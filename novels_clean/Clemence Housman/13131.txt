silent sweyn put hand on shoulder again vainly tried to see face in darkness have never quarrelled yet christian have never quarrelled returned other aware for first time that dictatorial brother have sometimes offered occasion for quarrel have be ready to take well said sweyn emphatically if speak against white fell to other a to night have spoken to will delivered word like ultimatum turned sharp

there be surprise conjecture when white fell absence be discovered christian held peace not even to brother did say how knew that have fled before midnight sweyn though evidently greatly chagrined seemed to disdain reference to subject of christian fear elder brother alone joined bear hunt christian found pretext to stay behind sweyn being out of humour manifested contempt by uttering not

retain most irrational suspicion against beautiful white fell be to sweyn evidence of weak obstinacy of mind must thrive upon expostulation argument evident intention to direct passion of grief anguish to hatred fear of fair stranger such a own be intolerable sweyn set will against again christian yielded to brother stronger word will against own judgment consented to silence repentance came before new moon first of year be old white fell came again smiling a entered a though assured of glad kindly welcome in truth there be only one who saw again fair face strange white garb without

founded if strange look desperate incoherent word be evidence enough thenceforward sweyn reasoning mastery must not uphold white fell above suspicion be not called upon to defend from accusation when christian have be brought to silence again well knew significance of fact that name formerly uttered freely often never heard now be huddled away into whisper that must not catch passing of time did not sweep away superstitious fear that sweyn despised be angry anxious eager that white fell must return merely by bright gracious presence reinstate in favour doubtful if authority example must keep from notice altered aspect of welcome foresaw clearly that christian must prove unmanageable might be capable of dangerous outbreak for time twin variance be marked on sweyn part by air of rigid indifference on christian by heavy downcast silence nervous apprehensive observation of brother superadded to remorse foreboding sweyn displeasure weighed upon intolerably remembrance of violent rupture be ceaseless misery elder brother self sufficient insensitive must little know how deeply unkindness stabbed depth force of affection such a christian be unknown to loyal subservience that must not appreciate have encouraged to domineer strenuous opposition to reason will be accounted a furious malice if not sheer insanity christian surveillance galled incessantly embarrassment danger foresaw a outcome therefore suspicion might be lulled judged wise to make overture for peace most easily done little kindliness few evidence of consideration slight return of old brotherly imperiousness christian replied by gratefulness relief might have touched have understood instead increased secret contempt so successful be finesse when late on day message summoning christian to distance be transmitted by sweyn doubt of genuineness occurred when errand proved useless set out to return mistake misapprehension be that surmised not till sighted homestead lying low between night

muscle strung excitement urged on caution checked two governed long stride swiftly noiselessly to climax felt be at hand a drew near to outer gate light shadow stirred went a though grey of snow have taken detached motion darker shadow stayed faced christian striking life blood chill with utmost despair sweyn stood before surely shadow went be white fell have be together close have not be in arm near enough for lip to meet there be moon star gave light enough to show that sweyn face be flushed elate flush remained though expression changed quickly at sight of brother how if christian have seen must one of frenzied outburst be met managed by resolution by indifference halted between two a result swaggered white fell questioned christian hoarse breathless yes sweyn answer be query with intonation implied be clearing ground for action from christian came have kissed like bolt direct staggering sweyn by sheer prompt temerity flushed yet darker yet half smiled over earnest of success have won have there be really between christian rivalry that imagined face have enough of insolence of triumph to exasperate jealous rage dare ask sweyn o sweyn must know have ring of despair anguish in tone angered sweyn misconstruing jealousy urging to such presumption be intolerable mad fool said constraining no longer win for woman to kiss leave mine without question one a must desire to kiss be such one a will never allow kiss to then christian fully understood supposition cried white fell that deadly thing sweyn be blind mad must save from be wolf sweyn maddened again at accusation dastardly way of revenge a conceived instantly for second time brother be at strife violently christian be now too desperate to be scrupulous for dim glimpse have shot possibility into mind to be free to follow striking of brother be necessity thank god be armed so sweyn equal illustration race facing assailant with bear spear struck up arm with butt end hit hard so that fell matchless runner leapt away on instant to follow forlorn hope sweyn on regaining foot be a amazed a angry at unaccountable flight knew in heart that brother be coward that be unlike to shrink from encounter because defeat be certain cruel humiliation from vindictive victor probable of uselessness of pursuit be well aware must abide chagrin content to know that time for advantage must come since white fell have parted to right christian to left event of sequent encounter did not occur to now christian acting on dim glimpse have have just a sweyn turned upon of something moved against sky along ridge behind homestead be staking only hope on chance own superlative speed if what saw be really white fell guessed be bending step towards open waste there be just possibility by straight dash desperate perilous leap over sheer bluff might yet meet head then have further thought be past quick fierce race chance of death at leap halted in hollow to fetch breath to look did come have gone came came with smooth gliding noiseless speed be walking running arm be folded in fur be drawn tight about body white lappet from head be wrapped knotted closely beneath face eye be set on far distance so went till even sway of going be startled to pause by christian fell drew quick sharp breath at sound of name thus mutilated faced sweyn brother eye glittered upper lip be lifted shewed teeth half of name impressed with ominous sense a uttered by warned of aspect of deadly foe yet cast loose robe till trailed ample spoke a mild woman what must then christian answered with solemn dreadful accusation kissed rol rol be dead kissed trella be dead have kissed sweyn brother will not die added may live till midnight edge of teeth glitter of eye stayed moment right hand also slid down to axe haft then without word swerved from sprang out away swiftly over snow christian sprang out away followed swiftly over snow keeping behind stride length from side so went running together silent towards vast waste of snow where living thing two moved under star of night never before have christian so rejoiced in power gift of speed training of use endurance be priceless to now though midnight be hour away be confident that go where fell thing must hasten a must must not outstrip escape from then when came time for transformation when woman form made longer shield against man hand must slay be slain to save sweyn have struck dear brother in dire extremity must not though reason urged strike woman for one mile for two mile ran white fell ever foremost christian ever at equal distance from side so near now again out flying fur touched spoke word never turned head to look at swerved to evade with set face looking forward sped straight on over rough over aware of nearness by regular beat of foot sound of breath behind in while quickened pace from first christian have judged of speed a admirable yet with exulting security in own excelling enduring effort when pace increased found put to test a never have be before in race foot indeed flew faster than be only by length of stride that kept place at side heart be high resolute did not fear failure yet so desperate race flew on foot struck up powdery snow breath smoked into sharp clear air be gone before air be cleared of snow vapour now then christian glanced up to judge by rising of star of coming of midnight so long so long white fell held on without slack be evident with confidence in speed proving matchless a resolute to outrun pursuer a to endure till midnight fulfil purpose christian held on still self assured must not fail must not fail to avenge rol trella be motive enough for to do what man must do for sweyn more have kissed sweyn must not die too with sweyn to save must not fail never before be such race a not when in old greece man maid raced together with two fate at stake for hard running be sustained unabated while star after star rose went wheeling up towards midnight for one hour for two hour then christian saw heard what shot through with fear where fringe of tree hung round slope saw something dark moving heard yelp followed by full horrid cry dark spread out upon snow pack of wolf in pursuit of beast alone have little cause for fear at pace held must distance four footed though be of white fell wile have infinite apprehension for how might not avail herself of savage jaw of wolf akin a be to half nature vouchsafed to look sign christian on impulse to assure that must not escape caught held back flung edge of fur running still turned like flash with beastly snarl teeth eye gleaming again axe shone on upstroke on downstroke a hacked at hand have lopped off at wrist that parried with bear spear even then shore through shaft shattered bone of hand at same blow so that loosed perforce then again raced on a before christian not losing pace though left hand swung useless bleeding broken snarl indubitable though modified from woman organ vicious fury revealed in teeth eye sharp arrogant pain of maiming blow caught away christian heed of beast behind by striking into close vivid realisation of infinitely greater danger ran before in deadly thing when bethought to look behind lo pack have reached track instantly slunk aside cowed yell of pursuit changing to yelp whine so abhorrent be that fell creature to beast a to man have drawn fur more closely to disposing so that instead of flying loose to heel drapery hung lower than knee without check to wonderful speed embarrassment by cumbering of fold held head a before lip be firmly set only tense nostril gave breath not sign of distress witnessed to long sustaining of terrible speed on christian by now strain be telling palpably head weighed heavy breath came labouring in great sob bear spear must have be burden now heart be beating like hammer dulness oppressed brain that be only by degree must realise helpless state wounded weaponless chasing terrible thing be fierce desperate axe armed woman except must assume beast with fang yet more formidable still far slow star went lingering nearly hour from midnight so far be brain astray that impression took that be fleeing from midnight star whose gain be by such slow degree that time equalling day day have gone in race round northern circle of world day day a long might last before end except slackened except failed must not fail yet how long have be praying so have started with self confidence reliance have felt no need for aid now seemed only mean by to restrain heart from swelling beyond compass of body by to cherish brain from dwindling shrivelling quite away sharp toothed creature kept tearing dragging on maimed left hand never must see must not shake off prayed off at time clear star before took to shuddering knew why shuddered at sight of what be behind have never divined before strange thing hid from men under pretence of being snow clad mound swaying tree now came slipping out from harmless cover to follow mock at impotence to make kindred thing resolve to truer form knew air behind be thronged heard hum of innumerable murmuring together eye must never catch be too swift nimble yet knew be there because on backward glance saw snow mound surge a grovelled flatlings out of sight saw tree reel a screwed rigid past recognition among bough after such glance star for awhile returned to steadfastness infinite stretch of silence froze upon chill grey world only deranged by swift even beat of flying foot own slower from longer stride sound of breath for clear moment knew that only concern be to sustain speed regardless of pain distress to deny with nerve have power to outstrip to widen space between till star crept up to midnight then out again must come that crowd invisible humming hustling behind dense dark enough knew to blot out star at back yet ever skipping jerking from sight hideous check came to race white fell swirled about leapt to right christian unprepared for so prompt lurch found close at foot deep pit yawning own impetus past control snatched at a bore past clasping right arm with one whole hand two swung together upon brink straining away in self preservation be vigorous enough to counter balance headlong impulse brought reeling together to safety then before be verily sure that be not to perish so crashing down saw gnashing in wild pale fury a wrenched to be free since right hand be in grasp used axe left handed striking back at blow be effectual enough even so right arm dropped powerless gashed with lesser bone broken jarred with horrid pain when let swing a leaped out again ran to recover few foot have gained from pause at shock near escape new quick pain made again faculty alive intense knew that what followed be most surely death animate wounded helpless be utterly at mercy if so must realise take action hopeless to avenge hopeless to save very despair for sweyn swept on to follow follow precede kiss doomed to death must yet fail to hunt that thing past midnight out of womanly form alluring treacherous into lasting restraint of bestial be last shred of hope left from confident purpose of outset sweyn sweyn o sweyn thought be praying though heart wrung out nothing sweyn sweyn o sweyn last hour from midnight have lost quarter star went lifting up great minute again greatening heart shrinking brain sickening agony that swung at side conspired to appal will have only seeming empire over foot now white fell body be so closely enveloped that not lap edge flew free stretched forward strangely aslant leaning from upright poise of runner cleared ground at time by long bound gaining increase of speed christian agonised to equal because star pointed that end be nearing black brood came behind again followed noising ah if must be kept quiet still slip usual harmless mask to encourage with interest last speed of most deadly congener what shape have must ever know if be not that be bound to compel fell thing that ran before into truer form might face about follow not so if might do anything what did race race racing bear agony must just stand still die to be quit of pain of breathing grew bewildered uncertain of own identity doubting of own true form must not be really man no more than running thing be really woman real form be only hidden under embodiment of man what be did not know sweyn real form did not know sweyn lay fallen at foot where have struck down own brother stumbled over have to overleap race harder because who have kissed sweyn leapt so fast sweyn sweyn o sweyn why did star stop to shudder midnight else have surely come leaning leaping thing looked back at with wild fierce look laughed in savage scorn triumph saw in flash why for within time measurable by second must have escaped utterly a land lay slope of ice sunk on one hand on other hand steep rose shouldering forward between two be space for foot to be planted none for body to stand yet juniper bough thrusting out gave handhold secure enough for one with resolute grasp to swing past perilous place pas on safe though first second of last moment be going dared to flash back wicked look laugh at pursuer who be impotent to grasp illustration finish crisis struck convulsive life into last supreme effort will surged up indomitable speed proved matchless yet leapt with rush passed before laugh have time to go out turned short barring way braced to withstand came hurling desperate with feint to right hand then launched upon with spring like wild beast when leap to kill with one strong arm hand must not hold with one strong hand arm must not guide sustain caught held even so fell together because felt whole arm slipping whole hand loosing to slack dreadful agony of wrenched bone above caught held with teeth tunic at knee a struggled up wrung off hand to overleap victorious like lightning snatched axe struck on neck deep once twice life blood gushed out staining foot star touched midnight death scream heard be not for set teeth have hardly yet relaxed when rang out dreadful cry began with woman shriek changed ended a yell of beast before final blank overtook dying eye saw that gave place to saw more that life gave place to death causelessly incomprehensibly for did not presume that holy water must be more holy more potent to destroy evil thing than life blood of pure heart poured out for in free willing devotion own true hidden reality that have desired to know grew palpable recognisable seemed to just great glad abounding hope that have saved brother too expansive to be contained by limited form of sole man yearned for new embodiment infinite a star what did matter to true reality that man brain shrank shrank till be nothing that man body must not retain huge pain of heart heaved out through red exit riven at neck that black noise came again hurtling from behind reinforced by dissolved shape blotted out for ever man sight hearing sense in early grey of day sweyn chanced upon footprint of man of runner a saw by shifted snow direction have taken aroused curiosity since little farther line must be crossed by edge of sheer height turned to trace so doing length of stride struck attention stride long a own if ran knew be following christian in anger have hardened to be indifferent to night long absence of brother now seeing where footstep went be seized with compunction dread have failed to give thought care to poor frantic twin who might be possible have rushed to frantic death heart stood still when came to place where leap have be taken piled edge of snow have fallen too nothing snow lay below when peered along upper edge ran for furlong till came to dip where must slip climb down then back again on lower level to pile of fallen snow there saw that vigorous running have started afresh stood pondering vexed that man must have taken leap where have not ventured to follow vexed that have be beguiled to such painful emotion guessing vainly at christian object in mad freak began sauntering along half unconsciously following brother track so in while came to place where footprint be doubled small print be others small a woman though pace from one to be longer than skirt of woman allow did not white fell tread so dreadful guess appalled so dreadful that recoiled from belief yet face grew ashy white gasped to fetch back motion to checked heart unbelievable closer attention showed how smaller footfall have altered for greater speed striking into snow with deeper onset lighter pressure on heel unbelievable must woman white fell run so must man christian run so guess became certainty be following where alone in dark night white fell have fled from christian pursuing such villainy set heart brain on fire with rage indignation such villainy in own brother till lately love worthy praiseworthy though fool for meekness must kill christian have life many a footprint have trodden vengeance must demand in tempest of murderous hate followed on in haste for track be plain enough starting with burst of speed a must not be maintained brought back soon to plod for spent sobbing breath to be regulated cursed christian aloud called white fell name on high in frenzied expense of passion grief be rage being such intolerable anguish of pity shame at thought of love white fell who have parted from kiss free radiant to be hounded straightway by brother mad with jealousy fleeing for more than life while lover be housed at ease if have known raved in impotent rebellion at cruelty of event if have known that strength love might have availed in defence now only service to that must render be to kill christian a woman knew be matchless in speed matchless in strength christian be matchless in speed among men easily to be matched in strength brave swift strong though be what chance have against man of strength inch frantic too intent on horrid revenge against brother successful rival mile after mile followed with bursting heart more piteous more tragic seemed case at evidence of white fell splendid supremacy holding own so long against christian famous speed so long so long that love admiration grew more more boundless grief indignation therewith also whenever track lay clear ran with such reckless prodigality of strength that soon be spent dragged on heavily till sometimes on ice of mere sometimes on wind swept place sign be lost so undeviating have be line that course straight on then short questing to hand recovered again hour after hour have gone by through more than half that winter day before ever came to place where trampled snow showed that scurry of foot have come gone wolf foot gone most amazingly only little beyond came to lopped point of christian bear spear farther on must see where remnant of useless shaft have be dropped snow here be dashed with blood footstep of two have fallen closer together hoarse sound of exultation came from might have be laugh have breath sufficed o white fell poor brave love well struck groaned torn by pity great admiration a guessed surely how have turned dealt blow sight of blood inflamed a might beast raven grew mad with desire to have christian by throat once again not to loose time till have crushed out life beat out life stabbed out life torn piecemeal likewise ah then not till then bleed heart with weeping like child like girl over piteous fate of poor lost love on on on through aching time toiling straining in track of two superb runner aware of marvel of endurance unaware of marvel of speed that in three hour before midnight have overpassed vast distance that must only traverse from twilight to twilight for clear daylight be passing when came to edge of old marl pit saw how two who have gone before have stamped trampled together in desperate peril on verge here fresh blood stain spoke to of valiant defence against infamous brother followed where blood have dripped till cold have staunched flow taking savage gratification from evidence that christian have be gashed deeply maddening afresh with desire to do likewise more excellently so slake murderous hate began to know through despair have entertained germ of hope that grew apace rained upon by brother blood strove on a best might wrung now by access of hope now of despair in agony to reach end however terrible sick with aching of toiled mile deferred light went lingering out of sky giving place to uncertain star came to finish two body lay in narrow place christian be one other beyond not white fell there where footstep ended lay great white wolf at sight sweyn strength be blasted body soul be struck down grovelling star have grown sure intense before stirred from where have dropped prone very feebly crawled to dead brother laid hand upon crouched so afraid to look stir farther cold stiff hour dead yet dead body be only shelter stay in most dreadful hour soul stripped bare of sceptic comfort cowered shivering naked abject living clung to dead out of piteous need for grace from soul have passed away rose to knee lifting body christian have fallen face forward in snow with arm flung up wide so have frost made rigid strange ghastly unyielding to sweyn lifting so that laid down again crouched above with arm fast round low heart wrung groan illustration sweyn finding when at last found force to raise brother body gather in arm tight clasped to breast tried to face thing lay beyond sight set limb in palsy with horror dread sens have failed fainted in utter cowardice for strength came from holding dead christian in arm enabling to compel eye to endure sight take into brain complete aspect of thing wound only blood stain on foot great grim jaw have savage grin though dead stiff kiss must bear no longer turned away ever looked again dead man in arm knowing full horror have followed faced for sake have suffered agony death for sake in neck be deep death gash one arm hand be dark with frozen blood for sake dead knew a in life have not known to give right meed of love worship because outward man lacked perfection strength equal to have taken love worship of great pure heart a due so unworthy in inner reality so mean so despicable callous contemptuous towards brother who have laid down life to save longed for utter annihilation so might lose agony of knowing so unworthy such perfect love frozen calm of death on face appalled dared not touch with lip have cursed so lately with lip fouled by kiss of horror have be death struggled to foot still clasping christian dead man stood upright within arm frozen rigid eye be not quite closed head have stiffened bowed slightly to one side arm stayed straight wide be figure of one crucified blood stained hand also conforming so living dead went back along track that one have passed in deepest passion of love one in deepest passion of hate night sweyn toiled through snow bearing weight of dead christian treading back along step before have trodden when be wronging with vilest thought cursing with murderous hatred brother who while lay dead for sake cold silence darkness encompassed strong man bowed with dolorous burden yet knew surely that night entered hell trod hell fire along homeward road endured through only because christian be with knew surely that to christian have be a christ have suffered died to save from sin illustration
