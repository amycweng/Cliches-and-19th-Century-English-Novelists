stripped off coat for seating said 'no yielded thought dead ' asked sat dumb stupid worn out in body mind hold to blame ' still did not speak 'rhoda o rhoda can not bear have that devil christian taught ' rhoda rose up with indignant cry then steadied voice spoke 'the name of christian love honour reverence above name on earth be not worthy even to utter betake with lie slander suspicion to others ready to suspect slander lie not to who till die can trust utterly ' turned went philip stood dead ' said to be dead must be dead awe compassion alone possessed to credit be said not one selfish consideration have place then quick wit told that rhoda have inadvertently implied more than must overtook hastily 'hear will not offend will not utter word against ' spoke very gently very humbly because of great compassion truly christian dead be not so hard to forgo rancour rhoda went on 'you must hear what come to tell before reach home do think have be watching praying for return
