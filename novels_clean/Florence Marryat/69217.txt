must live a be in presence of god pleading for for eternal re union if really desire everlasting salvation if long to meet again in state of bliss if regret past life desire to lead purer one in future will take up where dropped at mother death fit for eternity do wish that say cried frederick whose body be sorely weakened whose mental calibre have never be too strong for love of vicious course in past proved weakness of moral character care nothing more for money pleasure money bring have one desire to be assured of darling happiness that will meet again hereafter oh father if thing be to be gained by entering church let do so a quickly a may for if find occupation distraction will go mad holy church will take care of son said father tasker a rose to leave room will envelop with

to reward by salvation of wife whom will accept a child too because of great love for must not have chosen truer mean to ensure happiness of will live son to call sad time most blessed of life meantime must live without cried frederick relapsing into storm of grief not without replied priest with in spirit hour be where blessed faith comfort exceedingly over of le favoured people talk of communion of saint act a though dead once removed from sight have more part lot with mortal flesh know that doctrine be erroneous else what must become of many instance of saint angel appearing to men after demise dead so called be not beyond reach of prayer tear hear see pray for be blessed privilege to ask prayer a in case of sainted mother who have doubtless wearied throne of god with entreaty on behalf now about to be so mercifully almost miraculously answered to give ours a in case of young wife who will in after year rise up call blessed for what have done for a have cause to call dear mother be hers church for evermore exclaimed frederick in fervour of exaltation a stretched forth hand clasped of father only tell what to do will do take day two to think over idea son then if be still of same mind will speak to old friend canon bulfil on subject see if can not receive into college until be ready to pas for holy order be persuaded that few month study be will require to regain what may have lost then then exclaimed frederick with raised eye clasped hand will offer blessed mass for repose of soul day five six time day if will let do so will tell that can not give too much work if kill so much better will send sooner to remained in mingled state of despair hope for many day to come be whilst in condition that philip walcheren priest took advantage of persuaded to give fortune to church not that entertained slightest idea of fraud chicanery in doing so on contrary honestly rejoiced in success believing that be securing salvation of soul commendation of superior in faith be good men in way earnest to promote cause of catholic church religion judge fellow creature too hardly in world on supposition that what be good for tom dick must necessarily be good for harry protestant can see nothing idolatry in worship paid by catholic to image of patron be quite blind to fact that when exclaims with horror if one stand on ginger bread covered bible in order to increase one stature practises same idolatry in form catholic regard protestant a heretic because doe not bow head at elevation of mass when catholic church forbids child to kneel in prayer with protestant brother be a openly contemptuous of faith a belief to be of hers such extreme be folly go far to make one disbelieve in us of religion at except a plea for fighting intolerance have caused more people to forsake ordinance of childhood than anything else who set faction going flame alight will have much to answer for if day of judgment foretell ever come to pas catholic protestant may do many thing appear intolerant to outsider yet act in most perfect faith desire to serve god be how philip walcheren father tasker acted with regard to frederick wanted to help save soul thought saw way of doing brought argument to bear upon way frederick be a tinder in hand whole mind be absorbed with idea that sin have in measure brought awful calamity upon that loss of jenny be due to alone loathed thought of past life with licentiousness folly wanted to put right out of head to forget have ever be to lose sight of anything must remind of idea of cloister hard study strange to say held horror at moment for man of world who have lived life on race course behind scene of theatre longed for be oblivion hoped to find in exercise of religion have not felt so at time when hope of earth be shattered at foot must turn nowhere in world for comfort be then especially when death have removed what loved best from sight that feel a if must make heaven for ourselves in only half believe be well enough be cry of human heart for love of god without can not exist if must be followed by realisation of presence of god soul must be satisfied life changed burden of earth must roll off shoulder a christian bundle rolled off back in pilgrim progress instead of despairing mortal reviling fate almighty ordinance must be contented grateful child waiting patiently till father saw fit to call home mistake be to suppose religious ceremony designed of men will heal wound unless god balm have dropped upon first church going be very well for who like must never be made superstition a so many people make since be only instituted to do honour to god mission too often sadly fails in god be everywhere ready to be done honour to yet be too apt to fly to in sorrow believe a frederick walcheren believed that by making great sacrifice of pleasure making great sweep of sin at one same time must be pleasing god securing own happiness chapter iii of people who suffered be destined to suffer from jenny walcherens death heart bled most have be mentioned least because bled so silently unobtrusively poor mr crampton who can estimate depth length breadth of mother love whilst mr crampton have be noisily giving way

repulsive to thought a found alone speaks fair enough there be something behind can not understand well have taken care between will not want to visit spot too often poor darling what must think of depriving of title made wife be weak fool for letting take from so easily little thought must insult in manner perhaps be a well be wife false inscription can unmake that god be thanked father tasker say must wean heart from earthly longing a soon a may be one be squashed at rate will never want to look upon grave again with vile text written beneath dear name thou god knowest yes god doe know that be innocent of blame in matter except of tempting to leave home well well be not to be thought of sooner turn mind to other thing better stooped down gathered two three little blue flower be blossoming above jenny remains kissing put carefully between fold of pocket book then knelt down said prayer above dashing hand across eye turned slowly away meanwhile henry hindes be walking back to

have pushed over cliff deprived husband of life happiness feeling did not last be succeeded by paroxysm of unusual despair in earth heaven seemed to have arrayed against retired to room on plea of headache there indulged in custom be fast becoming habitual to of inhaling opium until sens be stupefied fear laid to rest remained alone evening retired to bed without seeing wife again be now so much custom that hannah be beginning to think nothing of believed that husband suffered from acute neuralgia necessitated taking soporific after be unwise to disturb so walked over to cedar where be always very welcome now tried to cheer up two lonely woman who must persist in sitting down with grief in lap instead of doing utmost to dispel hannah almost talked into promise evening that must spend winter abroad have never visited paris pressed so hard to have little pity on that mr crampton actually authorised to make inquiry about best mean of getting there hotel must be most suitable for sister to stay at therefore returned home well satisfied with success feeling have done good night work be past usual bed hour when reached hall so after brief visit to nursery hannah retired be

must not trust to speak more rhoda gathered up little shawl have carried over arm umbrella prepared to quit room rhoda dont be vexed with what said replied frederick did in good faith be sure must obey teaching of most holy church on subject strictly forbids tampering with such knowledge with communication from spirit of dead be taught to regard with horror a temptation from evil one sent in order to lure to own damnation yes said rhoda incredulously thought that saint in roman catholic church be often made so because have seen talked with spirit of dead that pope called convocation to

lay in power for grievous wrong have done poor rhoda berry hang said to after most unclerical fashion must make provision for child whether rhoda like not cant make up mind to give thousand to church who be a rich a old crsus whilst leave own flesh blood unprovided for never even told little beggar name if write to for will refuse again to take money well can settle on instead must see mr sinclair

beastly selfishness catholic church who have thousand of benefactor be rich in sort of treasure oh be not blaming replied mr sinclair who being protestant must rather have seen money thrown into

see grasping hand offered firmly quickly left room chapter ix whole talk of employ in firm of messrs hindes son late hindes crampton be of extraordinary change have taken place in employer clerk whether be head under clerk be shy a rule of whispering anything so derogatory to head of firm a suspicion that take more than be good for there be really other possible reason to be adduced for condition in henry hindes constantly presented in office formerly have be keen vigorous active man of business always ready to detect error in account to make good bargain for partner since mr cramptons death seemed a if have lost capacity vendor bearing sample of ware walked in out of counting house shaking head over mr hindes altered condition wondering what have become of powerful brain courteous manner to have be accustomed for so long cashier declared might a well take in book to be checked by child for attention governor accorded younger clerk affirmed that when carried message to inner office have to shout at sometimes three four time before seemed to hear understand what be saying have gone deaf inquired amongst be growing stupid seemed to be always more le asleep when roused to take active part in affair of firm be not always a good tempered a might be one lad have given notice because said must not stand mr hindes bullying longer be more remarkable because senior partner have ever be distinguished for urbanity soft spoken way with younger member of firm office companion be on alfred jones side for change in henry hindes be too remarkable to be denied who have be noted for being so well dressed perfectly appointed who be wont to come morning to town in suit of latest fashion with flower in button hole white hand carefully encased in well fitting glove must now lounge in at hour sometimes disgracefully late in shooting coat rough suit of tweed with sleepy eye careless hair looking a if have just tumbled out of bed manner have have credit of being so polite even when under necessity of telling unpleasant truth that even stranger be warned before set foot in office to ask for senior partner have become curt irritable sometimes exceedingly rude so that intending customer went away offended never showed face there again mr bloxam who have be cashier to firm for forty year past known henry hindes from cradle used to shake head say that business be fast going to devil sooner put shutter up better younger men whispered made joke amongst hinted that old harry a be familiarly termed amongst employ have be looking at outside of whisky bottle thing must go on much better if must stay at home leave to manage business comment naturally never reached ear of man pointed at unfortunate governor still continued to attend office furnish joke for lad under be little aware of how well deserved gait have now become slouching trembled a walked hand shook so that be with difficulty must sign name intelligibly more than once manager of bank lodged money with have sent over to identify signature be so unlike what used to be always seemed to be asleep nearly so must rouse with start when spoken to then curse intruder for having addressed in so low tone more than one youth followed jones out of office because hindes declared mumbled on purpose to annoy threw heavy book at head of third because on having failed to make master hear rang hand bell stood at elbow office where have be conducted so pleasantly be now scene of continual quarrelling henry hindes bid fair to be left alone in glory man whole appearance have changed clear keen eye be bloodshot dropsical looking nail be permitted to grow skin about to become irregular often appeared with unshaven chin limp collar mr bloxam be only person in office ever spoke to took curiously into confidence playing uncertain note on a on instrument of be not quite sure from longed to extract harmony there be case occupying attention of paper just then in mr hindes seemed to take unusual interest man have given up to justice for having committed murder twenty year before person who might have borne witness against being dead have provided necessary information even taking police to spot where have committed crime making disinter dust bone remained of victim reason case attracted particular attention be on account of length of time have elapsed since murder also that murderer have be very prosperous esteemed since occupied good position in society have wife family to be plunged into disgrace by confession cant understand motive of rayners confession bloxam henry hindes must observe confidentially to cashier must never have be found out to day of death what good doe disclosure effect here be respectable tradesman with wife family dependent on respected by friend customer rich flourishing in trade throw away for sake of confessing participation in crime world have forgotten age ago can not rectify even by swinging on gallows be true sir replied mr bloxam dont take into consideration that rayners conscience must not in probability let keep silence longer murder must lie pretty heavy on man soul mr hindes dont suppose have have much rest at night poor creature however much may have prospered outwardly be old man too sixty paper say begin to think doubt of meeting maker face to face with sin unconfessed wonder be how have managed to live through so many year with burthen on conscience must have led terrible life hindes face grew very yellow during exordium subject fascinated a fire be said to fascinate people precipice others until can hardly resist temptation to cast down headlong why must murder dreadful a be lie so much heavier on man conscience than other sin look how many murder be committed by most of strike blow perhaps might have killed fellow if have must have be arraigned a murderer since doe not go scot free feeling of murder be there same be just a guilty in sight of heaven why must vex about one sin more than other im not fit to argue point with mr henry answered cashier there surely difference dont always mean to murder friend when hit if do kill even by accident have to pay penalty when man deliberately injures knowing must kill like rayner who strike fellow creature on head with hammer why be deliberate murder meant to kill thompson must be thorough bad man to have kept secret in breast for twenty year hanging too good for thats what everybody say telling wont bring thompson back again thats argument said henry hindes sullenly rayner hang by confession doe one good except sir hell save own soul maybe by expiation of crime however tardy see what hypocritical life must have be leading mixing with sort of people who must have spurned with foot have known real character kissing innocent child wife setting up for respectable member of society when he lowest creature amongst deceit have be too much for at last mr hindes feel now doubtless that must rather be standing on gallows platform a honest man than keep place go on deceiving why must have be thoroughly miserable one must enjoy life however wealthy under such circumstance must have be nothing burden to henry hindes sat for few minute musing silently bloxam thinking interview be over prepared to leave office dont go bloxam exclaimed employer rousing stay little longer subject interest feel so much for poor fellow wonder if be in right mind oh yes sir there doubt of why remembers everything connected with murder a if happened yesterday described whole scene to officer with minutest detail such a lock of poor thompson hair getting stuck on hammer with blood holding hammer in flame of candle afterwards till be completely cleansed must tell exactly what poor fellow wore mentioned gold ring have on little finger when found bone dust under cellar flooring there be ring amongst just a said yes read that wouldnt have be wiser better of rayner to have kept secret to end for sake of wife child have kept so long see a said before confession must not remedy evil have done sir be not sure see that have entirely kept secret to have wife woman be powerfully cute about such matter married men dont keep secret long can say that on own authority know shouldnt care to have one mr bloxam wasnt to find out perhaps rayners wife got at have threatened with discovery isnt unlikely then have better be beforehand with at proposition hindes went positively grey stammered thought bloxam always have be told that evidence of wife can not be taken against husband in court of law ive heard same sir bless if woman once got hold of secret like shed have hundred way of bringing wall of man house about ear without meaning woman cant help gossiping nature if thing of sort once get repeated police must soon get hold of wouldnt trust neck to mr bloxams tender mercy know that though shes good woman fond of in way news leak through woman there other name for leak through do think so asked hindes with shiver im sure of sir many woman have be murdered for gossiping alone taunt men with thing may have done threaten to expose till aggravate into kicking beating to death case of manslaughter come through woman taunt theyre not generous a rule dont think said hindes putting suppositious case that must have be much wiser for rayner to have gone out to state australia have commenced new life there under name appears to have plenty of money think instead of making confession must sooner leave wife child comfortable fly country pretend to be lost overboard to die on reaching haven lose to world in fact begin life over anew be sure that if did that if did that mr henry exclaimed mr bloxam in voice of surprise henry hindes recalled to trip tongue have made changed countenance to kind of dull red purplish hue stammered did say must have be dreaming be talking of poor rayner surely why didnt take sum of money go away make new name for in new country did suppose be talking of bloxam why must say such thing of do look a if have committed thing that rayner did finished up sentence with feeble cackling laugh god forbid mr henry responded cashier solemnly knew of course be speaking of unhappy man why shouldnt have fled country instead sir why because must have be of use wherever went couldnt have left conscience behind once be awakened must have have to confess guilt whether found in england australia might have run away from wife child mr hindes couldnt have run away from crime must have followed anywhere even to end of earth poor wretch pity from bottom of heart hed better by far have given up to justice at once fancy life must have be living for last twenty year lying down getting up with ghost of poor murdered victim always by side looking at with reproachful eye asking silently what right have to be eating drinking making merry whilst lay in unhallowed grave be bound to come out at last sir murder always doe always doe always bloxam demanded employer fearfully do mean to say that murder have ever be successfully concealed very few sir if lie too heavy on conscience for why isnt rayner case in point if have be kept dark for ever must be amongst roman catholic for can ease conscience by confession if receive absolution be set at rest have such entire faith in power of priest to absolve from sin have friend of religion wonderful how bright seems after he be to confession quite different creature if man be to confess murder in confessional priest must give up to justice surely said henry hindes oh wouldnt begging pardon friend tell that secret of confessional be inviolate priest must dare reveal on penalty of being stripped of cloth what hears there never pass lip again not even to priest shouldnt like to trust same said hindes human nature be subject to too many accident priest might lose brain babble everything have heard fancy mr henry replied bloxam laughing that hears so many thing good bad indifferent that forgets a soon a have heard doesnt know name of penitent catholic may go to confessor like be director only that doe not change seem to know lot about said hindes indifferently only what friend tell sir replied cashier catholic seem to derive so much consolation from confession often wonder practice be not more largely used in other church will see book now mr henry not now replied hindes in languid voice im awfully tired did not see last week sir if youll excuse saying so be too long to let run on without casting eye over oh theyre sure to be right bloxam can trust better than hope may trust mr henry after forty year service with honoured father still must be satisfaction if must look into matter little more closely than have done of late youre not sir if youll forgive saying so since poor mr cramptons death hindes roused directly sitting upright in chair pulled ledger towards why since mr cramptons death bloxam said irritably ive have plenty of time to get over im not well havent be for month ought to go away go away continued muttering to now whats matter with confounded ledger stuck finger through hair stared in vague way at row of figure before there nothing matter sir trust replied cashier can detect error in here be bill of lading account of sale for to compare with entry mackintosh prome of antwerp sent five hundred bale of december order in consequence of fire taking place on wharf be unable to complete order oh hang man take beastly thing back do cried hindes pushing book across table look into im not well enough eyesight have failed terribly of late long row of figure dazzle trust to to do a think best dont worry about im going home reaching down for hat coat mr hindes stumbled out of office followed by winking eye of clerk who with tongue stuck in cheek whispered to other that governor have got em again poor old bloxam returned to desk shaking head repeating that business be going to devil chapter x henry hindes reached hampstead quite early in afternoon wife met with foreign letter in
