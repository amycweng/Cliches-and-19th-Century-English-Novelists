gallery after fourth dance picture gallery at bouchers be very seldom entered by of dancing guest being way removed from ballroom jenny mr walcheren being intimate friend at house knew well frederick thought rightly that since prohibition have gone forth against dancing with girl of heart must be more prudent if did not put in appearance to ballroom till after have held interview with jenny so when presented at house between nine ten oclock have divested of crush hat overcoat peeped into dancing room to see how far evening have advanced number two have just be placed above bandstand so concluded have at least hour to wait before jenny must join turned away again to seek solitude of picture gallery until time of meeting have arrived reckoned without host henry hindes who have be one of earliest arrival on express look out for walcheren spied a soon a looked into room rising quietly followed out so a soon a frederick have reached picture gallery heard step in rear turning with annoyance to see who have discovered retreat besides met outstretched hand smiling glance of mr hindes mr walcheren must not fail to return civility be infinitely vexed of people knew must rather have encountered anyone than mr hindes not only because be so intimately connected with cramptons undoubtedly knew most of family secret also because frederick have conceived unaccountable aversion for did not know why henry hindes have always be courteous polite to far more so indeed than mr crampton who invariably treated roman catholic a if religion be own fault be sinning day that didnt change hindes on contrary have scruple on score of difference of faith right to object to young man because courted jenny crampton have always spoken behaved to a one gentleman must to yet walcheren hated now a accepted hand asked after well doing must have liked to strike across smooth smiling face instead mr hindes having idea that young man be waiting to see miss crampton have thought must be excellent opportunity for to fulfil promise made to partner let mr walcheren know how utterly hopeless suit be how be walcheren said cordially a came up with dont mean to tell be going to eschew dancing to night when there be so many pretty girl doing wallflower saw look into ballroom disappear again wondered if have found way to buffet whisky soda shouldnt mind following if have for night be very warm be very thirsty have such intention answered walcheren in tone of annoyance fancy be rather too early for game came in here because have slight headache thought cool quiet might charm away before encountered heat glare of ballroom to be sure daresay will be charming place though one can not see much of picture by night be in semi darkness suppose bouchers intend guest to use on occasion a must have better lighted perhaps not replied walcheren be old friend of family consider privileged to do a like oh be not finding fault with decision dear fellow on contrary be very glad of opportunity of few word in private with be not often that wife can drag out to dance to tell honest truth came here evening expressly to see to see echoed walcheren in astonishment why what on earth can have to say to nothing on account dear friend unless be to tell what hope know have always be pleased to welcome to house always will be be a think be aware very intimate friend of mr mr crampton who be indeed intimate friend also of father before who have known almost from child know replied frederick what of mr crampton sent for before ten oclock morning found in greatest distress wife have intercepted letter from to miss crampton content have terribly upset passing over fact that consider breach of honour to pry into private correspondence of anybody be not aware that there be anything in letter alluded to be calculated to upset mr crampton said frederick dont sanction proceeding dear walcheren be only telling fact old gentleman be more than upset be terribly angry made daughter give solemn promise not to see of own free will speak write to again pray may ask cried frederick walcheren in sudden fury what business be of yours mr hindes to mention subject to none at owe to entreaty of friend mr crampton have begged to convey wish to have derived so much pleasure from society a acquaintance think so highly of intention with regard to daughter that dreaded task of telling

one with can not find serious fault objection be religion mr crampton will never allow daughter to inter marry with catholic decision be irrevocable since feeling for miss crampton can not have gone beyond admiration considering short time have known thought best must hear decision at once before mischief be done on side miss cramptons feeling be not to be taken into consideration also most certainly there be nothing on earth mr crampton care for so much a only child be heiress a doubtless know will leave nothing if marries against wish be very obstinate when thwarted very unrelenting miss crampton must hardly be so foolish a to give up fortune a well a parent at one blow under circumstance hope will not take offence dear walcheren if ask in name to relinquish acquaintanceship with

religion be insurmountable will never overlook be most unfair exclaimed frederick how be man to help what parent chose to make besides have religion at believe in nothing not god hereafter heaven hell

of ordinary appearance who be apparently waiting for came forward beg pardon sir began from witnessing feat of skill in water presume be swimming master must like to know term for course of lesson frederick laughed heartily at idea be not snob enough to be offended by young man mistake indeed wish be anything half so useful replied be only amateur like swimming be not at difficult only requires pluck practice anyone must attain proficiency if cared to take trouble youll forgive for mentioning sir said stranger who feared might have offended with heart there be harm in asking replied

touch to luncheon table be evidently only waiting return to be spread with noonday meal where be mr walcheren inquired frederick dont know sir replied stolid waiter a continued putting out cruet water bottle frederick ran up to bedroom be on upper floor finding also empty put on straw hat again descended to vestibule have wife mr walcheren gone out asked of porter well sir really cant say there be gentleman asking that question here already couldnt give satisfaction suppose lady must be out because cant find nowhere none of see pas through hall ill take oath hasnt come in for ive never left

frederick thinking did if come again during absence ask to walk upstairs wait until return right sir of course be mr crampton thought must be one else must be by jenny side when encounter took place if old crampton thought that by right of paternity must bully jenny be very much mistaken must have to answer to husband first went back to beach thinking must find amongst nursemaid child serenaders fruit seller be prepared to meet with little scolding for exposing to heat of day vulgarity of dover sand be not there beach be almost deserted now for baby attendant have gone back to lodging to early dinner serenaders be performing in front of pub in hope of earning meal there must have be difficulty in discerning jenny distinguished little figure on long line of sand shingle be evident be not there where must minx have hidden frederick be little inclined to feel cross although be first day of married life because jenny have so decidedly said must rather not go out that morning if have not done so must not have left to herself must have ventured into town have come away so hurriedly that might have found in want of trifling article that have forgotten gone to shop to procure turned step therefore in direction saw nowhere in street even asked one two pedestrian if have met young lady in broad brimmed hat trimmed with poppy grass shook head frederick wandered about street for time then resolved to go back to hotel after jenny be not baby have be well used to look after have watch to tell proper time to return be more than likely be already at castle warden first inquiry on re

came back to hotel frederick went upstairs to sitting room tried to occupy mind with newspaper persuade that be not particularly anxious for wife return there be nothing more irritating than to be kept in suspense especially for trifle must not help wondering where jenny have gone to why have gone why dickens hadnt come back again if stranger who have inquired for have not left proof that be mr henry hindes instead of mr crampton must have almost fancied that have be silly enough to have be lured away again by father be folly jenny be wife by love by law one must ever take from again unless quibble about age must be considered sufficient to annul marriage next moment laughed at idea mr crampton must surely never be such fool a to take advantage of loop hole must bring disgrace upon daughter name how foolish be to let so absurd idea worry why deuce didnt jenny come back be now four oclock be carrying joke too far couldnt possibly have lost way in place a dover besides wasnt sort of girl to lose way even if have broken leg done unlikely thing of sort must have have nous to call assistance send message to say what be matter only solution of mystery that must think of be that have gone for walk wandered so far away that be too tired to walk home quicker why in case have not procured vehicle to convey back again more frederick thought of more puzzled became when five oclock

noticed that wore large chip hat with scarlet poppy in white dress have book in hand went up way continued informant pointing in direction of grassy down frederick thanked commenced running off in direction have intimated of course said to cool breezy down must be far more likely to attract jenny than hot beach how foolish be of not to have thought of before walked rapidly straight ahead of for three four mile then stopped to consider what be doing jenny be not there must see from end to end of broad wide expanse sheep must have be visible to naked eye what be use of rushing about in aimless
