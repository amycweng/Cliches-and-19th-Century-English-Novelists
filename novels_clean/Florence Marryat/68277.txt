machine helpless half naked to watch elephantine mother chase with stout stick in hand failing to catch in time slip on wet sand flounder in wave from plight looked very much a though servant instead of rescuing did best to push further in before dragged drenched disordered on dry land again chapter iv baroness gobellis temperament be a inconsistent a dress under garb of jocose good humour often degenerated to horse play concealed jealous vindictive disposition must go length when offended to revenge be wont to say that never forgot forgave injury that when have knife a termed in man knew how to bide time that when time came turned bloodthirsty sentiment coupled with asseveration be constantly on lip that when willed death of anyone died that have power at command of one be aware frightened many timid ignorant people into trying to propitiate so apparently potent mortal generally kow towing before to such votary so long a pleased madame gobelli be used to shew favour by various gift of dress jewelry money according to circumstance for in case be lavishly generous soon tired of acquaintance replaced by fresh favourite hint that gave forth regarding antecedent be too extraordinary to gain credence except from most ignorant of auditor baroness always spoke in parable left proof of what meant to be brought up against proved that if be clever be still more cunning hint occasionally gave of being descended from royal blood though on wrong side of blanket of connection being acknowledged privately if not publicly by existing member of reigning family be received with open mouth by people of own class rejected with scorn by such a be acquainted with whom affected to know be remarkable also only proof real birth antecedent baroness gobelli be unique that notwithstanding desire to be considered noble by birth if not by law never shirked fact that baron be in trade on contrary rather made boast of used to relate story bringing into ridicule with greatest gusto fact being that baron gobelli be head of large firm of export bootmaker trading in london under name of fantaisie cie boot shoe of though professedly french be manufactured in germany where firm maintained enormous factory baroness must seldom be in company of anyone for more than five minute without asking where bought boot shoe recommending to fantaisie et cie a best maker in london wanted to be first in everything in popularity in notice in conversation if must not attract attention by personality startled people by vulgarity if must not reign supreme by reason of supposed birth must do so by boot shoe if nothing else if anybody slighted appeared to discredit statement be immediately marked down for retaliation harriet brandt have not be many day in heyst before baroness have become jealous of attention paid mr pullen child saw that girl be attractive heard that be rich liked to have pretty pleasant young people about when at home drew men to house reflected sort of credit upon herself determined to get harriet away from margaret pullen chain to own side instead baroness hated miss leyton quite a much a elinor hated be quick of hearing very intuitive have caught more than one of young lady uncomplimentary remark upon have divined still more than have heard have observed sympathy with bobby also that encouraged in boyish rebellion for reason have knife into miss leyton be waiting opportunity to turn foresaw with assistance perhaps of power of darkness of whose acquaintance be so proud that must be enabled to take revenge on elinor leyton through harriet brandt first advance to latter be suavity be not going to frighten girl by shewing claw until have stroked down right way with pattes de velour came upon one morning a sat upon sand with little ethel in arm nurse be within speaking distance busy with needlework infant seemed so quiet with miss brandt took such evident pleasure in nursing that mr pullen no longer minded leaving together have gone for stroll with miss leyton along digue so baroness found harriet comparatively speaking alone so youre playing at nursemaid again commenced in abrupt manner seem to have

shew eye of yours to get plenty of people to love let love in return be if men count in estimation of whats beautiful harriet raised eye looked at woman who addressed there be innocence of ignorance in a yet slumbering fire in depth proved of what nature must be capable when be given opportunity to shew hers be passionate temperament yearning to express panting for love have never known ready to burst forth like tree into blossom directly sun of desire reciprocity shone upon elder woman who have not be without little experience in day recognised feeling at once thought that must not give fig for virtue of man who be subjected to influence dont think that youll confine attention to baby long quoth baroness a encountered that glance how do know said young companion ah enough that do know

ranger corp be noted for good looking officer might be better for furtherance of plan against peace of miss leytons mind thought to keep engagement to captain pullen secret at event one must say be business to make public looked in harriet brandt yearning passionate eye decided that must be strange if impressionable young man must be thrown within influence without having fidelity little shaken especially if affianced to such cold uninteresting bit of good a elinor leyton like parrot in story though said nothing thought deal inwardly rumbled with half suppressed laughter a pictured discomfiture of latter young lady if by chance must find fiancs attention transferred from to little west indian seem amused madame said harriet presently be thinking of young men who be doomed to be

mustnt tell that state secret might get into trouble at court youd better not say mentioned harriet brandt be not in condition to remember repeat anything be lost in dream of possibility of future bell for djeuner roused at last brought to foot resembled other in one particular be equally fond of pleasure of table little baron appeared dutifully to afford clumsy spouse benefit of support in

considered quite too clumsy artificer to engage in so delicate game chapter v there be marked difference observable in manner of harriet brandt after conversation with baroness hitherto have be shy somewhat diffident seclusion of conventual life religious teaching have cast veil a be between outer world have not known how to behave how much might venture to do on being first cast upon madame gobellis revelation concerning beauty prospect have torn veil aside placed talisman in hand against secret fear be beautiful dangerous might become princess if played card well knowledge changed whole face of nature for became assured confident anticipatory began to frequent company of baroness without neglecting first acquaintance mr pullen baby spent more time in gobellis private sitting room

oppresses seem never to have quite lost sensation gave first evening that came here company enervates get neuralgia whenever have be short time together leaf in low spirit more disposed to cry than laugh wonder said friend considering that have that detestable school girl habit of hanging upon one arm dragging one down almost to earth how have stood so long beat delicate woman a be too prof how selfish miss brandt must be not to have seen that be distressing well will take large amount of expended force to drag madame gobelli to ground said margaret laughing so hope miss brandt will direct portion of attention to leave only residue poor girl seems to have have so few people to love to love during lifetime that be glad to practise on anyone who will reciprocate affection did see baroness kissing morning saw baroness scrubbing beard against miss brandt cheek if call that kissing replied elinor baroness never kiss have noticed salute poor bobby in morning exactly in same manner have

be too well off for elinor madame lamont told have fortune in own right of fifteen hundred year will want to gild with said elinor margaret pullen looked at miss leyton thoughtfully did really mean what said did jealousy of west indian heiress render capable of uttering untruth surely must see that harriet brandt be handsome growing handsomer indeed day with pure sea air tinting cheek with delicate flush like inside of shell that beauty joined to money must render tempting morsel for men formidable rival for woman think must find many people to agree with opinion elinor said after pause in answer to miss leytons last remark well think shes altogether odious replied friend with toss of head thought first time saw will think to last be day captain ralph pullen be expected to arrive in heyst two lady be preparing to go to station to meet baroness have at event done one good turn continued miss leyton have delivered for few hour from old man of sea what have be doing with morning

know how to refuse perhaps have be stuffing child with of horrid chocolate caramel be gorging day long know duty too well for miss said nurse resentfully wouldnt have allowed dear baby did not have anything to eat at well youre on side evidently so will say no more concluded miss leyton at same time if have child id sooner trust to wild beast than tender mercy of miss brandt past four oclock margaret if be to reach entrept in time must be going mr pullen hastily assumed hat mantle prepared to accompany friend have opened door be about to leave room when flood of melody suddenly poured into apartment proceeded from room at other end of corridor be produced by mandoline most skilfully played silvery note in rill trill chord such a might have be evolved from fairy harp arrested attention of miss leyton mr pullen have scarcely expressed wonder admiration to other at skilful manipulation of instrument evinced such art a have never heard before except in public when string of mandoline be accompanied by young fresh contralto voice o hush hush cried elinor with finger on lip a rich mellow strain floated through corridor dont think ever heard lovely voice before whose on earth can be word of song be in spanish only one must recognise be refrain of seralie seralie melody be wild pathetic passionate singer voice be touching beyond description professional must have arrived at hotel said margaret be sure be not singing of amateur hope will not practise at night keep baby awake elinor laughed o mother said thought be lamenting just now that ewe lamb slept too much for part must like to be lulled to sleep night by just such strain a listen margaret have commenced song ah gounod delicious ave maria how beautiful dont profess to know much about music said margaret

only thing make regret inability to play sing be most curious to learn who new arrival be ah here be mademoiselle brimont continued a caught sight of olga brimont slowly mounting steep staircase mademoiselle do happen to know who be who owns that lovely voice mr pullen be perfectly enchanted with olga brimont coloured little have never got over shyness of english lady particularly of one who

indeed be repeated always sang solo in convent choir used to say have finest voice in island o yes be harriet really passed on to own apartment do believe said elinor leyton turning almost fiercely upon mr pullen how can do otherwise replied margaret in face of mademoiselle brimonts assertion be strange that have heard nothing of miss brandt talent before have ever mentioned fact to that must

own way perhaps if be to speak to ralph tell plainly have be carrying on with girl not in sense must take doctor affect company that of gobellis good deal miss brandt sings beautifully ralph love music action annoys elinor can see since think must break off intimacy consider most imperatively necessary for many reason especially in case of susceptible young man like captain pullen have money say fifteen hundred year so be told miss leyton have nothing ralph only pay o yes be quite right acquaintanceship be dangerous for sense of honour be not so strong now a be when be boy gold be powerful bait with rising generation will take early opportunity of talking to captain pullen on subject will not wound feeling doctor betray trust for doing will speak from own experience a have done to if will not take advice must get someone with more influence to caution about hardly know how to make meaning clear to margaret miss brandt be dangerous acquaintance for of medical men know consequence of heredity better than outsider can do woman born in such circumstance bred of sensuality cruelty heartlessness can not in order of thing be modest kind sympathetic probably carry unknown danger in train whatever fascination position may be beg of to drop at once for ever of course will seems hard upon have seemed to crave so for affection companionship a mother craved for food blood a father craved for inflicting needle agony on innocent creature sneered meanwhile at suffering be afraid must have little faith in miss brandt craving for anything except gratification of own sens be seated on lower step of wooden flight led from digue to sand so that whilst must see what went on above be concealed from view just then harriet brandt beautiful voice accompanied by silvery strain of mandoline be heard to warble gounod marguerite from open window of baroness sitting room margaret glanced up apartment be brilliantly lighted on table be bottle of wine spirit with cake fruit madame gobellis bulky form might be seen leaning over dish have assembled quite little party there night two brimonts be present captain pullens tall figure be distinctly visible under lamplight harriet be seated on sofa full voice filled atmosphere with melody there something like voice remarked old doctor be very girl have be talking of replied mr pullen told have lovely voice be accomplished musician be that so said doctor phillips then be still more dangerous than imagined to be tone must be enough to drag man down to perdition especially if accompanied by such nature a can not believe must have inherited from progenitor see doctor there be ralph continued margaret pointing out brother in law left with miss leyton must have got rid of by mean crept up to gobellis can not go for be so refined so fastidious with regard to people in general that woman like baroness must grate upon feeling time open mouth baron never open at can only frequent company for sake of harriet brandt have seen for time past have made very uneasy will know everything about to morrow then if will not hear reason doctor phillips shrugged shoulder said more surely said companion think for moment ralph must ever seriously contemplate breaking engagement with elinor leyton for sake of girl o how angry arthur must be if suspected brother must be guilty of such thing who considers that man word must be bond be impossible to say margaret must not like to give opinion on subject when young men be led away by passion lose sight of everything else if girl be anything like mother must be epitome of lust o will speak to ralph a soon a ever can cried margaret in tone of distress will put matter a strongly before a possible will not may depend on doing can margaret a there seems likelihood of being able to interview young gentleman to night suppose go to bed feel rather tired after passage over must want to go back to baby doctor said margaret in timid voice a ascended hotel staircase together dont

have have effect good night dear dont worry please god will have little one right again in couple of day only said word out of compassion in own opinion infant be dying meanwhile harriet having finished song be leaning out of window with ralph pullen by side wore open sleeve a placed hand upon bare arm girl thrilled from head to foot so be determined not to go to brussels whispered in ear why must go will not be there baroness want to stay for week what must become of that time moping after be sure that must mope monsieur brimont be nice young man seems quite ready to throw at foot

havent taken taste out of everything else for harriet chapter viii doctor phillips be man of sixty bachelor have never made home tie for be therefore more interested in margaret pullen whose father have be one of dearest friend than might otherwise have be feared that heavy trial lay before be unwilling to see aggravated by misconduct on part of brother in law must see that young man be to say least of not behaving fairly towards fiance elinor leyton be determined to open eye to true state of affair with regard to harriet brandt spent sleepless night last visit to margarets suffering child having strengthened opinion a to hopeless condition lay awake wondering how must break news to poor young mother rose with intention of speaking to ralph without delay found more difficult to get word with than have anticipated gobelli party have decided to start with brimonts afternoon captain pullen stuck to entire morning ostensibly to assist baroness in preparation for departure in reality a anyone must see to linger by side of miss brandt miss leyton perceived lover defalcation a plainly a rest be too proud to make hint upon subject even to margaret pullen sat alone in balcony reading book gave sign of annoyance discomfiture close observer might have seen trembling of lip when attempted to speak fixed white look upon face betrayed inward anxiety made margarets kind heart ache to see dr phillips more indignant with ralph pullen than before party for brussels have arranged to travel by three oclock train at appointed time doctor be ready in balcony to accompany to entrept there be cab in heyst station being in town luggage be conveyed backwards forward in hand cart drawn by porter traveller invariably walked to destination baroness appeared dressed for journey in amazing gown of blue velvet trimmed with rare maltese lace with heavy mantle over small hat on head made round flat unmeaning face look coarser than before used herr baron a walking stick a usual whilst harriet brandt in white frock large hat shading glowing eye under scarlet parasol looked like tropical bird skimming by side with captain pullen in close attendance carrying flimsy wrap in case must require before reached journey end brimonts following in rear be of account beside more brilliant important friend ralph pullen did not look pleased when saw doctor phillips join party be also going to entrept exclaimed what can find to interest there dirty little smutty place be going just to help lady over line a there be bridge for crossing perhaps be bent on same errand replied doctor do give credit for le gallantry than pullen thats right doctor said baroness ive doubt youll be very useful bobby aint manner of good baron a so many trap to carry e asnt got arm to spare only wish be coming with why dont make up mind to come over with captain pullen day after to morrow ave little oliday be not aware that captain pullen be going to brussels madame fancy will have to get miss leytons consent first at mention of miss leytons name in connection with ralph pullen flushed uneasily harriet brandt turned look of startled enquiry upon speaker o ang miss leyton retorted baroness graphically surely wouldnt stop captain pullens fun just because e staying with be sister in law must call very ard cant always tie young man to be relation apron string doctor not always madame replied dropped subject wouldnt let miss leyton mr pullen keep from whispered harriet to cavalier never answered emphatically have reached little station by time porter be calling out vociferously that train be about to start for brussels so that in hurry of procuring ticket conveying lady luggage across cinder besprinkled line to where train stood puffing to be off there be more time to exchange sentimentality excite suspicion party being safely stowed away in carriage ralph pullen doctor phillips stood on wooden platform with hat off bowing farewell mind dont put off coming after thursday screamed baroness to ralph a filled up entire window with bulky person will expect by dinner time will bespeak room for whether will arriet ere will break er eart if dont turn up dont want responsibility of er committing suicide on ands right right responded ralph pretending to turn off a joke none of will do on account promise o well ope youre going to keep word will come back to eyst in double quick time good bye good bye kissing fat hand to two gentleman baroness be whisked out of heyst ralph looked longingly after departing line of carriage for minute then crossed line again to road beyond doctor phillips did not say word till be well clear of station then commenced of course youre not in earnest about following people to brussels why must not be knew brussels well a lad must enjoy renewing acquaintance with old town in proper company perhaps can hardly call that party fit one for to associate with youre alluding to baron baroness being in trade well a rule confess care to associate intimately with bootmaker friend one doe thing abroad that one must not dream of doing in england for vulgarity madame gobelli be very good natured generous really dont see that lower dignity by being on friendly term with whilst here be not alluding to madame gobelli though think that brimonts be fit companion for man who belongs to limerick ranger be engaged to marry daughter of lord walthamstowe do admire spirit must induce to hobnob with in heyst when must cut in bond street a far a know baron wife be harmless be miss harriet brandt must caution against quick resentment appeared on ralph pullens feature eye darkened ominous wrinkle stood out on brow what may have to say of miss brandt demanded coldly great deal more than know can possibly imagine be not fit person for elinor leyton to associate with consequently one whom be duty to avoid instead of cultivating think exceed duty doctor in speaking to thus be sorry must think so pullen anger will not deter from telling what be in mind must not forget how old friend be of side of family brother arthur be one of greatest chum wife father be without exception dearest friend added to be on intimate term with walthamstowes knowing what do therefore must hold criminal if left in ignorance of truth concerning young woman be alluding may ask to miss brandt be alluding to girl who call herself by name who be in reality only bastard daughter of henry brandt one of most infamous men whom god ever permitted to desecrate earth half caste mistress be careful what say doctor phillips said ralph pullen with ill suppressed wrath gleaming in blue eye there be need to be dear fellow can verify everything say fear man resentment be stationed in jamaica with regiment fifteen year ago when girl be child of six year old running half naked about father plantation uncared for by parent associating solely with negro servant brandt be brute perpetrator of such atrocity in vivisection other scientific experiment that be finally slaughtered on own plantation by servant everyone said served right mother be most awful woman have ever seen experience of sex in back slum alley have not be small be daughter of certain judge carey of barbadoes by one of slave girl brandt took a mistress before be fourteen at thirty when saw be revolting spectacle gluttonous obese large eye rolling sensual lip protruding a if be always licking in anticipation of prey be said to be obeah too by native ascribed death disease took place on plantation to malign influence consequently when got in clutch have heard that did not spare killed in most torturing fashion must devise did british government take notice of massacre there be enquiry of course actual perpetrator of murder must not be traced so matter died out hatred suspicion in brandt have be held for time have great effect upon verdict for in addition to terrible experiment upon animal experiment performed simply for own gratification for use that made of in treating fellow creature have be known to decoy diseased old native into laboratory after be never seen again be digging up of human bone on plantation finally roused negro to such pitch of indignation that rose en masse after murdering brandt abominable mistress set fire to house burned to ground there be doubt that if overseer of plantation african negro named pete have not carried off little girl must have shared fate of parent who can say if must not have be a well if have really can not see what right have to give vent to sentiment exclaimed captain pullen what have terrible story got to do with miss brandt everything when cat be black kitten be black too law of nature dont believe miss brandt bear trace in feature character of parentage ascribe to doe not assertion only prof ignorance of character characteristic girl be quadroon shews distinctly in long shaped eye with blue white wide mouth blood red lip also in supple figure apparently boneless hand foot of personal character have naturally have opportunity of judging can tell by way eats food way in us eye that have inherited half caste mother greedy sensual disposition in ten year time will in probability have figure at will run to fat must tell that also at glance have more compliment to pay young lady enquired captain pullen sarcastically have still to say pullen that be woman whom must never introduce to wife that be bounden duty to separate a soon a possible from fiance sister in law what if refuse to interfere in matter a far a can see concern one miss brandt in case regret to say that will feel duty to inform brother colonel pullen future father in law lord walthamstowe of what have told come dear boy be reasonable girl have attracted suppose be subject to woman influence at time must not let go further must break off be excellent opportunity to do so sister infant be fear seriously ill take party on to ostende send baroness polite note to say that be prevented from going to brussels will be right will take advice will not ill be hanged if will exclaimed young man be not boy to be ordered here there a if be not fit to take care of ive pledged word to go to brussels to brussels will go if miss leyton doesnt like must do other thing doe not shew such superfluity of affection a to prevent necessity of seeking for sympathy friendship elsewhere be sorry to hear speak like pullen doe not augur well for happiness of married life have thought more than once lately that will not be married at be to miss leyton dont say so be only passing infidelity engendered by attraction of other girl consider what brother must say what lord walthamstowe must think if committed great mistake at late hour of breaking off engagement can not see why brother opinion lord walthamstowes thought must interfere with happiness of whole life rejoined ralph sullenly however let that pas question on tapis be acquaintance with miss brandt consider must be put stop to for what reason if what bring against be true appears to that have more need of protection loyalty of friend must be cowardly to desert girl just because father mother happened to be brute be not fault quite allow be fault of madman that progenitor have lunacy in blood of consumptive that be strumous same fact affect life life of with whom come in contact be curse of heredity well if so how can concern anyone poor child o yes can will if be not greatly mistaken harriet brandt carry worse curse with even than posse fatal attribute of vampire affected mother birth that endued with thirst for blood characterised life will make harriet draw upon health strength of with whom may be intimately associated that may render love fatal to such a may cling to must tell pullen that fear have already proof of in illness of little niece whom mother tell be at one time scarcely ever out of miss brandt arm have other mean of accounting for sudden failure of strength vitality need not stare at a if thought know what be talking about there be many case like in world case of person who actually feed upon life of others a deadly upas tree suck life of victim by lulling into sleep from never wakens phillips must be mad do know that be accusing miss brandt of murder of killing child to whom never shewed anything greatest kindness why have known carry little ethel about sand for whole afternoon worse for poor little ethel say doe harm intentionally even consciously that deadly attribute of bloodthirsty parent have descended on in respect have not shadow of doubt if watch that young woman career through life will see that apparently care for most cling to most will soonest fade out of existence whilst continues to live stronger that victim die rubbish dont believe replied ralph sturdily medical men generally have crotchet in brain be most wonderful bee that ever buzzed in bonnet can say be must be quite willing to try experiment have tried pullen in mild form have have effect on be not same fellow who came over to heyst though by rule must be looking better stronger for change margaret have already complained to of strange effect girl have have upon must not breathe suspicion to concerning child illness verily believe must murder miss brandt putting nonsense aside said ralph do consider margarets baby to be seriously ill very seriously medicine have not have slightest effect upon condition be inexplicable little life be being slowly sapped may cease to breathe at moment have not yet have courage to tell sister truth how disappointed poor arthur will be yes grief will be nothing to mother be quite devoted to child by mutual consent have dropped subject of harriet brandt now spoke only of family affair ralph be kind hearted fellow under conceit felt very grave at prospect held out in regard to baby niece fulfilment of prophecy came sooner than even doctor phillips have anticipated a be sitting at dinner that evening madame lamont eye over brimming with tear rushed unceremoniously into salle manger calling to margaret madame madame please come up to room at once dear baby be worse margaret threw one agonised glance at doctor phillips rushed from room followed by elinor leyton high staircase seemed interminable more than once margarets leg failed under thought must never reach top did so all too soon on bed be laid

in bewildered voice doctor phillips who be have died baby maam dear baby went off like lamb without struggle o dear mistress do try to bear be baby dead said margaret in same dazed voice turning to doctor who have already satisfied that tiny heart pulse have ceased to beat dear child be not dead be living with god try to think of a quite happy free from world ill o wanted so wanted exclaimed bereaved mother a clasped senseless form in arm o baby baby why did go before have seen father then slid rather than sank from bedside in tumbled heap upon floor be better so will help through said doctor phillips a directed nurse to carry dead child into elinor leytons room placed margaret on own bed will not object miss leyton be sure must not leave mr pullen to night of course will not replied elinor have be afraid for day past that must happen poor margaret must not take hint spoke sympathetically there be tear in eye did not caress attempt to console friend did be required of there be spontaneous suggestion on part with regard to mother dead child a doctor phillips noted coolness did not wonder so much at ralphs being attracted by fervour warmth of harriet brandt a soon a poor margaret have revived have cry out administered sleeping draught to leaving in charge of elinor leyton went downstairs again to consult captain pullen a to what must be best thing for to do ralph be very much shocked to hear of baby sudden death eager to do in power for brother wife there be protestant cemetery in heyst doctor phillips proposed that must at once order little shell convey child body to ostende england a margaret might desire for burial sooner left place where have lost child said better idea be that must wish body to be taken to devonshire buried in quiet country churchyard where husband father mother be laid to sleep left ralph to telegraph to brother in india to anyone news might concern in england also to settle hotel claim give notice to lamonts that must leave on morrow supposing margaret must object suggested ralph will not object replied doctor might if be not taking child body with a be will be grateful to be thought acted for be true woman god bless only wish have not seen fit to bring heavy trial on head not word be exchanged between two men about harriet brandt ralph remembering hint doctor have thrown out respecting being ultimate cause of baby illness did not like to bring up name again felt rather guilty with respect to indeed doctor phillips be only too glad to see young man bestirring to be useful losing sight of own worry in trouble of sister in law of course must not have refused even demurred at accompanying party to england on so mournful errand to do justice did not wish to be otherwise brussels anticipated pleasure have be driven clean out of head by little tragedy have occurred in heyst attitude towards margaret when met again be so quietly affectionate brotherly that be of infinite comfort to quite acquiesced in

corner madame gobelli also much flattered vanity by speaking of ralph a if be confessed lover prospective fianc so what with new scene be passing through anticipated good fortune harriet be half delirious with delight looked a handsome a paint in consequence olga brimont on contrary although quietly happy in prospect of keeping house for brother did not share in transport of convent companion alfred brimont observed more than once that seemed to visibly shrink from miss brandt took early opportunity of asking reason why answer be conveyed in shrug of shoulder request that must not leave at hotel de saxe with rest of party take home at once to room over be to preside for in consequence two brimonts said good bye to gobellis harriet brandt at brussels station drove to apartment in rue de

happiness of ralph pullen elinor leyton well mr pullen said a shook hand cordially with margaret doctor what important business be that want to consult upon thought at very least must meet cousin arthur here if have have arthur perhaps must not have needed replied with faint smile really mr pennell be in want of advice sorely doctor agreed with that must be best person to whom must apply be at service madam said young man gaily a seated then told story of harriet brandt how ralph have met at lion dor devoted time to how be persecuting with letter have threatened to follow to camp interview there must be put stop to know mr pennell concluded not only for ralphs sake elinors for sake of walthamstowes husband be sure that arthur must be exceedingly annoyed at scandal of sort especially a lord walthamstowe be so old friend of family anthony pennell have looked very grave during recital after pause said be sure that ralph have not given young lady good cause to run after think not hope not there be very little amusement in heyst girl people with whom be now staying baron baroness gobelli call be amongst visitor to lion dor miss leyton be rather stickler for propriety used to refuse to walk out with ralph alone in evening be too much occupied with poor darling baby to accompany said margaret in faltering voice so ralph took to going to baroness private room instead became intimate with miss brandt acknowledge then that be intimate with think must have be because appears that have agreed to join party at brussels when when great trouble obliged to return to england with instead did know young lady mr pullen did at one time be rather intimate with be before baroness took up when passed almost time with be suppose very attractive in person o dear no not at cried margaret with woman dull appreciation of charm of one of own sex have fine eye what men must suppose call good figure complexion enormous mouth not at pretty nice looking at time be clever said pennell interrogatively think so have just come out of convent school be utterly unused to society have very good voice play well on mandoline lady be not always best judge of own sex remarked anthony turning to doctor phillips what do say doctor have opportunity of appraising miss brandt beauty accomplishment for must rather say nothing mr pennell replied doctor fact be knew parent in west indie must never believe in anything good coming from stock girl may be inherits terrible proclivity added to black blood be in point of fact quadroon not fit to marry into decent english family o dear exclaimed mr pennell laconically how do expect to help enquired after pause want to see baroness miss brandt tell that girl must cease communication with captain pullen said margaret tell that be engaged to marry miss leyton that marriage be fixed to take place next spring that walthamstowe family will be excessively annoyed if scandal of sort occurs to break off do not know that engagement exists be unfortunate part of elinor leyton be so absurdly scrupulous that will not have fact made public forbade to tell miss brandt about elinor went to red house where miss brandt be staying morning have most stormy interview with came here afterwards in most distressed state of mind harriet brandt have told that have secured ralph pullen meant to keep that have told loved that miss leyton be too cold prudish nature for man to be happy with of course elinor be terribly upset seldom show feeling be quite impossible for to disguise to day begged to leave matter in hand consented to do so be why telegraphed for be rather awkward predicament said anthony pennell thoughtfully will forgive for saying mr pullen that ralph be so very likely to have done sort of thing feel one might be treading on very delicate ground in fact putting one foot in by interfering know what ralph be selfish indolent full of vanity considers far too much trouble to make love a be called to woman will accept amount of love be offered so long a give trouble if miss brandt be that doctor here say of may possibly have drawn ralph on taken languid satisfaction a proof that agreed to said did will make dnouement just a unpleasant besides how will ralph take interference in matter may have design on girl idea in future connected with will ask what business have to come between o did not tell that have left letter in grate might be part of indolent carelessness may have be left there by design a mean of breaking ice between miss leyton be not after most proper person to appeal to why not wait till husband return let speak to brother be so afraid in case ralph might consider that have gone too far with miss brandt honour demanded that must marry mr pennell doctor phillips must tell thing if chose to prove to that harriet brandt be not fit wife for decent man anthony pennell thought again for few minute sitting silent with hand caressing smooth chin then said if be very much bent on doing what can in matter see only one way to accomplish must enter red house under flag of truce did know baroness gobelli can tell what sort of woman be never heard name before be quite character replied margaret believe husband be german baron be mr bates be extraordinary baroness strange mixture also of vulgarity refined taste drop aspirate yet talk familiarly of aristocratic royal title dress like cook out on sunday yet have passion for good painting old china at last word anthony pennell pricked up ear passion for old china exclaimed then there must be good in can not give introduction to red house on plea be connoisseur be desirous of seeing collection of course can how can approach people in amity with censure of miss brandt conduct in hand madame gobelli be infatuated with harriet brandt be telling poor elinor only afternoon must not be at surprised if be at bottom of unpleasantness must not be at bottom of anything unless ralph have given cause replied mr pennell who have never have good opinion of cousin straightforward dealing however may turn out must think must have heavy reckoning to settle with miss leyton be not first time remember have not forgotten trouble arthur have to get out of scrape with laundress girl at year before last yes arthur told about replied margaret be going to help time mr pennell be not in so far a procuring introduction to baroness taking opportunity to let know true state of affair with miss leyton yes said mr pennell there responsibility must cease must ralph have committed in writing anything of sort must promise to let fight out own way daresay there will be trouble about matter can see how have occurred at glance ralph have be merely amusing with girl have taken philandering in earnest wish must leave sort of thing off will ruin married life if doe not yes indeed elinor leyton really love more be sure than imago declared afternoon that if be not put complete stop to must break off engagement think must be right so do acquiesced anthony pennell well if people be ordinarily decent will a soon a hear truth prevent young friend interfering with woman right write introduction mr pullen will pay red house visit a

have taken three month leave then will return with to hosur like idea of india o anything anything to find with again answered feverishly conversation turned upon more indifferent subject armed with note of introduction to baroness anthony pennell presently took leave did not like task imposed upon hardly knew how must set about on consideration thought must do harm by having look at young lady

take turned slightly looked at face a thought passed through mind somehow eye met reassured began to think must be mistake that did not care for ralph a much a mr pullen have supposed that be only offended perhaps a hostess evidently be by curt uncivil manner in have treated so replied have not slightest excuse to make for cousin conduct madame gobelli appears to that have treated with very scant civility ought to be ashamed of a know little niece death be very sudden unexpected least must do be to escort sister in law miss leyton back to england since then well what since then demanded baroness sharply lord walthamstowe have come to arrangement said pennell speaking very slowly that marriage with miss elinor leyton will take place sooner than be at first intended limerick ranger be under order for foreign service captain pullen naturally wish to take wife out with though of course be excuse for omitting to write letter necessary preparation consequent excitement may have put

pushed away to make room for others piled up on top of one until trembled lest must come toppling down together be more used to handle treasure than be remarked presently must be too much afraid of

consequence of popularity to sit at table of of highest in land must liken one to nothing farmhouse dinner course succeeded course in rapid succession there be particular fault to find with anything utter want of ceremony mingling of well known aristocratic name with boot shoe trade way in baron baroness ate drank filled with surprise climax be reached when mr milliken who be late for dinner entered room hostess before introducing to stranger saluted with resounding smack on cheek pennell thought might be turn next shuddered wine flowed freely baroness being in undoubted good humour hospitality be unlimited after dinner baron having settled to sleep in armchair madame gobelli proposed that party must amuse with game of hunt slipper be robed in expensive satin dress threw down on ground with resounding thump thrusting two enormous foot into view offered slipper a inducement to commence game pennell stood aloof battling to restrain laughter at comical sight before baroness foot from have taken shoe be garbed in black woollen stocking full of hole displayed set of bare toe apparently quite unaware of ludicrous object presented kept on calling out for harriet brandt miss wynward to come complete circle at only mr milliken be seated harriet shrank backwards refused to play indeed madame can not know english game pleaded come on well teach screamed madame gobelli eres milliken e know about dont milliken e know ow to look for slipper under gal petticoat come ere arriet sit next mr pennell will be first to unt come on miss brandt must not come on remained seated declared that be too tired to play did not care for le jeux innocent have headache anything everything before must comply with outrageous request preferred to madame gobelli grumbled at idleness called disobliging anthony admired girl for steadfast refusal did not like to see in familiar society of woman a baroness must have liked still le to see engaged in such boisterous unseemly game a hunt slipper took opportunity of saying since be disinclined for such energetic game miss brandt perhaps must oblige by singing song must so much like to hear mandoline mr pullen have spoken to of efficiency on if madame gobelli wish have objection replied harriet oh well if be going to be so disagreeable a not to play good game said baroness a mr milliken pulled on foot again arriet may a well sing to good romp first wouldnt ave done arm adjourned rather sulkily to distant sofa with mr milliken where entertained other whilst harriet tuned mandoline presently let rich voice burst forth in strain of oh ma charmante anthony pennell be enchanted have passion for music appealed more powerfully to than anything else sat in rapt attention until harriets voice have died away then implored to sing song can not tell what be for who care more for music than for anything else in world to hear voice like yours why will create perfect furore when go into society must make fortune on stage know have need of oh one never know what one may have need of said harriet gaily a commenced dormez ma belle sang to perfection must have have very talented singing master observed pennell when second song be finished indeed only instructress be nun in ursuline convent in jamaica always loved said girl a ran over string of mandoline in merry little tarantelle made everyone in room feel a if have be bitten by spider from took name wanted above other thing to dance how pennell revelled in music performer how longed to hear from own lip that ralphs treatment have left ill effect behind when have ceased playing drew nearer to under cover of baroness conversation with mr milliken baron snore managed to exchange few word how can ever thank enough for treat have given began be very glad that liked be not prepared to hear such rare talent experience of young lady playing singing have not hitherto be happy have great genius did ever sing to mr pullen whilst in heyst once twice to cousin ralph pullen yes can not understand having treated baroness with such scant courtesy also who have be kind enough to allow to enjoy society must not have found so ungrateful have heard doubtless that be going to be married shortly yes have heard have suppose put everything else out of head perhaps may be a well especially for future wife there be thing be dangerous for men to remember such a lovely voice for example do think so harriet fixed dark eye on a put question be sure will be dangerous for unless will give leave to come hear again will not be able to sleep for thinking of do think baroness will be so good a to enrol a visitor to house have better ask if consent will sing to sometimes be always singing playing there be nothing else to do here baron baroness be almost always out

if may come see sometimes will count very happy man be generally alone in afternoon replied miss brandt sophistically in minute mr pennell be saying good night to hostess asking permission to repeat visit at future time if miss brandt must so far honour madame gobelli a to come have little lunch at chamber in piccadilly will feel only too much indebted to perhaps might arrange matine concert for same afternoon if must please will let know pray fix a early date a possible may really avail myself of kind permission to come see again may be sure that will not forget to do so good night good night baron good night miss brandt with nod to mr milliken be gone aint e nice fellow worth two of conceited jackanapes be cousin remarked baroness a disappeared what do think of im arriet oh be well enough replied miss brandt with yawn a prepared also to take departure be taller broader stronger looking than captain pullen must be very clever into bargain e never said word about be book exclaimed madame gobelli only fancy no never said word about book echoed harriet chapter xiv anthony pennell have promised to let margaret pullen hear result of visit to red house a entered presence on following evening saluted with query well have be there have seen to answered soberly yes have be there have seen what do think of what did say hope be not rude to dear mr pullen said pennell a seated prepared for long talk must let say in first place must never have recognised miss brandt from description of led to expect gauche schoolgirl half tamed savage juvenile virago be bound to say that struck a belonging to none of specie sent note of introduction to madame gobelli received very polite invitation in return in accordance with dined at red house yesterday dined there exclaimed margaret with renewed interest oh do tell about from very beginning what do think of dreadful woman baroness little humpty baron did tell miss brandt of ralphs impending marriage dear lady one question at time if please in first place arrived there rather sooner than be expected madame gobelli have not returned from afternoon drive miss harriet brandt did honour of tea table in very efficient manner with a much composure dignity a if have be duchess have very pleasant time together until baroness burst in upon be chaffing asked margaret incredulously what do really think of think be without exception most perfectly beautiful woman have ever seen what exclaimed companion have thrown back in armchair be regarding a if be perpetrating mysterious joke did not understand how extraordinary how very extraordinary exclaimed at length be very thing that ralph said of when first met why extraordinary there be few men who must not endorse opinion miss brandt posse kind of beauty appeal to sens of animal creature like have far more dangerous quality than of mere regularity of feature attracts without knowing be mass of magnetism o do go on mr pennell tell how received news went to break to never broke at there be need to do so miss brandt alluded to magnificent captain pullens marriage with greatest nonchalance evidently estimate at true value doe not consider worth troubling head about astonish how be to account then for attitude assumed towards miss leyton boast made of ralphs attention to bravado most likely miss leyton go to red house aflame like angry turkey cock accuses miss brandt of having robbed of lover what must have girl cry peccavi surely lower womanhood have one course to brave out besides have heard only one side of question remember can imagine miss leyton being very nasty if liked forget letter miss brandt wrote to ralph be found in empty grate at richmond remember a only proof of how unworthy be of confidence of woman really mr pennell seem to be on miss brandt side be for reason if idea concerning be correct displayed large amount of fortitude whilst speaking of brother in law yesterday own belief be that be mistaken that miss brandt be too clever for ralph of that care more for in way than do considers doubtless that have behaved in most ungentlemanly manner towards so do did not know what excuse to make for ralph be ashamed to own a relation harriet brandt did then confide supposed wrong to not at when mentioned ralphs name be like of other acquaintance when be out of room baroness told that have behaved like scoundrel to girl that have never confided fact of engagement to run after on occasion then after having promised to join party in brussels asked madame gobelli to engage room for left for england without even sending line of apology have taken least notice of since ah know reason of sudden departure cried margaret soft eye welling over with tear dear mr pullen said anthony pennell sympathetically even at sad moment ralph might have sent telegram scratched line of apology have to attend to such little courtesy know even if heart be breaking how can excuse not having called on written since wonder baroness be angry did not restrain tongue in speaking of yesterday said never wished to see face again doe know elinor went to red house think not there be mention of name then suppose may at event consider affair une chose finie hope so sincerely must not advise master ralph to show face at red house again baroness said longed to lay stick across back believe be quite capable of doing so oh indeed be replied margaret smiling heard great many story of valour in respect from madame lamont landlady of lion dor have miss brandt taken up residence altogether with madame gobelli think not told life there be very dull must like to change be in most unfortunate position for young girl remarked margaret left parentless with money at command in strange country with strange stigma attached to birth dont believe in stigma being attached to one birth returned pennell hastily only stigma worth thinking about be bring upon ourselves by misconduct one for instance a cousin ralph have done with regard to miss brandt must rather be in shoe than ralph think perhaps that being stranger friendless be fair game who be that taking name in vain interrupted languid voice at open door a captain pullen advanced into room margaret pullen started grew very red at being detected in discussing brother in law action anthony pennell who be always ruffled by cousin affected walk drawl blurted truth right out be replied hardly touching hand captain pullen extended to be just telling mr pullen of high estimation in name be held at red house be now ralphs turn to grow red fair face flushed from chin to brow a repeated red house what red house did not mention name to mean residence of madame gobelli be dining there yesterday dining there be by jove didnt know be acquainted with woman isnt queer old party baroness boot eh fancy knowing thought be cut above anthony if gobellis be good enough for to be intimate with in heyst suppose be good enough for to dine with in london ralph did not know until last evening however that have left to pay for room in brussels must have taken money over with to defray debt ralph have seated by time looked very uneasy a if wished have not come did old girl engage room for stammered well know reason must not go to brussels of course if have known that have gone to expense for must have repaid did tell of added rather anxiously yes good many more thing besides a have happened to come in whilst be on question have better make clean breast of perhaps have heard that miss leyton have be to red house have interview with miss brandt yes ive just come from richmond where weve have jolly row over grumbled ralph pulling moustache family felt that sort of thing must not go on must end one way other therefore went to red house ostensibly to view madame gobellis collection of china in reality to ascertain what view of matter miss brandt took to undeceive a to being in position to pursue intimacy with young lady further what devil business have to meddle in private affair demanded captain pullen rousing because unfortunately mother happened to be father sister replied pennell sternly scrape get in harm more than do one officer more le who get into scrape with woman go pretty well unnoticed have attained position in can not afford to have relation name bandied about a having behaved in manner unbecoming gentleman who dare to say that of cried ralph angrily everybody who know of attention paid miss brandt in heyst replied anthony pennell boldly without telling that be already engaged to be married wonder at miss leyton being angry about only wonder consent to have more to do with in circumstance o weve settled said ralph testily have whole matter out at richmond afternoon ive promised to be good boy for future never speak to pretty woman again need not wonder more about elinor be only glad enough to get back at price yes what about miss brandt enquired pennell be worrying about affair asked captain pullen quickly not bit think estimate attention at true value be alluding to opinion friend must have formed of character a officer gentleman o ill soon set right ill run over to red house see old girl if two will promise not to tell elinor must not advise to do be afraid might get warm reception think madame gobelli be quite capable of having soused in horse pond must think same if have heard name called yesterday what did call everything must think of considers have behaved not only in most ungentlemanly manner towards in most dishonourable one to miss brandt particularly told to tell that never wished to see face again damn exclaimed captain pullen wrathfully boot shoe into bargain vulgar coarse old tradesman wife how dare stop minute ralph baroness status in society make difference in matter know perfectly well that did wrong let have more discussion of subject captain pullen leaned back sulkily in chair well if did flirt little bit more than be prudent with uncommonly distracting little girl muttered presently be sure have have to pay for lord walthamstowe insists that if marry elinor before ranger start for malta engagement will be broken off so suppose must do be doosid nuisance to be tied up at five twenty before one have half seen life what dickens be to do with when ive got im sure dont know o will find married life very charming when youre used to said pennell consolingly miss leyton be everything fellow must wish for in wife only must give up flirting boy if mistake not youll find youve caught tartar expect to have to give up everything said other with sour mouth a soon a perceived favourable opportunity anthony pennell rose to take leave did not wish to quarrel with ralph pullen about girl whom have only seen once at same time feared for own self control if cousin continued to mention matter in so nonchalant manner pennell have always despised captain pullen for easy conceit with regard to woman seemed to to have grown more detestably contemptible than before be anxious therefore to quit scene of action to annoyance when bade margaret good evening ralph also rose expressed wish to walk with in direction of chamber suppose couldnt put up for night old chappie said with most languid air decidedly not replied pennell have only own bedroom ive intention of sharing why do not go back to richmond put up at hotel doosid inhospitable remarked captain pullen with faded smile sorry think so man can not give what doe not posse have better stay keep sister in law company for little while have work to do be going

gang cry eye out everything thrown on shoulder coffin funeral taking over from heyst to england be enough to drive everything else out of man head must acknowledge that owe excuse to pullen do quite believe in have have plenty of time since to remedy negligence even if did forget to be courteous at moment know youre quite right about other thing have more reason than one for letting matter drop be man can tell with impunity what must set woman tearing eye out did flirt bit with harriet brandt perhaps more than be quite prudent in circumstance mean circumstance of engagement to miss leyton yes if have be free must have be same perhaps worse for must not have have loophole of escape for see miss brandt be not sort of girl that man must marry why not demanded pennell with asperity oh because well must hear old phillips talk of her parent be most awful people have black blood in mother be half caste so see must be impossible for man in position to think of marrying one might get piebald son heir have have have putting aside be one of demndest fascinating little woman ever came across must say so too if have seen a much of a did cant tell what be exactly have drawing way about

if have be married appear to to have followed young lady about paid attention be to say least of compromising never announcing fact meanwhile that be bound to miss leyton after left without word of explanation to think what chose of conduct now wish to see again in order to apologise be right pretty well only make such serious matter out of little fun well then repeat that if be wise will save trouble ralph miss brandt be happily too sensible to have be taken in by pretence of making love to estimate at true value know that be engaged to elinor leyton that be engaged time knew think rather pity miss leyton for being engaged to point of view have never presented before to inflated vanity of ralph pullen pity exclaimed devil daresay seems incomprehensible to that woman must not be thankful to accept at hand crumb may fall from anothers table with regard to miss brandt assure be true even be otherwise be certain madame gobelli must not admit to house know sort of person be can be very violent if chooses name called yesterday be not pretty one have much trouble a relative to stand by listen to quietly yet must not say that be undeserved o well daresay returned ralph
