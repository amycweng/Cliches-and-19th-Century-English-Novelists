immediately raised apprehension repeated question 'be sure be not hurt not wounded ' must not say no to therefore answered believed felt slight contusion in shoulder that be convinced be trifling ' be now seized with fit of terror much greater in effect than former panic fervently intreated sir arthur to let servant take bay mare ride for help begged urgently violently for god sake that must take place in chaise must mount mare must do thing reply must get be still more vehement intercession from frank henley must not be alarmed assurance that there be not least danger most obstinate determination not to quit post notwithstanding pain must not feel persisting to reload discharged pistol then to proceed know not how fear be so far pacified a to yield to except energy seemed to overpower mine indeed suffered dreadfully rest of way knew youth generous spirit imagination be haunted with idea that blood be flowing foot of road that must rather drop from horse than be subdued be impossible indeed be to tell what felt at last arrived in grosvenor street sure enough poor fellow be faint with loss of blood bey god ' said to sir arthur when light be brought saw beend for surgeon good heaven run somebody run for help ' still insisted be slightly hurt began to resume earnestness to quiet sir arthur did more effectually by sending a desired by telling that if continued to agitate by contending with so much might very possibly throw into fever make wound most probably be not in dangerous mortal said not word except seriously solemnly requesting to calm mind for own sake if not for mine for after being wounded in defence of father to die by fault be dreadful indeed retired with more apparent satisfaction in countenance than think ever saw before be resolved however not to go to bed till have received account from surgeon came wound be examined word be immediately sent by express command of frank who have be told be sitting up for purpose that there be a have assured danger surgeon indeed thought proper to qualify with great danger be old remark that surgeon be not prone to speak too lightly of miracle perform short syllable great did not fail however to disturb very considerably waited till ball be extracted must believe brought for insisted upon seeing sir arthur called mad girl adding there be ruling persisted in questioning cross examining surgeon till be convinced that a said there be great danger then retired to rest be retired to same swimming motion chaise have communicated to nerve brain know not what to dreaming of sword pistol murdered men horrid ramblings of fancy under such impression to convince how trifling hurt be gallant frank insisted next day on coming down to dinner though be allowed to eat nothing chicken broth light

better channel be very rough water ran high when went on board sir arthur must willingly have retreated clifton be too impatient prevailed on to venture before have reached middle of channel laura sir arthur soon afterward be very sea sick be most disagreeable sensation when violent must certainly be more effectual in rendering coward fearless of death than dying sentiment of seneca socrates wind increased captain laboured several hour in vain to make port of dover at last told be too late for tide that current set against must drive down to deal proceeded accordingly be dark before came within sight of town of deal where captain in sea phrase be obliged to come to anchor deal boatman who be always on watch be most noted a be told on whole coast for extortion soon came up to ship

market by competitorship be not above mile from shore clifton however agreed to extravagant demand went into boat have not be there many minute before perceived that five boatman who managed be in liquor especially who seemed to be head man that be much more at mercy of wind wave in present than in former situation clifton frank endeavoured to make attentive by reproving probably did good though answer received in rugged vulgar idiom of sea be not very conciliatory be much tossed by roughness of water made however toward shore though evidently in awkward dangerous way most part of beach at deal be excessively steep when weather be wave break against very abruptly dangerously to boat be managed by men be ignorant have drunken away sens when boat approached beach man at helm being stupid being dark did not do duty side of boat be dashed against beach shock almost overset boat be half filled by wave broke over water be always fickle perilous element in agitated sea when

be immediately out of boat almost up to shoulder in sea caught hold of side of boat retreated step two set foot against steep beach steadied to resist returning wave have sooner retreated than called

though be did not neglect to obey mandate after clifton leaving helm jumped into water servant having gone before found ourselves safe after of have concluded be lost beyond redemption peril appears to have be wholly owing to inebriety of boatman for have be able to do duty there must have be none certainly very little be averted by active penetrating mind of frank seems a if be most accurate

propriety of when doing immediately assented aided by keeping boat in position frank directed almost a essentially a co adjutor be more more convinced be accident only have kept from possessing one of most enlarged of human understanding must likewise allow that said accident have rendered petulant impatient of contradiction too precipitate to be always aware of mistake too positive to be easily

marriage with divine anna have almost disgusted with for having though ineffectually endeavoured to aid so well nay have be tempted to shew letter to sir arthur on recollection have thrown philippic mentioned into fire have determined on silence for perceive harm may result from contrary conduct good to swerve to right left from direct path of principle truth because of selfish narrow unwise view of others be to be weak culpable what indeed have relationship to do with truth human tie can bind to error while rigorously act according to rule of truth a far a know comment disapprobation even resentment of relation friend father ought to be disregarded must own however have still folly to feel additional grief that error of so mean so selfish so dishonest nature must have taken such firm possession of mind of father be afraid must support better in person of having determined not to write to have written to thee to give vent relief to feeling of course thou wilt tell if thou seest reason have not discovered why ought to communicate content of letter to sir arthur whom vaunt of having in power whom be determined not to supply with money for projected marriage with clifton

have be witness to so many of virtue effect then briefly recapitulated progress of frank from child in virtue insisting on numerous proof of so lately have be witness recounted history of highwayman of peggy husband adventure of lake protection found from skill strength courage at deal not forgetting attendant incident of neglecting to give such brief strong touch a feeling dictated must own be very extraordinary young man yet can know part of good effected by mind so active so virtuous though perhaps know more than sir ay what let hear think partial already sir let hear very night arrived at paris prevented mr clifton count de beaunoir from fighting duel indeed yet never mentioned perhaps ever must have not afterward met with count at chateau de villebrun be very odd nay more sir day

incite to activity be truth too deeply engraven on heart of louisa to be forgotten be scarcely necessary to revive even at serious moment with respect to myself friend will be judge whole conduct will be submitted to with injunction not to indulge partiality in favour to censure advise instruct whenever find opportunity such louisa have be intercourse have mutual reason to congratulate other on effect have just have conversation with sir arthur have received letter from abimelech shewed of proof frank have yet given of energy relative to father be perhaps strongest know character of abimelech must think possible be willing not only to raise twenty thousand pound for sir arthur to pay down thirty more for son begin to be vain of son have even slight perception that there may be other good quality beside of getting hoarding money cunning be still predominant having conceived possibility of marriage accomplishment of be now become ruling passion have for moment subjected avarice neglect motive think may influence sir arthur not even threatening though language be couched in art of apparent kindness adulation letter however have produced effect on father a will perceive by following dialogue be begun by sir arthur what think of proposal anna ought rather to ask what be thought on subject sir can scarcely tell own doe not seem to quite so unreasonable a must once have supposed be a far a relates to if must have conceived partiality for mr clifton must then excuse sir for interrupting mr clifton be at present wholly out of question be in power fear be not to do service must be a desirous of doing now a ever can never more think of a husband be so very determined be hope sir determination be not offensive to can not say at present that be for not to mention that think very well of young mr henley own affair of anonymous letter be very improper strange proceeding aunt wenbourne lord fitz allen indeed seem to doubt according to account mr henley give think have foundation for doubt behaviour of mr clifton without letter must have be quite sufficient to have fixed determination what behaviour proof gave of deceit depravity of principle by manner in endeavoured to seduce when be that very day on frank arrived endeavoured to seduce be certain of truth of what say proceeded too far explained too openly for to be mistaken seduce then have entirely given up thought of thought of marrying have most certainly what be opinion of mr henley what can be sir be there two opinion concerning if be blind to virtue for whose safety have be so often so ardently active who must do justice own anna have often thought have love for be tempted to think so still love in sense in understand have carefully suppressed because till now supposed incompatible with duty virtue acknowledge begin to doubt even to suppose that view of subject have be more rational true than mine think be duty to form union for owns have ardent wish yes have honestly told passed between sincerity pleased branch of family must certainly be against such match suppose so world too must consider a having dishonoured be to consent believe must must exclaim against bad example what ought to be done opinion have be that world must have cause to make complaint now think rather imagine convinced be in error appears evident to mind at present that ought to consider whether action be in good bad just unjust totally to disregard own prejudice prejudice of world be to pay false homage to wealth rank because world tell be right must do so to neglect genius virtue judgment tell must be odious wrong must find little satisfaction in applause of world opposed to self condemnation mr henley be very good young man very good young man indeed believe must even be willing to think of for son if must not be opposed by other branch of family that surely will be afraid so lord fitz allen be half reconciled to again must avoid breaking with if possible aunt have good opinion of mr henley better of mr clifton yes so suppose must talk to edward mr henley have be friend edward doe not understand friendship when say friend mean acquaintance find most agreeable acquaintance who tell least truth certainly be not mr henley have observed lately to be rather fond of company of mr clifton whom think better companion own mr henley be very obstinate in opinion if opinion be true must not have persist in truth why must be more certain that what say be truth than other people because have examined with more industry caution have stronger mind greater love of enquiry doe not endeavour to make principle accord with practice regulates practice by principle still ask what proof have of being more in right than other people wonder sir that can put question have surely given sufficient proof of superiority though must doubt argument can not doubt fact own be very extraordinary young gentleman ah sir word gentleman shews bent of thought can not perceive be word without meaning if have meaning that who be best man be most gentleman know notion child mine differ little on matter however think quite so much in wrong a used to do perhaps there be something in what say many men of low fortune have made way to highest honour for what know may do same may certainly will deserve highest respect if flatter sir that will seek accept title distinction men have invented to impose on other folly obtain own artful purpose ought to warn that will be mistaken whole life will be devoted to discovery spreading of truth individual act of benevolence excepted wealth must acquire will be dedicated to sole object be afraid be strange whim anna hope yet to shew sir be noble duty be excess of guilt to neglect puzzle to conceive by what mean father must have become so rich have life be rapacious after money faculty be strong perverted what must have be wisdom be degenerated into cunning have made acquainted with usurer have made acquainted with spendthrift have traded in annuity profited by eagerness of youth to enjoy since must be sincere have encouraged sir to pursue plan of expence with view solely to own profit well well must marriage take place will all return into family must be motive sir with know that understand own reason mine if must answer same end there will be harm be going to reply sir arthur left being unwilling to hear argument took for granted must not understand frank came in soon after repeated to what have be said louisa must tell truth whole truth since have begun to imagine might indulge thought in dwelling on exalted quality uncommon virtue affection for have greatly increased never appeared to more lovely than in struggle check joy received at hope of union by recollection of loss of mr clifton like be astonished at power of brother mind at perversion fear that attempt having failed will serve to render perversion more obdurate nay perhaps more active seems even to dread lest be not secure desire to guard caution against must not suffer to repress conceal tenderness ecstasy indeed louisa be very strong be mingled with regret equally vivid mr clifton mr clifton repeatedly burst from while be relating what have passed between sir arthur to frank now again since have be writing to accused of coldness of shrinking from rather of half delivering truth lest sir arthur must think forward girl lest must think capable of too sudden change of degree of change do friend judge have at time endeavoured to shew naked heart often have violently struggled against disguise never concealed from thought more highly of frank henley than of mr clifton imagined principle taught to prefer what principle now warns to shun be more more convinced of error of marrying bad man in order to make good be not entirely ignorant of before therefore flattered good might be effected previous to marriage forgot when passion have purpose to obtain how artful be in concealment have quarrel with for having be so desirous of proving to own conviction that world prejudice prejudice of family ought to be respected while opinion accorded with practice of being now so equally alert to prove reverse such be deception mind put upon for indeed have be very desirous of acting with sincerity in instance can only say that feel more certain at present for before have doubt now have none if

however must not be satisfied in le than five minute heard door unbolting keeper men came in with bludgeon asked morosely why did not go to bed answered because have inclination to sleep went again to window examined very wall with utmost circumspection afterward turning away said beleep wake will be d if have chance ' then left presently afterward saw ray of light again heard various motion at going to bed passed night without closing eye in morning began to examine where be possible light must obtain admission placed in same situation looking to left saw closet be in direction that door be open looking into found that part of flooring in left hand corner be decayed that ceiling beneath have fissure of thought fortunate circumstance that sound be conveyed so distinctly into apartment though speak chiefly of bed chamber for be loudness of keeper voice stillness of surrounding object most contributed to hearing in front apartment not decayed state of building favoured conveyance of sound in direction began to consider how far must improve mean offered watching opportunity in course of day with finger by aid of stick left to stir fire removed of decayed mortar to right left increased aperture on inside be exceedingly careful not to push flake part of ceiling down into floor below attention paid to be very exact for be of utmost consequence be le accurate in pressing together rubbish scraped away into vacant corner between joint leaving trace must lead to discovery precaution be highly necessary a behaviour of keeper have proved for when came into chamber in morning a did early with customary attendant searched pried about with assiduity of suspicion at breakfast be again waited on by boy watched by keeper be necessary must not excite alarm in mind so full of apprehension therefore behaved with reserve to boy though with great complacency said little dismissed soon in forenoon door opened again boy be sent in with straight waistcoat keeper said to 'come sir put on jacket here boy be handy ' once more hesitated asked if mr mac fane be coming to pay visit did not return direct answer replied 'if will put on jacket may go stretch pin for hour in garden if not stay where be be d ' after short deliberation concluded that to comply be prudent very peaceably aided boy in performing office a back be turned to keeper smiled kindly significantly to boy to replied by look expressive of surprise curiosity can not be supposed that mind have be most anxiously enquiring into possibility mean of escape while in prison that moment unexpected privilege be granted whole effort be directed to same subject walked in garden overlooked in certain manner followed by keeper attendant therefore traversed in various direction without seeming to pay least attention to object on mind be most busy chance of escape hand being thus confined appeared to be a small in garden a in house be completely surrounded by high wall join house at end have one small gate rather door be locked bolted have other entrance except from house after having walked about hour a suppose keeper asked in tone rather of command than question if be not tired answered to replied be accordingly without saying word returned to prison will attempt description of suffering of mind continual fear by be distracted not for for there be appearance at time that greater harm than confinement be intended for subject be torturing resignation fortitude be duty reason for mentioning be that strongly excited to prompt effort at escape must think of none except of endeavouring to convince keeper be more interest to give freedom than to keep in confinement consequently when dinner be brought have taken station asked if must do favour to converse with for hour privately in presence of own men did not suffer to finish sentence exclaimed 'none of gab tell if speak word will have jacketed then b kiddy if get off again in hurry ' said more ate dinner casting eye occasionally to door conjecturing be probability by very sudden spring of breaking chain for have only put one up of drawing staple by be held from thickness of wood work knew must not be clenched be not possible believe for mind to be actuated by stronger motif than mine be in wish to escape circumstance of single chain might not occur second time determined on trial prolonged dinner till perceived begin to yawn at last turn head other way be about twelve foot distant from door rose quietly made two step then gave sudden spring came with great violence against door resisted of course fell backward after first moment of surprise keeper instantly locked door in rage of cursing called assistant however soon pacified by turning attention to strength of own fastening scoffing at fruitless attempt incident induced to change mode stood more with door ajar to watch after sending in boy locked bolted upon be in full expectation of straight waistcoat forbearance imagine be occasioned by strict order must have received to contrary threat indeed when attempted to speak be proof rather against supposition can solve other way than by supposing that order be if attempted persuasion with must then be at liberty to do thing to seemed exceedingly prone fear for must escape must inevitably be strong man who have waded far enough in error to commit act so violent will willingly plunge deeper in proportion a such fear increase sudden spring have made at door combining with supposition of madness have effect upon poor boy hearing door lock seeing a imagined let loose upon fright returned in full force look be so pale trembled so violently that feared must fall into fit went up to with utmost gentleness said be afraid good boy indeed will not hurt keeper scarcely stayed minute before recollecting have be long enough at dinner opened door again with caution of three chain bade boy take away then began to accuse of precipitancy soon remembered that thing ought to be hazarded where thing be at stake fear be not for while arm be free must have come upon thus suddenly success be far from improbable vice be always cowardly difference of weapon out of question three to one be not invincible odds now first occurred to how prudent must be to conceal bank bill began to consider be best mean took out examined number endeavoured to fix in memory be difficult task prudence required that nothing must be left to chance took burnt end of stick going into back room wrote number against wall in place from darkness be least liable to notice indeed considered there be little to fear even must figure made be seen for wrote in one continued line rendered unintelligible without key then once more took chair placed at closet door thinking that to hide at one corner of topmost shelf might perhaps be securest place previously began to feel at far end of shelf put hand upon something when brought to light proved to be remainder of bundle of quill felt again found nothing more there then removed chair toward other end after two three time sweeping hand ineffectually along shelf struck edge of against wall more than quire of paper fell flat upon led to conjecture that shelf have be hiding place perhaps to love sick girl that be possible there must be ink after more accurate search turning other hand with must feel better to opposite side found ink bottle took down treasure examined there be cotton in bottle ink be partly mouldy partly dried away however by aid of little water presently procured more than sufficient to write down number wanted pen for there be succedaneum a safest way of preserving what might become useful returned treasure to shelf on have be found for reason began to consider of place for bank note after looking carefully round chamber at last lifted up old picture here found break in wainscot in be inserted laterally full a much more writing paper a quantity have discovered in closet took away paper entirely lest if seen must lead to further search twisting up bill laid so a to be certain of recovering when pleased paper put upon shelf when boy brought supper asked name how old be other trifling question to

seldom used good for nothing must get pen if have quill must make one have pen knife no have forgotten that one of men have knife with several blade must ask to lend what must write supposing have paper letter to whom to mother thought not right to expose store to therefore suffered to go for time without saying thing more on subject discourse with have pretty well driven apprehension from mind be cautious to speak in very low tone of voice without being bidden have acuteness enough to follow example next day at breakfast gave sheet of paper two quill told to make pen of if must one for other for to take paper for letter looked with intelligent surprise where did come from be question in thought said nothing madman be being whom did not comprehend kindness to however made desirous to oblige gave part of breakfast ate what gave in manner shewed be not over fed at dinner brought pen asked why did not keep one to write to mother said have written have cleaned cut pen over again be not ill made considering that a told knife be bad one what will do for ink sir said told have little must be glad if have more perhaps replied must get one of men to bring half pennyworth said have money answered gentleman mr clifton suppose have just given sixpence for holding horse that intended to save for mother that must spare halfpenny to buy ink took boy hand said to 'if ever live to get free from place will remember ' emotion felt communicated looked sorrowfully up in face asked 'why be not mad sir ' very earnest mild manner with answered good fellow convinced set imagination to work said little more finished meal wrote down number gave bottle warned if be questioned by mean to tell untruth boy looked at again in manner spoke highly in favour put bottle in pocket a soon a master returned to door removed thing departed brought ink with supper one of men have taken sixpence refused to return change ink have emptied out of keeper bottle such be habit of vice boy related with indignation said dared not complain have nothing else to give therefore rewarded generous boy with couple of quill four sheet of paper for own use cautioning to keep to write to mother while wanted

notwithstanding thousand repeated conviction of impossibility to suffer to write either with effect connection did nothing make memorandum of thought occurred others of circumstance be present

have taken alarm be entering garden saw man mac fane instantly joined in pursuit though be in strait waistcoat yet happened to be swifter than of keeper be soon first in chase be up narrow lane with high banked hedge on side man be coming down keeper called to to stop man seeing arm confined hearing shout of pursuer endeavoured to do a be desired placed directly in way ran full against fell man by aid of hand be up rather soonest laid hold of sudden thought struck be bawling behind ' madman madman assumed that grinning contortion of countenance might easiest terrify uttered uncouth noise

jumped over into field on right there be ditch on other side of have intimation foot alighting on edge of once more fell pursuer profited by gate have passed be field of gardener man be at work close by came helped up not soon enough keeper arrived presently after man mac fane addressed to gardener endeavoured to tell who be said must give hundred pound if must aid to escape effort be soon put end to by keeper who threw down second time violently thrust thumb into throat by gagging prevented further speech mac fane however thought proper to give man crown assured be madman story be confirmed by man who supposed bitten who have joined in pursuit extreme malevolence of mac fane again displayed treatment be unworthy notice except a relates to what be to come be hurried back to prison left with strait waistcoat on whole day night be fed by boy who shewed many silent token of commiseration though once more watched by keeper two attendant with three chain up at door conversation between boy be for several day ended by continued overlooking of keeper men after keeper mac fane have retired went into back room be standing with face toward window be beside closet behaviour of mac fane have be so extraordinary a already to lead to suspect have wish to take away life a be standing here heard keeper bed room door open shut again soon after voice of mac fane in conversation listened very attentively to dialogue substance of be to much more alarming than unexpected be consultation on part of mac fane on policy mean of murdering keeper opposed several time mentioned mr clifton a unconquerable objection urged danger of being detected for did not seem to revolt at fact mac fane answered must silence clifton of whom favourite phrase be that 'he must soon do ' repeated very often with variety of uncommon oath even said that be fairly out of way must make edward st ives pay three thousand guinea curse mac fane continually coupled with name rancour thirst of blood preyed upon be incredible hundred time imprecated eternal damnation to soul if there be least danger fellow keeper have with be of own providing knew must hang durst not impeach squeak recollect be word used to take off be safest way clifton must in reality be accessary before fact therefore obliged to silence beside 'he must do must do ' confirmed by new string of oath keeper however continued averse to project said fellow must hang own father if must not bribe that there be nothing to be got by putting out of way that must not venture neck unless saw good cause while be arguing point loud authoritative rap be heard at keeper door accompanied by voice of mr clifton demanding admission entered whole story of escape be related with colouring own fear inspired mac fane darkly hinted thought have be communicating to keeper meeting repulse from mr clifton whenever idea of cruelty be started thought proper to use more reserve keeper concluded account by affirming must be necessary to continue in strait waistcoat not to let walk in garden more mr clifton assented to latter positively ordered arm to be released there be need said to punish in manner must not be at same time gave keeper twenty pound note repeated order to treat properly to take care not to suffer to escape misguided man how doe heart pant after virtue how grieve at slavery in be held what will agony be when full measure of error be come yet to be lucid moment of hope for suggested train of conclusion seem like heavenly certainty mr clifton have made attempt on anna st ives have be repelled even still be several day since effort continue to be ineffectual must be so purpose of vice be frustrated by pure energy of virtue for have succeeded must be released heart cheering thought pleasure inexpressible yes anna st ives be safe truth be omnipotent out of ash probably more strenuous determined assertor of may arise clifton at last may see how very foul be folly turn to wisdom must might be spared guilt of purchasing conviction at price of blood three day passed away after escape without remarkable occurrence sanguinary malignity of mac fane be more than counterbalanced by reasoning of probability hope in favour of anna st ives during confinement have slept little wearied however at length by repetition of idea be unavailing be slumbering more soundly than usual on night after ninth day be dreaming that door be unbolted chain rattling men entering to murder from be waked by starting in dream to run resist be real clanking of bolt lock of house door inspired dream opened to give one admission know not what be hour must be very late be completely dark soon distinguished mac fane voice jumped up hastily dressed in part presently heard keeper door open ray of light appeared on wall crept toward closet first word mac fane uttered be ' told must do told must do ' kept repeating other exclamation must not at first comprehend closing of with oath expressive of uncommon exultation descanted almost instantly from mr clifton to whom phrase alluded to adding be high time now to do too joy be so great oath so multiplied asseveration so continual that must tread out must send soul to hell very night other similar phrase that be time before keeper must obtain answer to question of 'what doe mean ' at last mr mac fane began to relate a soberly a intoxication of mind must permit that have done mr clifton out of ten thousand pound have got money god shiver soul to flame if did not make pay must blow to powder drink blood eat bone if did not be not all have prize eight thousand pound money be now in house stopped short cupidity of keeper be excited grew impatient mac fane imagine hesitated to reconsider if be possible to get money make away with secretly leave keeper in ignorance must not conclude to be impracticable must not sufficiently connect meaning of phrase followed might depend a much on seeing a hearing understood mac fane be acquainted with circumstance of money have in possession though whether knowledge be gained from mr clifton anna st ives for be mentioned must not distinguish talked much of letter of own cunning of contempt in held mr clifton keeper however be convinced of fact for proposed immediately to murder secure money point be for time debated moment expected must leave room to perpetrate crime mac fane have pistol cutlas yet seemed to suppose possibility even of conquering keeper be much more confident knew how to bring down have fear of ' mac fane remembered defeat keeper cheaply bought victory agreed must not be done silently unless must catch asleep unbolting of door must awaken wished keeper fellow to know nothing of matter must claim share at last mac fane proposed must be put in strait waistcoat next morning on

might come dispatch conversation continued long after scheme of flight to ireland continent be concerted rich happiness must enjoy insisted on with great self applause pleasure poor mistaken men at last parted with determination to execute scheme of strait waistcoat mac fane took possession of keeper bed a imagine went to of men here must remark that mac fane forgot did not imagine that
