dictionary upon morning vulgus be three very fair example of way in such task be done at rugby in consulship of plancus doubtless method be little changed for there be nothing new under sun especially at school in consulship of plancus here meaning in time of dr arnold vulguses now be known unto boy who be at school rejoice in time honored institution of vulgus commonly supposed to have be established by william of wykeham at winchester imported to rugby by arnold more for sake of line be learnt by heart with than for own intrinsic value a have always understood that be short exercise in greek latin verse on given subject minimum number of line being fixed for form master of form gave out at fourth lesson on previous day subject for next morning vulgus at first lesson boy have to bring vulgus ready to be looked over with vulgus certain number of line from one of latin greek poet then being construed in form have to be got by heart master at first lesson called up boy in form in order put on in line if must say seem to say by reading off master other boy book who stood near be sent back went below boy who did so say seem to say in case vulgus be looked over by master who gave entered in book to credit discredit of boy so many mark a composition merited at rugby vulgus line be first lesson other day in week tuesday thursday saturday a there be thirty eight week in school year be obvious to meanest capacity that master of form have to set one hundred fourteen subject year two hundred twenty eight two year so on now to person of moderate invention be considerable task human nature being prone to repeat will not be wondered that master gave same subject sometimes over again after certain lapse of time to meet rebuke bad habit of master schoolboy mind with accustomed ingenuity have invented elaborate system of tradition almost boy kept own vulgus written out in book book be duly handed down from boy to boy till if tradition have gone on till now suppose popular boy in whose hand bequeathed vulgus book have accumulated be prepared with three four vulguses on subject in heaven earth in more world than one unfortunate master can pitch upon at rate such lucky fellow have generally one for one for friend in time only objection to traditionary method of doing vulguses be risk that succession might have become confused so that follower of tradition must show up same identical vulgus fine morning in case when happened considerable grief be result when did such risk hinder boy men from short cut pleasant path william of wykeham founder of winchester college oldest of great public school of england here dr arnold fitted for oxford intrinsic inward real true minimum least elaborate prepared thought out with great care science of verse making now in study night tom be upholder of traditionary method of vulgus doing carefully produced two large vulgus book began diving into picking out line here ending there tag a be vulgarly called till have gotten that thought must make fit then proceeded to patch tag together with help of gradus producing incongruous feeble result of eight elegiac line minimum quantity for form finishing up with two highly moral line extra making ten in cribbed entire from one of book beginning o genus humanum must have used dozen time before whenever unfortunate wicked hero of nation language under sun be subject indeed began to have great doubt whether master must remember so only threw in a extra line because in case must call off attention from other tag if detected being extra line must be sent back to do two more in place while if passed muster again must get mark for incongruous ill fitting elegiac kind of verse generally used in expressing sorrow lamentation cribbed stole copied o genus humanum o human race second method pursued by martin may be called dogged prosaic method no more than tom took pleasure in task having old vulgus book of own one else must not follow traditionary method for too a tom remarked have genius martin then proceeded to write down eight line in english of most matter of fact kind first came into head to convert line by line by main force of gradus dictionary into latin must scan be cared for to produce eight line with false quantity concord whether word be apt what sense be mattered nothing a article be new not line beyond minimum did follower of dogged method ever produce scan contain right number of syllable with accent in proper place false quantity long syllable placed where short one must be used reverse concord agreement of word in construction a adjective with noun in gender number case third artistic method be arthur considered first what point in character event be subject must most neatly be brought out within limit of vulgus trying always to get idea into eight line not binding to ten even twelve line if must do then set to work a much a possible without gradus other help to clothe idea in appropriate latin greek must not be satisfied till have polished well up with aptest most poetic word phrase must get at fourth method indeed be used in school of too simple kind to require comment may be called vicarious method obtained amongst big boy of lazy bullying habit consisted simply in making clever boy whom must thrash do whole vulgus for construe to afterward latter be method not to be encouraged strongly advise not to practise of others will find traditionary most troublesome unless can steal vulguses whole experto crede that artistic method pay best in mark other way vicarious acting for here mean having done for em by experto crede believe one who have have experience martin den vulguses being finished by nine o'clock martin having rejoiced above measure in abundance of light of gradus dictionary other convenience almost unknown to for getting through work having be pressed by arthur to come do verse there whenever liked three boy went down to martin den arthur be initiated into

know how often have be right wrong now two be jawing away about young squaretoes struck in gower be end of sucking wiseacre dare say have time to lose have got five court at half past nine squaretoes over precise goody good sort of person sucking wiseacre young solomon say gower said tom appealingly be good fellow let try if ca get on without crib what in chorus why sha' get through ten line chorus chorus of greek play say tom cried east having hit on new idea remember when be in upper fourth old momus caught construing off leaf of crib 'd torn out put in book must float out on to floor sent up to be flogged for momus god of ridicule here nickname for teacher yes remember very well well doctor after 'd flogged told that did flog for using translation for taking into lesson using there when have learnt word before came in said there be harm in using translation to get clew to hard passage if tried must first to make out without did though said tom then arthur must be wrong of course be said gower little prig will only use crib when ca construe without go ahead east result of explosion on agreement started tom satisfied with having made confession not sorry to have locus penitentiae not to be deprived altogether of use of old faithful friend locus penitentiae place opportunity for repentance reformation boy went on a usual taking sentence in turn crib being handed to one whose turn be to construe of course tom must object to a be not simply lying there to be appealed to in case sentence must prove too hard altogether for construer must be owned that gower east did not make very tremendous exertion to conquer sentence before having recourse to help tom however with most heroic virtue gallantry rushed into sentence searching in high minded manner for nominative verb turning over dictionary frantically for first hard word stopped in meantime gower who be bent on getting to five must peep quietly into crib then suggest think be meaning think must take way brown a tom did see way to not profiting by suggestion lesson went on about a quickly a usual gower be able to start for five court within five minute of half hour when tom east be left face to face looked at one for minute tom puzzled east chock full of fun then burst into roar of laughter enemy defence well tom said east recovering see objection to new way be about a good a old one think besides advantage give one of feeling virtuous looking down on one neighbor tom shoved hand into back hair be not so sure said two fellow carried off leg really think tried one sentence fairly be sure remember what doctor said to yes will swear must make out one of sentence to day ever must really remember said east speaking slowly impressively to have come across one latin greek sentence half must go construe by light of nature whereby be sure providence intended crib to be used thing to find out said tom meditatively be how long one ought to grind at sentence without looking at crib now think if one fairly look out word one doe know then ca hit be enough to be sure tommy said east demurely with merry twinkle in eye new doctrine too old fellow added when one come to think of be cutting at root of school morality will take away mutual help brotherly love in vulgar tongue 'giving construes hold to be one of highest virtue for how can distinguish between getting construe from boy using crib hang tom if be going to deprive school fellow of chance of exercising christian benevolence being good samaritan will cut concern wish must joke about harry be hard enough to see one way precious sight harder than thought last night suppose there be use abuse of one will get straight enough somehow ca make out anyhow that one have right to use old vulgus book copy book hullo more heresy how fast fellow go down hill when once get head before leg listen to tom not use old vulgus book why be to take benefit of wisdom admire use work of past generation not use old copy book why might a well

be to make work of value goth barbarian churchwarden window probably cheap narrow window sheridan knowles writer of popular play say harry please chaff be really serious then be not duty to consult pleasure of others rather than own above of master fancy then difference to in looking over vulgus have be carefully touched retouched by others must bring sort of dreamy pleasure a if 'd met thought expression of somewhere before be born perhaps that of cutting up making picture frame round false quantity other monstrosity why tom must be so cruel a never to let old momus hum over o genus humanum again then look up doubtingly through spectacle end by smiling giving three extra mark for just for old sake sake suppose well said tom getting up in something a like huff a be capable of be deuced hard that when fellow really trying to do what ought best friend will hing chaff try to put down stuck book under arm hat on head preparatory to rushing out into quadrangle to testify with own soul of faithlessness of friendship now be as tom said east catching hold of know well enough by time bark worse than bite ca expect to ride new crotchet without anybody trying to make kick off especially a will have to go on foot still now sit down let go over again will be a serious a judge then tom sat down on table waxed eloquent about righteousness advantage of new plan a be wont whenever took up anything going into a if life depended upon sparing abuse must think of of opposite method denounced a ungentlemanly cowardly mean lying one know what besides very cool of tom a east thought did say seeing a how only came out of egypt last night at bed time came out of egypt escaped from bondage began new course of life well tom said at last see when came to school there be none of sort of notion may be right dare say be only what one have always felt about master be that be fair trial of skill last between like match at foot ball battle be natural enemy in school be fact have got to learn so much latin greek do so many verse have got to see that do if can slip collar do so much le without getting caught be one to if can get more out of catch shirking be one to fair in war lying if run

morality be served too tom for matter of that five year be clear fair mistake about understand understand know what be to come to with other last endurance snob here mean spirited fellow one destitute of manliness truce tom looked at pleased little puzzled have never heard east speak mind seriously before must help feeling how completely have hit own theory practice up to time thank old fellow said be good old brick to be serious not put out with said more than meant dare say only see know be right gower rest do will hold on must a be new up hill game see one must hit hard hold on tight at first very good said east hold on hit away only hit under line hit under line take unfair advantage must bring over harry sha' be comfortable now will allow have said have always be honorable enemy with master found state of war when came went into of course only think thing be altered good deal feel a used to master seem to to treat one quite differently yes perhaps do said east there be new set see mostly who feel sure of yet want to fight till know ground think be only said tom then doctor doe treat one so openly like gentleman a if one be working with well so doe said east be splendid fellow when get into sixth will act accordingly only know have nothing to do with lesson now except examining say though looking at watch be just quarter come along arthur go home a walked out got message to say that arthur be just starting must like to say good bye so went down to private entrance of school house found open carriage with arthur propped up with pillow in looking already better tom thought jumped up on to step to shake hand with tom mumbled thanks for present have found in study looked round anxiously for arthur mother east who have fallen back into usual humor looked quaintly at arthur said so have be at again through hot headed convert of yours there be be making life burden to morning about using crib will get floored to certainty at second lesson if be called up arthur blushed looked down tom struck in oh be all right be converted already always come through mud after grumbling spluttering clock struck have to go off to school wishing arthur pleasant holiday tom lingering behind moment to send thanks love to arthur siege reopens tom renewed discussion after second lesson succeeded so far a to get east to promise to give new plan fair trial encouraged by success in evening when be sitting alone in large study where east lived now almost vice arthur on leave after examining new fishing rod pronounced to be genuine article play enough to throw midge tied on single hair against wind strength enough to hold grampus naturally began talking about arthur tom who be still bubbling over with last night scene thought of last week wanting to clinch fix whole in own mind must never do without first going through process of belaboring somebody else with suddenly rushed into subject of arthur illness what have said about death vice vi se in place of play lightness elasticity midge gnat small fly grampus whale like fish east have given desired opening after seriocomic grumble that life be worth having now be tied to young beggar who be always 'raising standard that east be like prophet donkey who be obliged to struggle on after donkey man who went after prophet that have none of pleasure of starting new crotchet did half understand have to take kick carry luggage a if have fun threw leg up on to sofa put hand behind head said well after be most wonderful little fellow ever came across there be such meek humble boy in school hanged if think now really tom that belief much worse fellow than that doe think have more influence in house than dot bowles who came last quarter be ten yet turn round little finger old boy there be mistake about east nodded at tom sagaciously raising standard advancing improving now never thought tom so shutting eye hardening heart went straight at repeating that arthur have said a near a must remember in very word have thought life seemed to ooze out of a went on several time felt inclined to stop give up change subject somehow be borne on have necessity upon to speak out did so at end looked at east with anxiety be delighted to see that young gentleman be thoughtful attentive fact be that in stage of inner life at tom have lately arrived intimacy with friendship for east must not have lasted if have not made aware of sharer in thought be beginning to exercise indeed must friendship have lasted if east have shown no sympathy with thought so that be great relief to have unbosomed to have found that friend must listen friendship tom have always have sort of instinct that east levity be only skin deep instinct be true one east have want of reverence for anything that felt to be real be one of nature burst into what be generally called recklessness impiety moment feel that anything be being poured upon for good doe not come home to inborn sense of right appeal to anything like self interest in daring honest by nature outspoken to extent alarmed respectability with constant fund of animal health spirit did not feel bound to curb in way have gained for with steady part of school including a well who wished to appear steady a who really be so character of boy with whom must be dangerous to be intimate while own hatred of everything cruel underhand false hearty respect for what must see to be good true kept off rest tom besides being very like east in many point of character have largely developed in composition capacity for taking weakest side be not putting strongly enough be necessity with must help more than must eating drinking must never play on strongest side with heart at foot ball cricket be sure to make friend with boy who be unpopular down on luck now though east be not what be generally called unpopular tom felt more more day a character developed that stood alone did not make friend among contemporary therefore sought out tom be much more popular for power of detecting humbug be much le acute instinct be much more sociable be at period of life too largely given to taking people for what gave out to be singleness of heart fearlessness honesty be just what east appreciated thus two have be drawn into great intimacy intimacy have be interrupted by tom guardianship of arthur friendship tested east have often a have be said joined in reading bible discussion have almost always turned upon character of men woman of whom read not become personal to in fact two have shrunk from personal religious discussion not knowing how might end fearful of risking friendship very dear to felt somehow without quite knowing why must never be same tenfold stronger sapped at foundation after such communing together sapped undermined what bother explaining be wish must get on without ca however will find if have found out already that time come in human friendship when must go down into depth of lay bare what be there to friend wait in fear for answer few moment may do may be most likely will be a be english boy that will never do once done must be if friendship be to be worth name must find what be there at very root bottom of one heart if be at one there nothing on earth can at least ought to sunder east confession east have remained lying down until tom finished speaking a if fearing to interrupt now sat up at table leant head on one hand taking up pencil with other working little hole with in table cover after bit looked up stopped pencil said thank very much old fellow there be other boy in house must have done for arthur can see well enough went on after pause best big fellow look on with suspicion think be devil may care reckless young scamp so be eleven hour out of twelve not twelfth then contemporary worth knowing follow suit of course be very good friend at game not soul of arthur ever tried to break through crust see whether there be anything at bottom of then bad one wo stand know that think be half fancy harry not bit of said east bitterly pegging away with pencil see plain enough bless think everybody a straightforward kind hearted a be well what be reason of there must be reason can play game a well a one sing best song be best company in house fancy be not liked harry be fancy only wish be tom know must be popular enough with bad one wo have good one wo have why not persisted tom drink swear get out at night never bully cheat at lesson if only showed liked 'd have best fellow in house running after not said east then with effort went on will tell what be never stop during sacrament can see from doctor downward how tell against yes have seen that said tom have be very sorry for arthur have talked about have often thought of speaking to be so hard to begin on such subject be very glad have opened now why have never be confirmed said east confirmed admitted to church membership here to of church of england not be confirmed said tom in astonishment never thought of why be confirmed with rest of nearly three year ago always thought 'd be confirmed at home answered east sorrowfully see be how happened last confirmation be soon after arthur came be so taken up with hardly saw of well when doctor sent round for about be living mostly with green set know sort went in dare say be right got good by want to judge only must see of reason drove just other way be 'because doctor liked ' boy got on who did stay sacrament be 'the correct thing ' in fact like having good hat to wear on sunday must stand did feel that wanted to lead different life be very well content a be be going to sham religious to curry favor with doctor one else curry favor seek favor by flattery like east stopped speaking pegged away more diligently than ever with pencil tom be ready to cry felt half sorry at first that have be confirmed seemed to have deserted earliest friend to have left by at worst need for long year got up went sat by east put arm over shoulder dear old boy said how careless selfish have be why did come talk to arthur wish to heaven have said east be fool be too late talking of now why too late want to be confirmed now think so said east have thought about good deal only often fancy must be changing because see be to do good here just what stopped last time then go back again tom prescription will tell now how 't be with said tom warmly if have be for arthur must have done just a did hope must honor for then made out just a if be taking weak side before world going in once for against everything be strong rich proud respectable little band of brother against whole world doctor seemed to say so too only said great deal more ah groaned east there again be just of difficulty whenever think about matter want to be one of saint one of elect whatever right phrase be sympathy be other way with many poor wretch who run about street go to church stare tom mind be telling be in heart a far a know be muddle must be gentle with if want to land now have seen deal of sort of religion be bred up in ca stand if nineteen twentieth of world be to be left to uncovenanted mercy sort of thing mean in plain english to go to destruction other twentieth be to rejoice at why elect chosen to salvation one of favored few land here persuade uncovenanted mercy be to such mercy a god will grant to heathen outside church oh harry be not broke in tom really shocked oh how wish arthur have gone be such fool about thing be want too east be indeed cut way somehow being confirmed taking sacrament make feel on side of good bad too of everybody in world only there be great dark strong power be crushing everybody else be what christ conquered have got to fight what fool be ca explain if arthur be only here begin to get glimmering of what mean said east say now said tom eagerly do remember how hated flashman of course do said east hate still what then well when came to take sacrament have great struggle about tried to put out of head when must do tried to think of a evil a something that lord who be loving hated might hate too must do broke down believe christ broke down when doctor gave bread wine leaned over praying prayed for poor flashman a if have be arthur east buried face in hand on table tom must feel table tremble at last looked up thank again tom said know what may have done for to night think see now how right sort of sympathy with poor wretch be got at will stop for sacrament next time wo said tom can before be confirmed go ask doctor will very night after prayer east followed doctor old verger bearing candle up stair tom watched saw doctor turn round when heard foot step following closer than usual say hah east do want to speak to man if please sir private door closed tom went to study in state of great trouble of mind effect thereof be almost hour before east came back then rushed in breathless well be all right shouted seizing tom by hand feel a if ton weight be off mind hurrah said tom knew must be tell about well just told about ca think how kind gentle be great grim man whom have feared more than anybody on earth when stuck lifted just a if have be little child seemed to know 'd felt to have gone through burst out cry more than have done five year sat down by stroked head went blundering on told all much worse thing than have told be shocked bit did snub tell be fool be nothing pride wickedness though dare say be did tell not to follow out thought did give cut dried explanation when 'd done just talked bit can hardly remember what said yet seemed to spread round like healing strength light to bear up plant on rock where must hold footing fight for know what to do feel so happy be owing to dear old boy seized tom hand again be to come to communion said tom yes to be confirmed in holiday tom delight be a great a friend have yet have out own talk be bent on improving occasion so proceeded to propound arthur theory about not being sorry for friend death have hitherto kept in background by be much exercised for did feel honest to take what pleased throw over rest be trying vigorously to persuade that must like best friend to die off hand exercised made thoughtful anxious east power of remaining serious be exhausted in five minute be saying most ridiculous thing must think of till tom be almost getting angry again despite of however must help laughing giving up when east appealed to with well tom be

master chuckled grimly at burglarious entry insisted on leaving hall door two of front window open to frighten truant on return then two set about foraging for tea in operation master be much at fault having faintest possible idea of where to find anything being moreover wondrously short sighted tom by sort of instinct knew right cupboard in kitchen pantry soon managed to place on snuggery table

be not only at play in world answered tom rather puzzled to find out what really did mean be mixing up two very different thing in head think brown said master putting down empty saucer ought to get
