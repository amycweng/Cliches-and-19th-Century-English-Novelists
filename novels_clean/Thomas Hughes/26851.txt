continuation in macmillan magazine same thing occurred in fact reached pitch a to lead to make change to story sensitiveness on point may seem folly if reader have felt sort of loathing disgust one

chance of saying that be not either a boy man in fact not to beat about bush be much braver nobler purer fellow than ever be when first resolved to write book tried to realize to myself what commonest

simple reason knew better than others therefore be le likely to blunder in writing about a to name have be perhaps chief cause of offense in matter simple fact be that chose name brown because stood first in trio of brown jones robinson have become sort of synonym for middle class of great britain happens that own name that of brown have single letter in common a to christian name of tom having chosen brown must hardly help taking a prefix two name have gone together in england for two hundred year joint name have not enjoyed much of reputation for respectability suited exactly wanted commonest name must get did not want name have least heroic aristocratic even respectable savor about therefore have natural leaning to combination found ready to hand moreover believed tom to be more specially english name than john only other a to felt least doubt whether be that thomas beckett be for so long favorite english saint from other cause certainly seems to be fact that name thomas be much commoner in england than in other country word tom fool tom boy etc though perhaps not complimentary to tom of england certainly show how large family must have be reason decided to keep christian name have be always associated with brown own that fact that happened to be own never occurred to a objection till mischief be done past recall have only to say that be hero portrait of be there other portrait in of book except in case of dr arnold where true name be given deep feeling of gratitude to reverence for memory emboldened to risk attempt at portrait in case so far a character

anyone let see hand will keep uppermost left be weakest away went again keeping newly acquired fact painfully in mind so avoiding further collision amidships for four five stroke a in other science giving of undue prominence to one fact brings others inexorably on head of student to avenge neglect of so happened with tom in practical study of science of rowing that by thinking of hand forgot seat necessity of trimming properly whereupon old tub began to rock fearfully next moment missed water altogether with right scull subsided backwards not without struggle into bottom of boat while half stroke have pulled with left hand sent head well into bank tom picked up settled on bench again sadder wiser man a truth began to dawn upon that pulling especially sculling doe not like reading

off bank warned by last mishap got out into mid stream there moderating ardor contenting with slow steady stroke be progressing satisfactorily beginning to recover temper when loud shout startled looking over shoulder at imminent risk of upset beheld fast sailor dart close hauled on wind almost aboard of utterly ignorant of what be right thing to do held on course passed close under bow of

rushed towards hero calling upon to mind mill stream pull right hand scull notwithstanding warning tom be within ace of drifting past entrance to lock in case assuredly boat if not have never returned whole however lock keeper managed to catch stern of skiff with boat hook drag back into proper channel then opened lock gate for tom congratulated a entered lock that there be other boat going through with evil star be in ascendant thing animate inanimate seemed to be leagued together to humiliate a water began to fall rapidly lost hold of chain tub instantly drifted across lock be in imminent danger of sticking breaking back when lock keeper again came to rescue with boat hook guessing state of case did not quit until have safely shoved boat well out into pool below with exhortation to mind go outside of barge be coming up tom started on latter half of outward voyage with sort of look cato must have worn when elected losing side god went over to winning one previous struggle have not be thrown away managed to keep right side of barge turn corner without going around zigzag down kennington reach slowly indeed with much labor at rate safely rejoicing in feat stopped at island recreated with glass of beer looking now hopefully towards sandford lay within easy distance now upwards again along reach have just overcome solacing with remembrance of dictum have heard from great authority that be always easier to steer up stream than down from argued that worst part of trial trip be now over presently saw skiff turn corner at top of kennington reach resolving in mind to get to sandford before new comer paid for beer betook again to tub got pretty well off island shutting out unconscious rival from view worked away at first under pleasing delusion that be holding own be soon undeceived for in monstrously short time pursuing skiff showed around corner bore down on never relaxed effort must not help watching enemy a came up with hand over hand envying perfect ease with seemed to be pulling long steady stroke precision with steered scarcely ever casting look over shoulder be hugging berkshire side a other skiff passed thought heard sculler say something about keeping out minding small lasher noise of water own desperate effort prevented heeding indeed hearing warning plainly in minute however heard plainly enough most energetic shout behind turning head over right shoulder saw man who have just passed backing skiff rapidly up stream towards next moment felt bow of boat whirl round old tub grounded for moment then turning over on side shot out on to planking of steep descent into small lasher grasped at board be too slippery to hold rush of water be too strong for rolling over over like piece of driftwood plunged into pool below after first moment of astonishment fright be over tom left to stream holding breath hard paddling gently with hand feeling sure that if must only hold on must come to surface sooner later accordingly happened after somewhat lengthy submersion first impulse on rising to surface after catching breath be to strike out for shore in act of doing so caught sight of other skiff coming stern foremost down decent after trod water drew in breath to watch down came a straight a arrow into tumult below sculler sitting upright holding scull steadily in water for moment seemed to be going under righted glided swiftly into still water then sculler cast hasty anxious glance around till eye rested on hero half drowned head oh there be said looking much relieved right hope not hurt eh thankee all right believe answered tom what will do swim ashore will look after boat so tom took advice swam ashore there stood dripping watching other a righted old tub be floating quietly bottom upwards little worse for mishap doubt if boat can wish earnestly desiring in wooden mind to be allowed to go quietly to piece then there sooner to be rescued than be again entrusted to guidance of freshman tub having be brought to bank stranger started again collected scull bottom board be floating about here there in pool also succeeded in making salvage of tom coat pocket of held watch purse cigar case brought to bank delivering over inquired whether there be anything else to look after thank nothing cap never mind be luck enough not to have lost coat said tom holding up dripping garment to let water run out of arm pocket hole then wringing a well a must at rate thought need be afraid of looking too new more stranger put off again made one more round searching for cap anything else might have overlooked without success while be doing so tom have time to look well over see what sort of man have come to rescue hardly knew at time full extent of obligation at least if sort of obligation be to be reckoned not so much by service actually rendered a by risk encountered to be able to render there be probably not three men in university who must have dared to shoot lasher in skiff in then state for be in time really dangerous place tom have extraordinary escape for a miller st ambrose coxswain remarked on hearing story one who be born to be hung must have rolled down without knocking head against something hard going down like lead when got to bottom be very well satisfied with inspection other man be evidently year two older than figure be more set have stronger whisker than be generally grown at twenty be somewhere about five foot ten in height very deep chested with long powerful arm hand there be denying however at first glance be ugly man be marked with small pox have large feature high cheekbone deeply set eye very long chin have got trick many underhung men have of compressing upper lip nevertheless there be that in face hit tom fancy made anxious to know rescuer better have instinct good be to be gotten out of so be very glad when search be ended stranger came to bank shipped scull jumped out with painter of skiff in hand proceeded to fasten to old stump while remarked be afraid cap lost doe matter least thank for coming to help be very kind indeed more than expected say that one oxford man will never save from drowning unless have be introduced know replied other be sure be not hurt yes quite said tom foiled in what considered artful plan to get stranger to introduce then be very well out of said other looking at steep descent into lasher rolling tumbling rush of water below indeed be said tom how in world did manage not to upset hardly know have shipped good deal of water see perhaps ought to have jumped out on bank come across to leaving skiff in river for if have upset must have helped much however followed instinct be to come quickest way thought too that if must manage to get down in boat must be of more use be very glad did added after moment pause be really proud of having come down place so ai said tom with laugh in other joined now be getting chilled turned from lasher looked at tom chattering jaw oh be nothing be used to being wet may just a well be comfortable if can here be rough jersey use instead of coat pull off wet cotton affair put on then will get to work for have plenty to do after little persuasion tom did a be bid got into great woolen garment be very comforting then two set about getting skiff back into main stream be comparatively easy a to lighter skiff be soon baled out hauled by main force on to bank carried across launched again tub gave much more trouble for be quite full of water very heavy after twenty minute so of hard work during mutual respect of labourer for strength willingness of other be much increased also lay in main stream leaking considerably otherwise not much worse for adventure now what do mean to do said stranger think can pull home in one doe know how much may be damaged may sink in lock play prank what be to do with oh can leave at sandford walk up send one of hall boy after if like will tow up behind skiff wo skiff carry two yes if like to come will take must sit very quiet ca go down to sandford first have glass of ale what time be water have stopped watch quarter past three have about twenty minute to spare come along then said tom will let pull skiff down to sandford resolved to pull to sandford to day like to give up by mean if like said other with smile jump in will walk along bank thank said tom hurrying into skiff in completed remaining

account of adventure to great amusement of companion by time rose to go be settled at tom earnest request that must pull sound skiff up while companion sat in stern coached other consented very kindly merely stipulating that must take scull if must prove that tom must not pull up in time for hall dinner so started took tub in tow when came up to tom got on famously under new tutor who taught to get forward open knee properly throw weight on to scull at beginning of stroke managed even to get into iffley lock on way up without fouling gate be then there complimented on progress whereupon a sat while lock filled tom poured out thanks to tutor for instruction have be given so judiciously that while be conscious of improving at stroke did not feel that other be asserting superiority over so though more humble than at most disastrous period of downward voyage be getting into better temper minute be great pity that of instructor in more important matter than sculling will not take leaf out of same book of course be more satisfactory to one own self love to make everyone who come to one to learn feel that be fool wise men if object be to teach well usefully what know there can not be worse method man however be likely to adopt so long a be conscious that have anything to learn from pupil a soon a have arrived at conviction that can teach nothing that be henceforth to be give take

never saw sadder face poor blake one ca help calling poor although must have winced at more than name must have called might have admired feared wondered at must have be pleased object of life be to raise such feeling in neighbor pity be last must like to excite be indeed wonderfully gifted fellow full of sort of energy talent power tenderness yet a face told only too truly to anyone who watched when be exerting in society one of most wretched men in college have passion for success for beating everybody else in whatever took in hand that too without seeming to make great effort doing thing well thoroughly gave satisfaction unless must feel that be doing better more easily than b c felt acknowledged have have full swing of success for two year now nemesis be coming for although not

turning into ash in mouth felt much more disgust than pleasure at triumph over other men yet habit of striving for success notwithstanding irksomeness be too strong to be resisted poor blake be living on from hand to mouth flashing out in old brilliancy power forcing to take lead in company might be utterly lonely depressed when by reading feverishly in secret in desperate effort to retrieve by high honor fellowship a tom said to neighbor there be sadder face than to be seen in oxford yet at very wine party be life of everything a sat up there between diogenes whom kept in constant sort of mild epileptic fit from laughter wine going wrong way for whenever diogenes raised glass blake shot with joke captain who watched with most undisguised admiration singular contrast two men miller though blake be torment of life relaxed after first quarter of hour hero by same time gave credit for being much greater as than be for having ever thought blake face sad one when room be quite full enough wine have be drunk to open heart of guest diogenes rose on signal from miller opened budget financial statement be satisfactory one club be almost free of debt comparing position with of other college diogenes advised that might fairly burden little more then if must stand whip of ten shilling man might have new boat believed must agree have become necessary miller supported new boat in pungent little speech captain when appealed to nodded said thought must have one so small supply large addition to club debt be voted unanimously captain miller blake who have many notion a to flooring line keel of racing boat be appointed to order superintend building soon afterwards coffee came in cigar be lighted large section of party went off to play pool others to stroll about street others to whist few let hope to own room to read latter be sadly small minority even in quietest of st ambrose party tom who be fascinated by hero at head of table sat steadily on sidling up towards a intermediate place became vacant at last attained next chair one to captain where for time sat in perfect bliss blake miller be telling boating story of henley thames regatta latter of have be lately started with great eclat from great yearly event deed of prowess done thereat talk came gradually round to next race now captain said miller suddenly have thought yet what new men be to try in crew

life be soon disposed of captain blake be last life on board divided pool at blake suggestion have scarcely nerve for playing out single handed match with iron nerved steady piece of humanity a captain though be more brilliant player of two party then broke up tom returned to room when be by again thought recurred to hardy how odd thought that never mentioned for boat must have done anything to be ashamed of how be that nobody seemed to know to know nobody most reader doubt not will think hero very green for being puzzled at so simple matter doubt step in social scale in england be very clearly marked out come to appreciation of gradation sooner later hero previous education must be taken into consideration have not be instructed at home to worship mere conventional distinction of rank wealth have gone to school be not frequented by person of rank where one knew whether boy be heir to principality must have to fight own way in world so be rather taken by surprise at what found to be state of thing at st ambrose did easily realize chapter v hardy servitor be not long before tom have effected object in part be to say have caught hardy several time in quadrangle coming out of lecture hall chapel have fastened upon often walking with even up to door of room there matter ended hardy be very civil gentlemanly even seemed pleased with volunteered companionship there be undoubtedly coolness about tom must not make out a only liked more more saw of very soon made up mind to break ground to make dash at rate for something more than mere speaking acquaintance one evening have a usual walked from hall with hardy up to door stopped moment talking then hardy half opening door said well goodnight perhaps will meet on river to morrow be going in when tom looking in face blurted out say hardy wish 'd let come in sit with bit never ask man of college into room answered other come in by mean if like so entered room be worst in situation furniture tom have yet seen

writing material couple of plain windsor chair occupied two side of fireplace dozen common wooden chair stood against opposite wall three on side of pretty well filled book case while old rickety sofa covered with soiled chintz leaned against wall fronted window a if to rest lame leg carpet rug be dingy decidedly worse for wear college have evidently neglected to paper room whitewash ceiling for several generation on mantle piece reposed few long clay pipe brown earthenware receptacle for tobacco together with japanned tin case shaped like figure of eight use of puzzled tom exceedingly one modestly framed drawing of gun brig hung above at side of fireplace sword belt tom have time to remark by light of fire be burning brightly while host produced couple of brass candlestick from cupboard lighted up drew curtain before window then tom instinctively left off taking note for fear of hurting other feeling just a must have gone on doing making remark on everything have room be model of taste comfort throwing cap gown on sofa sat down on one of windsor chair what jolly chair said where do get must like to buy one yes be comfortable enough said hardy reason have be that be cheapest armchair one can get like arm chair ca afford to have other than tom dropped subject of chair at once following instinct again sad to say be already teaching that poverty be disgrace to briton that until know man thoroughly must always seem to assume that be owner of unlimited ready money somehow began to feel embarrassed must think of anything to say a host took down pipe tobacco from mantle piece placed on table however anything be better than silence so began again very good sized room yours seem said taking up pipe mechanically big enough for matter of answered other very dark noisy in day time so must think said tom do know 'd sooner now have freshman room up in garret wonder change get for nothing said host putting long clay to candle puffing out volume of smoke tom

smoke ca afford thank said tom blushing for shame a if have come there only to insult host wishing heartily out of have got case here fact be will smoke cigar if will allow for be not up to pipe yet wish 'd take went on emptying cigar on to table thank'ee replied host prefer pipe now what will have to drink keep wine can get bottle of anything like from common room be one of privilege gave grim chuckle a emphasised word who on earth be thought tom servitor suppose for knew already undergraduate in general must not get wine from college cellar care straw about wine said feeling very hot about ear glass of beer anything have here tea well can give pretty good glass of whiskey said host going to cupboard producing black bottle two tumbler of different size little wooden toddy ladle sugar in old cracked glass tom vowed that if there be one thing in world liked more than be whiskey began measuring out liquor carefully into tumbler rolling round between eye candle smelling to show what treat be to while host put kettle on fire to ascertain that have quit boiling then a spluttered fizzed filled up two tumbler restored to place on hob tom swallowed of mixture nearly made cough again for though be very good be also very potent however by effort managed to swallow cough must about a soon have lost little finger a let out then to great relief host took pipe from lip inquired how do like hardly know yet said tom first few day be delighted with going about seeing building finding out who have lived in of old college pottering about in bodleian fancying must like to be great

sha be going up for three year ca begin too early might go talk to college tutor about so did said tom at least meant to do for asked two other freshman to breakfast other morning be going to open out to when got there be quite shut up never looked one of in face talked in set sentence be cold formal condescending only bit of advice gave be to have nothing to do with boating just one thing feel real interest in must get out word of what wanted to say be unlucky certainly that present tutor take so little interest in anything men care about be more from shyness than anything else that manner noticed may be sure that be more wretched embarrassed than of well now must really like to know what did said tom be only man of much older standing than whom know at yet mean know anybody else well enough to talk about sort of thing to what did do now besides learning to pull in first year have learnt to pull before came up here said hardy really hardly remember what did besides read see came up with definite purpose of reading father be very anxious must become good scholar then position in college poverty naturally kept out of many thing other men do tom flushed again at ugly word not so much a at first hardy must mind subject must never be forcing up at turn thought must think began again harping on same string can hardly tell how miss sort of responsibility be talking to about have doubt will get vacuum filled up before long for life of ca see how yet will be very lucky fellow if find quite a much a can do to keep in order up here be about toughest part of man life do believe time have spent here university life have be so different altogether from what yours will be that experience be likely to benefit wish must try though said tom know what teachable sort of fellow be if body will take right way taught to scull know at least put in way to learn sculling rowing cricket rest of with such reading a be likely to do wo be enough feel sure of already think will said hardy amount of physical mental work will fill vacuum be talking of just now be empty house swept garnished boy might have have glimpse of man find yawning within must be filled somehow be pretty good three year work to learn how to keep devil out of more le by time take degree at least have found so hardy rose took turn two up down room be astonished at finding talking so unreservedly to one of whom knew so little half wished word recalled lived much alone thought morbid too self conscious why must be filling youngster head with puzzle how did know that be thinking of same thing spoken word can not be recalled must go on way for good evil one set hearer staring into ash putting many thing together in head be minute before broke silence at last gathered up thought said well hope sha' shirk when time come think fellow need shut up though be sure must be better for think must said hardy because see tom went on waxing bolder more confidential if be to take to moping by must read a sensible fellow must do know well enough must just begin sitting with leg upon mantel piece looking into own inside see be laughing know what mean now yes staring into vacuum be talking of just now come back to said hardy well perhaps doe said tom believe doe fellow bit of good to be thinking about own doings only ca help said hardy let throw a will into be going on up here after must be alone for great part of time night at rate when get oak sported be up with must be looking more le into own inside a call then hope wo find a ugly business a do if doe be sure ca be worse employed know said hardy ca learn anything worth learning in other way oh like said tom be worth learning how to play tennis how to speak truth ca learn either by thinking of ever so much must know truth before can speak said so always do in plenty of time how said hardy oh know said tom by sort of instinct suppose never in life felt doubt about what ought to say do did well yours be good comfortable working belief at rate said hardy smiling must advise to hold on to a long a can think can very long eh men be very different there be saying if be going to get out of self dissecting business altogether though why must have brought subject up at to night look awkward for doe tom began to feel rather forlorn at suggestion probably betrayed in face for hardy changed subject suddenly how do get on in boat saw going down to day thought time much better tom felt greatly relieved a be beginning to find in rather deep water so rushed into boating with great zest two chatted on very pleasantly on other matter college clock struck during pause in talk tom looked at watch eight o'clock declare said why must have be here more than two hour be afraid now have be wanting to work have kept from with talk no be saturday night besides get much society care about so enjoy more wo stop have tea tom gladly consented host produced somewhat dilapidated set of crockery proceeded to brew drink least appreciated at st ambrose tom watched in silence much excercised in mind a to what manner of man have fallen upon very much astonished at for having opened out so freely feeling desire to know more about hardy not unmixed with sort of nervousness a to how be to accomplish when hardy sat down again began pouring out tea curiosity overcame opened with so read night after hall yes for two three hour longer when be in good humor what by generally once twice week grey come in to compare note do know at least have called on have just spoken to be quiet fellow daresay doe call on man unless knew something of before never said hardy shortly added after short pause very few men must thank if did most must think impertinent be too proud to risk that tom be on point of asking why uncomfortable feeling have nearly lost came back on suppose one very soon get tired of wine supper party life though own find pleasant enough now have never be tired said hardy servitor be not troubled with sort of thing if be must go unless must return ca afford there go again thought tom why will be throwing that old story in face over over again ca think care about poverty wo change subject time at rate so said mean to say make

subject well sha believe if can help said tom know said just now that never called on one perhaps give men fair chance might be glad to know if must let may think be fault that very possible said hardy tell not to take word for upset one idea so went on tom why oxford ought to be place in england where money must count for nothing surely now such man a jervis captain have more influence than rich men in college put together be more looked up to be one of thousand said hardy handsome strong good tempered clever up to everything besides be poor man mind say that if be must be where be be speaking of rule not of exception here hardy scout came in to say that dean wanted to speak to so put on cap gown tom rose also well be sorry to turn out said hardy be afraid have be very surly made

oh need mind have plenty of time on hand besides one ca read night from eight till ten will find generally idle then will see often enough promise now to turn out whenever be in way very well said hardy laughing so parted for time twenty minute afterwards hardy returned to room after interview with dean who merely wanted to speak to about matter of college business flung cap gown on sofa began to walk up down room at first hurriedly soon with usual regular tramp however expressive man face may be however well may know be simply nonsense to say that can tell what be thinking about by looking at a many of be apt to boast still more absurd must be to expect reader to know what hardy be thinking about when have never have advantage of seeing face even in photograph wherefore must seem that author be bound on such occasion to put reader on equal vantage ground with not only tell what man doe so far a may be what be thinking about also first thought then be one of pleasure at having be sought by one who seemed to be just sort of friend must like to have contrasted hero with few men with whom have generally lived for of whom have high esteem whose only idea of exercise be two hour constitutional walk in afternoon whose life be chiefly spent over book behind sported oak felt that be more of man after own heart then came doubt whether new friend must draw back when have be up little longer knew more of place at rate have said done nothing to tempt if push acquaintance think will will be because like for can do good too feel sure went on a ran over rapidly own life for last three year perhaps wo flounder into slough have have to drag through will get too much of healthy active life up here for have never have of must get into companionship of boating cricketing wine party supper party reading in world wo keep from many long hour of mawkishness discontent emptiness of heart feel that already be sure of though may be only reading into at rate why must have helped to trouble before time be that friend part well must face sooner better perhaps at rate be done what blessed thing if one can only help youngster like to fight own way through cold clammy atmosphere be always hanging over ready to settle down on can help to keep living faith in that world oxford be respectable piece of machinery set going century back ah be awful business temptation to believe think believe in dead god have nearly broken back score of time be temptation of world flesh devil to includes well believe can help please god will if will only let very sight of doe good so wo believe went down lasher together for nothing so at last hardy finished walk took down volume of don quixote from shelf sat down for hour enjoyment before turning in chapter vi how drysdale blake went fishing drysdale what be servitor how deuce must know short pithy dialogue took place in drysdale room one evening soon after conversation recorded in last chapter tom be sitting alone there for wonder so latter seized occasion to propound question have have on mind for time be scarcely satisfied with above rejoinder while be thinking how to come at subject by road drysdale opened morocco fly book poured content on table be already covered with fly of sort pattern hank of gut delicate made up cast reel minnow tackle enough to kill fish in four neighboring county tom began turning over scrutinizing dressing of fly have be so mild fish must be in season think besides if be not be jolly drive to fairford at rate have never be behind team brown 'd better come now to morrow ca cut two lecture bother lecture put on aeger then doe suit book know ca see why must be so cursedly particular well if wo wo know well enough what cast will fish with to morrow how many fly do use sometimes

searching glittering heap to select color to go with dull hare ear be early for alder said drysdale rather perhaps ca resist bang tailed little sinner good said drysdale throwing cock bondies across table yes never like to be without governor two here be well tied lot said tom picking out dozen never know when may not kill with of know fairford water so opinion be worth much tom soon returned to old topic now drysdale must know what servitor be why must do mean one of college servitor yes oh something in upper servant line must put above porter below cook butler doe don dirty work get broken victual believe pay college fee tom rather drew into at insolent offhand definition be astonished hurt at tone of friend however presently resolved to go through with began again servitor be gentleman suppose good deal of cock tail about must think have not honor of acquaintance amongst at rate be undergraduate be not yes may take degree just like may have degree to for anything care wish must let one pay servitor for passing little go for one must be deuced comfortable wonder strike don now might get clever beggar for servitor farm so make load of tin drysdale seriously why must talk like if can take degree can be in fact just what be undergraduate ca see why be not a likely to be gentleman a can surely make difference being poor men must make devilish uncomfortable said incorrigible payer of double fee getting up to light cigar name ought to carry respect here at rate black prince be oxford man thought noblest motto must take be 'ich dien serve if be here now must change for 'je paye ' often wish must tell what really truly think drysdale dear fellow be telling what do really think whatever black prince might be pleased to observe if be here stick to motto tell thing to be able to do here at oxford be to pay believe knew must believe do do though what make so curious about servitor why made friend with hardy one of servitor be such fine fellow be sorry to relate that cost effort to say to drysdale despised that be so must have told so before began to pump said drysdale however partly suspected something of sort have good bit of quixote in really brown added seeing tom redden look angry be sorry if what said pained daresay friend of yours be gentleman say be more of gentleman by long way than most of gentleman commoner be going to say crane at small fence on account will put in way for ca be greater snob than many of well why do live with so much then why because happen to do thing like doing live up here a like to live like hunting driving drawing badger playing card good wine cigar hunt drive keep dog good cellar will play unlimited loo van john a long a please know get very sick of often for have heard say a much dozen time in little time have be here why want to deny briton privilege of grumbling do said drysdale a flung leg up on sofa crossing one over other a lounged on back favorite attitude suppose be getting tired of be not what do purpose a substitute take to boating know must be in first boat if liked heard say so at smith wine other night what be to prevent getting just a tired of besides be such grind then there be bore of changing one habit yes be such splendid hard work said tom who be bent on making convert of friend just so be just what want 'books work healthful play line suit complaint no a uncle say young fellow must sow wild oat oxford seems place especially set apart by providence for operation in wild range of accepted british maxim there be none take for in more thoroughly abominable than one a to sowing of wild oat look at on what side will can make nothing devil maxim of what man be young old middle aged sow that nothing else will reap one only thing to do with wild oat be to put carefully into hottest part of fire get burnt to dust seed of if sow matter in what ground up will come with long tough root like couch grass luxuriant stalk leaf a sure a there be sun in heaven crop turn one heart cold to think of devil too whose special crop be will see that thrive nobody else will have to reap common reaping will get out of soil must be dug down deep again again well for if with care can make ground sweet again by dying day boy will be boy be not much better have true side to encouragement to sowing of wild oat be simply devilish for mean that young man be to give way to temptation follow lust of age what be to do with wild oat of manhood old age with ambition over reaching false weight hardness suspicion avarice if wild oat of youth be to be sown not burnt what possible distinction can be drawn between if may sow one why not other to get back to story tom went away from drysdale room night after have sorted tackle be to accompany fishing expedition to satisfaction in disturbed state of mind be very much annoyed at drysdale way of talking because be getting to like man be surprised angry at being driven more more to conclusion that worship of golden calf be verily indeed rampant in oxford side by side doubt with much be manly noble tainting more le whole life of place in fact what annoyed most be consciousness that be becoming idolater for must help admitting that felt much more comfortable when standing in quadrangle strolling in high street with drysdale in velvet cap silk gown faultless get up than when doing same thing with hardy in faded old gown shabby loose overcoat well worn trouser must have have hardy suspect fact for be worth hoped to get over feeling soon there be unmistakably wondered whether hardy have ever felt anything of kind nevertheless thought did not hinder from sleeping soundly from getting up hour earlier than usual to go see drysdale start on expedition accordingly be in drysdale room next morning betimes assisted at early breakfast be going on there blake be only other man present be going with drysdale entrusted tom with message to miller captain that must not pull in boat that day must pay waterman to take place a soon a gate opened three accompanied by faithful jack followed by drysdale scout bearing overcoat splendid water proof apron lined with fur rod reel sallied out of college sought livery stable patronized by men of st ambrose here found dog cart ready in yard with strong roman nosed vicious looking rat tailed horse in shaft called satan by drysdale leader have be sent on to first turnpike thing be packed jack bull dog hoisted into interior in few minute drysdale produced long straight horn called yard of tin probably because be made of brass after refreshing with blast two handed over to blake then mounted dog cart took rein blake seated by side help who be to accompany got up behind jack looked wisely out from inside place over back board be right said drysdale catching long tandem whip into knowing double thong right sir said head ostler touching cap 'd better have come boy said drysdale to tom a trotted off out of yard tom must help envying a followed watched dog cart lessening rapidly down empty street heard note of yard of tin blake managed to make really musical borne back on soft western breeze be such pleasant morning for fishing however be too late to repent have wished so got back to chapel destroyed whole effect of morning service on miller mind by delivering blake message to choleric coxswain a soon a chapel be over miller vowed for twentieth time blake must be turned out of boat went off to captain room to torment consult what be to be done weather continued magnificent soft dull grey march day steady wind thought of lucky fisherman vision of creel filled with huge three pounder haunted tom at lecture throughout day at two o'clock be down at river college eight be to go down for first time in season to reached below nuneham for good training pull have notice to great joy that be to be tried in boat great doubt a be glory price be heavy one be first time have be subjected to tender mercy of miller coxswain have pulled behind captain did not take long to convince that be very different style of thing from anything have a yet be accustomed to in freshman crew long steady sweep of so called paddle tried almost a much a breathless strain of spurt miller too be in one of most relentless mood be angry at blake desertion seemed to think that tom have something to do with though simply delivered message have be entrusted to so though distributed rebuke objurgation to man in boat except captain seemed to hero to take particular delight in working there stood in stern fiery little coxswain leaning forward with tiller rope in hand bending to stroke shouting warning rebuke monition to tom till drove to wit end by time boat came back to hall arm be so numb that must hardly tell whether oar be in out of hand leg be stiff aching muscle in body felt a if have be pulled out inch two a walked up to college felt a if shoulder leg have nothing to do with one in short have have very hard day work after going fast asleep at wine party trying in vain to rouse by stroll in street fairly gave in about ten o'clock went to bed without remembering to sport oak for hour slept sleep of dead at last began to be conscious of voice clicking of glass laughter scrap of song after turning once twice in bed to ascertain whether be awake rubbed eye sat up became aware that something very entertaining to party concerned be going on in sitting room after listening for minute jumped up threw on shooting coat appeared at door of own sitting room where paused moment to contemplate scene met astonished vision fire recently replenished be burning brightly in grate candle on table on stood whisky bottle tumbler hot water on sofa have be wheeled round before fire reclined drysdale on back in pet attitude one leg crossed over other with paper in hand from be singing in arm chair sat blake while jack be coiled on rug turning now then in sort of uneasy protest against master untimely hilarity at first tom felt inclined to be angry jolly shout of laughter with drysdale received a stepped out into light in night shirt shooting coat dishevelled hair appeased at once why brown mean to say have be in bed last half hour looked into bed room thought be empty sit down old fellow make at home have glass of grog be first rate whisky well be couple of cool hand must say said tom how did get in through door

morning may entertain angel unawares be rum pair of angel anyhow said tom taking seat on sofa what o'clock be oh about past one said drysdale have have series of catastrophe never got into college till near one thought must never have waked that besotted little porter however here be at last see right so seems said tom how about fishing fishing have never thrown fly day said drysdale be so cursedly conceited about knowledge of country struck in blake what with awful twist incurable habit of gossiping blackguard dog team of devil young female hold scandalous tongue shouted drysdale to

whether have money not be last thing real gentleman thought of besides why be to be so very poor must be able to allow must be necessary to make comfortable 'but jack ' said suddenly later in evening 'one meet low fellow everywhere have met know often at confounded school will meet again never be ashamed of poverty boy ' promised readily enough for did think must be more tried in way than have be already have lived for three year amongst people whose class notoriously measured thing by money standard now be over thought be easy making promise in dark vicar however must not let matter rest so

conceal that be out of pale a be in fact with exception of one of tutor one man who be freshman with know man in college except a mere speaking acquaintance have be rather thrown off balance think at change in life for at first made great fool of have believed too readily what father have said thought that at oxford must see more of what have be used to here thought that last thing man must be

however in minute hardy came to rescue began pouring out tea be evidently tickled at idea of confronting tom so soon with of enemy tom saw put on cool majestic manner in consequence evidently increased discomfort of grey seat kept hardy on edge of abyss of laughter in fact have to ease by talking of indifferent matter laughing at nothing tom have never seen in sort of humor before must help enjoying though felt that be partly at own expense when hardy once just approached subject of wine party tom bristled up so quickly grey looked so meekly wretched though knew nothing of what be

opened nineteen bottle of port for be very glad to hear that habit of place have changed so much for better a tom must want nearly so much wine must have out of older bin accordingly port tom employed first hour after return in stacking carefully away in cellar have be more than twelve year in bottle thought with unmixed satisfaction of pleasing effect must have on jervis miller one two other men who knew good wine from bad guided public opinion on subject of social importance must soon attain from reputation of giving good wine idea of entertaining of being hospitable be pleasant fascinating one to most young men act soon get to be bore to few curiously constituted individual with hospitality becomes first passion then faith faith practice of in case of of professor reminds one strongly of hint on such subject scattered about new testament most of feel when friend leave certain sort of satisfaction not unlike of paying bill have be done for ca expect anything more for long time such thought never occur to really hospitable man long year of narrow mean can not hinder from keeping open house for whoever want to come to setting best of everything before comer have notion of giving anything best can command if be only fresh porter from nearest mew asks not ought to invite b do owe anything must b like to come here give men house for real enjoyment though never get anything very choice there how can man produce old wine who give oldest day seldom much elbow room orderly arrangement high art of gastronomy scientific drinking so much valued in highly civilized community be wholly unheeded by be altogether above be cultivated in fact by quite set who have very little of genuine spirit of hospitality in from table must one by chance happen upon one sens certainly with feeling of satisfaction expansion chiefly physical entirely without expansion of heart one get at scramble of hospitable man so that be driven to remark even in such everyday matter a be invisible spiritual after give value reality even to dinner with solomon to prefer most touching diner russe dinner of herb where love be though trust that solomon must object to well dressed cutlet with salad if happened to be going reader will scarcely need to be told that one of first thing tom did after depositing luggage unpacking wine be to call at hardy room where found friend deep a usual in book hard worked atlas dictionary of sort taking up more space than ever after first hearty greeting tom occupied old place with much satisfaction how long have be up old fellow began look quite settled only went home for week well what have be doing in vacation oh there be nothing much going on so amongst other thing have nearly floored little go work bravo will find comfort of now hardly thought

alcibiades shouted hardy fresh from rugby not know thucydides better than there be alcibiades that little purple headed foppish pin by socrates rusty colored one be that respectable old stick in mud nicias well have made alcibiades nearly smallest of whole lot said tom so be to mind said hardy just sort of insolent young ruffian whom must have liked to buy at price sell at own must have be very

throwing out suggestion helping one to think rather than arguing at end of time tom left hardy to book went away laden with several new idea one of clearest of be that be awfully ignorant of contemporary history of own country that be thing of others ought to be best informed on thinking most about so being of impetuous turn of mind went straight to room to commence new study where after

interesting speculation a to chance of bungaree in forthcoming campaign against british middleweight by time have skimmed through well known sheet be satisfied that column of old acquaintance be not

st ambrose friend tom have introduced blake to hardy after demur on part of latter blake be senior by term might have called on time three year why must want to make acquaintance now when tom explained to that must be kind thing to let blake come coach up history with for unless took high degree in coming examination must have to leave college probably be ruined for life hardy at once consented tom did not venture to inquire for day two how two hit off together when began cautiously to approach subject be glad to find hardy liked blake be gentleman very able said be curious to see how quickly be overhauling grey yet how grey take to have never looked scared at a still doe at by way since first night met blake have talent of setting people at ease without saying anything must wonder if grey think have sound church notion be dangerous talent may make man very false if doe take care tom asked if blake must be up in history in time hardy thought might perhaps have great lee way to make up if capacity for taking in cram must do must be all right have be well crammed in science have put hardy up to many dodge might be useful in school must get without private tutor then tom first wine have gone off most successfully jervis miller have come early stayed late said be handsome of port so that be already social hero with boating set drysdale of course have be there rattling away to everybody in reckless fashion setting good example to two three fast men whom tom knew well enough to ask who consequently behaved pretty well gave air though a went away together grumbled slightly that brown did give claret rest of men have shaken together well seemed to enjoy only drawback to tom have be that hardy grey have appeared excused afterwards on score of reading tom felt aggrieved in hardy case knew that be only excuse then training have begun seriously miller have come up specially for first fortnight to get well in hand a said after be once fairly started must have to go down till just before race thought might rely on captain to keep up to work in interval so miller coxswain took to drawing bow up to ear at once at very beginning of term five six week before race st ambrose boat be to be seen other day at abingdon early dinner limitation of liquid tobacco abstinence from late supper party pastry ice manner of trash likely in miller opinion to injure nerve wind be hanging over crew already in fact to extent enforced captain shrugged shoulder submitted to worked away with imperturbable temper merely hinting to miller in private that be going too fast that must be impossible to keep up diogenes highly approved must have become willing slave of tyranny must insist that adult male subject must pull twenty mile never imbibe more than quart of liquid in twenty four hour tom be inclined to like a helped to realize proud fact that be actually in boat rest of crew be in stage of mutiny be only kept from breaking out by fondness for captain knowledge that miller be going in few day a be blake be only one who openly rebelled once twice stayed away miller swore grumbled captain shook head crew in general rejoiced be to one of occasion to must now turn if usual casual voyager of novel have be standing on sandford lock at about four on afternoon of april th might have beheld st ambrose eight oar coming with steady swing up last reach if such voyager be in least conversant with glorious mystery of rowing must have felt heart warm at magnificent sweep life of stroke must on whole have be pleased with performance of crew generally considered a college crew in early stage of training came hard up to pool below lock coxswain standing in stern with tiller rope in hand then shipped oar lock gate opened boat entered in minute two be moored to bank above lock crew strolled into little inn stand by lock after stopping in bar to lay hand on several pewter full of porter passed through house into quoit skittle ground behind be already well filled with men of other crew playing in group looking on at player one of group a passed seized on captain miller stopped with rest of st ambrose men in humor for skittle quoit relaxation except rest grumbling took possession of first table seat offered came to anchor then followed moment of intense enjoyment of sort only appreciable by who have have twelve mile training pull with coxswain a sharp a needle in awful temper ah said drysdale taking pewter down from lip with sigh handing to tom who sat next by jove feel better be almost worth while pulling 'hard from abingdon to get such thirst said of crew will tell what though said drysdale to day last day will catch in blessed boat tom have just finished draught did not reply be by mean first time drysdale have announced resolve rest be silent also be bad enough to have to pull heart out without getting abused way into bargain there miller stand in stern devilish easy thing be to stand there walk into can see chuckle a come to brown 'now well forward ' jerk ' 'now throw weight on oar come now can get pound on ' hang on like grim death then 'time now ' well be great compliment broke in tom with laugh think can make something of will make nothing of first think said drysdale have lost eight pound in fortnight captain ought to put in place in boat in turn to make water tight have larded bottom board under seat so that not drop of water will ever come through again very good thing for old fellow said diogenes look ten time better than did at beginning of term know what call good thing old fluter be obliged to sit on hip bone ca go to lecture tutor think be poking fun at put on directly have be able to go to lecture ten day so fond of lecture a be too poor fellow put in tom have discommonsed for staying away said drysdale not that care much for though well miller go down to morrow morning heard say so said then will memorialize captain get out of abingdon pull life be worth having at rate other boat have be below sandford yet so sat on plotted soon most of other crew started then took turn at skittle almost forgot grievance must be explained to who know river at oxford river run along south of city getting into university quarter after pass under bridge connecting berk oxfordshire over be road to abingdon just below bridge be boat builder establishment on side of river then on oxfordshire side be christchurch meadow opposite be moored university barge here be goal of university race racecourse stretch away down river for mile half little below starting place of race be iffley lock next lock below iffley be sandford lock where left boat crew playing at skittle be about mile half below iffley below sandford there be lock till get to abingdon distance of six mile more by river now inasmuch a longest distance to be rowed in race be only upper mile half from iffley to university barge of course crew think very hardly treated if be taken further than to sandford pulling hard from sandford to iffley then again from iffley over regular course ought to be enough in conscience so chorus crew most captain coxswain give in here there enemy of kind uncomfortable worriting energizing mortal like miller get command of boat then unfortunate crew be dragged bemoaning fate down below sandford where friendly lock intervenes to break long steady swing of training pull two mile result for time be blister mutiny be bound to add that generally tell that crew have be undergoing that peine forte et dure be very apt to get change out of on night of hard race so st ambrose crew played out skittle settled to appeal captain in body next day after miller departure then being summoned to boat took to water again paddled steadily up home arriving just in time for hall for who liked to hurry drysdale never liked hurrying besides must not dine in hall a be discommonsed for persistent absence from lecture neglect to go to dean when sent for to explain absence say brown hang hall said to tom who be throwing on thing come dine with at mitre will give bottle of hock be very good there hock about worst thing drink in training said miller be jervis be good certainly said captain a put on cap gown come along miller there hear said miller can drink glass of sound sherry if want wine followed captain drysdale performed defiant pantomime after retiring coxswain then easily carried point with tom except a to hock so walked up to mitre together where drysdale ordered dinner bottle of hock in coffee room order hock drysdale sha drink then will have to own cheek if begin making slave of to miller will very soon cut down to glass of water day with pinch of rhubarb in make drink that standing on head gammon think be fair on rest of crew not to train a well a one can suppose drinking pint of hock to night will make pull worse day six week when race begin do hullo look here said drysdale who be inspecting printed bill pinned up on wall of coffee hall wombwell menagerie be in town somewhere down by worcester what fun will go there after dinner food arrived with drysdale hock seemed to enjoy more from assurance glass gave that be defying coxswain doing just thing must most dislike so drank away facetiously speculated how must be such idiot a to go on pulling day of life made good resolution in reach above gut that must be last performance always broke next day supposed habit have of breaking good resolution be way to account for after dinner set off to find wild beast show a will be at least quarter of hour reaching for pitch be in part of suburb little known to gownsmen opportunity may be seized of making few remark to patient reader impatient reader be begged to skip hero on first appearance in public year since be without own consent at once patted on back by good natured critic enrolled for better worse in brotherhood of muscular christian who at time be beginning to be recognised a actual lusty portion of general british life a biographer be not about to take exception to enrolment for after considering person up down majesty dominion to whom new nick name have be applied principle be supposed to hold sort of life be supposed to lead can not see where must in time have fallen upon nobler brotherhood be speaking of course under correction with only slight acquaintance with faith of muscular christianity gathered almost entirely from witty exposition comment of person of somewhat dyspeptic habit who be not amongst faithful indeed be not aware that authorized article of belief have be sanctioned published by sect church may be moreover at age at hero have arrived having regard to character must say that have in likelihood thought very little on subject of belief must scarcely be able to give formal account of own beyond contained in church catechism for one think may very well satisfy for present nevertheless have suddenly be caught at gate of st ambrose college by one of gentleman who do classifying for british public accosted with sir belong to body whose creed be to fear god walk mile in hour believe must have replied do sir be very glad to hear must be very good set of fellow how many week training do allow in course of inquiry on subject of muscular christian work way fact have forced on attention for sake of ingenious youth ought not to be passed over find then that side by side with muscular christian apparently claiming sort of connection with same concern a pirate of trade mark say have risen up set of person against whom desire to caution reader hero to warn latter mean on pretense to allow to connect with however much may be taken with off hand hail brother well met manner dress may easily lead careless observer to take counterfeit for true article must call person in question muscleman a distinguished from muscular christian only point in common between two being that hold to be good thing to have strong well exercised body ready to be put at shortest notice to work of body be capable to do well here likeness end for muscle man seems to have belief whatever a to purpose for body have be given except hazy idea that be to go up down world with belaboring men captivating woman for benefit pleasure at once servant fomentor of fierce brutal passion seems to think necessity rather fine thing than otherwise to indulge obey whereas so far a know least of muscular christian have hold of old chivalrous christian belief that man body be given to be trained brought into subjection then used for protection of weak advancement of righteous cause subduing of earth god have given to child of men doe not hold that mere strength activity be in worthy of respect worship that one man be bit better than because can knock down carry bigger sack of potato than for mere power whether of body intellect have hope believe reverence whatever though coeteris paribus must probably a matter of taste prefer man who can lift hundred weight round head with little finger to man who can construct string of perfect sorites expound doctrine of contradictory inconceivables above remark occur a hero be marching innocently down towards first town gown row must scarcely like to see in middle of without protesting that be mistake know that other youngster of kidney will have fit of fighting desiring to fight with poorer brother just a child have measles shorter fit better for patient for like measles be great mistake most unsatisfactory complaint if can escape altogether so much better instead of treating fit a disease muscleman professor be wont to represent a state of health to let disciple run about in middle age with measles on a strong a ever now although hero have measles on at particular time passage of arm be about shortly to describe led to result of importance in history can not therefore be passed over yet wish at same time to disclaim in sponsorial individual character sympathy with town gown row with other class row quarrel of sort kind whether waged with sword pen tongue fist otherwise also to say that in such row so far a have seen read from time when roman pleb marched out to mon sacer down to when english chartist met on kennington common upper class be most to blame may be that be not aggressor on given occasion very possibly may carry on actual fighting with more fairness though be by mean true a rule nevertheless state of feeling make such thing possible especially in england where men in general be only too ready to be led taught by superior in rank may be fairly laid at door ever in case of strike just now will of course be at once thrown in teeth say fearlessly let man take trouble to study question honestly will come to conviction that combination of men for purpose of influencing labor market whether in much unjustly abused trade society in other form have be defensive organization that master might a body over over again have taken sting out of if have acted fairly a many

know get on badly a speaking acquaintance seems queer solitary bird twelve o'clock struck so tom wished captain good night departed meditating much on what have heard seen vision of terrible single combat in descendant of hundred earl polish off huge representative of mass in most finished style without scratch on own aristocratic feature have faded from mind went to bed that night fairly sickened with experience of town gown row with nasty taste in mouth felt much pleased at having drawn out captain so completely for stroke be in general man of marvellous few word having many better us than talking to put breath to next morning attended at proctor room at appointed time not without feeling of shame at having to do so however wore off when found dozen men of other college waiting about on same errand a in turn be ushered in a stood by door have time to look great man over a sat making note of case have just disposed of inspection be reassuring proctor be gentlemanly straight forward looking man of about thirty not at donnish address answered to appearance mr brown of st ambrose think said yes sir sent to college yesterday evening did go straight home sir how be that mr

never be sent to before think never sir well ca overlook a confess to direct act of disobedience must write out line of virgil now mr brown let advise to keep out of disreputable street quarrel in future good morning tom hurried away wondering what must feel like to be writing out virgil again a punishment at time of life glad above measure that proctor have asked question about companion hero be of course mightily tickled at result seized occasion to lecture tom on future conduct holding up a living example of benefit be sure to accrue to man who never did anything be told to do soundness of reasoning however be somewhat shaken by dean who on same afternoon managed to catch in quad carrying off discoursed with concerning various systematic breach of discipline pointed out to that have already made such good use of time that if be to be discommonsed for three more day must lose term then took of cross gave book of virgil to write out gated for fortnight after hall drysdale sent out scout to order punishment a might have ordered waistcoat presented old copas with half sovereign then dismissed punishment gating from mind cultivated with great success science of mental gymnastics throwing everything least unpleasant off mind at once doubt be science worthy of cultivation if one desire to lead comfortable life get harder however a year roll over to attain to satisfactory proficiency in so must be mastered a early in life a may be town gown row be talk of college for next week tom of course talked much about like neighbor confided to one captain heresy be incredulous for one have ever heard talk a much in term a tom reported to have done on one evening so be resolved that must be taken to task on subject on first opportunity a nobody be afraid of there be difficulty in finding man to bell cat accordingly at next wine of boating set captain have scarcely entered when be assailed by host with jervis brown say believe gentleman can lick cad unless be biggest strongest of two captain who hated coming out with belief shrugged shoulder sipped wine tried to turn subject seeing that be bent on drawing out be not man to run from gun so said quietly more withstanding reverence in be held saying must not be allowed to pas dozen voice be instantly raised dozen authentic story told to confute listened patiently then seeing be in for said never mind fighting try something else cricket for instance player generally beat gentleman yes be professional well often get university crew can beat waterman professional again believe marker be best tennis player ai persevered captain generally find keeper huntsman shooting riding better than master be not fair case put be of men who have nothing else to do who live by thing gentleman only take up for pleasure only say that cad a call manage somehow to do best said captain how about army navy officer always lead well there be professional at rate said captain admit that officer lead men follow pretty close in forlorn hope there be fifty men to one officer after must be led men will never go without officer to lead be officer business to lead know do wo find best judge talking a if men wanted much leading read napier finest story in book be of sergeant who gave life for boy officer namesake brown at coa well never thought to hear cry down gentleman be not cry down gentleman said captain only say that gentleman flesh blood brain be just same better than man have chance on side in way of training pretty near prize so must be hard if did do most thing better than poor men give chance of training will tread on heel soon enough be say be certainly that captain said then relapsed into usual good tempered monosyllabic state from eager talk of men who took up cudgel naturally enough for own class talked before wine broke up into renewed consciousness of natural superiority failed again to rouse be in fact captain weak point if have one have strong belief one of strongest of be that nobody must be taught anything except by own experience so never very rarely exercised own personal influence just quietly went on own way let other men go theirs of belief be that there be man thing in world too bad to be tolerated faithfully acting up to belief captain tolerated person thing intolerable bearing fact in mind reader will easily guess result of application crew duly made to day after miller back be turned simply said that training proposed must not be enough that must take who chose to go down to abingdon twice week from time there be many defaulter spirit of diogenes groaned within a day after day crew have to be filled up from torpid by waterman drysdale must ride down to sandford meeting boat on way up then take place for pull up to oxford while groom rode horse up to folly bridge to meet there must mount again ride off to bullingdon to isi quentin other social meeting equally inimical to good training blake often absented three day in week other men once twice from considering fact tom came to understand difference between two hero strong likeness in many point have seen from first be alike in truthfulness bravery bodily strength in most of opinion jervis worried about nothing let men thing alone in belief that world be not going so very wrong must right somehow without hardy on other hand be consuming heart over everything seemed to to be going wrong in round about in college in oxford in england in end of earth never letting slip chance of trying to set right here thread there thread self questioning much enduring man slayer of dragon one with whom must not live much without getting uncomfortably aware of dragon also have to slay what wonder apart altogether from difference in social position one man be ever becoming more more popular while other be left more more to there be few of at oxford elsewhere who like to see man living brave righteous life so long a keep clear of still fewer who do like to be in constant contact with one who not content with so living be always coming across laying bare to own faint heartedness sloth meanness latter doubt inspires deeper feeling lay hold with firmer grip of men doe lay hold of be few for men ca always keep up to high pressure till have found firm ground to build upon altogether outside of be hard to be thankful fair to who be showing time after time that foothold be nothing shifting sand contrast between jervis hardy now began to force daily more more on hero attention from night of town gown row chough became regular haunt of crew who be taken there under guidance of tom drysdale next day not content with calling there on way from boat there be seldom evening now that tom did not manage to drop in spend hour there when one be very much bent on doing thing be generally easy enough to find very good reason excuse at rate for whenever doubt crossed tom mind silenced by reflection that time spent at chough must otherwise have be devoted to wine party billiards be not difficult to persuade that present occupation be more wholesome of two must not however feel satisfied till have mentioned change in life to hardy found much more embarrassing matter than fancied must be after one two false start managed to get out that have found best glass of ale in oxford at quiet little public on way to boat kept by most perfect of widow with factotum of ostler who be regular character that went there most evening for hour so must hardy come night hardy must spare time tom felt rather relieved at answer nevertheless went on to urge excellence of ale a further inducement believe be half so good a college beer will be bound be half a dear again only penny pint dearer said tom wo ruin crew go there if be captain said hardy must let run about drinking ale at night after wine party doe know about yes go there often on way from boat said tom at night too said hardy said tom go there after drinking wine have be to wine ten day at least not for more than five minute well sound ale be better than oxford wine said hardy if must drink something so subject dropped tom went away satisfied that hardy have not disapproved of new habit certainly occurred to that have omitted mention of pretty barmaid in enumeration of attraction of chough set down to mere accident be slip must set right in next talk that talk never came subject be not again mentioned between in fact to tell truth tom visit to friend room in evening became shorter le frequent a chough absorbed more more of time made excuse to that hardy must be glad of more time must be only bored if kept dropping in night now that examination for degree be so near that be sure drove grey away who must be of much more use to hardy just now many other equally plausible reason suggested whenever conscience smote for neglect a did not seldom always managed to satisfy somehow without admitting real fact that visit be no longer what have be to that gulf have sprung up be widening day by day between only friend who must have have courage honesty to tell truth about new pursuit meantime hardy be much pained at change in friend saw quickly enough often thought over with sigh a sat at solitary tea set down to own dullness to number of new friend such sociable fellow a tom be sure to make who of course must take up more more of time if felt little jealousy now then put resolutely back struggling to think evil if there be to lay on own shoulder cribbage be most virtuous respectable game yet scarcely one must think possessing in sufficient attraction to keep young gentleman in twentieth year tied to board going through quaint calculation night after night of fifteen two fifteen four two for nob one for heel old lady of chough liked nothing so much a game of cribbage in evening board lay ready on little table by elbow in cozy bar sure stepping stone to good grace tom somehow became enthusiast in cribbage must always loiter behind companion for quiet game chatting pleasantly while old lady cut shuffled dirty pack striving keenly for nightly stake of sixpence seldom failed to lose laughingly wrangling with over last point in game decided transfer of two sixpence duly posted in snuffer tray beside cribbage board into waistcoat pocket bag until must take off spectacle to wipe sink back in chair exhausted with pleasing excitement odd taste a seemed too bystander might reasonably have thought when might have be employing time so much more pleasantly in very room for flitting in out of bar during game now then stooping over old lady shoulder to examine hand exchange knowing look with be lithe little figure of miss patty with oval race merry eye bright brown hair jaunty little cap with fresh blue ribbon of shade of st ambrose color however there be accounting for taste be fortunate that like apple onion may possibly be too miss patty did not feel neglected did not care about attention perhaps may not have be altogether unconscious that least motion word of hers be noticed even when game be at keenest at rate be clear enough that tom be on best term though always took aunt part vehemently in little dispute arose sometimes even came to rescue at end recaptured vanished sixpence out of wrongful grasp generally laid on moment old lady held out hand pronounced word game one know that size have little to do with strength one might have wondered that little hand must have be able to open finger so surely one by one though seemed to do must to keep shut after if really thought have right to money have always time to put in pocket at once instead of keeping clenched hand on table arguing about till have time to get up to succour of aunt chapter xiii first bump what be time smith half past three old fellow answered diogenes looking at watch never knew day go so slowly said tom be time to go down to boat not by two hour more old fellow ca take book something to keep quiet wo be fit for anything by six o'clock if go on worrying like so diogenes turned to flute blew away to appearance a composedly a if have be first week of term though if truth must be told be must to get up wander about in feverish distracted state for tom restlessness infected diogenes whole heart be in college boat so though have pulled dozen of race in time be almost a nervous a freshman on first day of race tom unconscious of secret discomposure of other threw into chair looked at with wonder envy flute went toot toot toot till must stand no longer so got up went to window leaning out looked up down street for minute in purposeless sort of fashion staring hard at everybody everything unconscious time that be doing so must not have be able in fact to answer diogenes word have not that worthy inquired of what have seen when presently drew in head returned to fidgety ramblings about room how hot sun be there be stiff breeze from south east hope will go down before evening yes wind will make very rough below gut mind feather high now at starting hope to goodness sha' catch crab said tom think about old fellow be best plan ca think of anything else said tom what deuce be good of telling fellow not to think about diogenes apparently have nothing particular to reply for put flute to mouth again at sound of toot toot tom caught up gown fled into quadrangle crew have have early dinner of steak chop stale bread glass half of old beer piece at two o'clock in captain room current theory of training at time be a much meat a must eat more underdone better smallest amount of drink upon must manage to live two pint in twenty four hour be that most boat crew pretended to train at be allowed for last fortnight have be nominal allowance of st ambrose crew discomfort of such diet in hot summer month when be at same time taking regular violent exercise be something very serious outraged human nature rebelled against though did not admit in public there be very few men who did not rush to water bottle for relief more le often according to development of bump of conscientiousness obstinacy to keep to diet at strictly involved very respectable amount of physical endurance successor have found out unwisdom of a of other old superstition in order to get man into training for boat race now day be not of first importance to keep in constant state of consuming thirst restlessness of body sharpness of temper thirst generally induces tom appreciated honor of being in boat in first year so keenly that have almost managed to keep to training allowance consequently now that eventful day have arrived be in most uncomfortable frame of body disagreeable frame of mind fled away from diogenes flute found rest tried drysdale that hero be lying on back on sofa playing with jack only increased tom thirst soured temper by viciousness of remark on boating everything person connected therewith above on miller who have just come up have steered day before pronounced crew generally drysdale in particular not trained blake oak be sported a usual tom looked in at captain door found hard at work reading so carried off after vain hunt after others of crew even trying to sit down read first novel then play of shakespeare with success wandered away out of college found in five minute by natural irresistible attraction on university barge there be dozen men so reading paper group two discussing coming race amongst other thing chance of st ambrose making bump first night be weighed one joining in praising stroke there be great doubt whether crew must live up to tom carried on to top of barge to get out of hearing for listening made heart beat throat drier than ever stood on top looked right away down to gut strong wind blowing gown about not even pair oar be to be seen great event of evening made river solitude at time of day only one two skiff be coming home impelled by reading men who took constitutional on water be coming in to be in time for afternoon chapel fastest best of soon came near enough for tom to recognize hardy stroke so left barge went down to meet servitor at landing accompanied to st ambrose dressing room well how do feel for race to night said hardy a dried neck face have be sluicing with cold water looking a hardy bright a racer on derby day oh wretched be afraid will break down said tom pouring out of doubt misery hardy soon comforted greatly by time be half across christchurch meadow be quite in heart again for knew how well hardy understood rowing what sound judge be be therefore cheering to hear that thought be certainly second best if not best boat on river that must be sure to make bump unless have accident be just what fear so said tom be afraid will make awful blunder not said only remember fancy can pull boat by go to trying to do there be where young oar fail if keep thorough good time will be pretty sure to be doing share of work time be everything almost will be sure to think of said tom entered st ambrose just a chapel bell be going down went to chapel then to hall sitting by talking for companionship while rest dined so at last time slipped away captain miller mustered at gate walked off to boat dozen other crew be making way in same direction undergraduate of oxford streamed along with bank of river be crowded punt plied rapidly backwards forward carrying load of men over to berkshire side university barge other barge be decked with flag band be playing lively air a st ambrose crew reached scene of action time be lost in dressing room in two minute be standing in flannel trouser silk jersey at landing place have better keep jacket on

dear fellow be moonshine must settle matter with philosopher only apply universal law to particular case tom unconscious of pearl of economic lore be being poured out for benefit of crew be watching exeter eight a glided away towards cherwell thought seemed to keep horribly good time halloa drysdale look there be jack going across in one of punt of course be suppose must go down to see race why wo miller let start almost boat be off there be plenty of time may just a well be up here a dawdling about bank at iffley sha' go down till last miller never let get out down below well come here be

in way other obstruction swung steadily down past university barge top of be already covered with spectator man in boat felt a if eye of europe be on pulled in very best form small group of gownsmen be scattered along bank in christchurch meadow chiefly don who be really interested in race at time of day seldom liked to display enthusiasm enough to cross water go down to starting place sombre group lighted up here there by dress of few lady who be walking up down watching boat at mouth of cherwell be moored two punt in reclined at ease dozen young gentleman smoking several of be friend of drysdale hailed a boat passed what fool be to be here grumbled in undertone casting envious glance at punt in comfortable berth up under bank out of wind say brown wish be well past on way up silence in bow shouted miller devil how hate growled drysdale half in jest half in a sped along under willow tom got more comfortable at stroke by time reached gut began to hope that must not have fit lose strength just at start cut crab come to other unutterable grief fear of have be haunting day here be at last come along now keep up with said hardy to grey a boat neared gut two trotted along downwards hardy watching crew grey watching hardy how eager look 'd give twenty pound to be going to pull in race grey shambled on in silence by side of big friend wished must understand what be that moved so a boat shot into gut from under cover of oxfordshire bank wind caught bow feather high now shouted miller then added in low voice to captain will be ticklish work starting in wind just a bad for other boat answered captain well said old philosopher said miller be comfort to steer never make fellow nervous wonder if ever felt nervous now ca say said captain here be post may a well turn

evening hero be at door of hardy room just stopped for one moment outside with hand on lock looking little puzzled withal pleased then opened door entered little estrangement there have be between for week have passed away since race have begun hardy have thrown into spirit of so thoroughly that have not only regained hold on tom have warmed up whole crew in favour have mollified martinet miller be who have managed starting rope in race voice from towing path have come to be looked upon a safe guide for clapping on rowing steady even miller autocrat a be have come to listen for in confirmation of own judgment before calling on crew for final effort so tom have recovered old footing in servitor room when entered on night in question did so with bearing of intimate friend hardy tea common be on one end of table a usual be sitting at other poring over book tom marched straight up to leant over shoulder what here be at perpetual grind said come shut up give tea want to talk to hardy looked

out of wretched classic have good mind to clear out not to do errand what be man to do said hardy hold that be always better to laugh at fortune what be use of repining have done famously second be capital place on river second be hanged said tom mean to be first well hope may said hardy can tell nobody felt more than not even old diogenes when did make bump to night now talk like man saint ambrosian said tom what do think will ever catch so saying retired to chair opposite tea thing said hardy think ever will be very sorry to say be uncommonly strong lot have weak place two in crew think can do more than did to night at least with present crew if must get little more strength might yes think so jervis stroke be worth two of very little more powder must do then must have little more powder ay how be to get who can put in said tom sitting up there now be just what be come about drysdale be to go out will pull next race want to row do said hardy quietly tom must see that eye sparkled at notion though be too proud to show how much be pleased then have better come ask well cantankerous old party be coming can tell said tom in great delight captain just sent to break ground will be here directly say now hardy went on say have set heart upon be sure will bump if pull know said hardy getting up beginning to make tea to conceal excitement be in at idea of rowing see be not in training gammon said tom be always in training know well said hardy ca be in worse than drysdale have be of use above gut last three night be just what miller say said tom here come captain there be knock at door while spoke jervis miller entered tom be in dreadful fidget for next twenty minute may best be compared to enthusiastic envoy negotiating treaty suddenly finding action impeded by arrival of principal miller be very civil not pressing seemed to have come more with view of talking over present state of thing consulting upon than to enlisting recruit hardy met more than halfway speculated on sort of possible issue without hint of volunteering presently jervis who did not understand finessing broke in asked hardy point blank to pull in next race when pleaded want of training overruled at once by saying that there be better training than sculling so in hour be settled hardy be to pull five in next race diogenes be to take blake place at blake to take drysdale oar at whole crew be to go for long training walk next day sunday in afternoon to go down to abingdon on monday just to get into swing in new place then on tuesday to abide fate of war have hour pleasant talk over hardy tea then separated always told be man said captain to miller a walked together to gate want strength be a strong a horse must have seen sculling there be match on river to mind yes think will do replied miller at rate ca be worse than drysdale a for tom hardy may safely be said that two men in oxford went to bed in better spirit saturday night than two now to explain how came about hardy be wanted fortune have smiled upon st ambrosians in two race succeeded one in have bumped exeter have risen two more place without very great trouble of course constituency on bank magnified power doings there never be such crew be quite safe to be head of river nothing must live against pace so young oar in boat swallowed heard thought finest fellow going took le le pain to keep up condition when got out of earshot of jervis diogenes be ready to bet two to one that must bump oriel next night keep easily head of river for rest of race saturday night came brought with most useful though unpalatable lesson to st ambrosians oriel boat be manned chiefly by old oar seasoned in many race not liable to panic when hard pressed have fair though not first rate stroke good coxswain expert remarked that be rather too heavy for boat that dipped little when put on anything like severe spurt on whole be by mean sort of crew must just run into hand over hand so miller diogenes preached so ambrosians found out to cost have pace of other boat gained a usual boat length before gut first two fatal corner be passed then other well remembered spot where former bump have be made still miller made sign on contrary looked gloomy savage st ambrosian shout from shore too changed from usual exultant peal into something like quaver of consternation while air be rent with name laudations of little oriel long before cherwell drysdale be completely baked have played truant day before dined at weir be have imbibed much dubious hock from old habit managed to keep time tom other young oar got flurried quickened boat dragged there be life left in though managed just to hold first advantage must not put foot nearer stern of oriel boat glided past winning post clear boat length ahead of pursuer with crew much le depressed such race must tell on stroke even jervis who have pulled magnificently throughout be very much done at close leant over oar with swimming in head approach to faintness be scarcely able to see for minute so miller indignation knew bound bottled up till have manoeuvered crew into dressing room by jervis having stopped below then did not spare must kill captain whose little finger be worth whole of be disgracing college three four of have heart head pluck felt that be unjust for after have not brought boat up to second place poor diogenes sat in corner groaned forgot to prefix old fellow to few observation made blake have great difficulty in adjusting necktie before glass merely remarked in pause of objurgation in faith coxswain be very bitter word tom most of others be too much out of heart to resist at last drysdale fired up have right to be so savage that can see said suddenly stopping low whistle in be indulging a sat on corner of table seem to think weakest out of several weak place in boat yes do said miller then honourable member said drysdale getting off table seeing that humble effort be unappreciated think best for public service to place resignation in hand of coxswainship coxswainship be graciously pleased to accept replied miller hurrah for roomy punt soft cushion next racing night be almost worth while to have be rowing time to realize sensation will feel when see fellow passing cherwell on tuesday suave est be what be partial to mari mango in last reach terra from towing path alterius magnum spectare laborem to witness torture of wretched beggar in boat be obliged to translate for drysdale who never learned latin said blake finishing tie before glass there be awkward silence miller be chafing inwardly running over in mind what be to be done nobody else seemed quite to know what ought to happen next when door opened jervis came in congratulate captain said drysdale be well out of at last jervis pished pshaw 'd little at hearing what have happened presence acted like oil on water moment resignation be named tom thought have turned to hardy now be time have such confidence in man that idea of getting in for next race entirely changed aspect of affair to made feel a bumptious again a have done in morning so with idea in head hung about till captain have made toilet joined to miller a walked up well what be going to do now said captain be just what have to settle said miller have be up term know men pulling better than suppose must press somebody from torpid let see there be burton roll like porpoise interrupted miller positively impossible stewart might do then never kept time for three stroke in life said miller well there be better men said captain then may lay account to stopping where be if even lose place said miller dust unto dust what must be must if ca get crumb 'd best eat crust said captain be very well talking coolly now said miller will kill trying to bump there be three more night hardy must row if asked be sure said tom captain looked at miller who shook head think said take to be shy bird wo come to everybody whistle might have have two year ago believe wish have always told so said jervis at rate let try can say think will for see have be at starting place night a keen a freshman time be sure wo said tom know must give anything to pull have better go to room sound said captain miller will follow in hour have already heard how tom mission prospered next day at few moment before two o'clock st ambrose crew including hardy with miller who be desperate indefatigable pedestrian for leader crossed magdalen bridge at five returned to college having done little over fifteen mile fair heal toe walking in interval afternoon have be very hot miller chuckled to captain think there will be much trash left in of after that fellow hardy be a fine a race horse did see never turned hair way crew dispersed to room delighted with performance now that be over feeling that be much better for though declared have be harder work than race have yet pulled must have done trainer heart good to have seen twenty minute afterwards dropping into hall where be allowed to dine on sunday on joint fresh from cold bath looking ruddy clear hard enough for anything again on monday not chance be lost st ambrose boat started soon after one o'clock for abingdon swung steadily down whole way back again to sandford without single spurt miller generally standing in stern preaching above thing steadiness time from sandford up be accompanied by dozen men so who ran up bank watching struggle for first place on river be creating great excitement in rowing world be of most keen connoisseur who having heard st ambrose have changed man be on look out to satisfy a to how must work general opinion be veering round in favor of oriel change so late in race at critical moment be looked upon a very damaging foremost amongst runner on bank be wiry dark man with sanguine complexion who went with peculiar long low stride keeping keen eye well on boat just above kennington island jervis noticing particular spectator for first time called on crew quickening stroke took up reach at racing pace a lay in iffley lock dark man appeared above exchanged few word great deal of dumb show with captain miller then disappeared from iffley up went steadily again on whole miller seemed to be in very good spirit in dressing room thought boat trimmed better went better than have ever done before complimented blake particularly for ease with have changed side went up in high spirit calling on way at chough for one glass of old ale round miller be graciously pleased to allow tom never remembered till be out again that hardy have never be there before felt embarrassed for moment soon passed off moderate dinner early to bed finished day miller be justified in parting remark to captain well if win can comfort ourselves that hav' dropped stitch last two day at rate then eventful day arose tom many others felt be to make mar st ambrose be glorious early summer day without cloud scarcely breath of air stirring will have fair start at rate be general feeling have already seen what throat drying nervous business morning of race day be must not go over same ground more than can help so will imagine st ambrose boat down at starting place lying close to towing path just before first gun there be much greater crowd than usual opposite two first boat by time most of other boat have found place for there be not much chance of anything very exciting down below so besides men of oriel st ambrose who muster to night of sort fastest of fast slowest of slow having be by time shamed into something like enthusiasm many of other college whose boat have chance of bumping being bumped flock to point of attraction do make out what change be say backer of oriel to friend in like predicament yes have got see by george like look answered friend awfully long strong in arm well ribbed up devilish awkward customer will go try to get hedge pooh say other did ever know one man win race ay have say friend walk off toward oriel crowd to take five to four on oriel in half sovereign if can get now dark friend of yesterday come up at trot pull up close to captain with whom be evidently dear friend be worth looking at being coxswain of o u b best steerer runner swimmer in oxford amphibious sprung from amphibious race own boat be in danger so have left to take care of herself be on look out for recruit for university crew recruiting sergeant have sharper eye for sort of stuff requires what be name say in low tone to jervis giving jerk with head towards hardy where did get hardy answer captain in same tone be first night in boat know that reply coxswain never saw row before yesterday be fellow who scull in brown skiff be yes think will do keep eye on coxswain nod a if be somewhat of same mind examines hardy with eye of connoisseur pretty much a judge at agricultural show look at prize bull hardy be tightening strop of stretcher unconscious of compliment be being paid great authority seems satisfied with inspection grin rub hand trot off to oriel boat to make comparison just a first gun be heard grey sidles nervously to front of crowd a if be doing something very audacious draw hardy attention exchanging sympathizing nod with saying nothing for know not what to say then disappearing again in crowd hallo drysdale be that say blake a push off from shore thought be going to take easy in punt so thought say drysdale must keep away here be will run up mind if see within ten foot cock sure to win will give view holloa will be bound will hear may come speedily said blake then settled in seat eye in boat mind now steady watch stroke quicken be miller last word faculty of crew being now devoted to getting good start be difficult matter a water be like glass boat lie lightly on obeying slightest dip of oar of bow two who just feel water twice thrice in last minute then after few moment of breathless hush on bank last gun be fired be off same scene of mad excitement ensues only tenfold more intense a almost whole interest of race be tonight concentrated on two head boat fate at gate there be jam weaker vessel be shoved into ditch upset left unnoticed most active men including o u b coxswain shun gate altogether take big ditch in stride making for long bridge that may get quietly over be safe for best part of race know that critical point of struggle will be near finish boat made beautiful start again a before in first dash st ambrose pace tell gain boat length before first wind fail then settle down for long steady effort crew be rowing comparatively steady reserving for tug of war up above thus pas gut two treacherous corner scene of countless bump into wider water beyond up under willow miller face be decidedly hopeful show sign indeed can see that be not same man a be at place in last race feel that to day boat be full of life that can call on crew with hope of answer well trained eye also detects that while crew be at full stretch own instead of losing a did on last night be now gaining inch by inch on oriel gain be scarcely perceptible to even from bank be quite imperceptible there be be surer surer of a one after willow be left behind now come pinch oriel captain be beginning to be conscious of fact have be dawning on miller will not acknowledge to a coxswain turn boat head gently across stream make for berkshire side goal now full in view smile grimly a quickens stroke will shake off light heeled gentry yet a did before miller see move in moment signal captain next stroke st ambrose have quickened also now there be mistake about st ambrose be creeping up slowly surely boat length lessens to forty foot thirty foot surely steadily lessens race be not lost yet thirty foot be short space enough to look at on water good bit to pick up foot by foot in last two three hundred yard of desperate struggle be over under berkshire side now there stand up winning post close ahead won distance lessens lessens still oriel crew stick steadily gallantly to work will fight inch of distance to last oriel men on bank who be rushing along sometimes in water sometimes out hoarse furious madly alternating between hope despair have reason to be ashamed of man in crew off mouth of cherwell there be still twenty foot between minute will be over one way man in crew be now doing best mistake tell boat hold most men who can do better than best at pinch who will risk broken blood vessel will tell how will end hard pounding gentleman let see who will pound longest duke be reported to have said at waterloo won now tommy lad 't be thou big ben said a came up to last round of hardest fight won be there man of temper in crew tonight if so now be time for coxswain have called on men for last effort miller be whirling tassel of right hand tiller rope round head like wiry little lunatic from towing path from christchurch meadow from row of punt from clustered top of barge come roar of encouragement applause band unable to resist impulse break with crash into jolly young waterman playing two bar to second bump in gut be nothing few partisan on towing path to cheer already out of breath up here at very finish with oxford looking on when prize be headship of river once in generation only do men get such chance who ever saw jervis not up to work st ambrose stroke be glorious tom have atom of go still left in very back of head at moment heard drysdale view holloa above din seemed to give lift other men besides in boat for in six stroke gap be lessened st ambrose have crept up to ten foot now to five from stern of oriel week afterwards hardy confided to tom when heard that view holloa seemed to feel muscle of arm leg turn into steel did more work in last twenty stroke than in other forty in earlier part of race fifty yard oriel be safe look on captain face be so ominous that coxswain glance over shoulder bow of st ambrose be within two foot of rudder be moment for desperate expedient pull left tiller rope suddenly thereby carrying stern of own boat out of line of st ambrose call on crew once more respond gallantly yet rudder be against for moment boat drag st ambrose overlap bump bump shout st ambrosians on shore row on row on scream miller have not yet felt electric shock know will miss bump if young one slacken for moment young coxswain must have gone on making shot at stern of oriel boat so have lost bump now mistake bow of st ambrose boat jam oar of oriel stroke two boat pas winning post with way be on when bump be made so near shave be who can describe scene on bank be hurly burly of delirious joy in midst of took place terrific combat between jack oriel dog noble black bull terrier belonging to college in general one in particular who always attended race felt misfortune keenly luckily be parted without worse thing happening for though oriel men be savage not disinclined for jostle milk of human kindness be too strong for moment in adversary so jack be choked off with trouble oriel men extricated from crowd carrying off crib dog looking straight before into vacancy well rowed boy say jervis turning round to crew a lay panting on oar well rowed five say miller who even in hour of such triumph be not inclined to be general in laudation well rowed five be echoed from bank be that cunning man recruiting sergeant fatally well rowed add to comrade with whom get into one of punt to cross to christchurch meadow must have in university crew think will get to row from what hear answer other then must handcuffed carried into boat by force say o u b coxswain why be not pressgang institution in university chapter xv storm brew break certainly drysdale character came out well that night did not seem least jealous of success have be achieved through dismissal on contrary there be man in college who showed more interest in race joy at result then perhaps pleasure of being out of may have reckoned for something with in case there be at door with jack to meet crew a landed after race with large pewter foaming with shandygaff in hand for recreation draco must not have forbidden to drink at moment so amidst shaking of hand clapping on back pewter travelled round from stroke to bow then crew went off to dressing room accompanied by drysdale others bravo be finest race have be seen on river six year everybody say so fellow have deserved well of country have sent up to college to have supper in room must come hang training there be only two more night be safe to keep place what do say captain eh miller now be good natured for once well get head of river night said miller object if will turn out go to bed at eleven be right said drysdale now let go to old have glass of ale while supper be getting ready eh brown hooked arm into tom led way into town be so sorry be not in for finish said tom who be quite touched by friend good humour be said drysdale be more than be then can tell if must have seen under willow must have thought much of object of envy jack be quite satisfied with share of work glory on bank be old fellow at salutation jack reared on hind leg licked master hand well be real good fellow for taking a do think must have come near river if have be take everything a come said drysdale next race be on derby day must have gone if have be turned out of boat be compensation see here be wonder if miss patty have heard of victory turned down little passage entrance of chough a spoke followed by most of crew by tail of younger st ambrosians admirer bar be crowded next moment patty be there of course service be in great requisition for though of crew only took small glass of old ale made a much fuss about with pretty barmaid a if be drinking hogshead in fact have become clearly correct thing with st ambrosians to make much of patty considering circumstance be only wonder that be not more spoiled than seemed to be case indeed a hardy stood up in corner opposite to landlady chair silent onlooker at scene must help admitting to that girl held own well without doing saying anything unbecoming modest woman be hard thing for to be fair to for what saw now in few minute confirmed impression former visit have left on mind that friend be safe in toil how deeply of course must not judge that there be more between than must approve be now clear enough to stood silent leaning against wall in farthest corner in shadow of projecting cupboard much distressed in mind pondering over what behove to do under circumstance with exception of civil sentence two to old landlady who sat opposite knitting casting rather uneasy look from time to time towards front of bar spoke to one in fact nobody came near end of room existence seemed to have be forgotten by rest tom have be little uncomfortable for first minute after seeing hardy take glass of ale then missing forgot about be too busy with own affair to trouble further have become sort of drawer barman at cloughs presided under patty over distribution of ale giving eye to chief to see that be not put upon drysdale jack left after short stay to see that supper be being properly prepared soon afterwards patty went off out of bar in answer to bell called to part of house st ambrosians voted that be time to go off to college to supper cleared out into street tom went out with last batch of lingered moment in passage outside knew house way well enough by time next moment patty appeared from side door led to part of house so be not going to stay play game with aunt said what make in hurry must go up to college there be supper to celebrate getting head

pay for anyhow said why need tell what followed there be little struggle go along do mr brown next minute tom minus handkerchief be hurrying after companion patty be watching from door setting cap to right then turned went back into bar started turned red a saw hardy there still standing in further corner opposite aunt finished glass of ale a came in then passed out wishing good night why aunt

house though be very good customer tom minus handkerchief hurried after comrade caught up before got to college be there hardy whose absence vexed hero for moment have hoped that hardy now that be in boat must have shaken off reserve towards other men blamed because have not done so at once there must be reason for own oddness thought for everyone be full of praise a strolled on talking of race miller praised style time pluck did feel how boat sprung when called on at cherwell said to captain drysdale be always dead beat at gut just like log in boat pretty much like of rest of be in such good training too said diogenes will find out how diet have pretty well done with must hope said there be only two more night nothing can touch now be too sure of said miller mind now of let have nonsense till race be over be safe so talked on till reached college then dispersed to room to wash dress met again in drysdale room where supper be awaiting again hardy did not appear drysdale sent scout to room who brought back word that must not find so drysdale set to work to do honor of table enjoyed pleasure of tempting crew with sort of forbidden hot liquor rest of non professional imbibed freely with miller eye on example of diogenes captain before rest of crew exercised abstemiousness must have be admirable have not be in great measure compulsory be great success supper at drysdale although knocked up at hour notice triumph of boat have for time effect of warming up drawing out feeling of fellowship be soul of college life though only few men besides crew sat down to supper long before be cleared away men of set in college came in in highest spirit room be crowded for drysdale sent round to man in college with whom have speaking acquaintance flocked in sat where must men talked laughed with neighbor with whom perhaps have never exchanged word since time when be freshman together of course there be speech cheered to echo song of chorus might have be heard in high street at little before eleven nevertheless despite protestation of drysdale passive resistance of several of number miller carried off crew many of other guest went at same time leaving host small circle to make night of went to room in high spirit humming air of one of song have just heard have scarcely thrown gown on chair when thought struck ran down stair again across to hardy room hardy be sitting with cold tea poured out untasted before book open very unusual thing with at night tom either did not must not notice that there be anything unusual seated began gossiping away a fast a must without looking much at other began by recounting complimentary thing have be said by miller others of hardy pulling then went on to supper party what jolly evening have have did not remember anything so pleasant since have be up retailed speech named best song really ought to have be there why did come drysdale sent over for be sure one wished have be there did get message did feel up to going said there be nothing matter eh said tom a thought crossed mind that perhaps hardy have hurt in race a have not be regularly training nothing answered other tom tried to make play again soon came to end of talk be impossible to make head against cold silence at last stopped looked at hardy for minute who be staring abstractedly at sword over mantel piece then said there be something matter though sit glowering a if have swallowed furze bush why have be smoking old boy added getting up putting hand on others shoulder see be here take one of weed be mild miller allows two of day thank'ee said hardy rousing miller have interfered with smoking will have pipe for think want well see that doe good said tom after watching fill light smoke for minute without saying word here have managed one thing have at heart be in crew be head of river everybody be praising rowing up to sky saying that bump be doing here come to tell not word can get out of ai pleased do think will keep place paused

to neck wrist small silk neckkerchief put on like shawl thin almost gaunt old woman whom year have not used tenderly who showed mark of usage resolute high couraged soul who have met hard time in face must meet again if need be spoke in broad berkshire be otherwise homely body self possessed without shade of real vulgarity in composition widow looked with anxiety at harry a took seat although something of rustic dandy of late have not be so careful in matter of dress a usual in consequence of reproach on sunday there be nothing to complain of black velveteen shooting coat cotton plush waistcoat brown corduroy knee breech gaiter sat on well gave world assurance of well to do man for few of englebourn labourer rose above smock frock fustian trouser wore blue bird eye handkerchief round neck shirt though coarse in texture be a white a sun best laundress in englebourn must manage to bleach there be nothing to find fault with in dress therefore still mother did not feel quite comfortable a took stealthy glance at harry be naturally reserved fellow did not make much conversation mother felt little embarrassed on particular morning be not therefore until dame winburn have finished first slice of bread butter have sipped greater part of second dish of tea out of saucer that broke silence minded thy business last night harry when wur up at rectory about washin be belief a thou'lt get t'other 'lotment next quarter day doctor spoke very kind about said a how heer a high character o ' thee young a thee bist a of be ' man in parish a how wur set on lettin ' lot to thaay

scriptur say a to will be given will have more abundant dame winburn spoke hesitatingly looked doubtfully at harry a person who have shot with strange gun know not what effect bolt may have harry be brought up standing by unexpected quotation of mother after thinking for few moment while cut slice of bread replied say a will have more ca use what have got already be deal more like vineyard for aught a can see 't be little odds to way go how canst talk so harry said mother reproachfully thou knowbet thou wast set on last fall like wasp on sugar why scarce day past thou wast up to rectory to see doctor about now thou'rt like to get th'lotment thou'lt not go anyst harry looked out at open door without answering be quite true that in last autumn have be very anxious to get a large allotment a must into own hand that have be for ever up towards rectory perhaps not always on allotment business be naturally self reliant shrewd fellow felt that if must put hand on three four acre of land must soon make independent of farmer knew that at harvest time whenever there be pinch for good labourer must be glad enough to have while at other time with few acre of own must be own master must do much better for so have put name down first on doctor list taken largest lot must get worked so well that crop amongst others have be sort of village show last harvest time many of neighboring allotment stood out in sad contrast to of harry more energetic of peasantry lay by side of latter only half worked full of weed rent be never ready be worse than useless to let matter go on thus question arose what be to be done with neglected lot harry men like applied at once for eagerness to get have roused natural jealousy amongst farmer who began to foresee that new system might shortly leave with none worst labourer so vestry have pressed on doctor a dame winburn said not to let man have more than acre acre half well meaning easy going invalid old man must make up mind what to do so here be may again neglected lot be still in nominal occupation of idler doctor got rent be annoyed at partial failure of scheme have not indeed originated for have taken much credit to negligent

now for to do more than clean lot of weed year farmer grumbled that be always understood that man must have more than one lot poor rector have led flock into miry place with vengeance people who can not make up mind breed trouble in other place besides country village however quiet out of way place may be there be always quasi public topic stand to rural englishman in place of treaty budget reform bill so great allotment question for time be that exercised mind of inhabitant of englebourn until lately one have taken keener interest in than harry winburn that interest have now much abated so harry looked through cottage door instead of answering mother 't be belief a med amost hev for axin dame winburn began again when found that must not re open subject young missus said a much to last night ah to be sure thing 'd go better if have guidin on 'em be not going after more mother can keep bit o ' stick here together without while be alive if anything be to happen to think must stay

thy head act bit measterful more thow makest o ' more like thou art to win did hear aught of last night mother replied harry taking advantage of ungracious opening to speak of subject be uppermost in

eye full of pride love so harry who be right good son began to inquire what be be specially weighing on mother mind determined to do anything in reason to re place on little harmless social pinnacle from be wont to look down on other mother son of parish soon found out that present grievance arose from having neglected place a ringer of heavy bell in village peal on two preceding sunday a post be in sort corresponding one to stroke of boat at oxford anxiety be reasonable enough so harry promised to go to ringing in good time that morning then set about little odds end of job till must be time to start dame went to cooking other household duty be pretty well got under when son took hat started for belfry stood at door with half peeled potato in one hand shading eye with other a watched

side of be two three young woman who sang treble shrill ear piercing treble with strong nasal berkshire drawl in on other side of musician sat blacksmith wheelwright other tradesman of place tradesman mean in part of country what mean by artisan be naturally allied with laborer consorted with so far a church going be concerned formed sort of independent opposition sitting in gallery instead of in nave where farmer two three principal shopkeeper great landed commercial interest regularly sat slept where two publican occupied pew seldom made even pretence of worshipping rest of gallery be filled by able bodied male peasantry old worn out men generally sat below in free seat woman also few boy heart of latter be in gallery seat on back bench of be sign that have indued toga virilis be thenceforth free from maternal pastoral tutelage in matter of church going gallery thus constituted have gradually usurped psalmody a particular special portion of service left clerk school child aided by such of aristocracy below a cared to join to do response when singing time came reigned supreme slate on psalm be announced be hung out from before centre of gallery clerk leaving place under reading desk marched up there to give out took method of preserving constitutional connection with singing knowing otherwise must not have maintained rightful position of office in matter so matter have stood until shortly before time of story present curate however backed by miss winter have tried reform be quiet man with wife several child small mean have served in diocese ever since have be ordained in hum drum sort of way going where be sent for performing routine duty reasonably well without showing great aptitude for work have little interest have almost given up expecting promotion

therefore in concert with miss winter have begun to train child in church music small organ have stood in passage in rectory for many year have be repaired appeared first at schoolroom at length under gallery of church be announced one week to party in possession that on next sunday constituted authority must take church music into own hand then arose strife end of have nearly be to send gallery off in body headed by offended bass viol to small red brick little bethel at other end of village fortunately curate have too much good sense to drive matter to extremity so alienate parish constable large part of flock though have not tact energy enough to bring round to own view so compromise be come to curate choir be allowed to chant psalm canticle have always be read before while gallery remained triumphant master of regular psalm reader will now understand why miss winter salutation to musical constable be not so cordial a be to other villager whom have come across previously indeed miss winter though acknowledged constable salutation did not seem inclined to encourage to accompany talk mind out although be going same way with instead of drawing out a be wont in such case went on talking to cousin little man walked out in road evidently in trouble of mind did not like to drop behind go ahead without further remark from miss winter yet must not screw up courage to point of opening conversation so ambled on alongside footpath on be walking showing discomfort by twist of neck few second perpetual shifting of bass viol hunching up of one shoulder conversation of young lady under circumstance be of course forced miss mary though infinitely delighted at meeting soon began to pity involuntary companion be full of sensitive instinct best sort of woman have to marvellous extent tell at once infallibly if one in company have even creased rose leaf next moral skin before have walked hundred yard be interceding for rebellious constable katie said softly in french do speak to poor man be frightfully uncomfortable serf right answered miss winter in same language know how impertinent be other day to mr walker wo give way on least point lead rest of old singer make a stubborn a look how be winking jerking head at really must be so cruel to katie will have to begin talking to if thus urged miss winter opened conversation by asking after wife when have ascertained that missus wur pretty middlin made other commonplace remark relapsed into silence by help of mary however sort of disjointed dialogue be kept up till came to gate led up to school into child be trooping by two three here lady turned in be going up walk towards school door when constable summoned up courage to speak on matter be troubling resting bass viol carefully on right foot calling out after oh please marm miss winter well said quietly turning round what do wish to say why please mann hope a think be way unked 'bout here quire singin ' a call be sartin know a there ai amost nothing

church to be sure ool 'taint a want new fangled tune a sings be aal owld one a have ' be used in church ever since can mind only choose thaay a like out o ' book be ready to kep to thaay think mr

why look grave there never be such hard parish to manage nobody will do what ought never can get to do anything perhaps may manage to teach child better be only comfort katie dear what do poor thing sing psalm hope oh yes choose odd one on purpose believe class will take so young lady settled to teaching child in class fell in love with mary before church time bass viol proceeded to church did usual rehearsal gossiped with sexton to whom confided fact that young missus be terrible vexed bell soon began to ring widow winburn heart be glad a listened to full peal thought to herself that be harry who be making so much noise in world speaking to neighborhood then peal ceased a church time drew near single bell began congregation came flocking in from side farmer letting wife child enter

before house on lawn on warm day be one of daughter greatest trouble little choir of child sang admirably led by schoolmistress miss winter curate exchanged approving glance performed liveliest chant in collection that opposition might have cause to complain of want of joyfulness in turn miss winter be in hope that out of deference to usual rule of selection in gallery might have be modified be with small annoyance therefore after litany be over tuning finished heard clerk give out that must praise god by singing part of ninety first psalm mary who be on tiptoe of expectation a to what be coming saw curate give slight shrug with shoulder lift of eyebrow a left reading desk in minute became painful effort for to keep from laughing a slyly watched cousin face while gallery sang with vigour worthy of cause occasion on old lion will go adder fell long on young lion tread also with dragon stout strong treble took up last line repeated with dragon stout strong then whole strength of gallery chorused again with dra gons stout strong bass viol seemed to to prolong note to gloat over a droned out looking triumphantly at distant curate mary be thankful to kneel down to compose face

what be be not ill said quickly quite well aunt say did see then fact be have gone home chapter xxiii englebourn constable on afternoon of splendid day in early part of june four five day after sunday on morning service at englebourn be interrupted by fire at farmer grove david johnson tailor constable of parish be sitting at work in small erection half shed half summer house leaned against back of cottage not that david have not regular workshop with window looking into village street regular counter close under on passersby might see stitching from must gossip with easily a be wont although constable kept king peace made garment of kind for livelihood from curate frock down to ploughboy fustian be addicted for pleasure solace to keeping of bee constable bee inhabited row of hive in narrow strip of garden ran away at back of cottage strip of garden be bordered along whole of one side by rector premise now honest david loved gossip well considered part of duty a constable to be well up in event rumour happened arose within liberty loved bee better than gossip a be now in hourly expectation that must be swarming be working a have be said in summer house that might be at hand at critical moment rough table on be seated commanded view of hive big scissors shred of velveteen lay near on table also street door key old shovel of us will appear presently on knee lay black velveteen coat sunday garment of harry winburn to be fitting new sleeve in exertion at top of chimney in putting out fire harry have grievously damaged garment in question farmer have presented with five shilling on occasion sum be quite inadequate to purchase of new coat harry being too proud to call farmer attention to special damage have suffered in service have contented with bringing old coat to be new sleeved harry be favorite with constable on account of intelligence independence because of relation with farmer of englebourn on allotment question although by office representative of law order in parish david be man of people sympathized with peasantry more than with farmer have passed year of apprenticeship at reading where have picked up notion on political social question much ahead of englebourn worthy when returned to native village being wise man have kept new light in background consequently have succeeded in object of ambition have be appointed constable reason for seeking post be desire to prove that old joke a to manliness of tailor have application to case have established to satisfaction of neighborhood by resolute manner in called on performed duty now that character be made position secure be not so careful of betraying leaning have lost custom amongst farmer in consequence of job on be employed naturally turned thought to harry stitched away now weighing in mind whether must not go to farmer grove represent to that ought to give harry new coat now rejoicing over fact that rector have decided to let harry have acre of allotment land now speculating on attachment of favorite to gardener daughter whether must do thing to forward suit in pursuit of thought have forgotten about bee when suddenly great humming arose followed by rush through air like passing of express train recalled to jumped from table casting aside coat seizing key shovel hurried out into garden beating two together with might process in question known in country phrase a tanging be founded upon belief that bee will not settle unless under influence of peculiar music constable holding faithfully to popular belief rushed down garden tanging a though life depended upon in hope that soothing sound must induce swarm to settle at once on own apple tree be tanging superstition not people learned in bee ought to know never happened to meet one who have settled question be curious how such belief superstition fix in popular mind of countryside be held by wise simple alike david constable be most sensible open minded man of time class kemble akerman other learned anglo saxon scholar must have vainly explained to that tang be old word for to hold that object of tanging be not to lure bee with sweet music of key shovel to give notice to neighbour that have swarmed that owner of maternal hive mean to hold on to right to emigrant david must have listened to lecture with pity have retained unshaken belief in music in present case however tanging be of little avail for swarm after wheeling once twice in air disappeared from eye of constable over rector wall went on tanging violently for minute two then paused to consider what be to be done must get over wall into rector garden at once must go round ask leave to carry search into parsonage ground a man bee fancier be on point of following straight at once over wall fence constable be also strong within be not on best of term with old simon rector gardener late opposition to miss winter in matter of singing also came into mind so resolved that parish constable must lose caste by disregarding neighbour boundary be considering what to do next when heard footstep short cough on other side of wall recognized be there maester simon called out where upon walker on other side pulled up after second appeal answered shortly e'es hev'ee seed ought o bee thaay have bin riz gone off somweres athert wall e'es seen wer ' be 'em then aal amang wi ' ourn in lime aal amang wi'yourn exclaimed constable drattle thaay be more trouble than be wuth knowd a thaay wur yourn zoon a ever sot eye on old simon went on how did'ee know then asked constable thine be aal zettin crass legged said simon with chuckle thee medst cum pick out if theebet mind to 't simon be mollified by own joke broke into short dry cachinnation half laugh half cough while constable who be pleased astonished to find neighbour in such good humour hastened to get empty hive pair of hedger glove fortified with left cottage made best of way up street towards rectory gate hard by stood simon cottage old gardener be of impatient nature effect of joke have almost time to evaporate simon be fast relapsing into usual state of mind towards neighbour before latter made appearance wher ' hast be so long exclaimed when constable joined seed young missus t'other young lady standin ' talkin ' afore door said david so stopped back so a not to dlsturve be gone in who be talkin ' to to thy missus thy daarter too b'lieve 't be thaay be at whoam bea like enough what be zayin must heer nothin partic'lar judged a 't be summat about sunday fire 't be na use for thaay to go on fillin ' place wi ' bottle dwo mean to take mwore doctor stuff simon may be said by way have obstinately refused to take medicine since fall have maintained constant war on subject with own woman miss winter whom have impressed more than ever with belief in wrongheadedness ah how be'ee tho maester simon said david did mind to ax afore dwo feel wu for fall hope feel bit stiffish like a if summat wur cuttin ' m ' at time when lift up arm 't be mercy 't be wu said david bea so young lissom a be maester simon to remark simon replied by grunt disliked allusion to age rare dislike amongst class in part of country most of people be fond of making out older than be love to dwell on experience believe a firmly a rest of that everything have altered for worse in parish district since youth simon though short of word temper uncomfortable acquaintance in consequence be inclined to be helpful enough in other way constable with assistance have very soon hived swarm of cross legged bee then constable insisted on simon coming with taking glass of ale after little coquetting simon consented to do so after carrying re capture safely home erecting hive on three legged stand of own workmanship hastened to rejoin simon two soon found in bar of red lion constable wished to make most of opportunity so began at once to pump simon a to intention with regard to daughter simon be not easy to lead in anyway seemed in more than usually business of yours line about daughter whether have anyone in eye for not david must not make out one thing did make out grieved much old simon be in touchy unfriendly state of mind against harry who said be falling into bad way beginning to think much too much of self why be to be wanting more allotment ground than anyone else simon have given harry advice on point not to much purpose must seem a summed up notion on subject by remark that 't be waste of soap to lather as constable now then made stand for young friend very judiciously after feeling way for time came to conclusion a indeed truth be that simon be jealous of harry talent for growing flower have be driven into present frame of mind at hearing miss winter cousin talking about flower at dame winburn under very nose for last four five day have spoken thus to interest old man meaning to praise harry to fact be that old gardener be one of men who never can stand hearing other people praised think that such praise must be meant in depreciation of when have finished ale afternoon be getting on constable rose to go back to work while old simon declared intention of going down to hay field to see how mowing be getting on be sure that hay must never be made properly now that must be about a much a usual in hour coat be finished constable being uneasy in mind resolved to carry garment home at once to have talk with dame winburn so wrapped coat in handkerchief put under arm set off down village found dame busy with washing after depositing parcel sat down on settle to have talk with soon got on subject be always uppermost in mind son prospect poured out to constable trouble first there be sweet hearting after old simon daughter not that dame winburn be going to say anything against though might have thought a well a other folk for part liked to see girl be fit for something besides dressing up like better what worried be to see how harry took to heart be like must see how be to end made fractious too be getting into trouble about work have left regular place be gone mowing with gang most of men out of parish that knew nothing about likely not to be best of company be very well in harvest time when must go earn good wage at mowing reaping where about man must earn better than harry when came to winter again did see what might find want of regular place then farmer might take on own land that have got seemed to think so much of might turn out thought must so in fact old lady be troubled in mind only made constable more uneasy have vague sort of impression that be in way answerable for harry who be good deal with be fond of coming about place although cottage happened to be next to old simon might account for fact to extent yet constable be conscious of having talked to young friend on many matter in way might have unsettled encouraged natural tendency to stand up for own right independence knew well enough that temper be not one be likely to keep labouring man out of trouble in parish did not allow own misgiving however to add to widow trouble on contrary cheered by praising up harry a much a even must desire prophesying that must come right that lived must see son a respected a man in parish must be surprised indeed if be church warden before died then astonished at own boldness feeling that be not capable of higher flight of imagination constable rose to take leave asked where harry be working finding that be at mowing in dane close set off to look after kind hearted constable must not shake off feeling that something be going to happen to harry must get into trouble wanted to assure that a yet nothing have gone wrong whenever one have sort of vague feeling about friend there be natural irresistible impulse to go look after to be with dane close be part of glebe large field of ten acre so in extent close to village two footpath ran across so that be almost common property village child considered a much playground a green trampled grass good deal more than seemed endurable in eye of simon who managed rector farming operation a well a garden child have own way notwithstanding threat sometimes launched at miss winter must have sooner lost hay than have narrowed amusement be most difficult piece of mowing in parish in consequence of trampling of large crop bore dane other unknown person have made land fat perhaps with carcass benefit have lasted to time of story at rate field bore splendid crop mower always got extra shilling acre for cutting by miss winter special order be paid by simon in most ungracious manner with many grumbling that be enough to ruin mower in countryside a constable got over stile into hay field great part of misgiving passed out of head be simple kindly man whose heart lay open to influence of scene weather dane close full of life joy merry sound a seen under slanting ray of evening sun be just place to rub wrinkle out of constable however be not singular in matter what man amongst if will think matter over calmly fairly can honestly say that there be one spot on earth surface in have enjoyed so much real wholesome happy life a in hay field may have won renown on horseback on foot at sport pastime in englishman glory may have shaken off rival time after time across vale of aylesbury of berk other of famous hunting county may have stalked oldest shyest buck in scotch forest killed

don by sight certainly scarcely of visitor awkwardness of tom attempted explanation set everything wrong again then came one of awkward pause will occur so very provokingly at most inopportune time miss winter be seized with one of uncontrollable fit of shyness bondage to have so lately be grieving over to mary in self defence without meaning in least to do so drew up looked a proud a please hardy whose sensitiveness be almost a keen a woman felt in moment awkwardness of situation became a shy a miss winter if floor must have suddenly opened let through into dark shop must have be thankful a must not there stood meditating sudden retreat from room tremendous onslaught on tom a soon a must catch alone for getting into scrape tom be provoked with for not at once feeling at ease with one stood twirling cap by tassel looking fiercely at resolved not to break silence have be at trouble of bringing about charming situation now nobody seemed to like to know what to say do ought

great force so that when tom lifted misanthropic eye for moment caught hers be so full of fun that have nothing to do to allow not without struggle to break first into smile then into laugh brought eye to bear on ice being once broken dissolved a quickly a have gathered really ca see what there be to laugh at tom said miss winter smiling nevertheless blushing little a worked pretended to work at buttoning one of glove ca kate well then be very ridiculous enough to make one laugh that four must be standing here in sort of quaker meeting when ought to be half way to long walk by time oh do let start said mary know will be missing best of sight come along then said tom leading way down stair hardy lady followed descended into high street walking abreast two lady together with gentleman on flank formation answered well enough on high street broad pavement of celebrated thoroughfare being favourable to advance in line when have wheeled into oriel lane narrow pavement at once threw line into confusion after one two fruitless attempt to take up dressing settled down into more natural formation of close column of couple leading couple consisting of mary tom remaining couple of miss winter hardy be lovely midsummer evening oxford be looking best under genial cloudless sky so what with usual congratulation on weather explanatory remark on building a passed along hardy managed to keep up conversation with companion without much difficulty miss winter be pleased with quiet deferential manner soon lost feeling of shyness before hardy have come to end of such remark a occurred to to make be taking fair share in talk in describing day doings spoke with enthusiasm of beauty of magdalen chapel betrayed little knowledge of tracery moulding gave opening to companion to travel out of weather name of college church architecture be just one of subject be sure at time to take more le hold on man at oxford whose mind be open to influence of place hardy have read usual text book

solemn march up down beneath grand avenue of elm in midst of better university be there in strength from vice chancellor downwards somehow though might seem unreasonable thing at first sight for grave reverend person to do yet most of gravest of found reason for taking turn in long walk a for undergraduate turned out almost to man none of more certainly than young gentleman elaborately dressed who have sneered at whole ceremony a snobbish hour two before a for hero sailed into meadow thoroughly satisfied for moment with convoy have reason to be so for though there be many gayer more fashionably dressed lady present than cousin cousin by courtesy there be none there whose face figure dress carried more unmistakably mark of thorough quiet high breeding refinement be mere surface polish that

approval disapproval of head of republic of learning of most illustrious visitor cheering with equal vigor lady majesty minister prize poem be strange scene certainly have probably puzzled many person besides young lady one can well fancy astonishment of learned foreigner for instance when see head of university have reverenced at distance from youth up rise in robe in solemn convocation to exercise one of highest of university function hears sonorous latin period interrupted by three cheer for lady in pink bonnet when man be introduced for honorary degree whose name may be known throughout civilized world vice chancellor turning to compeer inquires placetne vobis domini doctores placetne vobis magistri hears voice of doctor master drowned in contradictory shout from young

with have remarked too that never must talk with now without breaking away after short time into badinage badinage certainly be very charming pleasant kept on stretch why must not let be serious sentimental when pleased did not break out in manner with other people so really felt to be duty to speak to on subject not in least for own sake for hers accordingly when party broke up started for fete at st john resolved to carry out intention at first must not get opportunity while be walking about on beautiful lawn of great garden seeing being seen listening to music looking at choice flower soon chance offered stayed behind rest without noticing to examine specially beautiful plant be by side in moment proposed to show smaller garden lie beyond to innocently consented be soon out of

poor fellow seems dreadfully cut up hope will be able to be of use to now for place katie showed from village street pressed horse up steep side of hawk lynch exhilaration of scramble sense of power

except in tom brain wherein be built up in gorgeous succession castle such a have built suppose before now with castle be built up side by side good honest resolve to be worthy of win worship with body mind soul a first installment away to wind went selfish morning thought rode down northern slope of chalk hill dutiful affectionate son at peace with mr porter honoring for care of treasure be seeking in good time for dinner well dear said mr brown to husband when be alone that night did ever see tom in such spirit so gentle affectionate dear boy there can be nothing matter did tell so replied mr brown woman have always got nonsense in head a soon a boy have hair on chin girl begin to put up back hair well john say what will be sure mary porter be very sweet taking girl be quite of

returned to englebourn rectory to stay over sunday attend betty winburn funeral be strangely attracted to harry by remembrance of old boyish rivalry by story have heard from cousin of unwavering perseverance with young peasant clung to pursued suit for simon daughter more than by feeling of gratitude with remembered effect visit to betty sick room have have on on day of ride from barton manor on day knew that have ridden into englebourn in miserable mental fog have ridden out of in sunshine have lasted through intervening week somehow have be set straight then there turned into right road out of wrong one at what very naturally believed to be most critical moment of life without stopping to weigh accurately respective merit of several person whom came in contact with day credited with large amount of gratitude good will harry with mother share a well a own so have be longing to do something for ever since more rejoiced in gave up to own new sensation more did gratitude become a be burden to yet opportunity offered of letting off of in action magistrate taking into consideration dangerous state of mother have let harry off with reprimand for assault so there be nothing to be done there wrote to katie offering more money for winburns declined adding however to note by way of postscript that might give to clothing club coal club then came news of betty death intimation from katie that thought harry must be much gratified if must attend funeral jumped at suggestion englebourn from hawk lynch to rectory be hallowed ground to idea of getting back there so much nearer to barton manor filled with joy tried in vain to repress when thought of main object of visit on present occasion arrived in time to go shake hand with harry before dinner though scarcely word passed between saw with delight that have evidently given pleasure to mourner then have charming long evening with katie walking in garden with between dinner tea after tea discoursing in low tone over work table while mr winter benevolently slept in arm chair discourse branched into many path managed always somehow to end in saying belief perfection of young lady of barton manor tom wondered how have happened so when got to own room a fancied have not betrayed in least have determined to keep resolutely on guard to make confident of living soul till be twenty one though sorely tempted to break resolution in favor of katie have restrained might have spared trouble did not know being unversed in way of woman unaware of subtlety quickness of intuition in matter connected with heart poor dear stolid dim sighted mankind how do see through walk round funeral on sunday afternoon between church have touched much being first have ever attended walked next behind chief mourner few friend amongst whom david be conspicuous yielding place to stood beside harry in church at open grave made response a firmly a must pressed shoulder against when felt strong frame of son trembling with weight burden of resolutely suppressed agony when parted at cottage door to tom accompanied mourner old tried friend david though nothing look grasp of hand passed between felt that be bound by new invisible bond a walked back up village passed churchyard where child be playing about on graf stopping now then to watch sexton a stamped down filled in mould on last made one beside stood a mourner heard bell beginning to chime for afternoon service resolved within that must be true helpful friend to widow son on subject must talk freely to katie did so that evening expounding how much one in position must do for young laboring man if be really bent on building up grand castle for harry foundation of rested on own determination to benefit patronize katie listened half doubtingly at first be soon led away by confidence poured out tea in full belief that with tom powerful aid must go well after took to reading christian year together branched into discussion on profane poetry katie considered scarcely proper for evening nevertheless being of such rare occurrence with have not heart to stop next morning tom be to return home after breakfast began subject of future plan for harry again when katie produced small paper packet handed to saying here be money again what money money left with for harry winburn thought at time that most probably must not take be sure doe want did try hard to get to take said tom holding out hand reluctantly for money not must offer money myself of course sent by david begged to do must to persuade to take well why must oh said club money be coming in be more than enough to pay for funeral for did want how provoking wonder if old david really did best to get to take yes be sure did ought to be very glad to find independence in poor man bother independence like to feel that cost nothing talk want to pay ah tom if knew poor a well a do must say so be afraid there be not two other men in parish who must have refused money fear of undermining independence take away pleasure in giving undermining why katie be sure have heard mourn over stubbornness unreasonableness oh yes be often provokingly stubborn unreasonable yet not independent about money anything can get out of besides acknowledge have become wiser of late used to like to see dependent cringing to now dread must like david to give in about singing must yes if must give in must be very proud have learnt great deal from used positively to dislike now that know think best man in parish if ever doe give in think will will be worth anything just because be so independent that be very well what be to do to show harry winburn mean to be friend if wo take money from have come over to mother funeral will think more of than of money must give can show sympathy for in great many way well must try by way about love affair be young lady at home have never seen know be away with aunt looking out for place have persuaded to get one leave home again for present father be quite well now be not wanted well seems ca do good with then must not go talk to father about harry might help in way must be very careful simon be such odd tempered old man oh be not afraid be great chum little soft soap will go long way with fancy if must get very morning to beanction harry suit ' a phrase be what must think of must think very highly of power of persuasion not least daunted by cousin misgiving tom started in quest of simon found at work in front of greenhouse surrounded by many small pot heap of finely sifted mould absorbed in occupation simon be rough stolid berkshire rustic somewhat of tyrant in bosom of family unmanageable servant cross grained acquaintance a citizen stiff necked grumbler who thought that nothing ever went right in parish withal thoroughly honest worker when allowed to go own way other way must go a mistress have long since discovered there be man who earned daily bread more honestly took pride in work rectory garden be always trim well kept bed bright with flower from early spring till late autumn be absorbed in what be about tom came up close to without attracting least sign of recognition so stopped opened conversation good day simon be pleasure to see garden looking so gay a yours simon looked up from work when saw who be touched battered old hat answered mornin ' sir ee find allus in blume indeed do simon how do manage must like to

simon can do good day work yet with man simon went on with potting without replying except by carefully measured grunt sufficient to show that have heard remark be not much impressed by tom saw that must change attack so after watching simon for minute began again wonder why be that men of time of life be so much stronger than young one in constitution now believe there be three young men in

scarcely passed lip when tom saw that have made mistake old simon retired into at once cunning distrustful look came over face there be doing anything with even new forcing house have lost attraction for tom after further ineffectual attempt to bring round returned to house somewhat crestfallen well how have succeeded said katie looking up from work a came in sat down near table tom shook head be afraid have made regular hash of said thought at first have quite come round old savage by praising garden promising that must let have new house mean to say did that said katie stopping work indeed did though be drawn on know saw be right card to play so must help oh tom how must do so want house least in world be only simon vanity want to beat gardener at grange at flower show penny will have

robert so bade other adieu lovingly after manner of cousin tom rode away with very soft place in heart for cousin katie be not least same sort of passionate feeling of worship with regarded mary two feeling must lie side by side in heart with plenty of room to spare in fact heart have be getting so big in last few week that seemed capable of taking in whole of mankind not to mention woman till on whole may be safely asserted that have matter be at in more forward state must have seen exactly what be passing in mind mary must probably have objected to kind of affection felt for cousin at particular time joke about cousinly love be probably a old certainly a true a solomon proverb however a matter stood must be concern of mary what feeling be towards katie other person tom rode in at lodge gate of grange soon after eleven o'clock walked horse slowly through park admiring splendid timber thinking how must break request to owner of place thought be interrupted by proceeding of

after leaving park suddenly occurred to that however satisfactory to result of encounter with unjust landlord might seem must probably prove anything agreeable to must be tenant harry winburn in fact a meditated on matter became clear to that in course of one morning have probably exasperated old simon against aspirant son in law put serious spoke in harry love wheel on one hand while on other have ensured speedy expulsion from cottage if not demolition of building whereupon became somewhat low under conviction that friendship be to work such wonder for said harry deliver out of trouble

however from being prepared for serious way in father looked upon day proceeding mr brown be sitting by after dinner when son turned up have to drink several extra glass of port to keep decently composed while tom narrated event of day in interval of attack on dinner be brought back for when servant have cleared away mr brown proceeded to comment on history in most decided manner tom be wrong to go to grange in first instance part of homily be amplified by discourse on corruption of turf in general special curse of small country race in particular such men a wurley supported for must cease racing used to be pastime of great people who must well afford to spend few thousand year on pleasure have now mostly fallen into hand of very worst lowest men of class most of whom must not scruple a mr brown strongly put to steal copper out of blind beggar hat if must go at rate might have done errand come away instead of staying there day accepting man hospitality mr brown really must be much embarrassed to know what to do if man must happen to attend next session assize above having accepted hospitality to turn round at end insult man in own house seemed to brown j p monstrous astounding

endeavor to prove that tenant in such case have claim right a against landlord weekly tenant be weekly tenant succession of week holding must make anything more tom found rushing into line of argument astonished sounded wild in felt sure there be truth therefore must not abandon though father be evidently annoyed called mere mischievous sentiment be more moved than must have liked to own in own heart felt aggrieved blamed other for not understanding though obstinate on general question upon point of leaving grange tom be fairly brought to shame gave in at last expressed sorrow though must not help maintaining that if father must have heard what took place seen man manner must scarcely blame for what have said done having owned in wrong however there be nothing for to write apology

commonly call chaff a well bred girl can venture on be annoyed to find quite at fault in attempt to get old antagonist of commemoration to show fight felt in moment how changed manner be thought by mean changed for better a for tom felt foolish shy at first to extent drove half wild word stuck in throat took to blushing again like boy of fourteen in fact got so angry with that rather avoided actual presence though be scarcely moment out of sight mr brown made best of son retreat devoted most gallantly to mary be completely captivated by before bedtime on first night of visit triumphed over wife when be alone laughed at groundlessness of suspicion be by mean so satisfied on subject a husband in day two however tom began to take heart of grace to find oftener at mary side with something to say more to look now in turn began to be embarrassed for attempt to re establish old footing failed difficulty of finding satisfactory new one remained to be solved so for present though of found quite satisfactory took refuge in presence of third party attached to katie talking at one through nothing must exceed katie judiciousness a medium of communication through better understanding began to establish visit of have be looking forward to so eagerly seemed likely after to be a pleasant in fact a have be in anticipation a became more at vigilance of mr brown mr porter

ankle saying doings of eventful autumn day then opened desk examined certain treasure therein concealed including withered rose bud sprig of heather cut boot lace scrap two of writing having gone through extravagant form of worship not necessary to be specified put away must ever come right made solitary tea sat down again to consider point point must not be considered alone began to feel more strongly what have have several hint of already that there be curiously close connexion between own love story that of harry winburn patty that must separate even in thought old simon tumble have recalled daughter from oxford at so critical moment for mary visit to englebourn at very time curious yet natural series of little accident have kept in ignorance of patty identity until final catastrophe then again way in harry winburn mother have come across on very day of leaving barton fellowship of common mourning have seemed to bind together so closely last discovery must not help fearing must turn harry into bitter enemy when heard truth a must sooner later a thing passed before gave in to sort of superstitious feeling that own fate hung in way upon of harry winburn if helped on suit be helping on own whether helped on own not be after not that be uppermost in thought be much changed in respect since last sat in room just after first day with since then angel have met have touched cord of self trembling be passing in music out of sight thought of harry trial enabled to indulge in good honest indignation for there be room in own case that prospect in life of such man must be in power to great extent of such people a squire wurley farmer tester because happened to be poor must be turned out of cottage where family have lived for hundred year at week notice through caprice of drunken gambler because have stood up for right have thereby offended worst farmer in parish must be marked man unable to get work thing appeared so monstrous to tom made so angry that be obliged to get up stamp about room from particular case very soon got to generalization question have before now puzzled gained new significance minute became real to why few men must be rich rest poor above why must be one of few why mere possession of property must give man power over neighbor why poor men who be ready willing to work must only be allowed to work a sort of favor must after get merest tithe of what labor produced be tossed aside a soon a work be done longer required other such problem rose up before crude sharp asking to be solved feeling quite unable to give one answer to viz that be getting out of depth that whole business be in muddle have recourse to old method when in difficulty putting on cap started off to hardy room to talk matter over see whether must not get light on from quarter returned in hour so somewhat le troubled in mind inasmuch a have found friend in pretty much same state of mind on such topic a one step have gained under arm carried certain book from hardy scanty library perusal of hoped at least might enable sooner later to feel that have got on to sort of firm ground at rate hardy have advised to read so without more ado drew chair to table began to look into glimpse of manner in tom spent first evening of second year at oxford will enable intelligent reader to understand why though took to reading far more kindly honestly than have ever done before made great advance in proper study of place not that wholly neglected for hardy kept pretty well up to collar passed little go creditably be fairly placed at college examination in of book have to get up for lecture be genuinely interested politics of athens struggle between roman pleb patrician mon sacer agrarian law began to have new meaning to chiefly because bore more le on great harry winburn problem problem indeed for have now fairly swelled into condition of england problem be becoming day more more urgent importunate shaking many old belief leading knew not very matter of leading be sore trial to further got on new road more felt want of guidance guidance of man for of book soon found to be bewildering college tutor whom consulted only deprecated waste of tune on finding impossible to dissuade at last recommended economic work of day a proper well spring of truth on such matter to tom accordingly went read with docility faith of youth bent on learning feeling in presence of men who have assumed right of speaking with authority spoke to with authority read on believing much hoping more somehow did not really satisfy though silenced for time be not fault of book most of laid down clearly enough that what professed to teach be science of man material interest law of making employment of capital escaped in eagerness wandered up down page in search of quite science of law with did not meddle nevertheless here there seemed to touch upon what be in search of be much fascinated for instance by doctrine of greatest happiness of greatest number for sake swallowed for time though not without wry face dogma self interest be true pivot of social action population have perpetual tendency to outstrip mean of living to establish preventive check on population be duty of good citizen so lived on for time in dreary uncomfortable state fearing for future of country with little hope about own when came to take stock of newly acquired knowledge to weigh measure found to consist of sort of hazy conviction that society must be right ready for millennium when man must do what liked nobody must interfere with there must be law against marriage result be more than must stand roused shook began to think well present teacher be very clever men well meaning men too see if teaching be only to land here why be scarcely worth while going through so much to get so little casting about still for guidance grey occurred to grey be in residence a bachelor attending divinity lecture preparing for ordination be still working hard at night school tom have be there once twice to help when curate be away in short be in very good book with grey who have got better of shyness with saw that tom be changed sobered in heart hoped day to wean from pursuit of body to be still fearfully addicted to bring into fold hope be not altogether unfounded for notwithstanding strong bias against tom have brought with from school be now at time much attracted by many of high church doctrine men who professed such men a grey saw did really believe something be in earnest about carrying belief into action party might did comprise many others of weakest sort who believed be in earnest about nothing who liked to be peculiar nevertheless while saw laying hold of many of best men of time be not to be wondered at that be drawn towards help might lie in men if must only get at so propounded doubt study result to grey be failure grey felt difficulty very little in whole matter tom found that be because believed world to belong to devil laissez faire buying cheap selling dear grey held might be good enough for law for world very probably be law of church be self sacrifice bearing one burden child must come out from region where world law be acknowledged tom listened be dazzled at first thought be getting on right track very soon found that grey specific be not of least use to be no good to tell of rule of society to felt that belonged wished to belong for clearly must not be church of england be outsider grey must probably admit to be so if asked have longing to be anything else if church meant exclusive body took care of own people have nothing to say to great world in most people have to live buying selling hiring working have to go on close corporation might have very good law be nothing to what wanted to know about be law great world devil world a grey called be ruled by rather ought to be ruled by perhaps after bentham others whose book have be reading might be right at rate be clear that have have in thought same world that have world included harry winburn labourer squire farmer so turned to again not hopefully more inclined to listen to than have be before have spoken to grey hardy be so fully occupied with college lecture private pupil tom have scruple about taking up much of spare time in evening nevertheless a grey have broken down there be nobody else on whose judgment must rely who must listen to whenever have chance must propound of puzzle to old friend in respect got little help for hardy be almost a much at sea a on such subject a value wage law of supply demand there be indomitable belief in that men intercourse with one not merely that of churchman must be founded on principal of doing a must be done by not on buying cheap selling dear that never must must be reconciled with one mean same thing twist how must faith of friend comforted tom greatly be never tired of bringing out at time have doubt whether grey might not be right whether after like maxim principle be meant to be law of kingdom of world wanted corroborative evidence on subject from impartial competent witness at last hit upon what wanted for one evening on entering hardy room found on last page of book shut up with air of triumph on recognizing visitor taking up thrust into tom hand slapping on shoulder said there boy be what want pretty near at rate now say word go back to room swallow whole digest then

stricture on knife razor business produced rather warm discussion merged in question whether keeper life be hard one till something be said implying that wurley men be overworked master took in high dudgeon word ran high in discussion tom remarked apropos of night work that must never ask man to do what must not do sentiment be endorsed by amongst others man in heather mixture host have retorted that have better in case try remark have effect of making tom resolve to cut short visit in meantime have brought ally to river side on night in question first hour a have seen have be enough for ally so tom be left in company with plaid stick pipe to spend night by be by mean first night have spent in open air promised to be pleasant one for camping out be almost longest day in year weather be magnificent there be yet hour of daylight place have chosen be just right one for enjoying evening be sitting under one of clump of huge old alder growing on thin strip of land already noticed divided main stream from deep artificial ditch fed water meadow on left emerald green meadow stretched away till met inclosed corn land on right ran main stream fifty foot in breadth at point on opposite side of be rough piece of ground half withey bed half copse with rank growth of rush at water edge be chosen haunt of moor hen water rat whose track must be seen by dozen like small open doorway looking out on to river through ran number of mysterious little path into rush wilderness beyond sun be now going down behind copse through beam came aslant chequered mellow stream ran dimpling by sleepily swaying mass of weed under surface on surface trout rose under bank a moth gnat gleaming beetle fell into stream here there one more frolicsome than brother must throw joyously into air swift rushed close by in company of five six wheeled screamed dashed away again skimming along water baffling eye a tried to follow flight two kingfisher shot suddenly up on to supper station on stunted willow stump twenty yard below sat there in glory of blue back cloudy red waistcoat watching with long sagacious beak pointed to water beneath now then dropping like flash of light into stream rising again with what seemed one motion to perch heron two be fishing about meadow watched stalking about in sober quaker coat rising on slow heavy wing lumbering away home with weird cry heard strong pinion of wood pigeon in air then from tree above head came soft call take two cow taffy take two cow taffy with fair false bird be said to have beguilled hapless welchman to gallows presently a lay motionless timid graceful little water hen peered out from door in rush opposite seeing cause for fear stepped daintily into water be suddenly surrounded by little bundle of black soft down went paddling about in out of weed encouraged by occasional sharp clear parental keck keck merry little dabchick popped up in mid stream looked round nodded at pert voiceless dived again even old cunning water rat sat up on bank with round black nose gleaming eye took solemn swim out turned up tail disappeared for amusement comfortable low came at interval from cattle revelling in abundant herbage living thing seemed to be disporting enjoying after kind last gleam of sunset be making whole vault of heaven glow shimmer a watched tom blessed star a contrasted river side with glare of lamp click of ball in noisy pool room before got dark bethought of making sure of position once more matter might have changed since chose before dinner with that must extract from keeper own experience in such matter have taken several hour hunting up down river afternoon before have hit on night line have persevered knowing that be only safe evidence to start from at last have found several so cunningly set that be clear that be first rate artist in poaching line against whom have pitted line must have be laid almost under nose on very day a freshness of bait proved one have selected to watch by be under bank within few yard of clump of alder where be now sitting there be satisfactory cover near others so have chosen one where must be perfectly concealed behind nearest trunk from person who might come in due time to take up line with view then got up stepping carefully on thickest grass where foot must leave mark went to bank felt with hook of stick after line be right returned to old seat then summer twilight came on bird disappeared hush of night settled down on river copse meadow cool gentle summer twilight after hot bright day welcomed too a folded up landscape tree lost outline settled into soft black mass rising here there out of white mist seemed to have crept up to within few yard round unawares there be sound now gentle murmur of water occasional rustle of reed of leaf over head a stray wandering puff of air passed through on way home to bed nothing to listen to nothing to look at for moon have not risen light mist hid everything except star two right up above so outside world having left for present be turned inwards on be very well at first wrapped plaid round shoulder leant against tree indulged in little self gratulation there be something of strangeness adventure in solitary night watch have charm for youngster of twenty one consciousness of not running from word of doing what have said must do while others shirked broke down be decidedly pleasant satisfaction did not last very long night began to get little wearisome too cool to be quite comfortable by degree doubt a to wisdom of self imposed task crept into head dismissed for time by turning thought to other matter neighbourhood of two mile up above reminded of previous summer wondered how must get on with cousin when met must probably see next day for must lose time in calling must receive well must have much to tell about mary have be more hopeful on subject of late loneliness utter solitude silence of position a sat there in misty night away from human habitation be not favorable somehow to hopefulness found getting dreary sombre in heart more more so a minute rolled on silence loneliness pressed on more more heavily be surprised at own down heartedness tried to remember how have spent former night so pleasantly out of door ah have always have companion within call something to do cray fishing bat fowling something of kind sitting there doing nothing fancied must make so heavy to night by strong effort of will shook off oppression moved hummed tune to break silence got up walked up down lest must again master if wind storm pouring rain anything to make sound movement must come of came there be little help in sound movement made by besides occurred to that much walking up down might defeat object of watch one must come near while be on move be probably making mark already might catch eye of setter of nightlines at distance if cunning party waited for morning light might keep away from place altogether so sat down again on old seat leant hard against alder trunk a though to steady keep troublesome thought well in front of in attitude of defense reasoned with on absurdity of allowing to be depressed by mere accident of place darkness silence reasoning at command did alter fact felt enemy advancing again casting about for help fell back on thought that be going through task holding to word doing what have said must do brought relief for moment fixed mind

not lessened be clear that must not last anything horse flesh be capable of real good oxford hack such a rode will do to carry two full grown men at end of pretty long day away from fresh horse moderate weight be too much to expect even of oxford horse flesh gallant beast tom rode be beginning to show sign of distress when struck into road there be slight dip in ground place little further on heath rose suddenly again road ran between high bank for short distance a reached point disappeared for moment from yeomanry force of wind be broken by bank so that must breathe more easily hear one voice tom looked anxiously round at lieutenant who shrugged shoulder in answer to look a bent forward to ease own horse said ca last mile what be to be done east again shrugged shoulder said nothing know master tom said harry winburn what pull up bit sir tom pulled up horse fell into walk willingly enough while east passed on few stride ahead harry winburn sprang off ride on now master

look here be on then said harry tom be aware of two horseman coming over brow of hill on left three hundred yard to rear at same instant horse stumbled came down on nose knee tom went off over

when down went two yeoman horse man floundering in bog above horse girth at same moment storm burst on driving mist pelting rain chase be over must not have seen regiment of men at fifty yard distance let lead horse master tom shouted harry winburn knowed where be going 'twill take best part o ' night to get out o ' know right let get back to road then a soon a can said tom surrendering horse head to harry turning up collar to meet pitiless deluge be driving on flank be drenched to skin in two minute tom jumped off plodded along on opposite side of horse to harry did not speak there be very little to be said under circumstance great deal to be thought about harry winburn probably knew heath a well a man living even have much difficulty in finding way back to road through storm however after half hour spent in beating about reached turned face northward towards oxford by time night have come on fury of storm have passed over moon began to show now then through driving cloud at last tom roused out of brown study in have be hitherto plodding along turned down coat collar shook looked up at sky across at companion who be still leading horse along mechanically be too dark to see face walk general look be listless dogged at last tom broke silence promised not to do anything after came out without speaking to harry made reply so presently went on did think 'd have gone in for such business a to night must have minded so much if have only be machine breaking robbing cellar staving in ale cask maiming cattle 'd hand in interrupted harry be glad to hear be certainly leaning

in use by country carrier garment be much too short for bare arm came out foot beyond end of sleeve rest of costume be even more eccentric being nothing more le than coarse flannel petticoat bare foot rested on mat in front of fire tom felt sudden doubt a to sanity doubt be apparently shared by widow woman who kept house maid of work one other of whom might be seen constantly keeping eye on guest from behind end of wooden screen however be time to be over particular must rest before going further after be only one man so tom thought be just on point of calling harry to come on when figure turned round towards window face of lieutenant disclosed between high peaked gill of carrier coat tom burst out into loud laugh called out be all right come along will just look to ho master tom very

precious bad bargain of then there be twelve striking must knock in good night will be round to breakfast at nine right believe in breakfast rather said east a shook hand at gate of st ambrose into tom disappeared while lieutenant strolled back to mitre chapter xlii third year east returned to regiment in few day at end of month gallant st embarked for india tom wrote several letter to lieutenant inclosing note to harry with gleanings of news from englebourn where escape on night of riot have be nine day wonder now that be fairly 'listed out of way public opinion be beginning to turn in favor in due course letter arrived from lieutenant dated cape town giving prosperous account of voyage so far east did not say much about convict a still insisted on calling harry little did say be very satisfactory tom sent off part of letter to katie to whom have confided whole story entreating to make best use of in interest of young soldier after out of way beginning settled down into usual routine of oxford life change in opinion object of interest brought now into more intimate relation with set of whom have a yet seen little for want of better name may call party of progress at party instead of practical joke boisterous mirth talk of boat bat gun horse highest deepest question of moral politics metaphysics be discussed discussed with freshness enthusiasm be apt to wear off when doing have to take place of talking have strange charm of own while last be looked back to with loving regret by for whom be no longer possibility with set tom soon fraternized drank in many new idea took to also many new crotchet besides with be already weighted almost new acquaintance be liberal in politics few only be ready to go length with be union men tom of course followed fashion soon propounded theory in institution gained name of chartist brown there be strong mixture of self conceit in have kind of idea that have discovered something be creditable to have discovered that be very fine thing to have feeling for sympathy with mass to believe in democracy glorious humanity good time coming know not what other big matter although startled pained at first to hear called ugly name have hated despised from youth up to know many of old acquaintance looked upon not simply a madman a madman with snobbish proclivity yet when first plunge be over there be good deal on other hand tickled vanity be far from being unpleasant to do justice however disagreeables be such that have there not be genuine belief at bottom must certainly have be headed back very speedily into fold of political social orthodoxy a be amidst cloud of sophism platitude big one sided idea half mastered filled thought overflowed in talk there be growing in taking firmer hold on daily true broad sympathy for men a men especially for poor men a poor men righteous burning hatred against law custom notion according to light be seemed to be setting aside putting anything else in place of above man be with natural outgrowth of child boy training though father must have be much astonished to be told so instinct of early day be now getting rapidly set into habit faith becoming part of in stage of life a in so many former one tom got great help from intercourse with hardy now rising tutor of college hardy be travelling much same road a hero be somewhat further on have come into from different country though quite other obstacle early life have be very different by nature from long severe self restraint discipline hardy be much le impetuous demonstrative of two did not rush out therefore a tom be too much inclined to do moment have seized hold of end of new idea felt to be good for what wanted brandish in face of comer think traitor to truth if be trying to make everybody met with eat hardy on contrary must test new idea turn over prove a far a must try to get hold of whole of ruthlessly strip off tinsel rose pink sentiment with might happen to be mixed up often often did tom suffer under severe method rebel against accuse friend to face in own secret thought of coldness want of faith manner of other sin of omission commission in end however generally came round with more le of rebellion according to severity of treatment acknowledge that when hardy brought down from riding high horse be not without good reason that dust in be rolled be always most wholesome dust for instance there be phrase more frequently in mouth of party of progress than good cause be fine big sounding phrase must be used with great effect in peroration of speech at union be sufficiently indefinite to be easily defended from ordinary attack while saved who used trouble of ascertaining accurately for settling for hearer what really did mean however satisfactory might be before promiscuous audience so long a vehement assertion declaration be be required to uphold same good cause be liable to come to much grief when have to get defined hardy be particularly given to persecution on subject when must get tom perhaps one two others in quiet room by while professing utmost sympathy for good cause hope a strong a theirs that enemy might find suspended to lamp post a soon a possible must pursue into corner from escape be most difficult asking supporter what exactly be driving from one cloud land to from good cause to people cause cause of labor other like troublesome definition until great idea seemed to have shape existence longer even in own brain hardy persecution provoking a be for time never went to undermining of real conviction in mind of junior shaking of anything did not need shaking only helped to clear idea brain a to what be talking thinking about gave glimpse soon clouded over again most useful nevertheless of truth that there be good many knotty question to be solved before man must be quite sure that have found out way to set world thoroughly to right heal ill that flesh be heir to hardy treated of friend most favorite notion even with le respect than one of good cause democracy that universal democracy favourite author have recently declared to be inevitable fact of day in live be perhaps on whole pet idea of small section of liberal young oxford with whom tom be now hand glove lost opportunity of worshipping doing battle for indeed most of did very truly believe that state of world universal democracy be to bring about be coming man must say how soon be to be in fact that age of peace good will men have dreamt of in time when lion must lie down with kid nation must not vex nation more after hearing something to effect from tom on several occasion hardy cunningly lured to room on pretence of talking over prospect of boat club then having seated by fire proceeded to assault gently with poker propounded suddenly to question brown must like to know what mean by 'democracy tom at once saw trap into have fallen made several effort to break away unsuccessfully being seated to cup of tea allowed to smoke be then there grievously oppressed mangled sat upon by oldest best friend took ground carefully propounded only what felt sure that hardy must at once accept what man of worth must possibly take exception to meant much more said than for present purpose must be enough for to say that else might mean democracy in mouth always meant that man must have share in government of country hardy seeming to acquiesce making sudden change in subject of talk decoyed innocent guest away from thought of democracy for few minute by holding up to flag of hero worship in worship tom be of course sedulous believer then having involved in most difficult country persecutor opened fire upon from masked battery of most deadly kind gun being from armory of own prophet long for rule of ablest man everywhere at time to find ablest man then give power obey that hold to be about highest act of wisdom nation can be capable of yes know believe that to hardy just a firmly a do hope so then how about universal democracy man having share in government of country tom felt that flank be turned in fact contrast of two belief have never struck vividly before be consequently much confused hardy went on tapping big coal gently with poker gave time to recover collect thought mean of course man be to have actual share in government said at last man be somehow to have share if not actual one ca see what proposition come to call having share in government when man have share in saying who will govern well will own be very different thing let see will find wisest governor for letting most foolish men in nation have say a to who be to be come now hardy have heard say that be for manhood suffrage be question let in idea there at present be considering whether vox populi be best test for finding best man be afraid history be against be good joke now there defy hardy begin at beginning then let see suppose will say then that egyptian babylonian empire be better than little jewish republic republic well let that pas never heard that jew elected moses of judge well never mind jew be exceptional case ca argue from admit that believe just contrary go on well then what do say to glorious greek republic with athens at head of say that nation ever treated best men so badly see must put on lecture in aristophanes for special benefit vain irritable willow suspicious old demus with two obolus in cheek doubting only between cleon sausage seller will choose for wisest man not to govern to serve whim caprice must call witness think be caricature take picture then out of thucydides plato xenophon how will wo mend matter much must go so fast brown wo mind saying so know get clear in own mind before pitch into everyone who come across so do own side admit be mostly right one more harm than good tom must stand being put down so summarily fought over ground from one country to from rome to united state with argument must muster with little success unfortunate first admission of felt throughout like millstone round neck must not help admitting to when left that there be good deal in hardy concluding remark will find rather tough business to get 'universal democracy ' 'government by wisest to pull together in one coach notwithstanding such occasional revers cold bath however tom went on strengthening in new opinion maintaining with zeal of convert shelf of bookcase wall of room soon began to show sign of change be taking place in way of looking at men thing hitherto framed engraving of george iii have hung over mantle piece early in third year frame have disappeared for few day when reappeared solemn face of john milton looked out from while honest monarch have retired into portfolio facsimile of magna charta soon displaced large colored print of day with pycheley soon afterwards death warrant of charles with grim resolute row of signature seal appeared on wall in place of honour in neighbourhood of milton squire brown be passing through oxford paid son visit soon after last arrangement have be completed dined in hall at high table being still member of college afterwards came with hardy to tom room to have quiet glass of wine spend evening with son few of friend who have be asked to meet governor tom have struggle with whether must not remove death warrant into bedroom for evening have actually taken if down with view in end must not stomach such backsliding so restored to place have never concealed opinion from father thought though think quite know what be if doe ought sooner better must be sneak to try to hide know wo like be always just fair will make allowance at rate up go again so re death warrant with devout secret hope that father might not see wine party went off admirably men be nice gentlemanly intelligent fellow squire who have be carefully planted by tom with back to death warrant enjoyed very much at last went except hardy now nervous time approached for short time longer three sat at wine table while squire enlarged upon great improvement in young men habit of university especially in matter of drinking tom have only opened three bottle of port in time men must have drunk certainly not le than bottle man other like remark made a sipped coffee then pushing back chair said well tom have servant better clear away then can draw round fire have talk must like to take turn while be clearing there be martyr memorial have seen thank know place well enough come to walk about in dark sha' be in man way so tom scout came in to clear away took out extra leaf of table put on cloth laid tea during operation mr brown be standing with back to fire looking about a talked when there be more space to move in began to walk up down very soon took to remarking furniture arrangement of room one after other picture came under notice most of escaped without comment squire simply pausing moment then taking up walk again magna charta drew forth hearty approval be capital notion to hang such thing on wall instead of bad print of steeple chase trash of sort ah here be something else of same kind why tom what be said squire a paused before death warrant there be moment two of dead silence while squire eye ran down name from jo bradshaw to mile corbet then turned came sat down opposite to son tom expected father to be vexed be not least prepared for tone of pain sorrow anger in first inquired then remonstrated for time past squire son have not felt so comfortable together a of old mr brown have be annoyed by much that tom have done in case of harry winburn though did not know there have sprung up barrier somehow other between of knew how have often felt embarrassed at being left alone together during past year found that there be certain topic must not talk upon avoided by mutual consent now then constraint embarrassment fell off for short time for at bottom loved appreciated one heartily divergence in thought habit have become very serious seemed likely to increase rather than not felt keenly chasm between two generation a looked at one from opposite bank in secret heart blamed other in great measure for be fault of mixed with longing felt for better understanding be enough of reserve indignation to prevent from coming to discovery of difference be too recent be too much alike in character temper for to make large enough allowance for to be really tolerant of other be first occasion on have come to outspoken serious difference though collision have be exceedingly painful to yet when parted for night be with feeling of relief that ice have be thoroughly broken before father left room tom have torn facsimile of death warrant out of frame put in fire protesting however at same time that though did thist out of deference to father be deeply grieved at having given pain must not must not give up conviction pretend that be changed even shaken squire walked back to hotel deeply moved who can wonder be man full of living vehement conviction one of early recollection have be arrival in england of news of beheading of louis xvi doings of reign of terror have be bred in time when be held impossible for gentleman christian to hold such view a son have be maintaining like many of noblest englishman of time have gone with accepted creed of day tom remained behind dejected melancholy now accusing father of injustice bigotry now longing to go after give up everything what be opinion conviction compared with father confidence love at breakfast next morning however after of have have time for thinking over what have passed met with cordiality be a pleasant to a be unlooked for from visit of father to at oxford tom dated new more satisfactory epoch in intercourse fact have begun to dawn on squire that world have changed good deal since time saw that young men be much improved in way acknowledged fact heartily on other hand have taken up with lot of new notion must not understand thought mischievous bad perhaps tom might get over a got to be older wiser in meantime must take evil with good at rate be too fair man to try to dragoon son out of anything really believed tom on part gratefully accepted change in father manner took mean of showing gratitude by consulting talking freely to on such subject a must agree upon be numerous keeping in back ground question have provoked painful discussion between by degree even must be tenderly approached now that be approached in different spirit honest belief of father son no longer looked so monstrous to one hard sharp outline began to wear off view of of to be modified thus bit by bit by slow sure process better understanding than ever be re established between beginning of better state of thing in relation with father consoled tom for many other matter seemed to go wrong with be constant bit of bright sky to turn to when rest of horizon looked dark dreary a did often enough for proved very trying year to third last year at university year full of large dream small performance of unfulfilled hope struggle to set right ending ever more surely in failure disappointment common pursuit of place have lost freshness with much of charm be beginning to feel in cage to beat against bar of often in spite of natural hopefulness heart seemed to sicken turn cold without apparent reason old pursuit palled on scarcely cared to turn to new one what be that made

satisfaction must not be enough for bed be too narrow for man to stretch on what be in search of must underlie embrace human love support beyond above private personal desire hope longing be conscious of restless craving feeling about after something must not grasp yet be not avoiding seemed to be mysteriously laying hold of surrounding routine of chapel lecture reading for degree boating cricketing union debating well enough in way left vacuum unfilled there be great outer visible world problem puzzle of be rising before haunting more more great inner invisible world opening round in awful depth seemed to be standing on brink of now shivering helpless feeling like atom about to be whirled into great flood carried knew not where now ready to plunge in take part full of hope belief that be meant to buffet in strength of man with seen unseen to be subdued by in year a bit of steady bright blue sky be boon beyond price so felt to be be not only with father that tom regained lost

working there everything seemed to be in exact place in best place must have be thought of for to be best thing must have be thought of for place yet perfection did not strike particularly at first surprise in way sank into gradually so that until forced to consider matter must not in least say why room have such very pleasant effect on young lady to whom charm be chiefly owing be sitting by buhl work table on lay embroidery book be reading letter seemed deeply to interest for did not hear voice of butler who have just opened door disturbed solitude until have repeated for second time mr

nature be quite astonishing miss porter said leaning forward with elbow on knee following pattern of one of flower on carpet with cane gave opportunity of showing delicately gloved hand to advantage indeed why do think so asked taking up embroidery pretending to begin working have not good reason after sitting half hour seeing enduring old smith greatest bore in london believe there be three house where servant dare let in must be a much a place be worth porter must hope for character who let in twice in season poor mr smith said mary smiling know have porter suddenly checked added

cordially be so glad to see said how kind of to call when be so busy mamma will be here directly think must remember mr st cloud mr grey st cloud patience be now quite gone drew up making slightest possible inclination towards grey then without taking further notice of turned to mary with look meant to be full of pitying admiration for contempt of visitor a must not look at be thrown away so made bow stalked out of room angrily debating with a went down stair whether must have understood be so fully convinced of sacrifice man in position be making in paying serious attention to girl with little fortune connexion that soon consoled in belief that embarrassment only arose from shyness that moment must explain must be obedient grateful servant meantime mary sat down opposite to curate listened to a unfolded errand awkwardly enough execution be threatened in house of poor struggling widow whom mr porter have employed to do needlework occasionally who be behind with rent through sickness be afraid that thing must be taken sold in morning unless must borrow two sovereign have so many claim on that must not lend money so have come out to see what must do amongst who knew by time grey have arrived at end of story mary have made up mind not without little struggle to sacrifice greater part of what be left of quarter allowance after must only be wearing cleaned glove

money just then butler came in with tea mary asked mr grey to take looked tired said if must wait little time must see mother who must be sure to do something more for poor woman grey have risen to leave be standing hat in hand ready to go be in habit of reckoning with strictly for minute of day be never quite satisfied with unless be doing most disagreeable thing circumstance for time being allowed to do greater stronger men than grey from adam downwards have yielded to temptation before now succumbed looked out of corner of eye there be something so fresh bright in picture of dainty little tea service young lady behind tea be beginning to pour out smelt so refreshing hand figure looked so pretty in operation that with sigh of departing resolution gave in put hat on floor sat down opposite to tempter grey took cup of tea then thought have never tasted anything so good delicious rich cream tempting plate of bread butter be too much for fairly gave way resigned to physical enjoyment sipped tea looked over cup at mary sitting there bright kind ready to go on pouring out for to extent seemed to a if atmosphere of light joy surrounded within circle of be sitting absorbing tea be only stimulant that grey ever took have more need of than usual for have given away chop be ordinary dinner to starving woman be faint with fasting bad air of hovel in have be spending morning elegance of room smell of flower charm of companionship with young woman of own rank contrast of whole to common way of life carried away hope thought began to creep into head to have long be stranger mary did very best to make visit pleasant to have great respect for self denying life knew be leading nervousness shyness of manner be of kind instead of infecting gave confidence made feel quite at ease with be so grateful to for having delivered out of recent embarrassment that be more than usually kind in manner saw how be enjoying thought what good must do to forget usual occupation for short time so talked positive gossip to risked opinion on riding habit very soon be telling plot of new novel have just be reading with animation playfulness must have warmed heart of anchorite for short quarter of hour grey resigned at end of time became suddenly painfully conscious of what be doing stopped short in middle of altogether worldly compliment detected in act of paying to too fascinating young hostess felt that retreat be only chance so grasped hat again rose with deep sigh sudden change of manner alarmed mary hope be not ill mr grey said anxiously not least thank in short must go to work ought to apologize indeed for having stayed so long oh have not be here more than twenty minute pray stay see mamma must be in directly thank be very kind must like very much indeed can not mary felt that must be no kindness to press further so rose held out hand grey took be not quite certain to day whether did not press in farewell shake more than be absolutely necessary if did may be quite sure that administered exemplary punishment to afterwards for so doing must gladly have left now over sensitive conscience forbade have forgotten office thought hitherto there be time yet not to be altogether false to so looked grave shy again said will not be offended with miss porter if speak to a clergyman mary be little disconcerted answered almost immediately oh pray say anything think ought to say be afraid there must be great temptation in living always in beautiful room like with one prosperous people do not think so one can not help surely mr grey think can be wrong not wrong

cheerful never be very cheerful place to at best of time not even at pulling time well river be part like best to think of even river make rather melancholy now one feel one have done with why tom believe melancholy come from not having asked to pull in boat perhaps doe call degrading to be pulling in torpid in one old age mortified vanity man have capital boat wonder how must have liked to have be turned out for bachelor just because have pulled good oar in day not at blame young one hope to do duty in torpid by way be uncommonly nice set of youngster much better behaved in way than be unless be that put on best manner before think do fact be be really fine young fellow so think will tell what jack since be sitting talking mind to one at last like old time somebody have made most wonderful change in college rather think be seeing what st ambrose be now thinking what be in time what uncommon member of society must have turned out if have have luck to have be here now instead of

positively forbid did care much about staying up so be pretty plain with said 'if be not allowed to take line thought best in such matter must resign at end of term assented afterwards thought better of sent for again have several encounter took ground very civilly firmly have to give up one objection after think turning point be when quoted st paul on said be teaching boy to worship physical strength instead of teaching to keep under body bring into subjection of course countered there with tremendous effect old boy took very well only saying feared be use to argue further in matter of boat racing have come to conclusion not without serious thought many year before however came round quietly so have on other point in fact be wonderfully open minded man for age if only put thing to right way have come round about gentleman commoner see have only two three up yes have given up taking altogether hope that may come soon tutor took to plucking ruthlessly at matriculation unless be

lost wicket one after so fast that tom hardy have time to play out two match with then to retire on laurel while afternoon be yet young old folk in village school room enjoyed beef pudding under special superintendence of miss winter then toddled to home sat about in warmest nook must find mumbling of old time doings at dr winter wedding david devoted to superintending issue of beer swelling with importance so full of milk of human kindness from great event of day that nobody minded little air did duty so satisfactorily that with exception of one two regular confirmed soaker who stuck steadily to tap of red lion there managed successfully to fuddle there be nothing like drunkenness in short be one of rare day when everything go right everybody seems to be inclined to give take to make allowance for neighbour by degree cricket flagged most of men went off to sit over pipe finish evening in own way boy girl took to playing at kissing in ring child who have not already gone home sat in group watching miss winter have already disappeared tom hardy captain began to feel that might consider part finished strolled together off green towards hardy lodging red lion being still in
