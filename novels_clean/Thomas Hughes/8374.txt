of joined though name be too much for others question of taking have be much considered be decided on whole to be best to do so boldly even though might cost valuable ally kingsley be of course consulted on point though living now almost entirely at eversley view a to proper policy to be pursued may be gathered best from following extract from letter of to mr ludlow must touch workman at point of interest first foremost at association also at political right a grounded on christian ideal of church on historic fact of anglo saxon race then national education sanitary dwelling house

supposed truth that praise of god alone be to be sought be to believe that child be intended to be taught a delicately gradually a possible painful fact that praise of men be not equally worth having to use critical faculty to discern praise of good men from praise of bad to seek former despise latter must say that last be more reasonable will say that if bring up child to care nothing for praise

mr maurice much to general increase of civilization throughout country be cause of fact be patent take delight in thus expressing consciousness of change must notice in tone of young gentleman not only at cambridge throughout britain be most wholesome most hopeful mean altered tone in speaking to of labouring class thirty year ago even later young men of labouring class be cad snob blackguard

from middle age up to latter year of french war relation between english gentry labourer seems to have be more cordial wholesome than in other country of europe with french revolution came change for worse revolution terrified too many of upper excited too many of lower class stern tory system of repression with bad habit of talking acting a if government people be necessarily in antagonism caused ever increasing bad blood besides old feudal tie between class class employer employed have be severed large mass of working people have gathered in manufacturing district in savage independence

principle founded on common humanity justice triumph of owe to courage practical good sense of whig party before example of court virtuous humane beneficent attitude of british upper class have undergone noble change there be aristocracy in world there never have be one a far a know have so honourably repented brought forth fruit meet for repentance have so cheerfully asked what duty be that might do be not merely enlightened statesman philanthropist devotee working clergy hard heartily a be working who have set to do good a duty specially required of by creed by station in generality of younger layman a far a can see humanity in highest sense of word have be awakened bid fair in generation to abolish last remnant of class prejudice class grudge whole creed of young gentleman be

few son of squireens in remote province of parvenu who can not afford to recognize class from whence have risen in army thanks to purifying effect of crimean indian war same altered tone be patent officer feel for with men talk to strive to instruct amuse more more year by year a proof that reform have not be forced on officer by public opinion from without be spontaneous from within instance of altered mind of aristocracy improvement be greatest in regiment be officered by men of best blood in care for sympathy with men majesty footguards stand first of god grant that friendship exists there between leader led may not be tested to death amid snow drift on battle field if be so know too that will stand test if wish for one absolute proof of changed relation between upper lower class have only to point to volunteer movement in in face of most real fatal danger addington ministry be afraid of allowing volunteer regiment lord eldon while pressing necessity must use a argument if people did not volunteer for government must against so broad be even then gulf between governed governor how much broader did become in after year have invasion threatened at period between even later must ministry have dared to allow volunteer regiment must have be justified in doing so even if have dared now what have come to pas world know world must know likewise that never must have come to pas save for not merely late twenty year of good government in state twenty year of virtue liberality in court late twenty year of increasing right mindedness in gentry who have now reward in finding that private in great majority of corp prefer being officered by men of rank socially superior to own a good always breed fresh good so volunteer movement made possible by goodwill between class will help in turn to increase goodwill already by performance of common duty experience of common humanity volunteer corp be become centre of cordiality between class class gentleman tradesman workman more see of other learn to like to trust to befriend other more more good work in hope volunteer of university of cambridge will do part like men gentleman when leaving university become of a ought organizing point for fresh volunteer in own district know may return to cambridge better example of way in altered tone of upper class volunteer movement have acted reacted upon other than may be seen in cambridge working men college volunteer rifle corp th cambridgeshire there have what perhaps must not have existed what certainly did not exist twenty year ago school of hundred men more taught for last eight year gratuitously by men of highest attainment in university by dean to whom believe success of attempt be mainly owing by professor tutor prizemen men who be now head master of public school who have given freely to fellow men knowledge have cost large sum of money heavy labour of year without insulting by patronage without interfering with religious opinion without tampering with independence in wise simply on ground of common humanity have be helping to educate men belonging for most part presume to very class book set forth a most unhappy most dangerous men conscious of unsatisfied unemployed intellect have reward in practical patent form out of men volunteer corp be organized officered partly by partly by gentleman of university nucleus of discipline loyalty civilization for whole population of cambridge noble work have be one may be parent of work nobler still be first instalment of will not say debt duty university owe to working class have tried to express in book what know be twenty year ago feeling of clever working men looking upon superior educational advantage of class can not forget more than working man that university be not founded exclusively even primarily for own class that great mass of student in middle age be drawn from lower class sizarships scholarship exhibition so forth be founded for sake of class rather than of own how case stand now know blame university for change have come about think simply by competition change began must say in sixteenth century then after war of rose revival of letter dissolution of monastery younger son of gentleman betook to pursuit of letter fighting having become treasonable farming on small scale difficult perhaps owing to introduction of large sheep farm happened in day while monastic order be left to recruit university a did continually through middle age from labouring class to scholar principally belonged so gentleman son be free to compete against son of working men by virtue of superior advantage beat out of field may find through latter half of sixteenth beginning of seventeenth century bequest after bequest for purpose of stopping change of enabling poor men son to enter university tendency be too strong to be effectually resisted then be too strong to be resisted now doe not increased civilization education of working class call on university to consider whether may not now try to become what certainly be meant to be place of teaching training for genius of rank not merely for of young gentleman why must not wealthy churchman in addition to many good deed in employ wealth now day found fresh scholarship exhibition confined to son of working men if be asked how can be so confined what simpler method than of connecting with national society bestowing exclusively on lad who have distinguished in national school believe that money spent in such way must be well spent for nation church university a for introduction of such class of lad lowering tone of university can not believe there be room enough in cambridge for men of rank there be still in certain college owing to circumstance must be very sorry to see altered fair sprinkling of young men who at least before have passed through cambridge career must not be called well bred lower tone of university tone of university raise wherever there be intellectual power good manner be easily acquired public opinion of young men express so freely possibly coarsely that priggishness forwardness fault to clever national school pupil must be most prone be soon hammered out of cambridge man result be that of most distinguished most popular men in cambridge be men who have risen from rank honour to for having done so if have succeeded so well may there not be hundred more in england who must succeed equally must not be a just to many a useful to university in binding to people people to to invent method for giving hundred fair chance earnestly press suggestion especially at present time of agitation among churchman on subject of education upon attention not of university of wealthy men who wish well to university to people not say of university be not from that proposal must come from friend outside be doing best with tool have fresh work will require fresh tool trust such will be day found for have now to tell of who may read book that be not altogether out of date political passion last outburst of described have thank god become mere matter of history by reason of good government unexampled prosperity of last twelve year fresh outburst of be always possible in free country whenever there be considerable accumulation of neglect wrong meanwhile be well indeed be necessary for student of history to know what manner of men be who become revolutionary what cause drive to revolution that may judge discerningly charitably of fellow men whenever see rising however madly against power be a for social evil described in book have be much lessened in last few year especially by movement for sanatory reform must warn young men that be not eradicated that for instance only last year attention be called by book to working tailor in edinburgh state be found be assured to be even more miserable than of london men in must warn also that social evil like dust dirt have tendency to re accumulate perpetually so however well generation may have swept house have worked hard honestly at rising generation will have assuredly in twenty year time to sweep over again one thing more have to say very earnestly to young men of cambridge will hear conservative reaction talked of a imminent indeed a having already begun will be told that reaction be made more certain by event now passing in north america will be bidden to look at madness of unbridled democracy to draw from such lesson a young spartan be to draw from drunken helot to shun with horror further attempt to enlarge suffrage if have learnt a must from training of university accuracy of thought language will not be content with such vague general term a conservatism democracy will ask if conservative reaction be at hand what thing be likely to conserve still more what ought to conserve if violence tyranny of american democracy be to be really warning to then in what point doe american democracy coincide with british democracy for so far farther can one be example warning for other looking a probably will under pressure of present excitement at latter question first will surely see that real analogy must exist between american english democracy even be universal suffrage to be granted to morrow for american democracy being merely arithmocratic provides representation whatsoever for more educated more experienced minority leaf conduct of affair to uneducated inexperienced many with such result a see result be believe simply impossible in country posse hereditary monarchy house of lord to give not only voice practical power to superior intelligence experience mr j s mill mr stapleton mr hare have urged of late right of minority to be represented a well a majority have offered plan for giving fair hearing that demand be wise a well a just present condition of federal state prof too painfully must not forget meanwhile that minority of britain be not altogether unrepresented in hereditary monarch who have power to call into counsel private public highest intellect of land in house of lord not wholly hereditary recruited perpetually from below by most successful therefore on whole most capable personage in free press conducted in most powerful organ by men of character of liberal education see safeguard against american tyranny of number even if enlargement of suffrage did degrade general tone of house of common a much a expect a long believe a throne house of lord press be what thank god be so long will enlargement of suffrage be fresh source not of danger of safety for will bind mass to established order of thing by loyalty spring from content from sense of being appreciated trusted dealt with not a child a men there be who will consider such language a especially ill timed just now in face of strike trade union outrage point to thing a proof of unfitness of workman for suffrage point especially to late abominable murder at sheffield ask not without reason must give political power to men who must do now that sheffield murder be in wise planned commanded by trade union in general believe think doe one else who know aught of british workman if be not a of sheffield men say private act of revenge be act of only one two trade union of town be known conduct have be already reprobated denounced by other trade union of england there be denying that case a against trade union be heavy one be notorious that have in past year planned commanded illegal act of violence be patent that be too apt from false sense of class honour to connive at such now instead of being a ought to be first to denounce workman will not see that by combining in society for certain purpose make society responsible for good lawful behaviour of member in act tending to further purpose be bound to say to man joining trade union will hing to carry out object have in view save what be allowed by british law will not see that be outraging first principle of justice freedom by dictating to man what wage must receive what master will work for other condition interferes with right a free agent in face of fact very painful disappointing be to will ask upper class do believe that average of trade union member be capable of such villanies a at sheffield do believe that average of be given to violence illegal act at even though may connive at such act in foolish hasty fellow by false class honour not quite unknown must say in certain learned gallant profession do fancy that there be not in trade union ten of thousand of loyal respectable rational patient men a worthy of suffrage a average borough voter if do so really know nothing about british workman at least be confounding workman of with workman of fancying that alone of class have gained nothing by increased education civilization political experience of thirty busy prosperous year be unjust to workman more be unjust to own class for thirty year past gentleman lady of shade of opinion have be labouring for among working class a aristocracy on earth ever laboured before do suppose that labour have be in vain that have bred in working class increased reverence for law increased content with existing institution increased confidence in class socially above if so must have a poor opinion of capability of upper class a have of of lower so far from misdoings of trade union being argument against extension of suffrage be in opinion argument for know be in minority just now know that common whisper be now not especially of who look for conservative reaction that trade union must be put down by strong measure confess hear such language with terror punish by mean most severely individual offence against individual freedom personal safety interfere surely with trade union try to bar men of right a free englishman to combine if choose for what consider own benefit look upon struggle between employer employed a fair battle in by virtue of irreversible law of political economy party who be in right be almost certain to win interfere in wise save to see fair play lawful mean used on side alike if do more if interfere in wise with trade union will fail fail doubly will not prevent existence of combination will only make secret dark revolutionary will demoralize working man thereby a surely a merchant be demoralized by being converted into smuggler will heap up indignation spite wrath against day of wrath finally to complete own failure will drive working man to demand extension of suffrage in tone will very certainly get hearing care seems to care little about suffrage now just because think that can best serve own interest by working trade union take from mean of redress real mistaken matter will seek redress in way in wish still le to seek by demanding vote obtaining one consummation undesirable a may seem to many must perhaps be best for peace of trade trade union still tainted with of violence secrecy false political economy inherit from evil time of last on simply believe because workman feel that be only organ that have other mean of making want opinion known to british government have vote belief believe with must send at least few men to parliament who must state case fairly in house of common must not only render reason for hear reason against if need be must be content with free discussion if must get that be feeling that can not get drive often into crooked dark way if answer that representative whom must choose must be merely noisy demagogue believe to be mistaken one can have watched preston strike however much may have disapproved a did of strike without seeing from temper self restraint reasonableness chivalrous honour of men that be a likely to choose worthy member for house of common a town constituency in england one can have watched leader of working men for last ten year without finding among men capable of commanding attention respect of house of common not merely by eloquence surprising a be by good sense good feeling good breeding training at first rubbing off of angle might require though two at least know who must require such training who must be ornament to house of common most inexperienced of rest must not give house one tenth trouble be given by certain clique among representative of sister isle must moreover learn lesson in week instead of never learning at like know too well yet catholic emancipation have pacified ireland though have brought into house inferior stamp of member much more surely must extension of suffrage pacify trade while must bring into house far superior stamp of member to who compose clique of have spoken why hear one say impatiently talk about subject of others at moment when nobody not even working class care about reform bill because be speaking to young men who have not yet entered public life because wish to understand just because question of parliamentary reform be in abeyance now will not be in abeyance ten year twenty year hence question will be revived ere be in maturity of manhood have best face certain prospect learn to judge wisely accurately on subject before be called on a will be to act upon if be true that present generation have done that can do intends to do towards suffrage have confidence in present ruler must submit without murmuring to decision on point be more incumbent on rising generation to learn how to do a assuredly will have to do work father have left undone question may remain long in abeyance under influence of material prosperity such a present under excitement of war a in pitt time let period of distress disaster come will be re opened a of yore progress towards institution more more popular may be slow be sure whenever class have conceived hope of being fairly represented be certain to fulfil own hope unless employ provokes violence impossible in england thing will be let young men of britain take care that be done rightly when be done how ought to be done will depend upon circumstance now future uncertain will depend upon pace at sound education spread among working class will depend too very much fear only too much upon attitude of upper class to lower in very question of trade union of strike will depend upon attitude toward unrepresented class during next few year upon very question of extended suffrage therefore must advise have almost said entreat young men over whom have influence to read think freely accurately upon subject taking if may propose to text book mr mill admirable treatise on representative government a for theory of own if have one must not put forward how will not be done can see clearly enough will not be done well by old charter will not be done well by merely lowering money qualification of elector may be done well by other method beside can trust freedom soundness of english mind to discover best method of when be needed let therefore conservative reaction suspect be going on in mind of many young men at cambridge consider what have to conserve be not asked to conserve throne thank god can take good care of let conserve house of lord will be conserved just in proportion a upper class will copy virtue of royalty of who be taken from of who be left let upper class learn from that just wise method of strengthening political power be to labour after social power come only by virtue usefulness let make a present sovereign have made morally necessary to people then there be fear of being found politically unnecessary other course be before if wish to make conservative reaction permanent even endurable fact if young gentleman fancy do that can strengthen class by making secret alliance with throne against mass then will discover rapidly that sovereign of house of brunswick be grown far too wise far too noble hearted to fall once more into trap if of do fancy that can better position by sneering whether in public in club at reformed house of common free press will only accelerate result most dread by forcing ultra liberal party of house what be even worse most intellectual respectable portion of press to appeal to people against if again be tempted a too many of be to give up public life a becoming too vulgar for prefer ease pleasure to hard work plain speaking of house of common then will simply pay same penalty for laziness fastidiousness have be paid by spanish aristocracy will discover that if think intellect unnecessary to nation nation will rapidly become of same opinion go own way without if be willing to make a easily can best educated most trustworthy most virtuous most truly liberal minded class of commonweal if will set to study duty of rank property a of profession to be called by god requirement of must fulfil if will acquire a can easily sound knowledge of political economy of social question of day if will be foremost with personal influence in good work if will set to compete on equal term with class below a may outrival then will find that class will receive not altogether on equal term that will accede to superiority undefined perhaps real practical enough to conserve class rank in article for just prudent man must wish if young gentleman look forward a fear few do still to conservative reaction of other kind than to even least return to tory maxim method of george fourth time to even least stoppage of what world call progress must define a putting in practice result of inductive science then do like king picrochole in rabelais look for kingdom will be restored to at coming of cocqcigrues cocqcigrues be never coming none know that better than present able moderate leader of conservative party none will be more anxious to teach fact to young adherent to make swim with great stream lest toss contemptuously ashore upon bank go on way unheeding return to system of be thank god impossible even though men heart must fail must onward know not whither though god doe know bigot who belief in system not in living god sentimentalist who shrink from fact because be painful to taste sluggard who hate change because disturbs ease simply stupid person who can not use eye ear may cry feebly to world to do what have never done since creation stand still awhile that may get breath brave honest gentleman who belief that god be not tempter deceiver father educator of man will not shrink even though pace may be at moment rapid path be at moment hid by mist for will believe that freedom knowledge a well a virtue be daughter of most high will follow call on rest to follow whithersoever may lead will take heart for for class by example of great prince who be of late gone home for if like most royal soul will follow with single eye steadfast heart freedom knowledge virtue then will be safe a royalty be safe in england now because god man have need thereof preface written in addressed to working men of great britain friend since wrote book five year ago have seen good deal of class of prospect much that have seen have given great hope much have disappointed nothing have caused to alter opinion here laid down much have given hope especially in north of england believe that there at least exists mass of prudence self control genial sturdy manhood will be england reserve force for generation yet to come last five year moreover have certainly be year of progress for good cause great drag upon namely demagogism have crumbled to piece of own accord seems

only possible under despotism of pharaoh since th of april one of most lucky day english workman ever saw trade of mob orator have dwindled down to such last shift a to working man sensibly seems

course to thought feeling of hero be compounded of right wrong such a judged working men whom be proud to number among friend have assured that judged rightly that working man of genius must feel during course of self education thought feeling often inconsistent contradictory to other stupid careless ill willed person have represented a own opinion having a seems to turned book upside down

brother brother wife daughter from degradation be to withdraw custom from slopseller to deal even at temporary increase of price with associate workman have done so can answer for in london a in country town paltry temptation of buying in cheapest market have still be too strong for labouring man in scotland in north of england thank god case have be very different to north must look still a

be just a wise a righteous reform bill a england have yet have be likely to have frankly say that experience of last five year give little hope of great development of true democratic principle in

lined road for mile great root of london running far out into country up poured past endless stream of food merchandise human being sap of huge metropolitan life tree how turn of road opened fresh line of terrace villa till hope deferred made heart sick country seemed like place where rainbow touch ground el dorado of raleigh guiana settler always little farther off how between gap in house right left caught tantalizing glimpse of green field shut from by dull line of high spiked paling how peeped through gate over fence at trim lawn garden longed to stay admire speculate on name of strange plant gaudy flower then hurried on always expecting to find something still finer ahead something really worth stopping to look at till house thickened again into street found to disappointment in midst of town then more villa paling then village when must stop endless house at last did stop gradually people whom passed began to look more more rural more toil worn ill fed house ended cattle yard farm building appeared right left far away spread low rolling sheet of green meadow cornfield oh joy lawn with high elm fir green hedgerow delicate hue scent of fresh clover

selfishness went hurrying on again at last came to wood first real wood have ever seen not mere party of stately park tree growing out of smooth turf real wild copse tangled branch grey stem fallen across other deep ragged underwood of shrub great fern like prince feather gay bed of flower blue pink yellow with butterfly flitting about trailer climbed dangled from bough to bough poor commonplace bit of copse dare say in world eye to fairy wilderness of beautiful form mysterious gleam shadow teeming with manifold life a stood looking wistfully over gate alternately at inviting vista of green embroidered path then at grim notice over head trespasser prosecuted young man came up ride dressed in velveteen jacket leather gaiter sufficiently bedrabbled with mud fishing rod basket bespoke sort

description of said wood must follow be most incompetent person in world to write indeed whole scene be so novel to that have time to analyse must only enjoy recollect lying on face fingering over

earth answer of poor gamin in st giles who when be asked what country be answered yard where gentleman live when go out of town significant that pathetic then wondered whether time must ever come when society must be far enough advanced to open to even such a glimpse if be only once year of fresh clean face of god earth then became aware of soft mysterious hum above around turned on back to look whence proceeded saw leaf gold green transparent in sunlight quivering against deep height of empyrean blue hanging in sunbeam pierced foliage thousand insect like speck of fire poised motionless on thrilling wing darted away returned to hang motionless again wondered what eat whether thought about anything whether enjoyed sunlight then that brought back to time when used to lie dreaming in crib

for to hear to take out with to mediterranean a secretary s'il y avait la de la morale of course yes of course too tailor boy be not expected to understand french most absurd thing be how everybody except perhaps dark lady seemed to take for granted that felt exceedingly honoured must consider a matter of course greatest possible stretch of kindness thus to talk over settle everything for a if

under direction passed that morning two three following delightfully question whether good dean must have be well satisfied have known how scientific teaching confirmed democratic opinion mere fact must understand thing when be set before a well a one else be to simple demonstration of equality in worth therefore in privilege of class may be answered that have right to argue from to mob that other working genius have right to demand universal enfranchisement for whole class just because exception be fit for surely be hard to call error if be one insolent assumption of democratic conceit c c doe not look more like humility of men who be unwilling to assert for peculiar excellence peculiar privilege who like apostle of old want glory save can share with outcast slave let society among other matter take note of chapter xvi cultivated woman be thus brought in contact for first time in life with two exquisite specimen of cultivated womanhood naturally a reader may well suppose almost entirely engrossed thought interest lillian for so must call became daily more more agreeable tried a fancied to draw out show off to best advantage whether from desire of pleasing pleasing know not wish to know consequence to boyish vanity be such a be more easy to imagine than pleasant to describe miss staunton on other hand became thought more more unpleasant not that ever for moment outstepped bound of most perfect courtesy manner be soft to one except to lord lynedale be when spoke to especially dictatorial abrupt seemed to make point of carping at chance word of mine of setting down suddenly by breaking in with severe pithy observation on conversation to have be listening unobserved seemed too to view with dislike anything like cordiality between lillian dislike be actually at moment vain enough such creature be man to attribute to jealousy till began to suspect hate a proud harsh exclusive aristocrat suspicion hatred received confirmation when one morning after evening even more charming than usual lillian came down reserved peevish sulky showed that bright heaven of sunny feature have room in for cloud that ugly one poor fool only pitied made up mind that one have ill used looked on a martyr perhaps to harsh cousin of hers day be taken up with writing out answer to dean searching question on pamphlet in believe acquitted tolerably seemed far more satisfied with commentary than be with text seemed to ignore utterly anything like religion even very notion of god in chain of argument nature be spoken of a wilier producer of marvel describes word in book to

that did not consider defect at be in wise anxious to weaken antithesis between natural revealed religion science may help former have absolutely nothing to do with latter stand on own ground have own law be own reward christianity be matter of faith of teaching of church must not go out of way for science science must not go out of way for where seem to differ be duty to believe that be reconcilable by fuller knowledge not to clip truth in order to make match with doctrine mr carlyle said miss staunton in abrupt way can see that god of nature be god of man nobody denies that dear except in word action else why do not write about nature a if be expression of living loving spirit not merely dead machine may be very easy dear for deist like mr carlyle to see god in nature if must accept truth of christianity must find that there be deeper mystery in than tree animal can explain pardon sir said think that very large portion of thoughtful working men agree with though in case opinion have only increased difficulty about christianity complain that can not identify god of bible with god of world around one of great complaint against christianity be that demand assent to mystery be independent of even contradictory to law of nature old man be silent mr carlyle be deist said miss staunton be sure that unless truth of christianity contrive soon to get justified by law of science higher order will believe in a little a mr locke informs that working class do prophesy confidently darling oh eleanor be in one of prophetic mood to night said lillian slyly have be foretelling know not what misery misfortune just because choose to amuse in own way gave sly pouting look at eleanor then called to look over engraving chatting over so charmingly stealing now then pretty saucy look at cousin seemed to say will do what like in spite of prediction confirmed suspicion that eleanor have be trying to separate suspicion received further corroboration indirect perhaps very unfair from lecture got from cousin after went up stair have be flattering very much lately about impression be making on family tormenting by compliment on clever way in played card when denied indignantly such intention patting on back laughing down in knowing way a much a to say that be not to be taken in by profession of simplicity seemed to judge one by to have notion of middle character between mere green horn deliberate schemer to night after commencing with usual compliment went on now first let give one hint be thankful for mind game with eleanor miss staunton be regular tyrant happen to know strong minded woman with vengeance manages one here unless be in good book expect to keep footing in house boy so just mind pay little more attention miss lillian little le after be

attended service daily have be appalled rather than astonished by what saw heard unintelligible service irreverent gabble of chorister reader scanty congregation meagre portion of vast building seemed to be turned to use never more than that evening did feel desolateness doleful inutility of vast desert nave with aisle transept built for purpose other now extinct whole place seemed to crush sadden must not re echo lillian remark how pillar rising story above story line of pointed arch lead eye heavenward be beautiful notion that about pointed architecture being symbolic of christianity ought to be very much ashamed of stupidity answered can not feel that though believe ought to do so that vast groined roof with enormous weight of hanging stone seems to crush one to bar out free sky above

especially might do more for people listen to little mr locke laity now day take pride in speaking evil of clergy never seeing that if be bad laity have made so why what do impute to worldliness being like world like laity round like in short improve yourselves by so doing if there be sad tendency in clergy to imitate will mend if find that after be who will have to mend with people so with priest ' be everlasting law when fifty year ago class be drunkard from statesman to peasant clergy be drunken also not so bad a laity now laity be eaten up with covetousness ambition clergy be covetous ambitious not so bad a laity laity working men especially be dupe of frothy insincere official rant a mr carlyle must call in parliament on hustings at debating society chartist meeting therefore clergyman sermon be apt to be just what people like elsewhere what therefore suppose people will like there if then answered in spite of opinion confess clergy to be so bad why be so angry with men of opinion if do plot sometimes little against church think know what opinion be mr locke did not hear just now praising monastery because be socialist democratic why be badness of clergy reason for pulling down church be of confused irrationality into allow yourselves to fall what do mean by cry shame on man for being bad clergyman if good clergyman be not good thing if very idea of clergyman be abominable a church destroyer ought to say ought to praise man for being bad one not acting out same abominable idea of priesthood very outcry against sin of clergy show that even in mind dim notion

come when will find that clergy be only class who can help ah may shake head warn of be only bulwark of poor against mediaeval tyranny of rank will find only bulwark against modern tyranny of mammon be on point of entreating to explain further at critical moment lillian interposed now stay prophetic glance into future here come lynedale papa in moment eleanor whole manner countenance altered petulant wild unrest harsh dictatorial tone vanished turned to meet lover with look of tender satisfied devotion transfigured whole face be most strange power have over presence even at distance seemed to fill whole being with rich quiet life watched with folded hand like mystic worshipper waiting for afflatus of spirit suspicious angry a felt towards must not help being drawn to by revelation of depth of strong healthy feeling of usual manner gave so little sign conversation thoroughly puzzled showed that there might be two side to question of people cause a well a to of others shook little faith in infallibility of own class to hear such severe animadversion on from person who professed a much disciple of carlyle a working man who evidently have lack of intellect to comprehend boldness to speak out doctrine who must praise old monastery for being democratic socialist spoke far more severely of clergy than must have done because did not deal merely in trite word of abuse showed real analytic insight into cause of short coming that same evening conversation happened to turn on dress of miss staunton spoke scornfully disparagingly a mere useless vanity frippery empty substitute for real beauty of person a well a higher beauty of mind emboldened by courtesy with be always called on to take share in everything be said done ventured to object humbly enough to

conversation have heard from publisher read letter to poem be on whole much liked most satisfactory method of publishing for party must be by procuring so many subscriber agreeing to take so many copy in consideration of dean known literary judgment great influence publisher must a private favour not object to take risk of further expense so far everything sounded charming method be not very independent one be only one must actually have delight of having published volume ala thought that sale of book might be greatly facilitated if certain passage of strong political tendency be omitted did not wish personally to object to a statement of fact to pictorial vigour with be expressed thought that be somewhat too strong for present state of public taste though must be last to allow private consideration to influence weak patronage of rising talent yet considering present connexion must hardly wish to take on responsibility of publishing such passage unless with great
