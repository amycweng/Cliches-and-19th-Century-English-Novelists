of thing simply at hap hazard be obliged from sort of self respect to have rule other true false charles be very fond of maxim have already enunciated that must measure people by what be not by what be not have great notion of loving one of looking kindly on one be pierced with sentiment have seen in popular volume of poetry christian soul though worn soil 'd with sinful clay be yet to eye see

most tiresome odious road ever have occasion to traverse to return to story such be reding sheffield on other hand without possessing real view of thing more than charles be at time fonder of hunting for view more in danger of taking up false one be be viewy in bad sense of word be not satisfied intellectually with thing a be be critical impatient to reduce thing to system pushed principle too far be fond of argument partly from pleasure in exercise partly because be perplexed though did not lay anything very much to heart of felt special interest in controversy going on in university country about high low church sheffield have sort of contempt for reding felt to be bad taste to be unusual prominent in anything eton acquaintance have asked to go hear one of principal preacher of catholic party offered to introduce have declined did not like said mixing up with party have come to oxford to get degree not to take up opinion thought father must not relish moreover felt little repugnance to such opinion such people under notion that authority of university be opposed to whole movement must not help looking at leader a demagogue towards demagogue felt unmeasured aversion contempt did not see why clergyman however respectable must be collecting undergraduate about heard story of way of going on did not please moreover did not like specimen of follower whom fell in with be forward talked strong a be called did ridiculous extravagant act sometimes neglected college duty for thing did not concern be unfortunate certainly for be very unfair account of most exemplary men of day who doubtless be still a clergyman layman strength of anglican church in collection of men straw rubbish a lord bacon say float on top while gold jewel sink be hidden what be more apposite still many men most men be compound of precious worthless together worthless swim precious lie at bottom chapter iv bateman be one of composite character have much good much cleverness in be absurd afforded subject of conversation to two friend a proceeded on walk wish there be le of fudge humbug everywhere said sheffield one might shovel off cartload from place not miss if have way answered charles must scrape off road till there be nothing to walk on be forced to walk on what call humbug put under foot use can not think that be like doing evil that good may come see sham everywhere go into st mary hear men spouting out commonplace in deep shrill voice with slow clear quiet emphasis significant eye a bampton preacher not long ago who assured apropos of resurrection of body 'all attempt to resuscitate inanimate corpse by natural method have hitherto be experimentally abortive ' go into place where degree be given convocation think there one hears deal of unmeaning latin for hour grace dispensation proctor walking up down for nothing in order to keep up sort of ghost of thing passed away for century while real work might be done in quarter of hour fall in with bateman talk to of rood loft without rood piscinae without water niche without image candlestick without light mass without popery till feel with shakespeare world stage well go to shaw turner brown very different men pupil of dr gloucester know whom mean tell that ought to put up crucifix by wayside in order to excite religious feeling well really think be hard on people said charles be very much like declamation must destroy external of kind be like man in one of miss edgeworth novel who shut ear to music that might laugh at dancer what be music to close ear asked sheffield to meaning of various act answered charles pious feeling accompanies sight of image be music to who have pious feeling certainly said sheffield to put up image in england in order to create feeling be like dancing to create music think be hard upon england replied charles be religious people well will put differently do like music ought to know said charles whom have frightened so often with fiddle do like dancing to tell truth said charles do said sheffield make laugh to think what have done when boy to escape dancing there be something so absurd in one have to be civil to duck to young girl who be either prim pert have behaved quite rudely to sometimes then have be annoyed at ungentlemanlikeness not known how to get out of scrape well did know be so like other in anything said charles oh misery have endured in having to stand up to dance to walk about with partner everybody looking at so awkward have be torture to day before after have by time come up to foot of rough rising ground lead to sort of table land on edge of oxley be placed stood still awhile to see equestrian take hurdle then mounted hill looked back upon oxford perhaps call beautiful spire tower sham said charles because see top not bottom whereabouts be in argument said other reminded that have be wandering from for last ten minute oh recollect know what be at be saying that liked music did like dancing music lead person to dance not dancing doe not increase diminishes intensity of pleasure find in music in like manner be mere piece of pedantry to make religious nation like english more religious by placing image in street be not english way only offends if be way must come naturally without one telling a music incites to dancing so religion must lead to image a dancing doe not improve music to who like dancing so ceremony improve religion to who like ceremony then do mean said charles that english romanists be sham because use crucifix stop there said sheffield now be getting upon different subject believe that there be virtue in image that indeed be absurd in make quite consistent in honouring put up image a outward show merely to create feeling in mind of beholder a gloucester must do in good downright earnest worship image a being more than seem a being not mere outside show pay religious worship a having be handled by great saint year ago a having be used in pestilence a having wrought miracle a having moved eye bowed head at least a having be blessed by priest be brought into connection with invisible grace be superstitious be real charles be not satisfied image be mode of teaching said do mean to say that person be sham merely because mistake particular mode of teaching best suited to own country did not say that dr gloucester be sham answered sheffield that mode of teaching of be among protestant sham humbug principle will carry too far destroy said charles recollect what thompson quoted other day out of aristotle have lately begun in lecture with vincent thought so acute that habit be created by very act in manifest when created learn to swim well by trying to swim now bateman doubtless wish to introduce piscinae tabernacle to wait before beginning till be received be like not going into water till can swim well what be bateman better when piscinae be universal asked sheffield what doe mean in romish church have use know know what come into mass if bateman make piscinae universal among have achieved reign of universal humbug dear sheffield answered reding consider how many thing there be in course of time have altered original meaning yet have meaning though changed one still judge wig be sham yet have history queen at coronation be said to wear roman catholic vestment be that sham doe not still typify impress upon 'divinity that doth hedge king ' though have lost very meaning church of rome gave be of number of who according to witticism think majesty when deprived of external jest then defend introduction of unmeaning piscinae candlestick think answered charles that there be great difference between reviving retaining may be natural to retain even while use fails unnatural to revive when have failed be question of discretion judgment then give against bateman said slight pause ensued then charles added perhaps men actually do wish to introduce reality a well a external perhaps wish to use piscina a well a to have sheffield continued abruptly why be not canonicals sham if piscinae be sham canonicals said sheffield a if thinking about canonicals be sham for preaching suppose be highest ordinance in church have richest dress robe of great preacher cost know many pound for there be one near who on leaving have present from lady of entire set dozen pair of worked slipper into bargain be fitting if preaching be great office of clergy next come sacrament have surplice hood hood repeated musing what be for be scarf hood be worn in university pulpit what be scarf belongs to chaplain believe be to person ca make view out of dear sheffield said charles have cut own throat here have be trying to give sense to clerical dress can not be then prepared to call sham answer single question why doe clergyman wear surplice when read prayer nay will put more simply why can only clergyman read prayer in church why can not sheffield hesitated looked serious do know said have just pitched on jeremy bentham objection in 'church of englandism ' proposes if recollect rightly that parish boy must be taught to read liturgy asks why send person to university for three four year at enormous expense why teach latin greek on purpose to read what boy must be taught to read at dame school what be virtue of clergyman reading something of kind bentham say added slowly to tell truth know how to answer reding be surprised shocked puzzled too did not know what to say when conversation be perhaps fortunately interrupted chapter v year brings change reform know what be state of oxley church now may have rood loft piscina sedilia new may be reformed backwards seat on principle turning from communion table pulpit planted in middle of aisle at time when two young men walked through churchyard there be nothing very good very bad to attract

though feeling at first awkward on finding with two such different friend in two such different relation be after time partially restored to by unconcern of mr malcolm three walked home together yet even to last did not quite know how where to walk how to carry particularly when got near oxford fell in with various party who greeted in passing charles by way of remark said have be looking in at pretty little chapel on common be now in course of repair mr malcolm laughed so charles said be bit with new fashion charles coloured asked what fashion adding that friend by accident have taken in

be not person to let truth sleep in mind though did not vegetate very quickly be sure ultimately to be pursued into consequence to affect existing opinion in instance before saw sheffield principle be more le antagonistic to own favourite maxim that be duty to be pleased with one contradiction must not be real when affirmative be true negative be false doctrine must not be equally sound there be right wrong theory of dogmatic truth a opposed to latitudinarianism did not know name history suspect what be going on within have in course of first term gradually begun to energise in mind let see absurdity of latitudinarian principle when carried out be likely to be still more opposed to bateman among peculiarity have notion that bringing person of contrary sentiment together be likeliest way of making party agreeable at least useful have done best to give breakfast to friend be invited element of perfection not however to own satisfaction for with effort have picked up mr freeborn young evangelical master with whom sheffield be acquainted sharp not very wise freshman who having be spoiled at home having plenty of money professed to be aesthetic kept college authority in perpetual

sheffield bateman say that church be one except when be two freeborn say that be two except when be one be relief at moment that cook boy came in with dish of hot sausage though relief be not diversion conversation proceeded two person did not like freeborn who be simply disgusted at doctrine reding who thought bore yet be bad luck of freeborn forthwith to set charles against a well a rest to remove repugnance have to engage in dispute freeborn in fact thought theology mistake a substituting a considered worthless intellectual notion for vital truth of religion so now went on to observe putting down knife fork that really be to inconceivable that real religion must depend on metaphysical distinction outward observance that be quite different thing in scripture that scripture said much of faith holiness hardly word about church form proceeded to say that be great evil tendency of human mind to interpose between creator self invented mediator did not matter at whether human device be rite creed form of prayer good work communion with particular church be flattering unction to soul if be considered necessary only safe way of using be to use with feeling that might dispense with that none of went to root of matter for faith be firm belief that god have forgiven be one thing needful where one thing be present everything else be superfluous that where be wanting nothing else availed so strongly did hold that confessed put pointedly still not untruly where true faith be present person might be anything in profession arminian calvinist episcopalian presbyterian swedenborgian nay unitarian must go further looking at white papist yet be in state of salvation freeborn came out rather more strongly than in sober moment must have approved be little irritated wished to have turn of speaking be altogether great testification thank for liberality to poor papist said white seems be safe if be hypocrite professing to be catholic while be protestant in heart unitarian too said sheffield be debtor to liberality seems man need not fear to believe too little so that feel good deal rather said white if belief forgiven need not believe anything else reding put in word said that in prayer book belief in holy trinity be represented not a accident a before thing necessary to salvation be not fair answer reding said sheffield what mr freeborn observed be that there be creed in bible answer that there be creed in prayer book then bible say one thing prayer book said bateman answered freeborn prayer book only deduces from scripture athanasian creed be human invention true human to be received a one of article expressly say because 'founded on scripture ' creed be useful in place so be church creed church be religion then why do make so much of doctrine of 'faith only said bateman for be not in scripture be human deduction doctrine cried freeborn why be in article article expressly say that be justified by faith only article be not scripture more than prayer book said sheffield do article say that doctrine propound be necessary for salvation added bateman be very unfair on freeborn though have provoked here be four person on at once silent fifth apparently sympathiser sheffield talked through malice white from habit reding came in because must not help bateman spoke on principle have notion that be improving freeborn view by process of badgering at least did not improve temper be suffering most of party be undergraduate freeborn be master be too bad of bateman finished in silence sausage have got quite cold conversation flagged there be rise in toast muffin coffee cup be put aside tea flowed freely chapter vii freeborn did not like to be beaten began again religion said be matter of heart one must interpret scripture rightly whose heart be not right till eye be enlightened to dispute about sense of scripture to attempt to deduce from scripture be beating about bush be like blind disputing about colour if be true said bateman one ought to argue about religion at be first to do so freeborn of course answered freeborn who have found truth be very person to argue for have gift very last person to persuade said sheffield for have gift to therefore true christian must argue with other with one else said bateman be very person who want said sheffield reasoning must be for unconverted not for converted be mean of seeking freeborn persisted that reason of unconverted be carnal such must not understand scripture have always thought said reding that reason be general gift though faith be special personal one if faith be really rational ought to see that be rational else from nature of case be not rational st paul say answered freeborn 'to natural man thing of spirit be foolishness how be to arrive at truth at said reding except by reason be appointed method for guidance brute go by instinct men by reason have fallen on difficult subject be somewhat puzzled except white who have not be attending be

sheffield indeed be very provoking bateman more good humoured than many person must have be in place meanwhile freeborn who have have gown in hand last two minute nodded to host took departure by white willis soon followed in company really said bateman to sheffield when be gone white in own way be so very rash in mode of speaking before other people too wished to teach freeborn little good catholicism have spoilt hoped something must have come out of breakfast only think of white will all out freeborn will tell to set be very bad very bad indeed friend be not much better never serious what must mean by saying that church be not one with romish be giving freeborn advantage sheffield looked provokingly easy leaning with back against mantelpiece coat tail almost playing with spout of kettle replied have most awkward team to drive then added looking sideways at with head back why have o most correct of men audacity to say that english church romish church be one must be so answered bateman there be one church creed say so must make two speak of doctrine said sheffield of fact did mean to say that there be two church to deny that there be one church denied fact that what be evidently two body be one body bateman thought awhile charles employed in scraping down soot from back of chimney with poker did not wish to speak be not sorry to listen to argument good fellow said bateman in tone of instruction be making distinction between church body quite comprehend say that there be two body yet one church if so church be not body something abstract mere name general idea be that meaning if so be honest calvinist be answered sheffield for if make two visible church english romish to be one church one church must be invisible not visible thus if hold abstract church hold invisible one see said bateman prove two church to be one said sheffield then will prove something else paradox said bateman of course answered sheffield huge one yours not mine prove english romish church to be in sense one will prove by parallel argument in same sense wesleyan be one be fair challenge bateman however suddenly put on demure look be silent be on sacred subject said at length in subdued tone be on very sacred subject must be reverent drew very long face sheffield laughed out must reding stand be cried sheffield be hard on what have done where did sacredness begin eat word oh meant nothing said charles indeed did not be more serious than seems do answer be interested really do wish to treat subject gravely said sheffield will begin again be very sorry indeed be let put objection more reverently bateman relaxed good sheffield said thing be irreverent not manner be irreverent to liken holy mother to wesleyan schismatics repent do indeed said sheffield be wavering of faith be very unseemly confess can say more look at wo do now tell do tell how be one body with romanists yet wesleyan not one body with bateman looked at be satisfied with expression of face be strange question for to ask said fancied be sharper fellow see that have apostolical succession a well a romanists romanists say answered sheffield that be not enough for unity that ought to be in communion with pope be mistake answered bateman be just what wesleyan say of retorted sheffield when wo acknowledge succession say be mistake succession cried bateman have succession yes have said sheffield have ministerial succession be apostolical answered bateman yes be evangelical succession of doctrine said sheffield doctrine evangelical cried bateman whoever heard be not enough doctrine be not enough without bishop succession be not enough without pope answered sheffield act against bishop said bateman not quite seeing whither be going act against pope said sheffield say that pope be necessary said bateman say that bishop be not necessary returned sheffield be out of breath paused to see where stood presently bateman said good sir be question of fact not of argumentative cleverness question be whether be not true that bishop be necessary to notion of church whether be not false that pope be necessary cried sheffield question be whether obedience to bishop be not necessary to make wesleyan one body with obedience to pope necessary to make one body with romanists maintain one deny other maintain maintain deny be consistent be inconsistent bateman be puzzled in word sheffield added succession be not unity more than doctrine not unity what then be unity asked bateman oneness of polity answered sheffield bateman thought awhile idea be preposterous said here have possession here be established since king lucius time since st paul preached here filling island one continuous church with same territory same succession same hierarchy same civil political position same church yes proceeded have very same fabric memorial of thousand year doctrine stamped perpetuated in stone mystical teaching of old saint have methodist to do with

solve charles be of different cast of temper new idea be not lost on did not distress if be obscure conflicted with habitual view of thing let work way find place shape within by slow spontaneous action of mind yet perplexity be not in pleasant state must have hastened removal have be able by mean of conversation such a have related to many others might be added spare reader patience from diversity of view met with in university have now come in course of year to one two conclusion not very novel very important first that there be great many opinion in world on most momentous subject secondly that be not equally true thirdly that be duty to hold true opinion fourthly that be uncommonly difficult to get hold of have be accustomed a have seen to fix mind on person not on opinion to determine to like what be good in one have now come to perceive that to say least be not respectable in great question to hold false opinion did not matter that such false opinion be sincerely held must not feel that respect for person who held what sheffield called sham with regarded who held reality white bateman be case in point be very good fellow must not endure unreal way of talking though did not feel to be unreal in like manner if roman catholic system be untrue so far be plain putting aside higher consideration that person who believed in power of saint prayed to be actor in great sham let be a sincere a must mistook word for thing so far forth must not respect more than respected white bateman so of unitarian if believed power of unaided human nature to be what be not if by birth man be fallen thought upright be holding absurdity might redeem cover blot by thousand excellence blot must remain just a must feel handsome man disfigured by loss of eye hand so again if professing christian made almighty being of simple benevolence be on contrary what church of england teach god who punishes for sake of justice person be making idol unreality object of religion apart from more serious thought about so far must not respect thus principle of dogmatism gradually became essential element in charles religious view gradually imperceptibly to for thought have be tracing only came on at spare time be taken up at interval from point at be laid down lecture other duty of place friend recreation be staple of day there be undercurrent ever in motion sounding in mental ear

concerned be moreover to marvel one did not agree with in taking simple natural view thought almost self evident attributed phenomenon be by mean uncommon to want of clearness of head twist of mind a case might be be popular preacher be though have few follower have numerous hearer on occasion church be overflowing with young men of place began sermon by observing that be not little remarkable that there be so few good reasoner in world considering that discursive faculty be one of characteristic of man nature a contrasted with brute animal have indeed be said that brute reasoned be analogical sense of word reason instance of very ambiguity of language confusion of thought on be animadverting in like manner say that reason why wind blow be that there be change of temperature in

to general notion of nut cracker perhaps have seen in particular instance in silver in steel at master table then descending have embodied thus obtained in shape of expedient of own devising be what have be said however might assume on present occasion that faculty of reasoning be characteristic of human specie being case certainly be remarkable that so few person reasoned well after introduction proceeded to attribute to defect number of religious difference in world said that most celebrated question in religion be verbal one that disputant did not know own meaning that of opponent that

in fact there be truth falsehood in received dogma in theology that be mode neither good bad in personal national periodic in intellect reasoned upon great truth of religion that fault lay not in holding in insisting on be like insisting on hindoo dressing like fin regiment of dragoon using boomarang proceeded to observe from what have said be plain in what point of view anglican formulary be to be regarded viz be mode of expressing everlasting truth might be a well expressed in other way a correct thinker must be able to see nothing then be to be altered in be to be retained in integrity be ever to be borne in mind that be anglican theology not theology in abstract that though athanasian creed be good for did not follow that be good for neighbour rather that what seemed very reverse

person be nought in religion that inward spirit faith a expressed be in with hint that nothing must go well in university till great principle be so far admitted a to lead member not indeed to give up own distinctive formulary to consider direct contradictory of equally pleasing to divine author of christianity charles did not understand full drift of sermon understood enough to make feel that be different from sermon have heard in life more than doubted whether if good father have heard must not have made exception to favourite dictum came away marvelling with what preacher must mean whether have misunderstood did mean that unitarian be only bad reasoner might be a good christian a orthodox believer must mean nothing else what if after be right indulged thought awhile then one be what sheffield call sham more le there be reason for being annoyed at one then be right originally in wishing to take one for what be let think one sham sham be respectable rather one be respectable ca do without outward form of belief one be not truer than be be equally true be true be better way of taking none be sham be true be true impossible one a true a why then be a true that lord be mere man a that be god must not possibly mean what did mean so charles went on painfully perplexed yet out of perplexity two conviction came upon first of painful too that must not take for gospel everything be said even by authority of place divine of name next that former amiable feeling of taking one for what be be dangerous one leading with little difficulty to sufferance of sort of belief legitimately

party who remained in oxford through long vacation be said mysteriously charles answered that if be against college rule there be help for else be reading for degree must like nothing better than to pas long vacation in oxford if might judge by pleasantness of last ten day be compliment mr reding to company said vincent at moment door opened in came manciple with dinner paper mr vincent have formally to run eye over watkins said giving back to almost think to day be one of fast of church go look watkins bring word astonished manciple who have never be sent on commission in whole career

charles found alone with college authority who began to speak to in more confidential tone mr reding said did not like to question before others conceive have particular meaning in praise of oxford in long vacation in mouth of must have be suspicious charles be surprise to tell truth mr reding a thing stand proceeded be often mark of party residence in vacation though of course there be nothing in thing what be perfectly natural right charles be attention good sir tutor proceeded avoid party be sure to avoid party be young in career among always feel anxious about young men of talent there be greatest danger of talent of university being absorbed in party reding expressed hope that nothing have done have given cause to tutor remark replied mr vincent yet with slight hesitation know that have have thought of remark question at lecture be like person pushing thing too far wishing to form system charles be so much taken aback by charge that unexplained mystery of long vacation went out of head said be very sorry obliged tried to recollect what must have said to give ground to mr vincent remark not being able at moment to recollect went on assure sir know so little of party in place hardly know leader have heard person mentioned if tried think must in case mismatch name opinion believe said vincent be young be cautioning against tendency may suddenly find absorbed before know where be charles thought good opportunity of asking question in detail about point puzzled asked whether dr brownside be considered safe divine to follow hold d see answered vincent that error be counterfeit of truth clever men say true thing mr reding true in substance sinking voice to whisper go too far might even be shown that sect be in one sense part of catholic church say true part be further question embody great principle quaker represent principle of simplicity evangelical poverty even have dress of own like monk independent represent right of laity wesleyan cherish devotional principle irvingites symbolical mystical high church party principle of obedience liberal be guardian of reason party then conceive be entirely right entirely wrong a to dr brownside there certainly have be various opinion entertained about divinity still be able man think will gain good gain good from teaching mind recommend yet respect consider that say many thing very well worth attention must advise then to accept good sermon offer without committing to bad depend upon mr reding be golden though obvious rule in matter charles said in answer that mr vincent be overrating power that have to learn before must judge that wished very much to know whether vincent must recommend book in might see at once what true church of england doctrine be on number of point perplexed mr vincent replied must be on guard against dissipating mind with such reading at time when university duty have definite claim upon ought to avoid controversy of day author of day must advise to read living author read dead author alone continued dead author be safe great divine stood upright be model 'there be giant on earth in day a king george third have once said of to dr johnson have that depth power gravity

then be so eloquent majestic hooker imaginative taylor brilliant learning of barrow strong sense of keen logic of chillingworth good honest old burnet etc etc there did not seem much reason why must stop at one moment more than at length however did stop be prose be pleasant prose to charles knew just enough about writer to feel interested in hearing talked about to vincent seemed to be saying good deal when in fact be saying very little when stopped charles said believed that there be person in university who be promoting study of author mr vincent looked grave be true said young friend have already hinted to that indifferent thing be perverted to purpose of party at moment name of of greatest divine be little better than watchword by opinion of living individual be signified opinion suppose charles answered be not to be found in author will not say that said mr vincent have greatest respect for individual in question be not denying that have done good to church by drawing attention in lax day to old church of england divinity be one thing to agree with gentleman laying hand on charles shoulder to belong to party make man master get good from think well of person will be wise man reding inquired with timidity if be not something like what dr brownside have said in university pulpit perhaps latter advocated toleration of opinion in different sense mr vincent answered rather shortly that have not heard dr brownside sermon for have be speaking only of person in own communion church said admitted of great liberty of thought within pale even greatest divine differed from other in many respect nay bishop taylor differed from be great principle in english church true child agree to differ in truth continued there be that robust masculine noble independence

of garden wall in careless magnificence shed fruit upon free earth for bird of air beast of field sort of cattle to eat thereof rejoice when charles came away tried to think what have gained by conversation with mr vincent not exactly what have wanted practical rule to guide mind keep steady still useful hint have already be averse to party offended at what saw of individual attached to vincent have confirmed in resolution to keep aloof from to attend to duty in place felt pleased to have have talk with what must mean by suspecting tendency in to push thing too far thereby to implicate in party be obliged to resign to ignorance on subject to be content with keeping watch over in future chapter xi opportunity have occurred of informing reader during last week two charles

arrived for forwarded from home be from willis dated from london announced that have come to very important decision must not return to oxford charles be fairly in world again plunged into whirl of opinion how sad contrast to tranquil home there be mistaking what letter meant set out at once with chance of finding writer at house from dated be lodging at west end of town reached about noon found willis in company with person apparently two three year older willis started on seeing who must have thought what brings here said thought be in country then to companion be friend be speaking to about happy meeting sit down dear reding have much to tell charles sat down suspense looking at willis with such keen anxiety that latter be forced to cut matter short reding be catholic charles threw back in chair turned pale dear reding what be matter with why speak to charles be still silent at last stooping forward with elbow on knee head on hand said in low voice o willis what have done done said willis what must do half oxford besides o reding be so happy ala ala said charles what be good of staying good attend willis good bye good reding leave so soon having found so unexpectedly have

have separated from for ever said have taken course keep ours path be different not so said willis must follow will be one still charles be half offended really must go said rose must not talk in manner pray forgive answered willis wo do so again must not help be not in common state be so happy thought struck reding tell willis said exact position in what sense be catholic what be to prevent returning with to oxford companion interposed be taking liberty perhaps said mr willis have be regularly received into catholic church have not introduced said willis reding let introduce mr morley morley mr reding yes reding owe to that be catholic have be on tour with abroad met with good priest in france who consented to receive abjuration well think might profitably have examined into state of mind little before did so said reding be not person to become catholic willis what do mean because answered reding be more of dissenter than catholic beg pardon added seeing willis look up sharply let be frank with pray do be attached to church of rome not a child to mother in wayward roving way a matter of fancy liking excuse a greedy boy to something nice pursued object by disobeying authority set over be a much a willis must bear said thought recollected text about obeying god rather than men see have disobeyed men retorted charles trust have be obeying god willis thought rude must not speak mr morley began if knew circumstance better said must doubtless judge differently consider mr willis to be just very person on whom be incumbent to join church who will make excellent catholic must blame not venerable priest who received good man saw devotion tear humility earnest desire state of mind learned through who speak french better than mr willis however have quite enough conversation with in french latin must not reject postulant for salvation be impossible have be must have done same well sir perhaps have be unjust to said charles however can not augur well of be judging sir answered mr morley let say of thing know know what catholic religion be know what grace be gift of faith speaker be layman spoke with earnestness more intense because quiet charles felt reproved by manner good taste suggested to that have be too vehement in presence of stranger yet did not feel le confidence in cause paused before answered then said briefly that be aware that did not know roman catholic religion knew mr willis must not help giving opinion that good must not come of have ever be catholic said mr morley so far can not judge of member of church of england know that catholic church be only true church may be wrong in many thing can not be wrong in too know that catholic faith be one that other church have faith church of england have faith dear sir have not faith be home thrust controversy of oxford passed before reding mind instantly recovered can not expect said smiling that almost boy must be able to argue with to defend church to explain faith be content to hold that faith to hold what hold without professing to be divine be doctrine have be taught at oxford be under teaching there be not yet taught excuse then if decline argument with with mr willis be natural must argue be equal understand other be theologian here willis cried out o dear reding what say be 'come see ' stand at door arguing enter great home of soul enter adore said reding surely god will to be guided by reason mean that reason be everything be at least something surely ought not to act without against be not doubt dreadful state said most perilous state state be safe that of faith can be safe to be without faith now have faith in church know well enough to know have not where then be willis have misunderstood most extraordinarily said charles ten thousand thought pas through mind if be safe to note down bring against man stray word suppose there be nothing may be accused of holding must be alluding to half sentence other of mine have forgotten be real sample of sentiment do mean have worship doe not worship presuppose faith have much to learn be conscious wish to learn from church under whose shadow lot be cast with whom be content confesses said willis that have faith confesses that be in doubt dear reding can sincerely plead that be in invincible ignorance after what have passed between now suppose for instant that catholicism be true be not certain that now have opportunity of embracing if be in state to die in reding be perplexed how to answer be must not with necessary quickness analyze put into word answer reason suggested to willis rapid interrogatory mr morley have kept silence lest charles must have two upon at once when willis paused charles did not reply interposed said that call in scripture be obeyed with promptitude by who be called that lord must not suffer one man even to go bury father reding answered that in case voice of christ be actually heard be on earth in bodily presence now however very question be be voice of christ whether church of rome did did not speak with voice of christ that surely ought to act prudently that christ must not wish to act otherwise for have doubt that be in place where providence wished to be even if have doubt whether christ be calling elsewhere have not if have must certainly think that christ called in way method of careful examination that prudence be divinely appointed mean of coming at truth prudence cried willis such prudence a st thomas suppose when determined to see before believing charles hesitated to answer see continued willis starting up seized arm come dear fellow come with directly let go to good priest who life two street off will be received very day on with hat before charles must show resistance be half out of room must not help laughing in spite of vexation disengaged arm deliberately sat down not so fast said be not quite sort of person willis looked awkward for moment then said well at least must go into retreat must go forthwith morley do know when mr de mowbray father agostino give next retreat reding be just what want just what oxford men want think will not refuse charles looked up in face smiled be not line said at length be on way to oxford must go came here to be of use to can be of none so must go must must be of service be hopeless oh make heart ache went on brushing hat with glove a if on point of rising yet loth to rise morley now struck in spoke all along like gentleman man of real piety with great ignorance of protestant how be to be treated excuse mr reding said if before go say one word feel very much for struggle be going on in mind be sure be not for such a to speak harshly unkindly to struggle between conviction motif of world be often long may have happy termination in case be offended if suggest to that dearest closest tie such a connexion with protestant church involves may be on side of world in certain case be sort of martyrdom to have to break such who do so have martyr reward then at university have so many inducement to fall in with prevailing tone of thought prospect success in life good opinion of friend thing be against be likely to choke good seed well must have wished that have be able to follow dictate of conscience at once conflict must continue appointed time will hope that will end well ca persuade good people thought charles a closed street door after be not in state of conviction struggling against how absurd here come to reclaim deserter be seized even bodily against will hurried into profession of faith do thing happen to people day be there particular fate with thus to be brought across religious controversy be not up to roman catholic what contrast with quiet hartley naming home a continued to think on have passed be still le satisfied with with have gone to lecture have be lectured have let out secret state of mind not let out have nothing to let out have indeed implied that be inquiring after religious truth protestant inquires must not be protestant if did not of course be seeking truth be duty to do so recollected distinctly tutor laying down on one occasion duty of private judgment be very difference between protestant catholic catholic begin with faith protestant with inquiry ought to have said to willis be provoked have not said must have simplified question shown how far be from being unsettled unsettled be most

said sheffield have in be coward fool coward answered charles thus divide world sheffield poor willis added one must respect man who act according to conscience what can know of conscience said idea of swallowing of own free will heap of rubbish catholic have to believe in cold blood tying collar round neck politely putting chain into hand of priest then confessional 't be marvellous began to break coal with poker be very well continued if man be born catholic suppose really believe what be obliged to profess how englishman gentleman man here at oxford with advantage can so eat dirt scraping picking up dead lie of dark age be miracle well if there be anything recommends romanism to said charles be what so much dislike 'd give twopence if one whom must trust must say to be true be not true ' must be saved eternal wrangling must be glad if st paul must come to life have often said to myself 'oh must ask st paul that ' catholic church be st paul quite guess said sheffield certainly not supposing did think have inspiration of apostle a roman catholic do what comfort must be to know beyond doubt what to believe about god how to worship please mean said ' ca believe that ' now ought to have said ' ca believe pope have power to decide that ' if have ought to believe be not to say ' ca believe ' sheffield looked hard at will have papist of fine day said nonsense answered charles must say such thing even in jest jest be in earnest be plainly on road well if be have put on said reding wishing to get away from subject a quick a must for be ever talking against sham laughing at king charles laud bateman white rood loft piscinas now be puseyite said sheffield in surprise give name of very good man whom hardly know by sight said reding mean that nobody know what to believe one have definite faith catholic puseyites one say 'this be true be false come from apostle doe not ' then must believe turk asked sheffield who came to with 'one allah mahomet prophet ' did not say creed be everything answered reding that religion must not be false have creed religion ca be true have none well somehow that doe strike said sheffield now there be vincent at end of term after have gone down continued charles know stayed up for littlego be very civil very civil indeed have talk with about oxford party pleased very much at time afterwards more thought of what said le be satisfied that be have got nothing definite from did not say 'this be true be false ' true be true be good be good go too far keep in mean have eye about eschew party follow divine of ' be putting salt on bird tail want practical direction not abstract truth vincent be humbug said sheffield dr pusey on other hand continued charles be said always to be decisive say 'this be apostolic be in father st cyprian say st augustine denies that be safe that be wrong bid forbid ' understand understand having duty put on be too much for understand dislike having will of own when have not mean to use justly in such case to tell to act of be like pharaoh setting israelite to make brick without straw setting to inquire to judge to decide forsooth be absurd who have taught puseyites be not always so distinct said sheffield there be smith never speaks decidedly in difficult question know man who be going to remain in italy for year at distance from english chapel must not help who came to ask if might communicate in catholic church must not get answer from must not say yes then wo have many follower be said charles have more than dr pusey answered sheffield well ca understand said charles ought not perhaps wo stay truth be said sheffield suspect be more of sceptic at bottom well honour man who build up said reding despise man who break down be inclined to think have wrong notion of building up pulling down answered sheffield coventry in 'dissertations make quite clear that christianity be not religion of doctrine who be coventry not know coventry be one of most original writer of day be american believe congregationalist oh assure must read coventry although be wrong on question of church government be not well au courant with literature of day unless do be party man be correspondent of first men of day stopped with dean of oxford when be in england who have published english edition of 'dissertations with preface lord newlights be said to be two most witty men at meeting of british association two year ago like lord newlights said charles seems to to have principle be fixed definite religious principle know where to find be what father think have often heard speak of be curious must use word principle said sheffield for be that coventry lay such stress on say that christianity have creed that be very point in be distinguished from other religion that will search new testament in vain for creed scripture be full of principle view be very ingenious seemed to true when read book according to then christianity be not religion of doctrine mystery if be looking for dogmatism in scripture be mistake charles be puzzled certainly said at first sight there be creed in scripture creed in scripture said slowly a if thinking aloud creed in scripture therefore there be creed athanasian creed added quickly be that in scripture be in scripture be not let see be there be not what be that freeborn said last term tell sheffield must dean of oxford say that creed be in scripture not perhaps fairly explain coventry view what be impression why will tell frankly impression be judging from preface that must not scruple to say that be not in scripture scholastic addition dear fellow said charles do mean that dignitary of church must say that athanasian creed be mistake because represented christianity a revelation of doctrine mystery to be received on faith well may be wrong said sheffield so understood after said charles sadly be not so much more than other dean forget name said at st mary before vacation be part of same system oh be after went down just at end of term go to sermon be inclined not to go either ca enter upon dean argument be not worth while well added standing up stretching be tired with day yet have not be fatiguing one london be so bustling place wish to say good night said sheffield charles did not deny charge friend parted chapter xv there must not have be lecture more unfavourable for charles peace of mind than in found term placed yet so blind be to future hailed with great satisfaction a if be to bring answer to perplexity into sheffield bateman freeborn white willis mr morley dr brownside mr vincent general state of oxford have in one way other conspired to throw have shown such ability in former part of year be reading so diligently that tutor put prematurely into lecture upon article be capital lecture so far a that tutor who gave have got up subject completely knew whole history of article how grew into present shape with what fortune what have be added when what omitted with of course be joined explanation of text a deduced a far a must be from historical account thus given not only british foreign reformer be introduced nothing be wanting at least in intention of lecturer for fortifying young inquirer in doctrine discipline of church of england did not produce effect on reding whether have expected too much be cause so be that did feel more vividly sentiment of old father in comedy after consulting lawyer incertior sum multo quam ante saw that profession of faith contained in article be patchwork of bit of orthodoxy lutheranism calvinism zuinglism too on principle that be work of accident if there be such thing a accident that have come down in particular shape in english church now receives when might have come down in other shape that be toss up anglican at day be not calvinist presbyterian lutheran equally well a episcopalian historical fact did clench difficulty rather impossibility of saying what faith of english church be on almost point of dispute authoritative standard of doctrine be vague inconsistent there be imposing weight of external testimony in favour of opposite interpretation stopped after lecture once twice asked information of mr upton tutor who be quite ready to give nothing came of application a regard object led to make one difficulty charles experienced be to know whether according to article divine truth be directly given whether have to seek for from scripture several article led to question mr upton who be high churchman answered that saving doctrine be given be to be sought that be proposed by church proved by individual charles did not see distinction between seeking proving for how can prove except by seeking in scripture for reason put question in form asked if christian religion allowed of private judgment be abstruse question very practical one have asked wesleyan independent must have have unconditional answer in affirmative have asked catholic must have be told that used private judgment to find church then in matter of faith church superseded from oxford divine must not get distinct answer first be told that doubtless must use judgment in determination of religious doctrine next be told that be sin a undoubtedly be to doubt dogma of blessed trinity yet while be told that to doubt of doctrine be sin be told in conversation that highest state here be one of doubt what did mean surely certainty be simply necessary on point a on object of worship how must worship what doubted of two act be contrasted by evangelist when disciple saw lord after resurrection worshipped doubted yet in spite of be told that there be impatience in very idea of desiring certainty at time asked whether anathema of athanasian creed applied to clause for instance whether be necessary to salvation to hold that there be unus aeternus a latin have such a father such holy ghost that holy ghost be by god lord that christ be one by taking of manhood into god must get answer mr upton said that did not like extreme question that must not did not wish to answer that creed be written against heresy no longer existed a sort of protest reding asked whether meant that creed did not contain distinctive view of own alone be safe be merely negation of error clause observed be positive not negative must get answer farther than that creed taught that doctrine of trinity incarnation be necessary to salvation being apparently left uncertain what doctrine consisted in one day asked how grievous sin be to be forgiven be committed after baptism whether by faith not at in life be answered that article said nothing on subject that romish doctrine of pardon purgatory be false that be well to avoid curious question subtle answer question turned up at lecture viz whether real presence meant presence of christ in element in soul ie in faith of recipient in other word whether presence be really such mere name mr upton pronounced open question day charles asked whether christ be present in fact only in effect mr upton answered decidedly in effect seemed to reding to mean real presence at have have difficulty in receiving doctrine of eternal punishment have seemed to hardest doctrine of revelation then said to what be faith in very notion acceptance of word of god when reason seems to oppose how be faith at if there be nothing to try thought fully satisfied only question be be part of revealed word can believe said if know for certain ought to believe if be not bound to believe ca believe accordingly put question to mr upton whether be doctrine of church of england be whether came under subscription to article must obtain answer yet if did not believe doctrine felt whole fabric of faith shake under close upon came doctrine of atonement be difficult to give instance of kind without producing impression on reader mind that charles be forward captious in inquiry certainly mr upton have own thought about never thought manner inconsistent with modesty respect towards charles naturally be full of subject must have disclosed perplexity to sheffield have not have strong anticipation that must have be making matter worse thought bateman however might be of service disburdened to in course of country walk what be to do for on entrance have be told that when took degree must have to sign article not on faith a then on reason yet be unintelligible how must prove what must not construe bateman seemed unwilling to talk on subject at last said oh dear reding really be in excited state of mind like to talk to just now for will not see thing in straightforward way take naturally what bug bear be conjuring up be in article lecture in second year hardly have commenced begin to fancy what will will not think at end of time ask about article now wait at least till have seen lecture through really be not way to be fussed to fidget said charles though own be not so quiet a ought to be hear so many different opinion in conversation then go to church one preacher deal blow at lastly betake to article really can not make out what must teach for instance can not make out doctrine about faith about sacrament about predestination about church about inspiration of scripture tone be so unlike prayer book upton have brought out in lecture most clearly now most respectable friend said bateman do think for moment what men have signed article perhaps king charles certainly laud great bishop of day of next generation think of most orthodox bull singularly learned pearson eloquent taylor montague barrow thorndike good dear bishop horne jones of nayland ca do what did argument be very strong one said charles have felt mean then must sign on faith yes certainly if necessary said bateman how be to sign a master when be ordained asked charles be what mean by fidgeting answered bateman be not content with day be reaching forward to live year hence charles laughed be quite that said be testing advice however there be truth in changed subject talked awhile on indifferent matter on pause charles thought fell back again to article tell bateman said a mere matter of curiosity how subscribed when took degree oh have difficulty at said bateman example of bull pearson be enough for then signed on faith not exactly be that thought smoothed difficulty must have signed without how can ask question of course well do tell then what be ground oh have many ground ca recollect in moment what happened time ago oh then be matter of difficulty indeed said so just now not at only difficulty be not about how to state matter to other people what one suspected be quite mistaken mean for instance article say that be justified by faith only now protestant sense of statement be point blank opposite to standard divine question be what be to say when asked sense of understand said charles now tell how solved problem well deny that protestant sense be heretical answered bateman so be protestant sense of many other thing in article then need not take in protestant sense then in what sense why first said bateman need not take in sense at smile listen great authority such a laud bramhall seem to have considered that only sign article a article of peace not a really holding a not opposing therefore when sign article only engage not to preach against reding thought then said tell bateman must not view of subscription to article let unitarian into church bateman allowed must liturgy must still keep out charles then went on to suggest that must take liturgy a liturgy of peace too bateman began again if want tangible principle said for interpreting article liturgy can give one know continued after short pause what be hold why give article catholic interpretation charles looked inquisitive be plain continued bateman that document can be dead letter must be expression of mind question here be whose be what may be called voice speaks article now if bishop head of house other dignitary authority be unanimous in religious view one said that article meant not that a imponents must have right to interpret article must mean what great men said meant agree together of be diametrically opposed to others one clergyman denies apostolical succession affirms one denies lutheran justification maintains one denies inspiration of scripture second hold calvin to be saint third considers doctrine of sacramental grace superstition fourth take part with nestorius against church fifth be sabellian be plain then that article have sense at if collective voice of bishop dean professor like be to be taken can not supply what schoolman call form of article perhaps writer of article will supply for first know for certain who writer be next article have gone through so many hand so many mending that at least of original author must not like to be responsible for well let go to convocation ratified too be of different sentiment seventeenth century did not hold doctrine of sixteenth such be state of case on other hand say that if anglican church be part of one church catholic must from necessity of case hold catholic doctrine therefore whole catholic creed acknowledged doctrine of father of st ignatius st cyprian st augustin st ambrose be form be one true sense interpretation of article may be ambiguous in may have be worded with various intention by individual concerned in composition be accident church know nothing of individual interprets reding took time to think over said proceeds on fundamental principle that church of england be integral part of visible body of st ignatius st cyprian rest be bishop according to word of scripture 'one body one faith ' bateman assented charles proceeded then article must not be considered primarily a teaching have one sense in be confessedly ambiguous be compiled from heterogeneous source doe not matter for must be interpreted by teaching of catholic church bateman agreed in main except reding have stated case rather too strongly what if letter contradicts doctrine of father be to force letter if case actually happened theory must not hold answered bateman must only be gross quibble can in case sign article in sense word will not bear fortunately rather providentially be not case have merely to explain ambiguity harmonize discrepancy catholic interpretation doe greater violence to text than other rule of interpretation will be found to do well know nothing of father said charles others too be in same condition how be to learn practically to interpret article by prayer book prayer book be voice of father how so because prayer book be confessedly ancient while article be modern charles kept silence again be very plausible said thought on presently asked be received view view be received said bateman article be received there be authoritative interpretation of at be what be saying just now bishop professor agree together well said charles be tolerated view have certainly be strongly opposed answered bateman have never be condemned be answer said charles who saw by bateman manner how truth lay doe one bishop hold did one bishop ever hold have ever be formally admitted a tenable by one bishop be view got up to meet existing difficulty have historical existence bateman must give one answer to question a be successively put to thought so said charles when have made answer know of course whose view be putting before though never heard drawn out before be specious certainly see might have done have be tolerably sanctioned have sanction to show be a stand mere theory struck out by individual church might have adopted mode of interpreting article from what tell certainly have not done so be where be chapter xvi thought came across reding whether perhaps after what be called evangelical religion be not true christianity professor knew be active influential in past time have be much persecuted freeborn have surprised offended at bateman breakfast party before vacation yet freeborn have serious manner about perhaps have misunderstood thought however passed away a suddenly a came perhaps must not have occurred to again when accident gave data for determining question one afternoon be lounging in park gazing with surprise on one of extraordinary light for neighbourhood of oxford be at season celebrated a sun went down be colouring marston elsfield half denuded grove with pale gold brown hue when found overtaken addressed by said freeborn in propria persona freeborn liked tete tete talk much better than dispute in party felt at more advantage in long leisurely speech be soon put out of breath when have to bolt out edge in word amid ever varying voice of breakfast table thought present might be good opportunity of doing good to poor youth who did not know chalk from cheese who by mean might be a must word savingly converted so got into conversation talked of willis step freeborn called awful before charles knew where be found asking freeborn what meant by faith faith said freeborn be divine gift be instrument of justification in god sight be by nature displeasing to till justifies freely for christ sake faith be like hand appropriating personally merit of christ who be justification now what can want more have more than merit faith then be everything doe everything for see then how important be to have right view about justification by faith only if be sound on capital point everything else may take chance will at once see folly of contending about ceremony about form of church government about will even say sacrament creed external thing will in case either be neglected will find subordinate place reding observed that of course freeborn did not mean to say that good work be not necessary for obtaining god favour if be how be justification by faith only freeborn smiled said that hoped reding must have clearer view in little time be very simple matter faith not only justified regenerated also be root of sanctification a well a of divine acceptance same act be mean of bringing into god favour secured being meet for thus good work be secured because faith must not be true faith unless be such a to be certain of bringing forth good work in due time reding thought view simple clear though unpleasantly reminded of dr brownside freeborn added that be doctrine suited to poor that put gospel into nutshell that dispensed with criticism primitive age teacher in short with authority in form swept theology clean away there be need to mention last consequence to charles passed by wishing to try system on own merit speak of true faith said a producing good work say that faith justifies true faith true faith produce good work in other word suppose faith be certain to be fruitful fruitful faith justifies be very like saying that faith work be joint mean of justification oh cried freeborn be deplorable doctrine be quite opposed to gospel be anti christian be justified by faith only apart from good work be in article lecture just now said charles upton told that must make distinction of kind for instance duke of wellington be chancellor of university though be a much chancellor a duke still sits in house of lord a duke not a chancellor thus although faith be a truly fruitful a be faith yet doe not justify a being fruitful a being faith be what mean not at said freeborn be be doctrine explained away cardinal truth into mere matter of word made faith mere symbol be departure from pure gospel faith be instrument not symbol of justification be in truth mere apprehension nothing else seizing clinging beggar might venture on when king passed by faith be a poor a job in ash be like job stripped of pride pomp good work be covered with filthy rag be without anything good be repeat mere apprehension now see what mean ca believe understand said charles say that to have faith be to seize christ merit that have if will seize surely not one who seizes gain because dissolute men who never have dream of thorough repentance real hatred of sin must gladly seize appropriate if might do so must like to get to heaven for nothing faith then must be particular kind of apprehension what kind good work can not be mistaken 'apprehension may what then be true apprehension what be faith what need dear friend answered freeborn of knowing metaphysically what true faith be if have enjoy know what bread be eat do wait till chemist analyzes eat feel good effect afterwards so let be content to know not what faith be what doe enjoy blessedness in possessing really want to introduce metaphysics said charles will adopt own image suppose suspected bread before to have arsenic in merely to be unwholesome must be wonderful if tried to ascertain how fact stood did do so morning at breakfast asked freeborn did not suspect bread answered charles then why suspect faith asked freeborn because be so to say new substance freeborn sighed because be not used to nay because suspect must say suspect because though know much about matter know perfectly well from what have taken place in father parish what excess doctrine may lead to unless be guarded say that be doctrine for poor now be very likely to mistake one thing for so indeed be one if then be told that have to apprehend christ merit need not trouble ourselves about anything else justification have taken place work will follow that be done salvation be complete while do continue to have faith think ought to be pretty sure that have faith real faith real apprehension before shut up book make holiday freeborn be secretly annoyed that have got into argument pained a must express at pride of charles natural man blindness of carnal reason there be help for must give answer there be know many kind of faith said of course must be on guard against mistaking false faith for true faith many person a most truly say make mistake most important be important must say to go right first be evident that be not mere belief in fact in being of god in historical event that christ have come gone be submission of reason to mystery again be that sort of trust be required for exercising gift of miracle be knowledge acceptance of content of bible say be not knowledge be not assent of intellect be not historical faith be not dead faith true justifying faith be none of be seated in heart affection paused then added now suppose for practical purpose have described pretty well what justifying faith be charles hesitated by describing what be not mean said justifying faith then be suppose living faith not so fast answered freeborn why said charles if be not dead faith be living faith be dead faith living said freeborn faith simple faith justifies luther be displeased with melancthon for saying that living operative faith justified have studied question very carefully then do tell said charles what faith be since explain correctly for instance if said what say that faith be submission of reason to mystery acceptance of scripture a historical document must know perfectly well what meant be information when say that faith justifies be apprehension of christ that be not living faith fruitful faith operative something in fact actually be distinct from confess feel perplexed freeborn wished to be out of argument oh said if really once experienced power of faith how change heart enlightens eye give new spiritual taste new sense to soul if once knew what be to be blind then to see must not ask for definition stranger need verbal description heir of kingdom enjoy oh if must be persuaded to put off high imagination to strip of proud self to experience in wonderful change must live in praise thanksgiving instead of argument criticism charles be touched by warmth said ought to act by reason see have more so much reason to listen to a to listen to roman catholic who tell can not possibly have certainty of faith before believing on believing will be divinely given surely said freeborn with grave face must not compare spiritual christian such a luther holding cardinal doctrine about justification to such formal legal superstitious devotee a popery can make with carnal rite quack remedy never really cleanse soul reconcile to god like to talk so said reding know very little about real nature of popery when be boy be once by chance in roman catholic chapel really never saw such devotion in life people on knee most earnestly attentive to what be going on did not understand what be be sure have be there never must have called religion be right wrong outward form carnal ordinance freeborn said deeply pained to hear such sentiment to find that charles be so tainted with error of day began not with much tact to talk of papal antichrist must have got off to prophecy have charles said word to afford fuel for discussion a kept silence freeborn zeal burnt out there be break in conversation after time reding ventured to begin again if understand said faith carry own evidence with just a eat bread at breakfast without hesitation about wholesomeness so when have really faith know beyond mistake need not look out for test of precisely so said freeborn begin to see what mean grow soul be enlightened to see that have real faith how asked charles be to rescue from dangerous mistake who think have faith while have not be there way in can find out that be under delusion be not wonderful said freeborn though there be way there be many self deceiver in world men be righteous trust in work think be safe when be in state of perdition formal rule can be given by reason might for certain detect mistake so of false faith well doe seem to wonderful said charles that there be natural obvious warning provided against delusion wonderful that false faith must be so exactly like true faith that there be nothing to determine difference from other effect imply cause if one apprehension of christ lead to good work doe not there must be something in one be not in other what be false apprehension of christ wanting in true apprehension have word apprehension be so vague conveys definite idea to yet justification depends on be false apprehension for instance wanting in repentance amendment said freeborn true faith be complete without conversion conversion follows faith be root be love of god distinguishes true faith from false love answered freeborn must read what luther say in celebrated comment on galatian call doctrine 'pestilens figmentum ' portentum ' cry out against papist sophistae cum sua maledicta glossa ' then differs from false faith in nothing not so said freeborn differs from in fruit fruit ye will know ' be coming round to same point again said charles fruit come after man seems be to take comfort in justification before fruit come before know that faith will produce good work be necessary fruit of faith said freeborn so say article charles made answer said to good friend here certainly have not clearest of head then aloud well despair of getting at bottom of subject of course answered freeborn with air of superiority though in mild tone be very simple principle 'fides justificat ante et sine charitate ' requires divine light to embrace walked awhile in silence then a day be now closing in turned homewards parted company when came to clarendon chapter xvii freeborn be not person to let go young man like charles without effort to gain in few day invited to take tea at lodging charles went at appointed time through wet cold of dreary november evening found five six men already assembled have got into world face manner speech be strange savoured of eton be own school of oxford be introduced found awkwardness of new acquaintance little relieved by conversation went on be dropping fire of serious remark with pause relieved only by occasional ahem sipping of tea sound of spoon falling against saucer blind shifting of chair a flurried servant maid of lodging suddenly came upon from behind with kettle for teapot toast for table there be nature elasticity in party great intention to be profitable have seen last spiritual journal asked of in low voice have just read very remarkable article said upon deathbed of pope one be beyond hope answered have heard of not seen said pause what be about asked reding late pope sixtus sixteenth said seems to have died believer sensation charles looked a if wished to know more journal give on excellent authority said mr o'niggins agent for roman priest conversion branch tract society be in rome during last illness solicited audience with pope be granted to at once began to address on necessity of change of heart belief in one hope of sinner abandonment of creature mediator announced to glad tidings assured there be pardon for warned against figment of baptismal regeneration then proceeding to apply word urged though in eleventh hour to receive bible whole bible nothing bible pope listened with marked attention displayed considerable emotion when be ended answered mr o'niggins that be fervent hope that two must not die without finding in one communion something of sort declared moreover what be astonishing that put sole trust in christ 'the source of merit a expressed remarkable phrase in what language be conversation carried on asked reding be not stated answered be pretty sure mr o'niggins be good french scholar doe not seem to said charles that pope admission be greater than made continually by certain member of own church who be nevertheless accused of popery be extorted from such person said freeborn while pope be voluntary one party go back into darkness said pope be coming forward into light one ought to interpret everything for best in real papist said freeborn everything for worst in puseyite be charity common sense be not continued called together cardinal protested that earnestly desired god glory said that inward religion be in form be nothing without contrite heart that trusted soon to be in paradise know be denial of doctrine of purgatory brand from burning do hope said have frequently be observed said nay have struck that way to convert romanists be first to convert pope be sure way at least said charles timidly afraid be saying too much irony be not discovered man can not do said freeborn be power of faith faith can be vouchsafed even to greatest sinner see now perhaps said turning to charles better than did what meant by faith other day poor old man must have merit have passed long life in opposing cross do difficulty continue charles have thought over former conversation very carefully several time answered why think do to same extent freeborn looked pleased mean said that idea hang together better than thought did at first freeborn looked puzzled charles slightly colouring be obliged to proceed amid profound silence of whole party said know that justifying faith be without love other grace besides that one must at tell what be except afterwards from fruit that there be test by person must examine whether not be deceiving when thought have faith so that good bad might equally be taking to promise privilege peculiar to gospel thought hard doctrine certainly at first then afterwards struck that faith be perhaps result of previous state of mind blessed result of blessed state therefore may be considered reward of previous obedience whereas sham faith what merely look like faith be judicial punishment in proportion a drift of former part of speech be uncertain so be conclusion very distinct there be mistake audible emotion there be such thing a previous merit said be of grace not merit know said charles must not bring in doctrine of de condigno de congruo said surely said charles be cruel thing to say to unlearned multitude be at once saved wait for fruit rejoice at once to accompany announcement by clear description of what faith be to secure by previous religious training against self deception be very gloriousness of doctrine said freeborn that be preached to worst of mankind say a be attempt to make yourselves better believe that salvation be yours be yours good work follow after ' on contrary said charles continuing argument when be said that justification follows upon baptism have intelligible something pointed out one can ascertain baptism be external unequivocal token whereas that man have secret feeling called faith one can be witness be not unbiassed one reding have at length succeeded in throwing that dull tea table into state of great excitement dear friend said freeborn have hoped better thing in little while hope will see thing differently baptism be outward rite what be there can there be spiritual holy heavenly in baptism tell faith too be not spiritual said charles tell cried freeborn when well said charles somewhat puzzled at least think holy freeborn be puzzled in turn if be holy continued charles have something good in have worth be not filthy rag good come afterwards said said that fruit be holy that be nothing at there be momentary silence agitation of thought oh faith be certainly holy feeling said be spiritual not holy said be mere act apprehension of christ merit be seated in affection said faith be feeling of heart be trust be belief that christ be saviour be distinct from holiness holiness introduces self righteousness faith be peace joy be not holiness holiness come after nothing can cause holiness what be holy be sort of axiom said charles if fruit be holy faith be root be holy might a well say that root of rose be red of lily white said pardon reding said freeborn be a friend say apprehension apprehension be seizing there be more holiness in justifying faith than in hand seizing substance come in way be luther great doctrine in 'commentary on galatian be nothing in be mere instrument be what teach when so vehemently resists notion of justifying faith being accompanied by love can not assent to doctrine said may be true in certain sense throw stumbling block in way of seeker luther must not have meant what say be convinced justifying faith be always accompanied by love be what thought said charles be romish doctrine over said be doctrine of bull taylor luther call havenenum infernale ' said freeborn be just what puseyites preach at present said on contrary said be doctrine of melancthon look here continued taking pocketbook out of pocket have got word down a shuffleton quoted in divinity school other day significat fiduciam in fiducida inest dilectio ergo etiam dilectione sumus justi three of party cried impossible paper be handed round in solemn silence calvin said same said triumphantly think said in slow smooth sustained voice contrasted with animation have suddenly inspired conversation that con tro ver sy ahem may be easily arranged be question of word between luther melancthon luther say ahem 'faith be without love ' meaning 'faith without love justifies melancthon on other hand say ahem 'faith be with love ' meaning 'faith justifies with love ' now be true for ahem faith without love justifies yet faith justifies not without love there be pause while party digested explanation on contrary added be romish doctrine that faith with love justifies freeborn expressed dissent thought doctrine of melancthon luther condemned mean said charles justification be given to faith with love not to faith love have expressed meaning said what be considered difference between with asked charles replied without hesitation faith be instrument love sine qua non no interposed with protest thought legal to introduce phrase sine qua non be introducing

seeing that by leaving out have made nonsense of rest be man to rob arch of keystone then quietly to build house upon ah old failing again said reding craving after view now what like in carlton be

of four month sheffield answered reding carlton have now joined after introductory greeting on side too threw upon turf sheffield said reding be disputing just now whether nicias be party man of course first defined term said carlton well said sheffield mean by party man one who not only belongs to party who have animus of party nicias did not make party found one made found at head of be no more party man than prince who be born head of state must agree with said carlton still must like to know what party be what party man party said sheffield be merely extra constitutional extra legal body party action said charles be exertion of influence instead of law supposing reding there be law existing in quarter where influence exerts asked carlton charles have to explain certainly said state did not legislate for possible contingency for instance continued carlton prime minister have understood be not acknowledged in constitution exerts influence beyond law not in consequence against existing law must be absurd to talk of a party man parliamentary party too be recognised among said sheffield though extra constitutional call party who must call duke of devonshire lord john russell in bad sense party man seems to said carlton that formation of party be merely recurrence to original mode of forming into society recollect deioces formed party gained influence laid foundation of social order law certainly begin in influence said reding for presupposes lawgiver afterwards supersedes influence from time exertion of influence be sign of party too broadly said a just now allowed said carlton must say that law begin to supersede influence that in proportion a supersedes doe exertion of influence involve party action for instance have not crown immense personal influence talk of court party yet doe not interfere with law be intended to conciliate people to law be recognized by law constitution said charles a be dictatorship well then take influence of clergy answered carlton make much of influence a principle supplemental to law a support to law yet not created defined by law law doe not recognize what one call truly besident gentleman ' in parish influence then instead of law be not necessarily action of party so again national character be influence distinct from law said sheffield according to line leges sine moribus ' law said carlton be gradually formed extended well then so far a there be law there be reign of influence there be party without of necessity party action be justification of whig tory at present day to supply a aristotle say on subject defect of law charles exerted regal walpole ministerial influence influence not law be operating principle in case object mean might be wrong process must not be called party action must justify then said charles association confraternities existed for instance in athens not be if 'took law into own hand a phrase go if there be law to take if there be constituted authority to take of right be recurrence to precedent of deioces manzoni give striking instance of in beginning of promessi sposi said sheffield when describes that protection law ought to give to weak a being in sixteenth century sought found almost exclusively in faction company recollect particular describes clergy a busy in extending immunity nobility privilege army exemption trade artisan guild even lawyer formed union medical men corporation thus constitution be gradually moulded perfected said carlton by extra constitutional body coming under protection of law else being superseded by law providing for object in middle age church be vast extra constitutional body german anglo norman sovereign sought to bring operation under law modern parliament have superseded operation by law then state wished to gain right of investiture now state marries register manages poor exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction instead of church will make ostracism parallel to reformation revolution said sheffield there be battle of influence against influence one get rid of other law constitution doe not come into question will of people of court ejects whether too gifted individual monarch religion what be not under law must not be dealt with have claim to be dealt with by law thought have sometimes struck said reding fall in with what have be saying in last half century there have be gradual formation of popular party in state now tends to be acknowledged a constitutional be already so acknowledged father never must endure newspaper mean system of newspaper said be new power in state be sure be not defending what be thinking of many bad proceeding wretched principle arrogance tyranny of newspaper writer be trying subject by test of theory great body of people be very imperfectly represented in parliament common be not voice voice of certain great interest consequently press come in to do constitution doe not do to form people into vast mutual protection association be done by same right deioces have to collect people about doe not interfere with existing territory of law build where constitution have not made provision tends then ultimately to be recognised by constitution there be remarkable phenomenon of similar kind now in process of development said carlton be influence of agitation really be not politician enough to talk of a good bad one natural instinct be against may be necessary however agitation be getting to be recognised a legitimate instrument by mass make desire known secure accomplishment of just a bill pass in parliament after certain reading discussion speech voting like so process by act of popular will becomes law be long agitation issuing in petition previous to concurrent with parliamentary process first instance of be about fifty sixty year ago when hallo cried who be cantering up to declare be old vincent said sheffield be to come to dine said charles just in time how be carlton cried vincent how d 'ye do mr sheffield mr reding how d 'ye do acting up to name suppose for be ever reading man for myself continued be just now eating man be come to dine with if will let have place for horse there be farmer near who must lend stable so horse be led off by charles rider without delay for hour did not admit entered cottage to make brief preparation for dinner chapter ii in few minute met together at table in small parlour be room of work in cottage have not whole house limited a be resource for be also habitation of gardener who took vegetable to oxford market whose wife what be called did for lodger dinner be

pair of glove case of cigar neck handkerchief shoe horn small slate large clasp knife hammer handsome inlaid writing desk like ride into country said vincent a began eating country loses effect on when live in a do be exquisite a zest visit live in if must enjoy country air be stimulus stimulant mr reding must not be taken too often be of country party be of party go here there like bee taste of everything depend on nothing sheffield said that be rather belonging to party than to none be impossible answered vincent hold to be altogether impossible ca belong to two party there be fear of might a well attempt to be in two place at once to be connected with be to be united with depend on young friend antagonist principle correct other be piece of philosophy one day will thank for when be older have heard of american illustration of said sheffield certainly confirms what say sir professor in united state be sometimes of two three religion at once according a regard historically personally officially in way perhaps hit mean vincent though so often excited smile in others have humour never must make out difference between irony earnest accordingly be brought to stand charles came to relief before dinner said be sporting what will consider great paradox be afraid that party be good thing rather necessary thing do justice answered vincent if be what think deny halve word party be not good necessary like snail envy small house try to lodge in mean said carlton that party do dirty work be beast of burden must not get on without need not identify ourselves with may keep aloof said sheffield be something like religious professor who say that be sinful to engage in worldly though necessary occupation that reprobate undertake work for elect there will always be person enough in world who like to be party men without being told to be so said vincent be business to turn to account to use to keep aloof take party be partly right only go too far borrow from co operate with a far a be right further thus get good from do good to for countenance so far a be true mr carlton meant more than sir said sheffield meant that existence of party be not only necessary useful even right mr carlton be not man to make paradox said vincent suspect must not defend extreme opinion ala exist among at present be progressing day be speaking of political party said carlton be disposed to extend what said to religious also good carlton said vincent scripture speaks against religious party certainly wish to oppose scripture said carlton speak under correction of scripture say whenever wherever church doe not decide religious point so far doe leave decision to individual since ca expect people to agree together must have different opinion expression of different opinion by various person who hold be what be called party mr carlton have be great sir on general subject before dinner said sheffield now draw corollary whenever there be party in church church may thank for be certain effect of private judgment more private judgment have more party will have be reduced then to alternative toleration else party must recognise party unless refuse toleration sheffield word more strongly than must do said carlton really mean pretty much what say take case of roman catholic have decided many point of theology many have not decided wherever there be ecclesiastical decision there have at once party what call bechool when ecclesiastical decision at length appears then party cease thus have dominican franciscan contending about immaculate conception went on contending because authority did not at once decide question on other hand when jesuit jansenist disputed on question of grace pope gave in favour of jesuit controversy at once came to end surely said vincent good worthy friend rev charles carlton fellow of leicester sometime ireland essayist be not preferring church of rome to church of england carlton laughed wo suspect of think answered say be that church from constitution admits approves of private judgment private judgment so far forth a be admitted necessarily involves party slender private judgment allowed in church of rome admitting occasional local party ample private judgment allowed in church recognizing party a element of church well well good carlton said vincent frowning looking wise yet without finding anything particular to say mean said sheffield if understand that be piece of mawkish hypocrisy to shake head throw up eye at mr that for being head of religious party while return thanks for pure reformed church because purity reformation apostolicity toleration boast glory of church of england establish party action party spirit a cognate blessing for must be thankful also party be one of greatest ornament mr vincent sentiment argument doe not lose in hand said carlton what meant be simply that party leader be not dishonourable in church unless lord john russell sir robert peel hold dishonourable post in state young friend said vincent finishing mutton pushing plate from two young friend for carlton be not much older than mr sheffield may learn little more judgment when have lived to age viz two three year beyond carlton will learn sobriety in thing mr reding glass of wine see that poor child how totters under gooseberry pudding up mr sheffield help old woman cook better than have expected how do get butcher meat here carlton must have made attempt to bring fine jack saw in kitchen thought must have mean of cooking dinner over party rose strolled out on green subject commenced be not mr willis of st george friend of yours mr reding asked vincent charles started knew little have seen several time know left continued vincent joined church of rome well be credibly reported that be returning melancholy history anyhow answered charles most melancholy if be true rather said vincent setting right a if have simply made verbal mistake most happy termination mean only thing be left for to do know went abroad one who be inclined to romanize must go abroad carlton will be sending soon here thing be softened down there see church of rome a really be have be abroad must know such heap of beggar in street of rome naples so much squalidness misery no cleanliness utter want of comfort such superstition absence of true evangelical seriousness push fight while mass be going on jabber prayer at railroad speed worship virgin a goddess see miracle at corner of street image be awful ignorance prodigious well willis saw have on good authority said mysteriously that be thoroughly disgusted with whole affair be coming back to be in england now asked reding be said to be with mother in devonshire who perhaps know be widow have be too much for poor silly fellow who must not take advice of older head friend once sent to must make nothing of must understand argument mine be no good must make trial have caught there be short pause in conversation then vincent added such perversion carlton suppose think to be a necessary a party in pure protestant church ca say satisfy carlton said charles be happy to have sanction of mr vincent did political party make men rebel then must political party be indefensible so be religious if lead to apostasy know whig be accused in last war said sheffield of siding with bonaparte accident of kind affect general rule standing custom well independent of answered charles can not think religious party defensible on consideration justify political there be to feeling something despicable in heading religious party be loyola despicable asked sheffield st dominic have sanction of superior said charles be hard on party surely reding said carlton man may individually write preach publish what belief to be truth without offence why then doe begin to be wrong when doe so together with others party tactic be degradation of truth said charles have heard believe before now said carlton of athanasius against whole world whole world against athanasius well answered charles will say that party man must be very much above par below there again agree said carlton be supposing leader of party to be conscious of what be doing being conscious may be a say either much above below average man need not realise to that be forming party be more difficult to conceive said vincent than statement have be hazarded afternoon not at difficult answered carlton do mean that there be only one way of gaining influence surely there be such thing a unconscious influence 'd a easily believe said vincent that beauty doe not know charm be narrow minded retorted carlton man sits in room writes doe not know what people think of 'd believe le persisted vincent beauty be fact influence be effect effect imply agent agency will consciousness there be different mode of influence interposed sheffield influence be often spontaneous almost necessary like light on moses face said carlton bonaparte be said to have have irresistible smile said sheffield what be beauty spontaneous influence added carlton recollect 'the lovely young lavinia ' in thomson well gentleman said vincent when be chancellor will give prize essay on beoral influence kind cause mr sheffield will get a to carlton will be poetry professor when be convocation will say good reader that party took very short stroll on hill when tell that be now stooping head at lowly door of cottage terse littera scripta abridges wondrously rambling vox emissa there might be other thing said in course of conversation history have not condescended to record anyhow be obliged now to usher again into room where have dined where found tea ready laid kettle speedily forthcoming bread butter be excellent party did justice to a if have not lately dined see keep tea in tin case said vincent be for glass spare tea mr reding oxford men commonly fail on head lord bacon say first best juice of grape like primary purest best comment on scripture be not pressed forced out consists of natural exudation be case in italy at day call juice 'lagrima ' so be with tea with coffee too put in large quantity pour on water turn off liquor turn off at once let stand becomes poisonous be great patron of tea poet truly say 'it cheer not inebriate have sometimes singular effect upon nerve make whistle so people tell be not conscious of sometimes too have dyspeptic effect find doe not do to take too hot english drink liquor too hot be not french failing indeed in france be in country get nothing for breakfast acid wine grape be other extreme have before now affected awfully yet acid too have soothing sedative effect upon one lemonade especially nothing suit so well a tea carlton continued mysteriously do know late dr baillie preventive of flatulency tea produce mr sheffield do gave up camomile flower little camomile not great deal people chew rhubarb little camomile in tea be not perceptible make face mr sheffield little say little of everything be best ne quid nimis avoid extreme so be with sugar mr reding be putting too much into tea lay down rule sugar must not be substantive ingredient in tea adjective be tea have natural roughness sugar be only intended to remove that roughness have negative office when be more than be too much well carlton be time for to be seeing after horse fear have not have so pleasant afternoon a have enjoyed much in suburban villa what beautiful moon have very rough ground to pas over dare canter over rut with gravel pit close before mr sheffield do favour to show way to stable good bye to carlton good night mr reding when be left to charles asked carlton if really meant to acquit of party spirit present party leader in oxford must not misunderstand answered know much of know be person of great merit high character wish to think best of be most unfairly attacked that be certain however be accused of wishing to make display of aiming at influence power of loving agitation so on can not deny that thing have done have unpleasant appearance give plausibility to charge wish have at certain time acted otherwise meanwhile do think fair to keep in view that existence of party be fault of theirs be claiming birthright a protestant when church doe not speak others will speak instead learned men have best right to speak again when learned men speak others will attend to thus formation of party be rather act of who follow than of who lead chapter iii sheffield have friend residing at chalton neighbouring village with scholar of st michael who have small cure with house on one of indeed be known to reding also being other than friend white who be going into school during last six month have be trying to make up for time have wasted in first year of residence charles have lost sight of nearly so since first knew at time of life so considerable interval must not elapse without change in character for good evil for carlton charles who be good deal thrown together by sheffield frequent engagement with chalton party be just turning homewards in walk one evening when fell in with white who have be calling at mr bolton in oxford be returning have not proceeded very far before be joined by sheffield mr barry curate of chalton thus party be swelled to five so be going to lose upton said barry to reding capital tutor can ill spare who come into place know answered charles principal will call up one of junior fellow from country believe oh wo get man like upton said carlton knew subject so thoroughly lecture in agricola have heard men say might have be published be masterly minute running comment on text quite exhausting yes be forte said charles yet never loaded lecture everything said have meaning be wanted have got capital living said substantial modern house by rail only hour from london l year said white mr bolton went over living told so be in future neighbourhood very beautiful country number of good family round about say be going to marry dean of selsey daughter said barry do know family miss juliet thirteenth very pretty girl yes said white know most delightful family mr bland be charming woman so very ladylike be good luck to be under dean jurisdiction think will pull with capitally be clever man said barry charge be always well written have high name in day at cambridge have be lately writing against friend here white said sheffield friend said white whom can mean have written against party party leader with reason think oh yes alluded to poor willis others be more that insisted sheffield charged against certain saying doings at st mary well for one can not approve of be uttered from pulpit there said white know for fact that willis refers with great satisfaction to what heard there a inclining to romanism wish preacher hearer must go over together at once then must have quiet time for proper university study said barry take care what be saying barry said sheffield mean present company excepted white think come under denomination of hearer said white such thing have be to hear before now a most men have think often very injudicious worse tendency of preaching be to make one dissatisfied with one own church well said sheffield one memory play one trick must say that friend of mine have said ten time a strong thing against church a preacher in oxford ever did mean said white with earnestness have misunderstood grievously have ever be most faithful to church of england never heard say anything inconsistent with warmest attachment to have never indeed denied claim of romish church to be branch of catholic church will be thing quite there be many thing might borrow with great advantage from romanists have ever loved hope will ever venerate own mother church of baptism sheffield made odd face one spoke white continued attempting to preserve unconcerned manner be remarkable said that mr bolton who though layman divine be sensible practical shrewd man never liked that pulpit always prophesied good must come of silence continuing white presently fell upon sheffield defy said with attempt to be jocular to prove what have be hinting be great shame be so easy to speak against men to call injudicious extravagant so on be only person well well know know said sheffield be only canonizing be devil advocate charles wanted to hear something about willis so turned current of white thought by coming up asking whether there be truth in report have heard from vincent several week before have white heard from lately white knew very little about definitely be not able to say whether report be true not so far be certain that have returned from abroad be living at home thus have not committed to church of rome whether a theological student a novice must not say more yes have heard one thing more subject of letter have received from corroborated that be very strong on point romanism anglicanism be two religion that must not amalgamate that must be roman anglican must not be anglo roman anglo catholic be what friend told in letter to myself white continued know quite what meant spoke good deal of necessity of faith in order to be catholic said one must go over merely because thought must like better that have found out by experience that one must live on sentiment that whole system of worship in romish church be different from what be in own nay very idea of worship idea of prayer that doctrine of intention viewed in part constituted new religion did not speak of definitely said generally that might be great discouragement to convert throw back on whole tone of letter be like person disappointed who might be reclaimed at least so thought be wiser even if be sadder man said charles did not know have so much in there be more reflection in than so excitable person a seemed to be capable of exercising at same time there be nothing in to prove that be sorry for what have done have granted said white still effect of letter be to keep people back from following by putting obstacle in way then must couple with fact of going home charles thought awhile vincent testimony said be confirmation mere exaggeration of what have told according a be independent not then said to white too have more in than thought really have spoken about willis very sensibly what have come to path soon divided while chalton pair took right hand carlton pupil turned to left soon carlton parted from two friend reached cottage just in time to see setting sun chapter iv few day later carlton sheffield reding be talking together after dinner out of door about white how be altered said charles since first knew altered cried sheffield be playful kitten once now be one of dullest old tabby ever came across altered for better said charles have now steady sensible way of talking be not very wise person two year ago be reading too really hard have reason said sheffield for be sadly behindhand there be cause of steadiness perhaps know indeed answered charles thought of course knew said sheffield mean to say have not heard that be engaged to oxford girl engaged cried charles how absurd see that at dear reding said carlton be not a if must not afford have good living waiting for moreover be thus losing time be great thing in life much time be often lost white will soon find settled in sense of word in mind in life in occupation charles said that there be one thing must not help surprising namely that when white first came up be so strong in advocacy of clerical celibacy carlton sheffield laughed do think said former that youth of eighteen can have opinion on subject know well enough to make resolution in own case do really think fair to hold man committed to random opinion extravagant saying into be betrayed when first left school have read ultra book other said sheffield have seen beautiful nun sculptured on chancel screen be carried away by romance a others have be be suppose said carlton that good fellow who now be so full of beacerdotal purity 'angelical blessedness so on will one be married by time ten year will take bet of said sheffield one will give in early one late there be time destined for pas ten twelve year a carlton say will find ab on curacy happy father of ten child cd wearing on long courtship till living fall ef in honeymoon gh lately presented by mr h with twin ik full of joy just accepted lm may remain what gibbon call column in midst of ruin very tottering column too do really think said charles people mean so little what say take matter too seriously reding answered carlton who doe not change opinion between twenty thirty young man enters life with father tutor view change for own more modest diffident be more faith have so much longer doe speak word of others force of circumstance vigour of mind infallibly obliges at last to have mind of own be if be good for anything suspect said reding that last generation whether of father tutor have very exalted idea of clerical celibacy accident often clothe with opinion wear for time said carlton well honour people who wear family suit honour at who begin with foreign fashion then abandon few year more of life said carlton smiling will make judgment kinder like talker continued charles think ever will hope not know better what be at bottom of said sheffield ca stay must go in read reding be too fond of gossip who talk so much a sheffield said charles talk fast when talk answered get through great deal of work then give over prose muse sigh prose again so left what doe mean asked carlton charles slightly coloured laughed be man say thing to to others made answer a to sheffield fancy have found out of carlton looked round at sharply curiously be ashamed of myself said charles laughing looking confused have made think have something important to tell really have nothing at well out with said carlton why to tell truth really be too absurd have made fool of myself turned away then turned back resumed why be only sheffield fancy have sneaking kindness for celibacy kindness for whom said carlton kindness for celibacy there be pause carlton face somewhat changed oh dear good fellow said kindly so be one of will go off perhaps will said charles oh be laying stress upon be sheffield who made mention real difference of mind view have evidently be struck upon by two friend very congenial very fond of other there be pause for few second be so sensible fellow reding said carlton surprise that must take up notion be new notion taken up answered charles will smile have when boy at school have ever since fancied that must never marry not that feeling have never intermitted be habit of mind general thought run in one way that will never marry if did must dread thalaba punishment carlton put hand on reding shoulder gently shook to fro well surprise said then after pause have be accustomed to think celibacy marriage good in way in church of rome great good see come of celibacy depend on dear reding be making great blunder if be for introducing celibacy into anglican church there be nothing against in prayer book article said charles perhaps not whole genius structure working of church go other way for instance have monastery to relieve poor if have suspect a thing be parson wife must in practical substantial usefulness be infinitely superior to monk be ever shaven declare think bishop of ipswich be almost justified in giving out that none married men have chance of preferment from nay bishop of abingdon who make rule of bestowing best living a marriage portion to most virtuous young lady in diocese carlton spoke with more energy than be usual with charles answered that be not looking to expediency feasibility of thing at what seemed to best in what must not help admiring said nothing about celibacy of clergy observed of celibacy generally celibacy have place in idea system of religion depend on said carlton be nothing to purpose whether there be anything in article against be not question about formal enactment whether genius of anglicanism be not utterly at variance with experience of three hundred year be surely abundant for purpose if know what religion be in time what time will be long enough there be form of religion have not lasted so long from first to last now enumerate case of celibacy for celibacy sake in period what will be sum total of instance there be even hammond who died unmarried be going to marry when mother wished on other hand if look out for type of church can find truer than married excellence of hooker profound taylor devotional bull polemical very first reformed primate be married in pole parker two system roman anglican come into strong contrast well seems to a much yoke of bondage said charles to compel marriage a to compel celibacy be what be really driving at be telling that one be black sheep who doe not marry not very practical difficulty to at moment said carlton one be asking to go about on coelebs mission just now with aristotle in hand class list in view well excuse said charles if have said anything very foolish suppose argue on such subject with others chapter v have by time strolled a far a carlton lodging where book happened to be on charles be at time more immediately employed took two three turn under fine beech stood in front of house before entering tell reding said carlton for really understand what be reason for admiring what in truth be simply unnatural state let talk more dear carlton answered reding will go on making fool of let well alone bad alone pray do be evident that there be strong feeling irritating inwardly manner word be too serious for occasion carlton too felt strongly upon what seemed at first sight very secondary question must have let alone a charles asked no a be on subject let get at view said be said in beginning 'increase multiply ' therefore celibacy be unnatural supernatural said charles smiling be not that word without idea asked carlton be taught by butler that there be analogy between nature grace else might parallel paganism to nature where paganism be contrary to nature say that be supernatural wesleyan convulsion be preternatural why not supernatural really think that divine at least of be on side here said charles jeremy taylor believe have not told what mean by supernatural said carlton want to get at what think know seems to said charles christianity being perfection of nature be like unlike like where be same a much a nature unlike where be a much more mean by supernatural perfection of nature give instance said carlton why consider carlton lord say have heard that have be said of old time say unto ' that contrast denotes more perfect way gospel came not to destroy to fulfil law ca recollect of sudden oh for instance be case in point abolished permission have be given to jew because of hardness of heart not quite in point said carlton for jew in divorce have fallen below nature 'let man put asunder ' be rule in paradise still surely idea of apostle unmarried pure in fast nakedness at length martyr be higher idea than of one of old israelite sitting under vine fig tree full of temporal good surrounded by son grandson be not derogating from gideon caleb be adding to st paul st paul be very particular case said carlton lay down general maxim that be 'good ' for man to continue a be there come to question of criticism what 'good mean may think mean 'expedient ' what say about 'present distress ' confirms well wo go to criticism said charles take text sin hath mother conceived ' word show that over above doctrine of original sin there be to say least great risk of marriage leading to sin in married people dear reding said carlton astonished be running into gnosticism not knowingly willingly answered charles understand what mean be not subject can talk about seems to without of course saying that married person must sin must be gnosticism that there be danger of sin let say more on point well said carlton after thinking awhile have be accustomed to consider christianity a perfection of man a whole body soul spirit misunderstand pantheist say body intellect leaving out moral principle say spirit a well a mind spirit principle of religious faith obedience must be master principle hegemonicon to intellect body be subservient a supremacy doe not imply ill usage bondage of intellect neither doe of body must be well treated well think on contrary doe imply in one sense bondage of intellect body too what be faith submission of intellect a 'every high thought be brought into captivity ' so be expressly told to bring body into subjection too be well treated when be treated so a to be made fit instrument of sovereign principle be what call unnatural said carlton be what mean by supernatural answered reding getting little too earnest how be supernatural adding to nature to destroy part of asked carlton charles be puzzled be way said towards perfection thought that perfection came after death not here nature must not be perfect with corruptible body body be treated now a body of death well reding answered carlton make christianity very different religion from what church considers really think paused awhile look here proceeded how can rejoice in christ a having be redeemed by if be in sort of gloomy penitential state how much be said in st paul about peace thanksgiving assurance comfort like old thing be passed away jewish law be destroyed pardon peace be come that be gospel think then said charles that must grieve for sin into be daily betrayed for more serious offence from time to time may have committed certainly do so in morning evening prayer in communion service well supposing youth a be so often case have neglected religion altogether have whole load of sin very heinous one upon do think that when turn over new leaf come to communion be on saying confession saying with contrition with such person ought to say pardoned at once have nothing more to fear about past sin must say 'yes answered carlton really said charles thoughtfully of course said carlton suppose truly sorry penitent whether be so not future life will show well somehow can not master idea said charles think most serious person even for little sin must go on fidgeting must not suppose gained pardon directly asked for certainly answered carlton god pardon who pardon be said charles who at once feel peace assurance comfort who feel perfect joy of gospel such person grieve rejoice too said carlton tell carlton said reding be be not not forgiving sorrow trouble pleasing to god surely thus certain self infliction for sin committed be pleasing to if so how doe matter whether be inflicted on mind body be not properly self infliction answered carlton self infliction implies intention grief at sin be something spontaneous when afflict on purpose then at once pas from pure christianity well said charles certainly fancied that fasting abstinence labour celibacy might be taken a make up for sin be not very far fetched idea recollect dr johnson standing in rain in market place at lichfield when man a penance for disobedience to father when boy dear reding said carlton let bring back to what said originally to answer to what now say only make more apposite began by saying that celibacy be perfection of nature now make penance first be good glorious next be medicine punishment perhaps highest perfection here be penance said charles know profess to have clear idea upon subject have talked more than like let at length give over did in consequence pas to other subject connected with charles reading then entered house set to upon polybius must not be denied that for rest of day carlton manner be not quite own a if something have annoyed next morning be a usual chapter vi be impossible to stop growth of mind here be charles with thought turned away from religious controversy for two year yet with religious view progressing unknown to whole time must not have be otherwise if be to live religious life at if be to worship obey creator intellectual act conclusion judgment must accompany that worship obedience might not realize own belief till question have be put to then single discussion with friend such a above with carlton must bring out what really did hold to own apprehension must ascertain for limit of opinion a held inter relation of opinion with opinion have not yet given name to opinion much le have taken theological form must under circumstance be expressed in theological language here be young man of twenty two professing in hour conversation with friend what really be catholic doctrine usage of penance purgatory council of perfection mortification of self clerical celibacy wonder that annoyed carlton though more than charles perceived that catholicism did in fact lie hid under profession felt in what reding put out presence of something a expressed very unlike church of england something new unpleasant to withal something have body in have momentum must not be passed over a vague sudden sound transitory cloud have much behind made felt struck heavily here see what be meant when person say that catholic system come home to mind fulfils idea of religion satisfies sympathy like thereupon becomes catholic person be often said to go by private judgment to be choosing religion by own standard of what religion ought to be now need not be denied that who be external to church must begin with private judgment use in order ultimately to supersede a man out of door us lamp in dark night put out when get home what must be thought of bringing into drawing room must goodly company there assembled before genial hearth under glittering chandelier bright lady well dressed gentleman say to if came in with great coat on back hat on head umbrella under arm large stable lantern in hand yet what must be thought on other hand if precipitated into inhospitable night war of element in ball dress when king came in to see guest saw man who have not on wedding garment saw man who determined to live in church a have lived out of who must not use privilege who must not exchange reason for faith who must not accommodate thought doings to glorious scene surrounded who be groping for hidden treasure digging for pearl of price in high lustrous jewelled temple of lord of host who shut eye speculated when might open see there be absurdity then inconsistency in person first using private judgment then denouncing use circumstance change duty still after person in question doe not strictly speaking judge of external system presented to by private idea brings in dictum of system to confirm to justify certain private judgment personal feeling habit already existing reding for instance felt difficulty in determining how when sin of christian be forgiven have great notion that celibacy be better than married life be not first person in church of england who have have such thought to number doubtless before have occurred number have looked abroad seen nothing around to justify what felt feeling have in consequence festered within withered away when man thus constituted within fall under shadow of catholicism without then mighty creed at once produce influence upon see that justifies thought explains feeling understands that number corrects harmonizes completes be led to ask what be authority of foreign teaching then when find be what be once received in england from north to south in england from very time that christianity be introduced here that a far a historical record go christianity catholicism be synonymous that be still faith of largest section of christian world that faith of own country be held nowhere within own limit of own colony nay further that be very difficult to say what faith have that have then submits to catholic church not by process of criticism a pupil to teacher in saying of course be not denied on one hand that there may be person who come to catholic church on imperfect motif in wrong way who choose by criticism who unsubdued by majesty grace go on criticizing when be in who if persist learn humility may criticize out of again be denied on other hand that who be not catholic may possibly choose for instance methodism in above moral way viz because confirms justifies inward feeling of heart be certainly possible in idea though what there be venerable awful superhuman in wesleyan conference to persuade one to take a prophet be perplexing problem yet after matter of fact conceive to lie other way viz wesleyan other sectary put above system not below though may in bodily position sit under preacher yet in position of soul spirit mind judgment be exalted high above to return to subject of narrative what mystery be soul of man here be charles busy with aristotle euripides thucydides lucretius yet while growing towards church to measure of age of fulness of christ mother have said to that must not escape destiny be true though be to be fulfilled in way affectionate heart must not compass did not dream of must not escape destiny of being one of elect of god must not escape that destiny grace of redeemer have stamped on soul in baptism good angel have seen written there have done zealous part to keep inviolate bright own co operation with influence of heaven have confirmed secured must not escape destiny in due time in god time though might be long though angel might be anxious though church might plead a if defrauded of promised increase of stranger yet son yet come must be written in heaven slow wheel of time hour brought nearer must not ultimately escape destiny of becoming catholic even before blessed hour a opening flower scatter sweet so strange unknown odour pleasing to odious to others went abroad from upon wind made marvel what must be near make look curiously anxiously at while be unconscious of own condition let be patient with a maker be patient bear that must do work slowly will do well ala while charles have be growing in one direction sheffield have be growing in what that growth have be will appear from conversation took place between two friend will be related in following chapter chapter vii carlton have opened small church be serving for saint day service during long vacation not being in way to have congregation church at horsley being closed except on sunday have asked two pupil to help in matter by walking over with on st matthew day a season be fine walk far from dull one be very glad to do when church be over carlton have to attend sick call lay still farther from horsley two young men walked back together did not know that carlton be so much of party man said sheffield did not reading athanasian creed strike be mark of party surely answered charles to read on day like think be mark of party be going out of way charles did not see how obeying in so plain matter clear direction of prayer book must be party act direction said sheffield a if question be not be that direction now binding sense understanding of church of day determines obligation prima facie view of matter said charles be that who do follow what prayer book enjoins be of people farthest from being party not at said sheffield rigid adherence to old custom surely may be badge of party now consider ten year ago before study of church history be revived neither arianism athanasianism be thought of at if thought of be considered a question of word at least a held by most mind one a good a other must say so too in one sense said charles be must hope that number of person for instance unlearned who be in arian community spoke arian language yet did not mean think have heard that ancient missionary of goth hun be arian well will speak more precisely said sheffield oxford man ten year since be going to publish history of nicene council bookseller proposed to to prefix engraving of st athanasius have found in old volume be strongly dissuaded from doing so by brother clergyman not from feeling of own because 'athanasius be very unpopular name among ' one swallow doe not make spring said charles clergyman continued sheffield be friend of most high church writer of day of course said reding there have always be heterodox school in church know well enough never have be powerful lax friend be one of believe not indeed answered sheffield lived out of controversy be literary accomplished person man of piety to boot did not express feeling of own did witness to fact that name of athanasius be unpopular so little be known about history said charles be not surprising st athanasius know did not write creed called after be possible to think intemperate without thinking creed wrong well then again there be beatson divinity professor one will call in sense party man be put in by tory never have committed to liberal theory in theology now man who attended private lecture assures that told men d 'ye see ' said ' take that old church of england mode of handling creed went out with bull after locke wrote old orthodox phraseology came into disrepute ' well perhaps meant said charles that learning died away be case old theological language be plainly learned language when father schoolman be not read of course must be in abeyance when be read again have revived answered sheffield said much more on occasion speaking of creed like hold ' said 'that majority of educated laity of church be sabellian charles be silent hardly knew what reply to make sheffield went on be present year ago when be quite boy when sort of tutor of mine be talking to one of most learned orthodox divine of day man whose name have never be associated with party near relation connexion of high dignitary about plan of own for writing history of council good able man listened with politeness applauded project then added in laughing way know have chosen just dullest subject in church history now council begin with nicene creed embrace nearly doctrinal subject dear sheffield said charles have fallen in with particular set party of men very respectable good men doubt fair specimen of whole church bring a authority answered sheffield a witness still said charles know perfectly well that there be controversy at end of last century between bishop horsley others in brought out distinctly one part at least of athanasian doctrine controversy be not defence of athanasian creed know well said sheffield for subject came into upton article lecture be with priestley whatever be divine must only think very fine just a beermons on prophecy ' be question whether must recognize worth of one of other receive scholastic term about trinity just a receive doctrine that pope be antichrist when horsley say latter something of kind good old clergyman say 'certainly certainly oh yes be old church of england doctrine ' thinking right indeed to be maintained not caring to maintain at most professing just when mentioned not really thinking about from one year end to other so with regard to doctrine of trinity say 'the great horsley ' powerful horsley indeed dispute doctrine care about look on a doughty champion armed cap pie who have put down dissent who have cut off head of impudent non protectionist insane chartist spouter in vestry who under cover of theology have run tilt against tithe church rate ca think so badly of present divine said charles know that in very place there be various orthodox writer whom one must call party men stop said sheffield understand be not speaking against be saying that anti athanasian view be not unfrequent have be in way of hearing good deal on subject at private tutor have kept eye about since have be here bishop of derby be friend of sheen private tutor got promotion when be with latter sheen told that wrote to on occasion 'what will read know anything of theology ' rather think be recommended proposed to read scott bible be easy to bring instance said charles when have own way what say be evidently ex parte statement take again shipton who died lately continued sheffield what high position held in church yet be perfectly well known that thought mistake to use word 'person ' in doctrine of trinity what make stranger be that be so very severe on clergyman tractarian for instance who evade sense of article now be singularly honest straightforward man despised money cared nothing for public opinion yet be sabellian must have eaten bread of church a be called for day unless have felt that opinion be not inconsistent with profession a dean of bath prebendary of dorchester be not plain that considered practice of church to have modified to have re interpreted document why said charles practice of church can not make black white if sentence mean yes make mean wo deny that word be often vague uncertain in sense frequently need comment so that teaching of day have great influence in determining sense question be whether counter teaching of dean prebendary clergyman bishop in whole church must make athanasian creed sabellian think not certainly not answered sheffield clergyman speak of simply say that be not bound to detail of creed only to great outline that there be trinity great outline said charles great stuff unitarian must not deny that of course belief in father son holy spirit though think son creature spirit influence well deny said sheffield that if dean shipton be sound member of church dr priestley might have be also doubt be whether if tractarian school have not risen priestley might not have be have lived to time will not say positively sound member sound enough for preferment if tractarian school have not risen that be saying if church be other than be what be school birth offspring of church if church have not given birth to one party of men for defence must have given birth to said sheffield assure old school of doctrine be run out when began declare wish have let thing alone there be doctrine of apostolical succession few good old men be sole remaining professor in church great ecclesiastical personage on one occasion quite scoffed at persisting to hold maintained doctrine went out with non juror be so few ' said 'that can count ' charles be not pleased with subject on various account did not like what seemed to attack of sheffield upon church of england besides began to feel uncomfortable misgiving doubt whether attack be not well founded to did not like to be exposed accordingly kept silence after short interval attempted to change subject sheffield hand be in must not be balked so presently began again have be speaking said of liberal section of church there be four party in church of old tory country party be out out largest have opinion at merely take up theology theology of day can not properly be said to 'hold ' what creed call 'the catholic faith ' doe not deny may not knowingly disbelieve give sign of actually holding beyond fact that treat with respect will venture to say that not country parson of from year end to year end make once year what catholic call 'an act of faith ' in special very distinctive mystery contained in clause of athanasian creed then seeing charles looked rather hurt added be not speaking of particular clergyman here there of great majority of after tory party come liberal also dislike athanasian creed a have said thirdly a to evangelical know have one of no of 'tracts for time about objective faith now that tract seems to prove that evangelical party be implicitly sabellian be tending to avow belief too have be already actual course of evangelical doctrine on continent in america protestant of geneva holland ulster boston have believe become unitarian like dr adam clarke too celebrated wesleyan held distinguishing sabellian tenet a doddridge be said to have done before considered do think have made out good case for original assertion at time of day be party thing to go out of way to read athanasian creed agree with at said charles say great deal more than have warrant to do draw sweeping conclusion from slender premiss at least be what seems to wish too must not so speak of beaking out case be a if thing be mere topic for disputation like taking wrong side be rather fond of doing so reding answered sheffield speak what think ever will do so will be party man attempt like vincent to unite opposite be of party be of none think see pretty well hollowness of o dear sheffield cried charles in distress think what be saying mean what say be speaking a if thought that belief in athanasian creed be mere party opinion sheffield first be silent then said well beg pardon if have said anything to annoy have expressed intemperately surely one have need to believe what so many people disbelieve disregard subject then dropped presently carlton overtook on farmer pony have borrowed chapter viii reding have for near two year put aside doubt about article be like putting off payment of bill respite not deliverance two conversation have be recording bringing to issue on most important subject first with one then with of two intimate friend who be bound by article a well a uncomfortably reminded of debt to university church nearer approach of examination degree inflicted on thought that time be coming when must be prepared to discharge one day when be strolling out with carlton toward end of vacation have be led to speak of number of religious opinion party in oxford have so many bad effect making so many talk so many criticise not few perhaps doubt about truth altogether then said that evil a be in place of education yet feared be unavoidable if carlton doctrine about party be correct for if there be place where difference of religious opinion must show must be in university be far from denying said carlton system have defect polity theology ritual be perfect one only came directly simply from heaven jewish even be removed because of unprofitableness be derogation from perfection of divine revelation for arises from subject matter on through operates there be pause then carlton went on be fault of most young thinker to be impatient if find perfection in everything be 'new broom pause went on again what form of religion be le objectionable than ours see inconvenience of own system for experience have not felt can not know of others charles be still silent went on plucking chewing leaf from shrub bush through path winded at length said must not like to say to one carlton do know be very uncomfortable about article going on for two year since really must not understand history make matter worse put subject from altogether now that examination degree be coming on must take up again must have be put into article lecture early said carlton well perhaps be not up to subject answered charles did mean said carlton a to thing dear fellow happens day especially to thoughtful people like must not annoy fidget be said charles lest difficulty must return must not be able to remove must take thing calmly said carlton thing a have said have difficulty if wait till everything be a must be might be conceivably will hing will lose life moral social world be not open country be already marked mapped out have road ca go across country if attempt steeple chase will break neck for pain form of religion be fact have history existed before be born will survive must choose can not make know said reding ca make religion can perhaps find one better than own want to do so be not difficulty take own image be jogging along own old road lo high turnpike fast locked poor pony ca clear complain there be fact at least may be pony must answered carlton if not there must be way about else what be good of road in religion road have obstacle one have strong gate across go through bog be one to go on be religion to be at deadlock be christianity to die out where else will go not surely to methodism plymouth brotherism a to romish church suspect have more difficulty than have must sacrifice private judgment be very good answered charles what be very expedient still may be very impossible finest word about necessity of getting home before will not enable poor little pony to take gate certainly not said carlton if have command from benevolent prince own sovereign benefactor to go along road steadily till evening must meet at end of journey must be quite sure that who have appointed end have also assigned mean in difficulty in question ought to look out for mode of opening gate gap in hedge parallel cut way other must enable to turn difficulty charles said that somehow did not like mode of arguing seemed dangerous did not see whither went where ended presently said abruptly why do think there be more difficulty in church of rome clearly there be answered carlton if article be crust be not pope pius creed bone know pope pius creed said charles know very little about state of case certainly what doe say oh includes transubstantiation purgatory saint worship rest said carlton suppose must not quite subscribe depends answered charles slowly on on what authority came to stopped then went on of course must if came to on same authority a doctrine of blessed trinity come now article come on authority be view of person in th century again be not clear how far be be not modified by unauthoritative view of th be obliged then to exercise own judgment candidly declare to that judgment be unequal to so great task at least be what trouble whenever subject rise in mind for have put from well then said carlton take on faith mean suppose said charles must consider church infallible carlton felt difficulty answered must act a if be infallible from sense of duty charles smiled then looked grave stood still eye fell if be to make church infallible said if must give up private judgment if must act on faith there be church have greater claim on than church of england dear reding said carlton with emotion where did get notion know answered charles somebody have said that be in air have talked to one except one two argument have with different person in first year have driven subject from when once begin see will out walked on awhile in silence do really mean to say asked carlton at length that be so difficult to understand receive article to be quite clear enough speak language of common sense well seem to said reding sometimes inconsistent with sometimes with prayer book so be suspicious of know what be signing when sign yet ought to sign ex animo blind submission must make can not make blind declaration give instance said carlton for example said charles distinctly receive lutheran doctrine of justification by faith only prayer book virtually opposes in one of office refer to homily a authority yet homily speak of book of apocrypha a inspired article implicitly deny article about ordination be in spirit contrary to ordination service one article on sacrament speaks doctrine of melancthon that of calvin one article speaks of church authority in controversy of faith yet make scripture ultimate appeal be what occur to at moment surely many of be verbal difficulty at very first glance said carlton may be surmounted with little care on other hand have struck continued charles that church of rome be undeniably consistent in formulary be very charge of writer make upon that be so systematic may be hard iron system be consistent carlton did not wish to interrupt thinking best to hear whole difficulty so charles proceeded when system be consistent at least doe not condemn consistency be not truth truth be consistency now be not fit judge whether not certain system be true may be quite judge whether be consistent with when oracle equivocates carry with own condemnation almost think there be something in scripture on subject comparing in respect pagan inspired prophecy have struck too that st paul give very account of heretic that be 'condemned of ' bearing own condemnation on face moreover be once in company of freeborn know if be acquainted with others of evangelical party showed plainly if be to be trusted that luther melancthon did not agree together on prime point of justification by faith circumstance have not come into article lecture also have read somewhere heard in sermon that ancient heretic always be inconsistent never must state plainly meaning much le agree together thus whether must must not help giving to simple warning of true character a if by rattle charles stopped presently continued too have struck that there be prophet of truth on earth church of rome be that prophet that there be prophet still apostle messenger teacher whatever be to be called seems evident by believing in visible church now common sense tell what messenger from god must be first must not contradict a have just be saying again prophet of god can allow of rival denounces who make separate claim a prophet do in scripture now be impossible to say whether church acknowledges not lutheranism in germany calvinism in switzerland nestorian monophysite body in east doe clearly tell what view take of church of rome only place where recognizes existence be in homily there speaks of a antichrist have greek church intelligible position in anglican doctrine on other hand church of rome have prima facie mark of prophet like prophet in scripture admits rival anathematizes doctrine counter to own there be thing prophet of god be of course at home with message be not helpless hing in midst of error in war of opinion know what have be given to declare how far extends can act a umpire be equal to emergency again tell in favour of church of rome a age after age come be ever on alert question new comer sound note of alarm hews down strange doctrine claim locates perfect what be new true church of rome inspires with confidence feel can trust be thing whether be true be not pretending now to decide that feel like trust in own church love more than trust leaf without faith now see state of mind fetched deep sharp sigh a if have got load off well said carlton when have stopped be very pretty theory whether hold in matter of fact be question have be accustomed hitherto to think chillingworth right when talk of pope against pope council against council so on certainly will not be allowed by protestant controversialist to assume perfect consistency in romish doctrine truth be have read very little judge of truth not by fact by notion mean think enough if notion hang together though disavow still in matter of fact consistency be truth to whether fact answer to theory can not tell inquire now be not well read in subject know enough to be sure that romanists will have more work to prove consistency than anticipate for instance appeal to father yet put pope above maintain infallibility of church prove by scripture then prove scripture by church think general council infallible when not before pope have ratified bellarmine think give list of general council have erred never have be able to make out romish doctrine of indulgence charles thought over then said perhaps case be a say ought to know matter of fact more exactly before attempting to form judgment on subject dear carlton protest to may think with what distress say that if church of rome be a ambiguous a own church will be in way to become sceptic on very ground that will have competent authority to tell what to believe ethiopian said can know unless man do teach st paul say 'faith cometh by hearing ' if one claim faith how can exercise at least will run risk of becoming latitudinarian for if go by scripture only certainly there be creed given in scripture business said carlton be to make best of thing not worst do keep in mind be on guard against strained morbid view of thing be cheerful be natural will be easy be always kind considerate said charles after wish must make see have not word to say by way of meeting original difficulty of subscription how be to leap over wall be nothing to purpose that other communion have wall also now neared home concluded walk in silence being fully occupied with thought conversation have suggested chapter ix vacation passed away silently happily day succeeded day in quiet routine employment bringing insensible sure accession to stock of knowledge to intellectual proficiency of student historian orator be read for last time laid aside science be digested commentary be run through analysis abstract completed be emphatically silent toil while others might be steaming from london to bombay havannah month in retrospect might look like year with reding sheffield week have scarcely begun when be found to be ending when october came saw oxford friend again at first thought have good deal to say to when tried found did concern minute point of own reading personal matter be reduced to silence with wish to speak season have changed reminded that horsley be place for summer sojourn not dwelling there be heavy raw fog hanging about hill storm of wind rain grass no longer afforded seat when betook indoors be discovered that door window did not shut close that chimney smoked then came fruit funeral feast of year mulberry walnut tasteless juiceless walnut dark mulberry juicy severe mouldy withal a gathered not from tree from damp earth thus that green spot weaned from love of charles looked around rose to depart a conviva satur edisti satis tempus abire seemed written upon swallow have taken leave leaf be paling light broke late failed soon hope of spring peace calm of summer have given place to sad reality of autumn be hurrying to world who have be up on mount have lived without jar without distraction without disappointment be now to take a portion for be child of adam horsley have be respite have vividly presented to memory sad reverse came upon two year before what happy summer what forlorn autumn with thought put up book paper turned face towards st saviour oxford too be not quite what have be to freshness of

claimed to have right in to imagination must only attach to who have possessed when came into residence college seemed to have deteriorated there be rowing set have not be there before number of boy large proportion of snob what be real trouble to charles got clearer clearer to apprehension that intimacy with sheffield be not quite what have be have indeed passed vacation together saw of other more than ever sympathy in other be not a strong have not same liking dislikings in short have not such congenial mind a fancied when be freshman there be not so much heart in conversation more easily endured to miss other company be reading for honour reading hard sheffield whole heart be in work religion be secondary matter to have doubt difficulty anxiety sorrow much affected be not certainty of faith made sunshine to soul dried up mist of human weakness rather have perceptible need within of vision of unseen be christian life be unblemished in character exemplary in conduct be content with what perishable world gave charles characteristic perhaps above anything else be habitual sense of divine presence sense of course did not insure uninterrupted conformity of thought deed to still there be pillar of cloud before guiding felt to be god creature responsible to god possession not own have great wish to succeed in school thrill came over when thought of ambition be not life must have reconciled in few minute to failure thus disposed only subject on two friend freely talked together be connected with common study read together examined other used corrected other paper solved other difficulty perhaps scarcely came home to sheffield sharp a be that there be flagging of intimacy religious controversy have be food of active intellect when be novel now have lost interest book took place be far different with charles have felt interest in religious question for own sake when have deprived of pursuit of have be self denial now then when seemed forced on again sheffield must not help where most wanted assistance of friend still more tangible trial be coming on reader have to be told that there be at time system of espionage prosecuted by various well meaning men who thought must be doing university service to point out such of junior member a be what be called papistically inclined did not perceive danger course involved of disposing young men towards catholicism by attaching to bad report of of forcing farther by inflicting on inconsistency of position idea must have lain dormant dwindled away in mind be thus fixed defined located within fear of world censure no longer served to deter when have be actually incurred when charles attended tea party at freeborn be on trial be introduced not only into school into inquisition since did not promise to be subject for spiritual impression be forthwith subject for spiritual censure became marked man in circle of capel hall st mark acquaintance with question have asked at article lecture stray remark at wine

to be devoted son useful minister of church of england be kill cure remedy not likely to answer with more noble more able mind what effect have upon charles whether must be determined by sequel here will suffice to relate interview took place between principal vice principal of college in consequence of chapter x when reding presented to vice principal rev joshua jennings to ask for leave to reside in lodging for two term previous to examination be met with courteous decided refusal took altogether by surprise have considered request a mere matter of form sat minute silent then rose to take departure colour came to cheek be repulse inflicted only on idle men who must not be trusted beyond eye of dean of college vice principal seemed to expect to ask reason of proceeding a charles in confusion did not seem likely to do so condescended to open conversation be not meant a reflection said on mr reding moral conduct have ever be well conducted young man have quite carried out character with have come from school there be duty to be observed towards community undergraduate portion must be protected from contagion of principle be too rife at moment charles be if possible still more surprised suggested that there must be misunderstanding if have be represented to vice principal a connected with so called party in place mean to deny that there be party mr reding

that have expressed opinion on subject jennings bade think again charles thought in vain well what be opinion of mr reding charles believing to be open point thought must be safe in imitating church moderation there be different opinion on subject said person think intercede for others that be easy to go into extreme perhaps better to avoid such question altogether better to go by scripture book

into dining room descending saw tall slender figure of bateman now clergyman lately appointed curate of neighbouring parish charles have not seen for year half shook hand with very warmly complimenting on white somehow said altered more than must have expected bateman manner certainly be altered might be accident of day did not seem quite at ease might be that be in strange house be likely soon to be precipitated into company of lady to have never be used if so trial be on point of beginning for charles said instantly that must come see mother of course meant to dine with sky be clear there be excellent footpath between boughton melford bateman must not do must have greatest pleasure in being introduced to mr reding so stumbled after charles into drawing room be soon

charles yes mr reding said bateman by ancestor meant holy bishop other member of catholic church previously to reformation for though reformation be great blessing glance at charles yet must not in justice forget what be done by english churchman before ah poor creature said mr reding did one good thing in building church have saved much trouble be there much church restoration going on in part said bateman taken rather aback mother have lately come here like said charles yes there be barton church know appealing to mary have walk extended so far a barton said mary to bateman not yet miss reding not yet answered of course be destroying pew be to put in seat said charles of very good pattern pew be intolerable said bateman yet last generation of incumbent contentedly bore be wonderful not unnatural silence followed speech charles broke by asking if bateman intended to do anything in improvement line at melford bateman looked modest nothing of consequence said few thing be done have rector of old school poor man who be enemy to sort of thing be with malicious feeling in consequence of attack on clergyman of past age charles pressed visitor to give account of own reform why said bateman much discretion be necessary in matter do a much harm a good get into hot water with churchwarden vestry a well a with old rector again with gentry of place please one for reason have made attempt to introduce surplice into pulpit except on great festival intending to familiarize parishioner to by little little however wear scarf stole have taken care that must be two inch broader than

be quite unshapely oh have remedied that said bateman have noticed miss reding dare say bishop short cassock come to knee look much like continuation of waistcoat straight cut coat being worn a usual well miss reding have adopted same plan with long cassock put coat over mary have difficulty to keep from smiling charles laughed out impossible bateman said mean wear tailed french coat over long straight cassock reaching to ankle certainly said bateman gravely thus consult for warmth appearance too parishioner be sure to know think great point miss reding little boy a pas say be parson will be bound do said charles well said mr reding surprised out of propriety did one ever hear like bateman looked round at startled frightened be going to speak of improvement in church said mary wishing to divert attention from mother ah true miss reding true said bateman thank for reminding have digressed to improvement in own dress must have liked to have pulled down gallery lowered high pew that however must not do so have lowered pulpit six foot now by doing so first give pattern in own person of kind of condescension lowliness to must persuade people be not for consequence of lowering pulpit be that one in gallery can see hear preach be bonus on who be below be broad hint certainly said charles be hint for below also continued bateman for one can see hear in pew till side be lowered one thing only be wanting besides said charles smiling looking amiable lest must be saying too much since be full tall must kneel when preach bateman else will undo own alteration bateman looked pleased have anticipated said preach sitting be more comformable to antiquity to reason to sit than to stand with precaution said charles really think might have ventured on surplice in pulpit sunday be parishioner contented oh not at far from cried bateman can hing alteration be so simple nothing besides asked charles nothing in architectural way answered one thing more in way of observance have fortunately picked up very fair copy of jewell black letter have placed in church securing with chain to wall for poor person who wish to read church be emphatically 'poor man church '

negative to certain point in respect oh to be sure said charles contradict by mean contradict entirely may give plain unqualified unconditional categorical flat denial asked bateman of course of course bateman must not make out have not dream how be teasing know where to find said paced down walk in silence bateman began again see said must be such wonderful blindness must be so utterly inexcusable in person like who have known what church of england be not dissenter not unlettered layman one who have be at oxford who have come across so many excellent men who have seen what church of england must be grave beauty orderly decent activity who have seen church decorated a must be with candlestick ciboriums faldstools lectern antependiums piscinas rood loft sedilia who in fact have seen church service carried out must desiderate nothing tell dear good reding taking hold of button hole what be want what be name that must take off charles must have said have spoken mind merely

protestation must effect how absurdly exaggerated be report be circulated about a said bateman with want of common sense be really well informed man well read in english divine thought might incidentally hear something from must turn to account when got to melford found mr campbell have be asked to meet young cambridge rector of neighbouring parish of same religious sentiment on whole a bateman though little positive man of clear head vigorous mind have be going over church conversation at dinner turned on revival of gothic architecture event gave unmixed satisfaction to party subject must have died out almost a soon a be started for want of difference upon have not bateman happily gone on boldly to declare that if have will there must be architecture in english church gothic music gregorian be good thesis distinctly put gave scope for very pretty quarrel reding said that adjunct of worship whether music architecture be national be mode in religious feeling showed in particular time place did not mean to say that outward expression of religion in country might not be guided must not be forced that be a preposterous to make people worship in one own way a be merry in one own way greek said cut hair in grief roman let grow oriental veiled head in worship greek uncovered christian take off hat in church mahometans shoe long veil be sign of modesty in europe of immodesty in asia may a well try to change size of people a form of worship bateman must cut down foot then will begin ecclesiastical reform surely worthy friend answered bateman mean to say that there be natural connexion between internal feeling outward expression so one form be better than far from answered charles let who confine music to gregorians put up crucifix in highway be representative of particular place time be what say of good friend short coat long cassock said campbell be confusion of different time ancient modern of different idea said charles cassock catholic coat protestant reverse said cassock be old hooker anglican habit coat come from catholic france anyhow be what mr reding call mixture of idea said campbell be difficulty find in uniting gothic gregorians oh pardon said bateman be one idea be eminently catholic ca be more catholic than rome suppose said campbell yet there be gothic there rome be peculiar place said bateman besides dear friend if do consider rome have corrupted pure apostolic doctrine can wonder that must have corrupt architecture why then go to rome for gregorians said campbell suspect be called after gregory bishop of rome whom protestant consider first specimen of antichrist be nothing to what protestant think answered bateman let quarrel about term said campbell think rome have corrupted faith whether be antichrist not said so yourself just now be true did said bateman make little distinction church of rome have not corrupted faith have admitted corruption among people wo do answered campbell depend on ca stand ground in controversy unless in heart think very severely of church of rome why what be rome to asked bateman come from old british church meddle with rome wish rome not to meddle with will well said campbell read bit of history of reformation will find that doctrine that pope be antichrist be life of movement with ultra protestant not with answered bateman such ultra protestant a writer of homily said campbell say again be not contending for name only mean that a doctrine be life of reformation so belief have too that there be something bad corrupt perilous in church of rome that there be spirit of antichrist living in energizing in ruling be necessary to man being good anglican must believe ought to go to rome impossible dear friend said bateman doctrine have be that rome be sister church say said campbell that without strong repulsion will not withstand great claim overcoming attraction of church of rome be mother oh that word beother mighty mother open arm oh fragrance of bosom be full of gift feel have long felt why rush into arm because feel that be ruled by spirit be not did distrust of go from be that certainty have of corruption disproved must join communion to morrow be not very edifying doctrine for reding thought bateman oh good campbell said be paradoxical to day not bit of answered campbell reformer felt that only way in must break tie of allegiance bound to rome be doctrine of serious corruption so be with divine if there be one doctrine in agree be that rome be antichrist antichrist depend upon doctrine be necessary for position quite understand language said reding see be used in various publication implies that controversy be game that disputant be not looking out for truth for argument must not mistake mr reding answered campbell mean be that have leave to trifle with conviction that rome be antichristian if think so for if be so be necessary to say so poet say gently of sister fall ' if be fall must not speak gently of at first one say beo great church who be to speak against ' yes must if view of be true 'tell truth shame devil recollect use own word be sanctioned protected by divine must else can give sufficient reason for not joining church of rome must speak out not what think what do think if do think here be doctrine thought charles why be putting controversy into nutshell bateman interposed dear campbell said be behind day have given up that abuse against rome then party be not so clever a give credit for being answered campbell be sure of who have given up protest against rome be looking towards have eye to see say answered bateman be a said before wish to interfere with rome anathematize rome rome anathematizes wo do said campbell who resolve to remain in church be using sweet word of romanism will be forced back upon proper ground in spite of will get thanks for pain man can serve two master either go to rome condemn rome for romish church have great deal in ca get over thinking so much a admire in part ca help speaking ca help must not be honest must not be consistent well have ended better than began thought bateman chimed in oh yes true too true be painful to see there be great deal in church of rome man of plain sense reader of father scripture student true member of anglo catholic church can possibly stomach put corona on discussion rest of dinner passed off pleasantly indeed not very intellectually chapter xvi after dinner occurred to that subject of gregorians gothic have be left in lurch how in world did get off asked charles well at least have found said bateman really must like to hear what have to say upon campbell oh really bateman answered be quite sick of subject one seems to to be going into extreme what be good of arguing about wo agree with see at answered bateman people often think differ merely because have not courage to talk to other good remark thought charles what pity bateman with so much sense must have so little common sense well then said campbell quarrel with gothic gregorians when coupled together be that be two idea not one have figured music in gothic church keep gregorian for basilica good campbell said bateman seem oblivious that gregorian chant hymn have always accompanied gothic aisle gothic cope gothic mitre gothic chalice ancestor did what must answered campbell be great in architecture small in music must not use what be not yet invented sang gregorians because have not palestrina paradox paradox cried bateman surely there be close connexion answered campbell between rise nature of basilica of gregorian unison existed before christianity be of pagan origin be afterwards consecrated to service of church pardon interrupted bateman gregorians be jewish not pagan be so for argument sake said campbell still at least be not of christian origin next old music old architecture be inartificial limited a method of exhibiting respective art ca have large grecian temple ca have long gregorian gloria not long one said bateman why there be poor willis used to complain how tedious old gregorian composition be abroad explain answered campbell of course may produce to length merely by addition not by carrying on melody can put two together then have one twice a long a speak of musical piece must of course be natural development of certain idea with one part depending on in like manner might make ionic temple twice a long twice a wide a parthenon must lose beauty of proportion by doing so then be what meant to say of primitive architecture primitive music that soon come to limit soon be exhausted can hing more if attempt more be like taxing musical instrument beyond power try bateman said reding to make bass play quadrille will see what be meant by taxing instrument well have heard lindley play sort of quick tune on bass said bateman most wonderful be wonderful be right word answered reding be very wonderful say 'how can manage ' be very wonderful for bass ' be not pleasant in in like manner have always felt disgust when mr so so come forward to make sweet flute bleat bray like hautbois be forcing poor thing to do what be never made for be literally true a regard gregorian music said campbell instrument did not exist in primitive time must execute other be speaking under correction mr reding seems to know more about subject than do have always understood a say answered charles modern music did not come into existence till after power of violin became known corelli who wrote not two hundred year ago hardly venture on shift piano again have heard have almost given birth to beethoven modern music then must not be in ancient time for want of modern instrument said campbell in like manner gothic architecture must not exist until vaulting be brought to perfection great mechanical invention have taken place in architecture in music since age of basilica gregorians science have gained by be curious enough said reding one thing have be accustomed to say quite fall in with view of yours when people who be not musician have accused handel beethoven of not being simple have always said 'be gothic architecture simple ' cathedral express one idea be indefinitely varied elaborated in part so be symphony quartett of beethoven certainly bateman must tolerate pagan architecture must in consistency exclude pagan jewish gregorians said campbell must tolerate figured music reprobate tracery window be for asked bateman gothic with handel roman with gregorians for in place answered campbell exceedingly prefer gothic architecture to classical think one true child development of christianity wo for reason discard pagan style have be sanctified by eighteen century by exclusive love of many christian country by sanction of host of saint be for toleration give gothic ascendancy be respectful towards classical conversation slackened much a like modern music said charles ca quite go length to doctrine must lead can not indeed help liking mozart surely music be not religious have not be speaking in defence of particular composer said campbell figured music may be right yet mozart beethoven inadmissible in like manner suppose because tolerate roman architecture therefore like naked cupid to stand for cherub sprawling woman for cardinal virtue paused besides added a be saying just now must consult genius of country religious association of people well said bateman think perfection of sacred music be gregorian set to harmony there have glorious old chant just little modern richness think just worst of answered campbell be mixture of two thing good in incongruous together be mixture of first second course at table be like architecture of facade at milan half gothic half grecian be what be always used believe said charles oh yes must not go against age said campbell must be absurd to do so only spoke of what be right wrong on abstract principle to tell truth ca help liking mixture though ca defend bateman rang for tea friend wished to return home soon be month of january season for after dinner stroll well said campbell be more lenient to age than to yield to age when set figured bass to gregorian tone laugh at for setting coat upon cassock be honour to be author of mongrel type said campbell mongrel type said bateman rather be transition state what be passing to asked charles talking of transition said campbell abruptly do know that man willis know college turned romanist be living in parish have hope be making transition back again have seen said charles have called be unfortunate be out still go to mass find why where doe find chapel asked bateman at seaton good seven mile from said charles yes answered campbell walk to fro sunday be not like transition except physical one observed reding person must go somewhere answered campbell suppose went to church up to week joined romanists very awful defection said bateman very satisfactory melancholy satisfaction with look at charles that victim of delusion must be at length recovered yes said campbell very sad indeed be afraid must expect number more well know how to think said charles hold church have on mind be so powerful be such wrench to leave can not fancy party tie standing against humanly speaking there be far far more to keep fast than to carry away yes if moved a party said campbell be not case move simply because others move poor fellow because ca help bateman will let chaise be brought round how can help continued standing up over fire catholic principle lead on there be nothing to drive back why must not love for own church asked bateman be deplorable unpardonable will keep going one after a ripen said campbell did hear report did not think much of said reding that smith be moving not impossible answered campbell thoughtfully impossible quite impossible cried bateman triumph to enemy will not believe see not impossible repeated campbell a buttoned fitted great coat about have shifted ground carriage be announced mr reding believe can take part of way if will accept of seat in pony chaise charles accepted offer bateman be soon deserted by two guest chapter xvii campbell put charles down

written better than willis must write be not willis be there be something about willis understand wonder how mother get on together think have sister chapter xviii campbell have be much pleased with reding interest in be not lessened by hint from bateman that allegiance to english church be in danger called on in long time asked to dinner when charles have returned invitation campbell have accepted beginning of acquaintance be formed between rectory at sutton family at boughton grew into intimacy a time went on campbell be gentleman travelled man of clear head ardent mind candid well read in english divinity devoted anglican incumbent of living so well endowed a almost to be dignity mary be pleased at introduction a bringing brother under influence of intellect must not make light of a campbell have carriage be natural that must wish to save charles loss of day reading trouble of muddy walk to rectory back by coming over to boughton accordingly so happened that saw charles twice at mother for once that saw at sutton came of visit nothing occurred particularly bear upon line of narrative so let pas one day charles called upon bateman on entering room be surprised to see campbell at luncheon in conversation with third person there be moment surprise hesitation on seeing before rose welcomed a usual when looked at stranger felt slight awkwardness must not control be willis apparently submitted to process of reconversion charles be evidently de trop there be help for so shook hand with willis accepted pressing call of bateman to seat at table to share bread cheese charles sat down opposite willis for while must not keep eye from at first have difficulty in believing have before impetuous youth have known two year half before have always be silent in general company in be changed a in everything else not that talked more than be natural talked freely easily great change however be in appearance manner have lost bloom youthfulness expression be sweeter indeed than before very placid there be thin line down face on side of mouth cheek be wanting in fulness have air of man of thirty when entered into conversation became animated former self returned suppose may admire cream at season said charles a helped for be none of devonshire men be not peculiar to devonshire answered campbell be have abroad at rome there be sort of cream cheese very like very common will butter cream keep in so warm climate asked charles fancied oil be substitute rome be not so warm a fancy said willis except during summer oil so be said campbell thus read in scripture of multiplication of oil meal seems to answer to bread butter oil in rome be excellent so clear pale can eat a milk taste suppose be peculiar observed charles just at first answered campbell one soon get used to such substance milk butter cheese oil have particular taste at first use alone get over rich guernsey butter be too much for stranger while russian relish whale oil most of taste be in measure artificial be certainly so with vegetable said willis when be boy must not eat bean spinach asparagus parsnip think others therefore hermit fare be not only most natural only naturally palatable suppose crust of bread draught from stream replied campbell clerk of copmanhurst dry pea said charles macaroni grape of neapolitan be a natural more palatable said willis rather be luxury said bateman answered campbell not luxury luxury be in very idea something recherche thus horace speaks of 'peregrina lagois ' what nature yield sponte sua around however delicious be luxury wild duck be luxury in old neighbourhood amid oxford fen bateman grape at naples then old woman here be luxurious over sixpenn'rth of tea said bateman for come from china campbell be posed for instant somehow bateman be quite at ease whether with with other might be charles sudden intrusion something have happened before campbell answered at length that steamer railroad be making strange change that time place be vanishing price must soon be only measure of luxury seems measure also of grasso magro food in italy said willis for think there be dispensation for butcher meat in lent in consequence of dearness of bread oil seems to show that age for abstinence fasting be past observed campbell for be absurd to keep lent on beef mutton oh campbell what be saying cried bateman past be bound by lax way in italy do certainly think answered campbell that fasting be unsuitable to age in england a well a in rome take care fine fellow thought charles keep rank wo secure prisoner what not fast on friday cried bateman always did so most rigidly at oxford doe credit answered campbell be of cambridge what do say to rubric calendar insisted bateman be not binding answered campbell be binding said bateman pause a between round of boxing match reding interposed bateman cut please bit of capital bread home made suppose thousand pardon said bateman not binding pas to willis if please yes come from farmer next door be glad like repeat be binding campbell odd sort of binding when have never bound answered campbell have existed two three hundred year when be ever put in force there be said bateman in prayer book yes there let lie never get out of retorted campbell there will stay till end of story oh for shame cried bateman must aid mother in difficulty not be like priest levite mother doe not wish to be aided continued campbell oh how talk what will do what can be done cried poor bateman done nothing said campbell be there such thing a desuetude of law doe not law cease to be binding when be not enforced appeal to mr willis willis thus addressed answered that be moral theologian have attended school believed be catholic rule that when law have be promulgated be not observed by majority if legislator knew state of case yet kept silence be considered ipso facto to revoke said bateman to campbell do appeal to romish church answered campbell appeal to whole catholic church of church of rome happens in particular case to be exponent be plain common sense that if law be not enforced at length cease to be binding else must be quite tyranny must not know where be church of rome doe give expression to common sense view well then said bateman will appeal to church of rome too rome be part of catholic church a well a since then romish church have ever kept up fasting ordinance be not abolished 'greater part ' of catholic church have always observed have not said campbell now dispenses with fast a have heard willis interposed to ask question do mean then said to bateman that church of england church of rome make one church most certainly answered bateman be possible said willis in what sense of word one in sense answered bateman that of intercommunion be suppose said willis be one except that have intercourse with other bateman assented willis continued intercourse be social dealing consulting arranging ordering obeying mutual support in short visible union bateman still assented well be difficulty said willis ca understand how two part can make up one visible body if be not visibly united unity implies union see that at said bateman see at willis must not expect will give up to be one of point there be only one visible church therefore english romish church be part of campbell saw clearly that bateman have got into difficulty came to rescue in own way must distinguish said state of case more exactly kingdom may be divided may be distracted by party by dissension yet be still kingdom conceive be real condition of church in way church of england rome greece be one suppose will grant said willis that in proportion a rebellion be strong so be unity of kingdom threatened if rebellion be successful if party in civil war manage to divide power territory between then forthwith instead of one kingdom have two ten fifteen year since belgium be part of kingdom of netherlands suppose must not call part of kingdom now seems case of church of rome england still kingdom may be in state of decay replied campbell consider case of turkish empire at moment union between separate portion be so languid that separate pasha may almost be termed separate sovereign still be one kingdom church then at present said willis be kingdom tending to dissolution certainly be answered campbell will ultimately fail asked willis certainly said campbell when end come according to lord saying 'when son of man cometh will find faith on earth just a in case of chosen people sceptre failed from judah when shiloh came surely church have failed already before end said willis according to view take of failing how can separation be more complete than exists at present between rome greece england might excommunicate other said campbell then be willing said willis to assign beforehand something definite occurrence of will constitute real separation do so said reding to campbell be dangerous commit in moral question for then if thing specified did occur must be difficult to see way said willis certainly must be in difficulty must find way out know in case must choose other ultimatum a test of schism there must be added speaking with emotion 'in lowest depth lower still ' concluding word be out of keeping with tone of conversation hitherto fairly excited bateman who for time have be impatient listener be dangerous line campbell said be indeed ca go along with will never do to say that church be failing never fails be always strong pure perfect a prophet describe look at cathedral abbey church other sanctuary fitly typify dear bateman answered campbell be a willing a to maintain fulfilment of prophecy made to church must allow fact that branch of church be divided while maintain doctrine that church must be one see at answered bateman need not allow there be such thing a church there be one church everywhere be not divided be merely outward form appearance manifestation of church be divided church be one a much a ever be that will never do said campbell stood up before fire in state of discomfort nature never intended for controversialist good bateman added to be a thought said willis bateman be describing invisible church hold indefectibility of invisible church not of visible be in fix thought charles will do best to tow old bateman out so began said bateman only mean that one church present in particular point different appearance from doe not follow that in fact have not visible agreement too difference implies agreement english roman church agree visibly differ visibly think of different style of architecture will see willis what mean church be church world over be visibly one same yet how different be church from church church be gothic southern church be palladian how different be basilica from york cathedral yet visibly agree together one must mistake either for mosque jewish temple may quarrel be better style one like basilica call pagan that do said bateman little extreme said campbell little extreme a usual basilica be beautiful in place there be two thing gothic can not show line forest of round polished column graceful dome circling above one head like blue heaven party be glad of diversion from religious dispute so continued lighter conversation have succeeded with considerable earnestness fear must confess said willis that church at rome affect like gothic reverence feel awe in love feel sensible pleasure at sight of gothic arch there be other reason for in rome said campbell church be so unfinished so untidy rome be city of ruin christian temple be built on ruin be generally dilapidated decayed thus be ruin of ruin campbell be on easier subject than of anglo catholicism one interrupting proceeded flowingly in rome have huge high buttress in place of column not cased with marble of cold white plaster paint impart indescribable forlorn look to church willis said often wondered what took so many foreigner be protestant to rome be so dreary so melancholy place number of old crumbling shapeless brick mass ground unlevelled straight causeway fenced by high monotonous wall point of attraction straggling over broad solitude faded palace tree universally pollarded street ankle deep in filth eye mouth deep in cloud of whirling dust straw climate most capricious evening air most perilous naples be earthly paradise rome be city of faith to seek shrine that contained be veritable penance a be fitting understood catholic going there be perplexed at protestant there be spell about limen apostolorum said charles st peter st paul be not there for nothing there be more tangible reason said campbell be place where person of nation be to be found society be so varied a roman go to ballroom host whom bow to in first apartment be frenchman a advance eye catch massena granddaughter in conversation with mustapha pasha soon find seated between yankee charge d'affaires russian colonel englishman be playing fool in front of here campbell looked at watch then at willis whom have driven over to melford to return bateman call be time for to be going must be overtaken by evening bateman who have remained in state of great dissatisfaction since last spoke have not be for quarter of hour past did not find in spirit to try much to detain reding so be speedily left to drew chair to fire for while felt nothing more than heavy load of disgust after time however thought began to draw out into series took following form be too bad too bad said campbell be very clever man far cleverer than be well read man too have tact tact be deplorable reding coming be one misfortune however might have got over might have even turned to advantage to use such argument a did how must hope to convince made mere laughing stock how did throw off oh said that rubric be not binding who ever heard thing at least from anglo catholic why pretend to be good catholic with such view better call protestant erastian at once one must know where to find such bad impression must make on willis saw did must hardly keep from smiling campbell have tact at go on on own way bringing out own thought be very clever original certainly never considering company be so positive so knock down be quite unpleasant know how to sit sometimes oh be cruel thing effect must be wretched poor willis declare think have moved one inch really fancied at one time be even laughing at be said afterwards there be something else know recollect that catholic church be in ruin have broken to piece what paradox who will believe that declare be so vexed know what to be at jumped up began walking to fro be because bishop wo interfere one ca say be worst be at bottom of evil have to put out little finger enforce rubric then whole controversy must be at end knew there be something else yes said need not fast cambridge men be always peculiar always have whim other ought to have be at oxford must have made man of have many good point run theory ride hobby drive consequence to death here be interrupted by clerk who told that john tims have taken oath that wife must not be churched before congregation be half minded to take infant to methodist for baptism thought took different direction chapter xix winter have be on whole dry pleasant in february march rain be so profuse wind so high that bateman saw very little of charles willis did not abandon design on latter be anxious question how best to conduct a to campbell be resolved to exclude from participation in hesitated about reding have found far le definitely roman than expected conjectured that by making confidant employing against willis really might succeed in giving anglican direction accordingly told of anxiety to restore willis to church of baptism not discouraged by charles advice to let well alone for might succeed in drawing from rome without reclaiming to anglicanism weather having improved asked two to dinner on one of later sunday in lent determined to make field day of with view carefully got up of most popular work against church of rome after much thought determined to direct attack on of practical evil a considered of romanism a being more easy of proof than point of doctrine history in too for what knew willis might by time be better read than considered too that if willis have be at shaken in new faith when be abroad be by practical exemplification have before eye of issue of peculiar doctrine when freely carried out moreover to tell truth good friend have not very clear apprehension how much doctrine held in common with church of rome where be to stop in several detail of pope pius creed in consequence be evidently safer to confine attack to matter of practice see willis said a sat down to table have given abstinence food not knowing whether avail of dispensation will eat meat ourselves think fast at proper time agree with campbell at fast however on sunday be rule take primitive one willis answered that did not know how primitive usage lay supposed that of allowed that matter of discipline might be altered by proper authority certainly answered bateman so everything be done consistently with inspired text of scripture stopped itching if must to bring in great subject not seeing how saw must rush in medias re so added with inspired text presume what one see in foreign church be not very consistent what suppose mean antependia rere dos stone altar cope mitre said willis innocently certainly be not in scripture true said bateman though not in scripture be not inconsistent with scripture be very right worship of saint especially blessed virgin of relic gabbling over prayer in unknown tongue indulgence infrequent communion suspect be directly unscriptural dear bateman said willis seem to live in atmosphere of controversy so be at oxford there be always argument going on in room religion be thing to enjoy not to quarrel about give slice more of leg of mutton yes bateman said reding must let enjoy meat willis deserves for believe have have fair walk to day have not walked good part of way to seaton back matter of fourteen mile hilly ground ca be dry too in part yet true said bateman take glass of wine willis be good madeira aunt of mine sent put to shame said charles who have stepped into church from bedroom have trudged pilgrimage to be not saying word against dear friend willis said bateman be merely point on thought must agree with that there be many corruption of worship in foreign church at last when silence be observable willis said that supposed that person who be not catholic must not tell what be corruption what not here subject dropped again for willis did not seem in humour perhaps be too tired to continue so ate drank with nothing very commonplace remark to season meal withal till cloth be removed table be then shoved back bit three young men got over fire bateman made burn brightly two of at least have deserved relaxation be two who be to be opponent respondent in approaching argument one have have long walk other have have two full service baptism funeral armistice continued good quarter of hour charles willis spent in easy conversation till bateman who have be priming while with controversial point found ready for assault opened in form come dear willis said ca let off so be sure what saw abroad scandalized be almost rudely put willis said that have be protestant might have be easily shocked have be catholic drew almost imperceptible sigh besides have have temptation to be shocked must have recollected that be in church in greater matter must not err have not come to church to criticize said to learn know said what be meant by saying that ought to have faith that faith be grace that faith be mean of salvation if there be nothing to exercise faith go against sight well then unless there be sight offend there be nothing for to go against bateman called paradox if so said why become mahometans must have enough to believe then why just consider said willis supposing friend honourable man be accused of theft appearance be against must at once admit charge must be fair trial of faith in if be able in event satisfactorily to rebut think must thank must have waited for explanation before took part instead of knowing too well to suspect if then come to church with faith in see there even if surprise be trial of faith be true said charles there must be ground for faith believe without reason question be whether what church doe a in worship be not fair matter to form judgment upon for against catholic said willis a be when be abroad have already found ground for belief for one who have not mean protestant certainly consider be very uncertain whether will take view of catholic worship ought to take may easily happen that will not understand yet person have before now be converted by sight of catholic worship said reding certainly answered willis god work in thousand way there be much in catholic worship to strike protestant there be much will perplex for instance what bateman have alluded to devotion to blessed virgin surely said bateman be plain matter be quite impossible that worship paid by roman catholic to blessed mary must not interfere with supreme adoration due to creator alone be just instance in point said willis see be judging priori know nothing of state of case from experience say must be ca be otherwise be way protestant judge come to one conclusion catholic who act doe not speculate feel truth of contrary thing said bateman be so like axiom a to supersede trial on other hand familiarity be very likely to hide from people real evil of certain practice how strange be answered willis that perceive that be very argument various sect urge against anglican for instance unitarian say that doctrine of atonement must lead to looking at father not a god of love of vengeance only call doctrine of eternal punishment immoral so wesleyan baptist declares that be absurdity to suppose one can hold doctrine of baptismal regeneration really be spiritual that doctrine must have numbing effect on mind destroy simple reliance on atonement of christ will take instance many good catholic who never came across anglican be a utterly unable to realize position a be to realize can not make out how can be so illogical a not to go forward backward nay pronounces professed state of mind impossible doe not believe in existence may deplore state may think illogical worse know be state doe exist a then admit that person can hold one catholic church yet without believing that roman communion be so put to even a argumentum ad hominem whether ought not to believe that can honour blessed lady a first of creature without interfering with honour due to god at most ought to call only illogical ought not to deny that do what say do make distinction said bateman be quite possible fully grant for educated romanist to distinguish between devotion paid by to blessed virgin worship of god only say that multitude will not distinguish know say so answered willis still repeat not from experience on priori ground say not 'it be so ' must be so there be pause in conversation then bateman recommenced may give trouble said laughing be resolved to have back good willis now consider be lover of truth be that church from heaven tell untruth willis laughed too must define word truth untruth said subject to definition have hesitation in enunciating truism that church be not from heaven tell untruth of course ca deny proposition said bateman well then be not quite certain that in rome there be relic learned men now give up yet be venerated a relic for instance campbell tell that reputed head of st peter st paul in great roman basilica be certainly not head of apostle because head of st paul be found with body after fire at church year since know about particular instance answered willis be opening large question can not be settled in few word if must speak must say must begin with assumption that existence of relic be not improbable do grant grant nothing said bateman go on why have plenty of heathen relic admit what be pompeii be found there one vast heathen relic why must there not be christian relic in rome elsewhere a well a pagan of course of course said bateman well relic may be identified have tomb of scipio with name on did find ash in one of suppose must be pretty certain that be ash of scipio to point cried bateman quicker st peter continued willis speaks of david sepulchre be with unto day ' therefore be nothing wonderful that religious relic must be preserved eleven hundred year identified to be such when nation make point of preserving be beating about bush cried bateman impatiently get on quicker let go on own way said willis then there be nothing improbable considering christian have always be very careful about memorial of sacred thing have not proved that said bateman fearing that manoeuvre must not tell what be in progress well said willis doubt suppose at least from fourth century when st helena brought from holy land memorial of lord passion lodged at rome in basilica be thereupon called santa croce a to previous time of persecution christian of course have fewer opportunity of showing similar devotion historical record be le copious yet in spite of existence be a certain a fact of history collected bone of st polycarp immediate disciple of st john after be burnt a of st ignatius before after exposure to beast so in like manner bone blood of martyr one doubt never heard of one who did so disciple took up baptist body must have be strange if have not buried 'in sepulchre a evangelist say speaking of a known now why must not in like manner even with greater reason have rescued body of st peter st paul if be only for decent burial be then wonderful if body be rescued that must be afterwards preserved ca be in two place at once said bateman hear answered willis say then if there be tradition that in certain place there be relic of apostle there be at first sight probability that be there presumption be in favour can deny well if same relic be reported to be in two place then one other tradition be erroneous prima facie force of tradition be weakened must not actually discard at once have force still though so great force now suppose there be circumstance confirm one other be weakened still further at length probability of truth may become evanescent when fair interval have passed there be change of evidence in favour then be at length given up be work of time meanwhile be not bit more of objection to doctrine practice of relic veneration that body be said to lie in two place than to profane history that charles be reported by authority to be buried at windsor by others at westminster question be decided just before time be question of evidence must be treated a such if st paul head be found under own church said bateman be pretty clear be not preserved at other basilica true answered willis grave question of kind can not be decided in moment know circumstance of case do take account of have to be proved then suppose that be st paul head be found with body for since be beheaded must not be attached to be one question others must arise be not easy to settle question of history question seem settled revive be very well for secular historian to give up tradition testimony at once for generation to oh oh church can not do so have religious responsibility must move slowly take chance of turning out that head at st john lateran be after of two apostle that have cast aside question say revive did not walpole make highly probable that two little prince have place in procession at king richard coronation though century before two skeleton of boy be found in tower at very place where child of edward be said to have be murdered buried by duke of gloucester speak from memory general fact be illustrating be undeniable ussher pearson voss proved that st ignatius shorter epistle be genuine now after lapse of two century question be at least plausibly mooted again there be pause while bateman thought over fact argument nothing be forthcoming at moment willis continued must consider also that reputed relic such a have mentioned be generally in custody of religious body who be naturally very jealous of attempt to prove spurious with pardonable esprit de corp defend with might oppose obstacle in way of adverse decision just a own society defends most worthily fair fame of foundress queen boadicea be case given against by tribunal in land valiant loyal head must not abandon must break magnanimous heart must die in service a good knight from religious duty then from human feeling be very arduous thing to get received relic disowned well said bateman to poor judgment doe seem dishonesty to keep up inscription for instance one know not to be true dear bateman be begging question said willis body doe not know be point in course of settlement not settled may say that individual have settled may be settled be not settled yet parallel case happen frequently in civil matter one speaks harshly of existing individual body in consequence till lately monument in london bore inscription to effect that london have be burned by poor papist hundred year ago pope poet have called 'column ' tall bully 'lifts head lie ' yet inscription be not removed till few year since believe when monument be repaired that be opportunity for erasing calumny till then have not be definitely pronounced to be such not pronounced in deference to prima facie authority of statement contemporaneous with calamity recorded there be never point of time at can say tradition be now disproved ' when received belief have be apparently exposed question lie dormant for opportunity of fresh argument when none appear then at length accident such a repair of building despatch have somehow got off subject thought bateman sat fidgeting about to find thread of argument reding put in objection said that one knew cared about inscription on monument religious veneration be paid to two head at st john lateran right said bateman be just what meant to say well answered willis a to particular case mind be taking account of for profess to know how matter lie let consider extent of mistake there be doubt in world at least be head of martyr only question be more whether be very head of two apostle from time immemorial have be preserved upon under altar a head of saint martyr requires to know very little of christian antiquity to be perfectly certain that really be saintly relic even though unknown hence sole mistake be that catholic have venerated what ought to be venerated anyhow under wrong name perhaps have expected miracle have right to expect have experienced a might well experience because be relic of saint though be in error a to what saint surely be great matter have made three assumption said bateman first that none relic of saint have be placed under altar secondly that relic be always there thirdly thirdly know there be third let see most true said willis interrupting will help to others have assumed that there be christian in world called catholic again that think right to venerate relic dear bateman be ground not point of argument if be to be questioned must be in distinct dispute really think have have enough of disputation yes bateman said charles be getting late must think of returning give tea let begone go home cried bateman why have just done dinner done nothing else a yet have great deal to say however rang bell for tea have table cleared chapter xx conversation flagged bateman be again busy with memory be getting impatient too time be slipping away blow struck moreover willis be beginning to gape charles seemed impatient to be released romanists put thing so plausibly said to very unfairly most unfairly one ought to be up to dodge dare say if truth be known willis have have lesson look so demure dare say be keeping back great deal playing upon ignorance who know perhaps be concealed jesuit be awful thought suspended course of reflection second wonder what doe really think be so difficult to get at bottom of wo tell tale be under obedience one never know when to believe suspect have be wofully disappointed with romanism look so thin of course wo say so hurt man pride like to be consistent doe like to be laughed at so make best of thing wish knew how to treat be wrong in having reding here of course willis must not be confidential before third person be like fox that lost tail be bad tact in see now what thing be to have tact requires very delicate tact there be so many thing wished to say about indulgence about so seldom communicating think must ask about mass so after fidgeting good deal within while be ostensibly employed in making tea commenced last assault well will have back again among by next christmas willis said ca give greater law be certain of take time slow sure what joyful time will be ca tell what keep be doing nothing be flung into corner be wasting life what keep willis looked odd then simply answered grace bateman be startled recovered heaven forbid said that must treat thing lightly interfere with unduly know dear friend what serious fellow be do tell just tell how can justify mass a be performed abroad how can be called beasonable service when party conspire to gabble over a if mattered not jot who attended to even understood speak man speak added gently shaking by shoulder be such difficult question answered willis must speak such difficult question continued rising into more animated manner kindling a went on mean people view so differently be so difficult to convey to one person idea of idea of worship be different in catholic church from idea of in church for in truth religion be different deceive dear bateman said tenderly be not ours be religion carried little farther little too far a must say differ in kind not in degree ours be one religion yours when time come come will for alien a be now to submit to gracious yoke of christ then dearest bateman will be faith will enable to bear way usage of catholic else might perhaps startle else habit of year association in mind of certain outward behaviour with real inward act of devotion might embarrass when have to conform to other habit to create for other association faith of speak

quite wonderful when will dear good people be enlightened o sapientia fortiter suaviterque disponens omnia o adonai o clavis david et exspectatio gentium veni ad salvandum no domine deus noster now at least there be mistaking willis bateman stared be almost frightened at burst of enthusiasm have be far from expecting why willis said be not true then after what heard that be somewhat dubious shaky in adherence to romanism be sure beg pardon must not for world have annoyed have known truth willis face still glowed looked a youthful radiant a have be two year before there be nothing ungentle in impetuosity smile almost laugh be on face a if be half ashamed of own warmth took nothing from evident sincerity seized bateman two hand before latter knew where be lifted up out of seat raising own mouth close to ear said in low voice must to god that not only thou also who hear day be in little in much such a be except chain then reminding have grown late bidding good night left room with

at first be inclined to think that after might have misgiving about position then thought that perhaps have hair shirt catenella on lastly came to conclusion that have just meant nothing at did finish quotation have begun after passing little time in state looked towards tea tray poured out cup of tea ate bit of toast took coal off fire blew out one of candle taking up other left parlour wound like omnibus up steep twisting staircase to bedroom meanwhile willis charles be proceeding to respective home for while have to pursue same path did in silence charles have be moved far more than bateman rather touched by enthusiasm of catholic friend though from difficulty in finding language to express fear of being carried off leg have kept feeling to when be about to part willis said to in subdued tone be soon going to oxford dearest reding oh that be one with have in have thought of at mass many time priest have said mass for oh dear friend quench not god grace listen to call have have what

charles to return to oxford during last month scruple have arisen in mind whether with present feeling must consistently even present for examination subscription be necessary for entrance into school felt that honour of class list be only intended for who be bona fide adherent of church of england laid difficulty before carlton who in consequence did best to ascertain thoroughly present state of mind seemed that charles have intention either now at future day of joining church of rome that felt must not take such step at present without distinct sin that must simply be against conscience to do so that have feeling whatever that god called to do so that felt that nothing must justify so serious act conviction that must not be saved in church to belonged that have such feeling that have definite case against own church sufficient for leaving definite view that church of rome be one church of christ still must not help suspecting that one day must think otherwise conceived day might come nay must come when must have conviction at present have not of course must be call on to act upon by leaving church of england for of rome must not tell distinctly why so anticipated except that there be so many thing thought right in church of rome so many thought wrong in church of england because too more have opportunity of hearing seeing greater cause have to admire revere roman catholic system to be dissatisfied with own carlton after carefully considering case advised to go in for examination acted thus on one hand a vividly feeling change take place in mind of young men difficulty of reding foretelling own state of opinion two year to come on other from reasonable anticipation that contrary advice must have be very way to ripen present doubt on untenableness of anglicanism into conviction accordingly examination came off in due time school be full did well class be considered to be secure sheffield followed soon after did brilliantly list came out sheffield be in first class charles in second there be always of necessity good deal of accident in matter in present case reason enough must be given to account for unequal success of two friend charles have lost time by father death family matter consequent upon virtual rustication for last six month have be considerable disadvantage to moreover though have be careful persevering reader certainly have not run race for honour with same devotion a sheffield have religious difficulty particularly late indecision about presenting at be without serious influence upon attention energy a success have not be first desire of soul so failure be not greatest misery must have much preferred success in day two found must well endure want of now came question about degree must not be taken without subscription to article consultation followed with carlton there be need of becoming ba at moment nothing must be gained by better that must postpone step have to go down say nothing about one must be wiser if at end of six month a carlton sanguinely anticipated found in more comfortable frame of mind then let come up set right what be to do with at moment there be little difficulty here either what to propose have better be reading with clergyman in country thus must at once be preparing for order clearing mind on point at present troubled besides might thus have opportunity for parochial duty must have tranquillizing sobering effect on mind a to book to must give attention of course choice must rest with clergyman who be to guide for carlton must not recommend usual work in controversy with rome for anglican church be famous rather be of positive character treated subject philosophically historically doctrinally displayed peculiar principle of church hooker great work for instance bull defensio harmonia pearson vindiciae jackson on creed noble work to laud on tradition might be added though form be controversial such too be antiquity waterland on use of antiquity wall on infant baptism palmer on liturgy ought to neglect practical devotional author a bishop taylor wilson horne most important point remained whither be to betake did know of clergyman in country who must be willing to receive a friend pupil charles thought of campbell with whom be on best of term carlton knew enough of by reputation to be perfectly sure that must not be in safer hand charles in consequence made proposal to be accepted nothing then remained for to pay few bill to pack up book have left in friend room then to bid adieu at least for time to cloister grove of university quitted in june when everything be in youthful fragrant beauty have admired so much in beginning of residence three year before part iii chapter now must look forward not back once before took leave to pas over nearly two year in life of subject of narrative now second dreary longer interval will be consigned to oblivion reader will be set down in autumn of year next one after in charles took class did not take degree at time interest be confined to boughton rectory at sutton a to melford friend bateman have accepted incumbency of church in manufacturing town with district of soul where be full of plan for introduction of surplice gilt candlestick among people where be to be hoped will learn wisdom willis also be gone on different errand have bid adieu to mother brother soon after charles have gone into school now be father aloysius de sanctum cruce in passionist convent of pennington one evening at end of september in year aforesaid campbell have called at boughton be walking in garden with miss reding really mary said to think doe good to keep best year of life be going humanly speaking there be not chance of changing mind at least till have made trial of church of rome be quite possible that experience may drive back be dreadful dilemma answered how can even indirectly give permission to take so fatal step be dear good fellow made reply be sterling fellow long time that have be with have made difficulty have read thoroughly book recommended more done told know have employed in parish have taught catechism to child be almoner poor fellow health be suffering now see there be end of hope deferred make heart sick be so dreadful to give countenance to what be so very wrong said mary why what be to be done answered campbell need not countenance ca be kept in leading string for ever there have be kind of bargain wanted to make move at end of first year did think while to fidget about quieted compounded in way removed name from college board there be not slightest chance of ever signing article consented to wait year now time up more be getting impatient so be not who will be giving countenance will only be leaving be so fearful insisted mary poor mother declare think will be death will be crushing blow there be doubt of said campbell what doe know of at present hardly can tell answered have be informed of indeed distinctly year ago seeing charles so often in appearance just same fear doe not realize have never spoken to on subject fancy think scruple troublesome certainly of course temporary must break to mary said campbell well think must be done replied heaving sudden sigh if so will be real kindness in to save task to be quite unequal have talk with charles first when come to point may have greater difficulty than think beforehand so be settled full of care at double commission with be charged campbell rode back to sutton poor charles be sitting at open window looking out upon prospect when campbell entered room be beautiful landscape with bold hill in distance rushing river beneath campbell came up to without perceiving putting hand on shoulder asked thought charles turned round smiled sadly be like moses seeing land said dear campbell when will end be that good charles of course doe not rest with answered campbell well said year be long run out may go way ca expect of must even indirectly countenance in what with love of think sin said campbell be a much a to say 'act for ' answered charles well be willing campbell did not at once reply then said will have to break to poor mother mary think will be death charles dropped head on window sill upon hand said trust that of will be supported so do fervently answered campbell will be most terrible blow to sister dear fellow must not take into account do seriously consider actual misery be causing for possible good do think have not considered campbell be nothing for one like to be breaking dear tie to be losing esteem sympathy of so many person love oh have be most piercing thought have exhausted have drunk out have got familiar with prospect now be fully reconciled yes give up home give up who have ever known loved valued wished well know well be making by word outcast oh dear charles answered campbell beware of very subtle temptation may come on here have meant to warn of before greatness of sacrifice stimulates do because be so much to do charles smiled how little know said if be case must have waited patiently two year more why did not rush forward a others have done will not deny have acted rationally obediently have put subject from again again have returned will say nothing harsh unkind of charles said campbell be most unfortunate delusion wish must make take in idea that there be chance of being delusion ah campbell how can forget so answered charles know be very thing have influenced so much along said 'perhaps be in dream oh must pinch awake ' know what stress laid on change of feeling upon dear father death what thought to be conviction before vanished then like cloud have said to myself 'perhaps will vanish too 'the cloud return after rain come again again heavier than ever be conviction rooted in endures against prospect of loss of mother sister here sit wasting day when might be useful in life why because hinders lately have increased on tenfold will be shocked let tell in confidence lately have be quite afraid to ride to bathe to do anything out of way lest something must happen might be taken away with great duty unaccomplished by time have proved that be real conviction belief in church of rome be part of myself can not act against without acting against god be most deplorable state of thing certainly said campbell who have begun to walk up down room that be delusion be confident perhaps be to find so just when have taken step will solemnly bind to foreign creed a word part from mouth mist will roll up from before eye truth will show how dreadful have thought of too said charles have influenced great deal have made shrink back now believe to be like hideous form in fairy tale beset good knight when must force way into enchanted palace recollect word in thalaba talisman be faith ' if have good ground for believing to believe be duty god will take care of own work will not be deserted in utmost need faith ever begin with venture be rewarded with sight yes good charles answered campbell question be whether ground be good what mean be that since be not good will not avail in trial will then too late find be not good delusive campbell answered charles consider that reason come from god ground must at best be imperfect if appear to be sufficient after prayer diligent search obedience waiting in short doing part be voice calling on be in case who make seem convincing to be in hand only question be what must have to do can not resist conviction be upon last week have possessed in different way than ever before be now so strong that to wait longer be to resist god whether join catholic church be now simply question of day wish dear campbell to leave in peace love therefore consent let go let go answered campbell certainly be catholic church to be going there must be no need to ask 'let go ' how can expect from when think so think of case charles a well a own throw into state of feeling for can not deny never have concealed from conviction that romish church be antichristian have ten thousand gift be in many respect superior to own have something in spoil have confidence in that being case how can 'let go ' to be like person saying 'let go hang ' 'let go sleep in fever ward jump into well how can 'let go ' ah said charles be dreadful difference ca get farther than think church of rome prophet of god tool of devil own said campbell do think that if take step will find in hand of circe who will change make brute of charles slightly coloured wo go on added campbell pain be good perhaps be making matter worse spoke for time at length charles got up came up to campbell took hand kissed have be kind disinterested friend to for two year said have given lodging under roof now be soon to be united by closer tie god reward 'let go for day breaketh be hopeless cried campbell let part friend must break to mother in ten day after conversation charles be ready for journey room put to right portmanteau strapped gig at door be to take first stage be to go round by boughton have be arranged by campbell mary that must be best for not to see mother to whom campbell have broken matter at once till took leave of must be needle pain to of to attempt interview sooner charles leapt from gig with beating heart ran up to mother room be sitting by fire at work when entered held out hand coldly to sat down nothing be said for little while then without leaving off occupation said well charles so be leaving where how do propose to employ when have entered upon new life charles answered that have not yet turned mind to consideration of anything great step on everything else depended there be silence then said wo find anywhere such friend a have have at home charles presently continued have have everything in favour charles have be blessed with talent advantage of education easy circumstance many deserving young man have to scramble on a can charles answered that be deeply sensible how much owed in temporal matter to providence that be only at bidding that be giving up looked up to charles perhaps made too much of well god be with have taken line poor charles said that one must conceive what cost to give up what be so very dear to what be part of there be nothing on earth prized like home then why do leave said quickly must have way do suppose because like oh really dear mother cried if saw heart know in scripture how people be obliged in apostle time to give up for christ be heathen then replied thank charles be obliged to for dashed away tear from eye charles be almost beside did not know what to say stood up leaned elbow on mantelpiece supporting head on hand well charles continued still going on with work perhaps day will come voice faltered dear father put down work be useless misery said charles why must stay good bye for present dearest mother leave in good hand not kinder better than mine lose gain farewell for present will meet when will when call will be happy meeting threw on knee laid cheek on lap must no longer resist hung over began to smooth down hair a have done when be child at length scalding tear began to fall heavily upon face neck bore for while then started up kissed cheek impetuously rushed out of room in few second have seen have torn from sister be in gig again by side of phlegmatic driver dancing slowly up down on way to collumpton chapter ii reader may ask whither charles be going though must not be quite true to answer that did not know better than said reader yet have most certainly very indistinct notion what be becoming of even locally like patriarch went out not knowing whither went have never seen catholic priest to know in life never except once a boy be inside catholic church only knew one catholic in world where be did not know knew that passionists have convent in london be not unnatural that without knowing whether young father aloysius be there not must direct course to san michaele yet in kindness to mary of did not profess to be leaving direct for london proposed to

duty lay before chapter iii nothing happened to charles worth relating before arrival at steventon next day when afternoon being fine left portmanteau to follow by omnibus put upon road if required courage to undertake by long journey on momentous errand did not lessen difficulty that journey took in way place person so dear to a oxford carlton have passed through bagley wood spire tower of

reding have come to resolution with great deliberation have remained on mind a mere intellectual conclusion for year two surely now at length without blame may change into practical resolve none of can answer that habitual ruling conviction on be duty to act will remain before consciousness moment when come into hurry of world be assailed by inducement motif of various kind therefore say that time of argument be past act on conclusion already drawn how do know asked carlton what have be unconsciously biassed in arriving at one notion have possessed have not be able to shake off ability to retain conviction in bustle of life be to mind very test necessary test of reality do do retain answered reding be always upon only at time a have confessed objected carlton surely ought to have very strong conviction indeed to set against mischief be doing by step of kind consider how many person be unsettling what triumph be giving to enemy of religion what encouragement to notion that there be such thing a truth how be weakening church well say be that must have very strong conviction to set against well said charles grant maintain that only motive be sufficient to justify such act be conviction that one salvation depends on now speak sincerely dear carlton in saying that think will be saved if remain in english church do mean that there be salvation in church said carlton rather coldly be talking of be not place to judge others only say god call must follow at risk of soul god 'calls said carlton what doe mean like be dissenting language know be scripture language answered

many other subject be always so be member of church of england to seek truth have given from first do seek for be ready provided for carlton thought moment seemed doubtful what to answer then said that must of course seek be part of moral probation to seek truth then talk to about position said charles hardly expected to make answer be what majority of church of england people say tell to seek give rule for seeking make exert private judgment directly come to conclusion theirs turn round talk to of 'providential position there be thing tell supposing ought to seek truth do think that member of english church do seek in way scripture enjoins upon seeker think how very seriously scripture speaks of arduousness of finding labour of seeking duty of thirsting after truth believe bulk of english clergy bulk of oxford resident head of house fellow of college with good point be not man to deny have ever sought truth have taken what found have used private judgment at if have judged have be in vaguest most cursory way possible have looked into scripture only to find proof for what be bound to subscribe a undergraduate getting up article then sit over wine talk about that friend who have beeceded ' condemn glancing at newspaper on table assign motif for conduct yet after be more likely to be right who have given year perhaps to search of truth who have habitually prayed for guidance have taken mean in power to secure 'the gentleman of england who sit at home at ease ' may talk of seeking truth of private judgment a duty have never sought have never judged be where be not because be true because find there because be 'providential position ' pleasant one into bargain reding have got somewhat excited paragraph in newspaper have annoyed without taking into account there be enough in circumstance in found to throw out of ordinary state of mind be in crisis of peculiar trial person must have felt to understand few men go to battle in cold blood prepare without agitation for surgical operation carlton on other hand be quiet gentle person who be not heard to use excited word once year conversation came to stand at length carlton said hope dear reding be not joining church of rome merely because there be unreasonable unfeeling person in church of england charles felt that be not showing to advantage that be giving rise to very surmise about motif of conversion be deprecating be sad thing said with something of self reproach to spend last minute in wrangling forgive carlton if have said anything too strongly earnestly carlton thought have thought in excited state be use telling so so merely pressed offered hand affectionately said nothing presently said dryly abruptly reding do know roman catholic answered reding willis indeed hav' seen even two year have be entirely working of own mind carlton did not answer at once then said a dryly abruptly a before suspect then will have much to bear with when know what do mean asked reding will find under educated men suspect what do know of said reding suspect answered carlton what be to purpose asked charles be thing must think of english clergyman be gentleman may have more to bear than reckon for when find with men of rude mind vulgar manner dear carlton a' talking of what know nothing at about well must think of must contemplate said carlton judge from letter speech one read in paper charles thought awhile then said certainly like many thing be done said by roman catholic just now see how can be more than trial cross see how affect great question except that may find fish out of water answered carlton may find in position where can act with one where will be quite thrown away well said charles a to fact know nothing about may be a say think much of proof in community worst be on outside what offends in catholic public proceeding need be measure nay believe can not be measure of inward catholic mind must not judge anglican church by exeter hall nay not by episcopal charge see interior of own church exterior of church of rome be not fair comparison look at book of devotion insisted carlton ca write english reding smiled at carlton slowly shook head to fro while said write english suppose a classically a st john writes greek here again conversation halted nothing be heard for while simmering of kettle there be good in disputing a might be seen from first have own view be beginning end of matter charles stood up well dearest carlton said must part must be going on for eleven pulled out of pocket small christian year have often seen with continued accept in memory of will not see here be pledge will not forget will ever remember stopped much affected oh be very hard to leave to go to stranger went on wish can not help be called be compelled stopped again tear flowed down cheek be well said recovering be well be hard at time scarcely one to feel for black look bitter word be pleasing following own will well began looking at finger slowly rubbing palm one on must be whispered to through tribulation to kingdom sowing in tear reaping in joy pause new train of thought came over oh said fear so very much so very much that who come forward will go back can not stand where be for time will think do then will oppose still think keep ground while use same word a before belief opinion will decline will hold le then in time will strike that in differing with protestant be contending only about word call rationalist take care fall into liberalism now dearest carlton one friend in oxford who be patient loving towards good bye may meet not long hence in peace joy can not go to must come to embraced other affectionately next minute charles be running down staircase chapter vi charles went to bed with bad headache woke with worse nothing remained to order bill be off for london yet must not go without taking last farewell of place be up soon after seven while gownsmen be rising in respective chapel have be round magdalen walk christ church meadow there be few none to see wherever went tree of water walk be variegated a beseemed time of year with thousand hue arching over head screening side reached addison walk there have be for first time with father when be coming into residence just six year before to day pursued onwards still till came round in sight of beautiful tower at length rose close over head morning be frosty there be mist leaf flitted about be in unison with state of feeling re entered monastic building meeting with nothing scout with box of cinder old woman carrying off remains of kitchen crossed to meadow walked steadily down to junction of cherwell with isi then turned back what thought came upon for last time there be one to see threw arm round willow so dear to kissed tore off of black leaf put in bosom be like undine said killing with kiss one care for scarce person know neared long walk again suddenly looking obliquely into saw cap gown looked anxiously be jennings there be mistake direction be towards charles always have felt kindly towards in spite of sternness must not meet for world what be to do stood behind large elm let pas then set off again at quick pace when have got way ventured to turn head round saw jennings at moment by sort of fatality sympathy be so common turning round towards hurried on soon found again at inn strange a may seem though have on whole have a good success a carlton in keen encounter of wit night before have left unsatisfactory effect on mind time for action be come argument be past a have said to recur to argument be only to confuse clearness of apprehension of truth began to question whether really have evidence enough for step be taking temptation assailed that be giving up world without gaining next carlton evidently thought excited what if be true perhaps conviction be after dream what did rest upon tried to recall best argument must not be there after such thing a truth be not one thing a good a at event must not have served god well in generation where have be placed recollected line in ethic of aristotle quoted by philosopher from old poet in poor outcast philoctetes lament over own stupid officiousness a call have be cause of misfortune be not busybody too why must not let well alone better men than have lived died in english church then what if a campbell have said so called conviction be to vanish just a entered roman pale a have done on father death began to envy sheffield have turned out well with good class fellowship merely principally because have taken thing a came not gone roaming after vision felt violently assaulted be not deserted not overpowered good sense rather good angel came to aid evidently be in way able to argue judge at moment deliberate conclusion of year ought not to be set aside by troubled thought of hour with effort put whole subject from addressed to journey how got to steventon hardly recollected gradually came to found in first class of great western proceeding rapidly towards london then looked about to ascertain who fellow traveller be farther compartment be full of passenger who seemed to form one party talking together with great volubility glee of three seat in own part of carriage one only that opposite to be filled on taking survey of stranger saw grave person passing past middle age face have that worn rather that unplacid appearance even slight physical suffering if habitual give to feature eye be pale from study other cause charles thought have seen face before must not recollect where when what most interested be dress appearance be such a be rarely found in travelling companion be of unusual character taken together with small office book held in hand plainly showed charles that be opposite roman ecclesiastic heart beat felt tempted to start from seat then sick feeling sinking came over gradually grew calmer journeyed on time in silence longing yet afraid to speak at length on train stopping at station addressed few word to in french companion looked surprised smiled in hesitating saddish voice said that be englishman charles made awkward apology there be silence again eye sometimes met then moved slowly off other a if mutual reconnoitring be in progress at length seemed to strike stranger that have abruptly stopped conversation after apparently beating about for introductory topic said perhaps can read sir better than can be oxford man by appearance charles assented bachelor be of near master standing companion who did not seem in humour for talking proceeded to various question about university a if out of civility what college sent proctor that year be taylor professor appointed be member of church of england did new bishop of bury keep headship c c matter of fact conversation followed came to nothing charles have so much to ask thought be busy mind full here be catholic priest ready for necessity yet opportunity be likely to pas away nothing to come of after one two fruitless effort gave up leant back in seat fellow traveller began a quietly a must to say office time went forward steam be let off put on train stopped proceeded office be apparently finished book vanished in side pocket after time charles suddenly said how came to suppose be of oxford not entirely by look manner for saw jump from omnibus at steventon with assistance be impossible to mistake have heard others say same said charles yet ca myself make out how oxford man must be known from not only oxford men cambridge men be known by appearance soldier lawyer beneficed clergyman indeed class have external indication to who can read know person said charles who believe that handwriting be indication of calling character doubt replied priest gait be be not of who can read so recondite language yet language be a really a hieroglyphic on obelisk be fearful thought said charles with sigh a be exhale breath draw stranger assented man moral self said be concentrated in moment of life life in tip of finger spring of instep very little thing try what man be made of think must be speaking to catholic priest said charles when question be answered in affirmative went on hesitatingly to ask if what have be speaking of did not illustrate importance of faith one did not see at first sight said how be rational to maintain that so much depended on holding doctrine little more little le might be test of heart companion looked pleased however observed that there be beore le ' in faith that believed whole revealed message really believed part of that ought to believe what church proposed to on word of church yet surely so called evangelical belief more than unitarian high churchman than evangelical objected charles question said fellow traveller be whether submit reason implicitly to have received a god word charles assented must say then continued that unitarian really belief a god word that professes to receive when pass over get rid of so much that be in word certainly not said charles why because be plain said charles that ultimate standard of truth be not scripture unconsciously to view of thing in mind be to measure of scripture then belief if may so speak said priest not external word of god certainly well in like manner continued do think person can have real faith in admits to be word of god who pass by without attempting to understand such passage a 'the church pillar ground of truth sin ye forgive be forgiven ' 'if man be sick let call for priest of church let anoint with oil ' said charles in fact profess to have faith in mere text of scripture know sir added hesitatingly that anglican doctrine be to interpret scripture by church therefore have faith like catholic not in scripture simply in whole word committed to church of scripture be part companion smiled how many asked so profess waiving question understand what catholic mean by saying that go by voice of church mean practically by voice of first priest meet priest be voice of church be quite intelligible in matter of doctrine have faith in word of priest what where be that 'word ' of church person speak of believe in when do exercise belief be not undeniable fact that so far from anglican clergyman agreeing together in faith what first say second will unsay so that anglican can not if must have faith in necessarily though must not chooses between how then have faith place in religion of anglican well said charles be sure know good many person if knew church of england a do must not need to tell who from knowledge of gospel have absolute conviction intimate sense of reality of sacred fact contained in whether call faith not be powerful enough to colour whole being with influence rule heart conduct a well a imagination ca believe that person be out of god favour yet according to account of matter have not faith do think person believe practise be brought home to a being in scripture asked companion certainly do answered charles a far a man can judge then perhaps may be practising virtue of faith if there be passage in to be insensible a about sacrament penance extreme unction about see of peter must in charity think that passage have never be brought home applied to mind conscience just a pope bull may be for time unknown in distant part of church may be in involuntary ignorance yet fear that taking whole nation there be few who on score can lay claim to faith errantes invincibiliter circa aliquos articulos et credentes alios non sunt formaliter haeretici sed habent fidem supernaturalem qua credunt veros articulos atque adeo ex ea possunt procedere actus perfectae contritionis quibus justificentur et salventur de lugo de fid p charles said did not fully meet difficulty faith in case of person at least be not faith in word of church companion must not allow said received scripture on testimony of church at least be believing word of god like presently charles said be to great mystery how english people a whole be ever to have faith again be there evidence enough for faith new friend looked surprised not over pleased surely said in matter of fact man may have more evidence for believing church to be messenger of god than have for believing four gospel to be from god if then already belief latter why must not believe former belief in gospel be traditional belief said charles make difference can not see how nation like england have lost faith ever can recover hence in matter of conversion providence have generally visited simple barbarous nation convert of roman empire be suppose considerable exception said priest still seems to great difficulty answered charles see when dogmatic structure be once broken down how be ever to be built up again fancy there be passage somewhere in carlyle 'french revolution on subject in author lament over madness of men destroying what must not replace what must take century strange combination of fortunate circumstance to reproduce external received creed be not denying god forbid objectivity of revelation saying that faith be sort of happy expedient delusion really evidence for revealed doctrine be so built up on probability see what be to introduce into civilized community where reason have be cultivated to utmost argument be test of truth many man will say have be educated catholic have not so be find unable though wishing to believe for have not evidence enough to subdue reason what be to make believe fellow traveller have for time shown sign of uneasiness when charles stopped said shortly quietly what be to make believe will will charles hesitated proceeded if there be evidence enough to believe scripture see that there be repeat there be more than enough to believe church evidence be not in fault requires be to be brought home applied to mind if belief doe not then follow fault lie with will well said charles think there be general feeling among educated anglican that claim of roman church rest on sufficiently intellectual basis that evidence note be well enough for rude age not for be what make despair of growth of catholicism companion looked round curiously at then said quietly depend upon there be quite evidence enough for moral conviction that catholic roman church none other be voice of god do mean said charles with beating heart before conversion one can attain to present abiding actual conviction of truth know answered other at least may have habitual moral certainty mean conviction one only steady without rival conviction even reasonable doubt present to when be most composed in hour of solitude flashing on from time to time a through cloud when be in world conviction to effect roman catholic church be one only voice of god one only way of salvation then mean to say said charles while heart beat faster that person be under duty to wait for clearer light will not have can not expect clearer light before conversion certainty in highest sense be reward of who by act of will at dictate of reason prudence embrace truth when nature like coward shrink must make venture faith be venture before man be catholic be gift after approach church in way of reason enter into in light of spirit charles said that feared there be great temptation operating on many well informed excellent men to find fault with evidence for catholicity to give over search on excuse that there be argument on side be not one set of men answered companion be grievous deficiency in englishman altogether englishman have many gift faith have not other nation inferior to in many thing still have faith nothing will stand in place of not sense of beauty of catholicism of awfulness of antiquity not appreciation of sympathy show towards sinner not admiration of martyr early father delight in writing individual may display touching gentleness conscientiousness demand reverence still till have faith have not foundation superstructure will fall will not be blessed will effect nothing in religious matter till begin by act of unreserved faith in word of god whatever be till go out of till cease to make something within standard till oblige will to perfect what reason leaf sufficient indeed incomplete when will recognize defect in try to remedy then will recognize much more will be on road very shortly to be catholic there be nothing in exactly new to reding be pleasant to hear from voice of priest thus have sympathy authority felt be restored to conversation stopped after while disclosed to new friend place for be bound after what charles have already be saying must be no great surprise to latter knew superior of san michaele taking out card wrote upon few word of introduction for by time have reached paddington scarcely have train stopped when priest took small carpet bag from under seat wrapped cloak around stepped out of carriage be walking out of sight at brisk pace chapter vii reding naturally wished to take important step be meditating a quietly a must have adopted what considered satisfactory measure for purpose such arrangement often turn out very differently from promise so be in case passionist house be in eastern part of london so far well a knew in neighbourhood respectable publisher in religious line with whom father have dealt have written to to bespeak room in house for few day trusted must suffice for process of reception what be to happen to after left for advice might get from in whose hand found be now wednesday hoped to have two day to prepare for confession then proposed to present before who be to receive better plan must have be to have gone to religious house at once where doubtless good father must have lodged secured from intrusion given best advice how to proceed must indulge if doing so great work like to do in own way must be hard on though be not best way on arriving at destination saw in deportment of host ground for concluding that coming be not only expected understood doubtless then paragraph of oxford gazette have be copied into london paper did relieve unpleasant surprise to find a passed to room that worthy bibliopolist have reading room attached to shop be far more perilous to privacy than coffee room must have be be not obliged however to mix with various party who seemed to frequent determined a far a possible to confine to apartment rest of day employed in writing letter to friend conversation of morning have tranquillized went to bed peaceful happy slept soundly rose late refreshed in mind body turned thought to serious duty of day breakfast over gave considerable time to devotional exercise then opening writing desk addressed to work hardly have got into when landlord made appearance with many apology for intrusion hope that be not going to be impertinent proceeded to inquire if mr reding be catholic question have be put to thought might venture to solicit answer from person who must give most authentic information here be interruption vexatious in perplexing in form in came upon must be absurd to reply that be on point of becoming catholic so shortly answered in negative mr mumford then informed that there be two friend of mr reding below who wished very much to have few minute conversation with charles must make intelligible objection to request in course of few minute knock be heard at room door on answering two person presented apparently stranger to however at moment be relief for vague fear surmise have begun to flit across mind a to face be to make appearance younger of two who have round full cheek with boyish air shrill voice advanced confidently seemed to expect recognition broke upon charles that have seen before must not tell where ought to know face said yes mr reding answered person addressed may recollect at college ah remember perfectly said reding jack kitchen boy at st saviour yes said jack came when young tom be promoted into dennis place then added with solemn shake of head have got promotion now so seems jack answered reding what be speak ah sir said jack must converse in tone of befitting seriousness added in deep inarticulate voice lip not being suffered to meet together sir stand next to angel now what angel oh know cried charles be sect sandemanians sandemanians interrupted jack hold in abhorrence be leveller bring in disorder evil work beg pardon know be sect though recollect what have heard about well tell jack what be be answered jack a if be confessing at tribunal of propraetor be member of holy catholic church be right jack said reding be not distinctive enough so be one will say a much hear out mr reding sir answered jack waving hand hear strike repeat be member of holy catholic church assembling in huggermugger lane ah said charles see be what 'gods call now what do men men said jack not understanding however allusion men call christian professing opinion of late rev edward irving bd understand perfectly now said reding irvingites recollect sir said not irvingites follow man follow wherever spirit lead have given up tongue ought to introduce to friend who be more than angel proceeded modestly who have more than tongue of men angel being nothing short of apostle sir mr reding here be rev alexander highfly mr highfly be mr reding mr highfly be man of gentlemanlike appearance manner language be refined conduct be delicate so much so that charles at once changed tone in speaking to came to mr reding said from sense of duty there be nothing in conversation to clash with profession explained that have heard of mr reding being unsettled in religious view must not lose opportunity of attempting so valuable accession to cause to have dedicated see said charles smiling be in market be bargain of glaucus with diomede answered mr highfly for be asking co operation be giving fellowship of apostle be recollect one of characteristic of body said charles to have order of apostle in addition to bishop priest deacon rather said visitor be special characteristic for acknowledge order of church of england be completing church system by restoring apostolic college what must complain of said charles be at inclined to listen to claim must be very different view different member of body put forward must recollect sir answered mr highfly that be under divine teaching truth be gradually communicated to church pledge what will believe to morrow by anything say to day certainly answered reding thing have be said to by teacher must suppose be only private opinion though seemed to be more be saying said mr highfly at present be restoring gentile apostolate church of england have bishop priest deacon scriptural church have more be plain ought to have apostle in scripture apostle have supreme authority three anglican order be subordinate to be disposed to agree with there said charles mr highfly looked surprised pleased be restoring said church to more scriptural state perhaps then may reckon on co operation in doing so ask to secede from establishment to acknowledge apostolic authority to ought to submit doe not strike mr highfly answered reding that there be body of christian not inconsiderable one maintains with what be more have always preserved that true higher apostolic succession in church body mean in addition to episcopacy belief that there be standing ordinance above episcopacy give name of apostolate on contrary answered mr highfly consider that be restoring what have lain dormant ever since time of st paul nay will say be ordinance never have be carried into effect at though be in divine design from first will observe that apostle be jew there never have be gentile apostolate st paul indeed be apostle of gentile design begun in have hitherto be frustrated went up to jerusalem against solemn warning of spirit now be raised up to complete work of spirit be stopped by inadvertence of first apostle jack interposed must be very glad said to know what religious persuasion be besides own mr reding considered to have preserved succession of apostle a something distinct from bishop be quite plain whom mean catholic answered charles popedom be true apostolate pope be successor of apostle particularly of st peter be very well inclined to roman catholic answered mr highfly with hesitation have adopted great part of ritual be not accustomed to consider that resemble in what be characteristic cardinal tenet allow to say highfly said reding be reason why irvingite mean member of denomination must become catholic own religious sense have taught that there ought to be apostolate in church consider that authority of apostle be not temporary essential fundamental what that authority be see in st paul conduct towards st timothy placed in see of ephesus sent charge in fact be overseer bishop have care of church now be precisely power pope claim have ever claimed moreover have claimed a being successor sole proper successor of apostle though bishop may be improperly such also hence catholic call vicar of christ bishop of bishop like believe consider that in pre eminent sense be one pastor ruler of church source of jurisdiction judge of controversy centre of unity a having power of apostle specially of st peter successores sunt sed ita ut potius vicarii dicendi sint apostolorum quam

while slowly described circumference with handle at length asked without raising eye whether be true spoke slowly in what be called spiritual tone whether be true information have be given that mr reding gentleman have honour of addressing whether be true that be in search of religion more congenial to feeling than of church of england mr reding must not give satisfaction on subject of inquiry

still with drooping head languid sing song voice after be plymouth brother got too absurd charles who have for instant be amused now became full of one thought how to get out of room be obviously left to to keep up conversation so said presently be for pure religion from what tell said charles gather that member of new community be allowed to name one two doctrine of own be scriptural made answer therefore be one may differ agree still be so a say mr reding be for election assurance dearest friend be for perfection sweet sister be for second advent desire to include among soul who be thirsting after river of life personal view believe be partial to sacrament ceremony charles tried to cut short interview by denying that have religion to seek after decision to make be easier to end conversation than visit threw back in chair in despair half closed eye oh good irvingites thought blameless men who came only to protest vanished at first word of opposition now thrice have church clock struck quarter since entrance see why be not to stop here a long a go on striking since have stopped so long have not in element of progress decay will never die what be to become of be doomed to find natural death for when case seemed noise be heard on staircase with scarcely apology for knock wild gawky man made appearance at once cried out hope sir be not bargain yet hope be not too late discharge young woman mr reding let teach old truth never have be repealed there be need of discharging for a kindly a have unfolded leaf flourished in sun of reding forbearance so did at once shrink vanish one must hardly tell how before rough accent of intruder charles suddenly found in hand of new tormentor be intolerable said to jumping up cried sir excuse be particularly engaged morning must beg to decline favour of visit what did say sir said stranger taking note book pencil from pocket began to look up in charles face write down word saying half aloud a wrote decline favour of visit then looked up again keeping pencil upon paper said now sir reding moved towards spreading arm a one drive sheep poultry in one direction repeated looking towards door really sir feel honour of call day sir day be too much too much too much said intruder waiting below so long that dainty lady have be good part of hour here now ca give five minute sir why sir answered charles be sure be come on errand a fruitless a hers be sick of religious discussion want to be to to save trouble sick of religion discussion said stranger to a wrote down word in note book charles did not deign to notice act to explain own expression stood prepared to renew action of motioning to door tormentor then said may like to know name be zerubbabel vexed a reding be felt that have right to visit tediousness of former visitor upon present so forced to reply zerubbabel indeed be zerubbabel christian name sir surname be at once mr reding answered zerubbabel rather have christian name zerubbabel be one jewish designation be come then to inquire whether be likely to become jew stranger thing have happened answered visitor for instance myself be once deacon in church of england then be not jew said charles be jew by choice said after much prayer study of scripture have come to conclusion that a judaism be first religion so be to be last christianity consider episode in history of revelation be not likely to have many follower in such belief said charles be for progress now not for retrograding differ from mr reding said zerubbabel see what establishment be doing have sent bishop to jerusalem be rather with view of making jew christian than christian jew said reding zerubbabel wrote down think bishop of jerusalem be to convert jew then differ from sir on contrary fancy excellent bishop have in view to revive distinction between jew gentile be one step towards supremacy of former for if jew have place at in christianity a jew must be first place charles thought have better let have talk out so zerubbabel proceeded good bishop in question know well that jew be elder brother of gentile be special mission to restore jewish episcopate to see of jerusalem jewish succession have be suspended since time of apostle now see reason of calling on mr reding be reported that lean towards catholic church wish to suggest to that have mistaken centre of unity see of james at jerusalem be true centre not see of peter at rome peter power be usurpation on james consider present bishop of jerusalem true pope gentile have be in power too long be now jew turn seem to allow said charles that there ought to be centre of unity pope certainly said zerubbabel ritual too must be jewish be collecting subscription for rebuilding of temple on mount moriah hope too to negotiate loan will have temple stock yielding calculate at least four per cent have hitherto be thought sin said reding to attempt rebuilding temple according to julian apostate went better way to work motive be wrong sir answered other act be good way to convert jew be first to accept rite be one of greatest discovery of age must make first step towards for have adopted present state of religion render possible despair to see day when bloody sacrifice will be offered on temple mount a of old here came to pause charles making reply said in brisk off hand manner may not hope will give name to religious object adopt old ritual catholic be quite of yesterday compared with charles answering in negative zerubbabel wrote down in book refuse to take part in scheme disappeared from room a suddenly a entered chapter viii charles trial be not at end suspect reader will give shudder at news a having very material share in infliction yet reader case have great alleviation that take up narrative in idle hour charles encountered reality in very busy anxious one so however be not great time elapsed after retreat of zerubbabel when landlord again appeared at door assured mr reding that be fault of that last two person have called on that lady have slipped by gentleman have forced way that now really did wish to solicit interview for personage of great literary pretension who sometimes dealt with who have come from west end for honour of interview with mr reding charles groaned only one reply be possible day be already wasted with sort of dull resignation gave permission for introduction of stranger be pale faced man of about thirty five who when spoke arched eyebrow have peculiar smile began by expressing apprehension that mr reding must have be wearied by impertinent unnecessary visitor visitor without intellect who knew better than to obtrude fanaticism on person who did despise know more about university continued than to suppose that congeniality can exist between member mass of religious sectarian have have very distinguished men among sir at oxford of very various school yet able men distinguished in pursuit of truth though have arrived at contradictory opinion not knowing what be driving at reding remained in attitude of expectation belong continued to society be devoted to extension among class of pursuit of truth philosophical mind mr reding must have felt deep interest in own party in university society in fact considers to be distinguished confessor in momentous occupation have thought must not pay individually whose name have lately honourably appeared in paper better compliment than to get elected member of truth society here be diploma added handing sheet of paper to charles glanced eye over be paper part engraving part print part manuscript emblem of truth be in centre represented not by radiating sun star a might be expected a moon under total eclipse surrounded a by cherub face by head of socrates cicero julian abelard luther benjamin franklin lord brougham then followed sentence to effect that london branch association of british foreign truth society having evidence of zeal in pursuit of truth of charles reding esq member of oxford university have unanimously elected into number have assigned dignified responsible office of associate corresponding member thank truth society very much said charles when got to end of paper for mark of good will yet regret to have scruple about accepting till of patron be changed whose head be prefixed to diploma for instance like to be under shadow of emperor julian must respect love of truth presume said mr batts not much fear said charles seeing did not hinder from deliberately embracing error not so answered mr batts thought truth julian conceive can not be said to have deserted truth because in fact always be in pursuit of fear said reding there be very serious difference between principle own on point ah dear sir little attention to principle will remove said mr batts let beg acceptance of little pamphlet in will find fundamental truth stated almost in way of aphorism wish to direct attention to page where be drawn out charles turned to page read a follows on pursuit of truth be uncertain whether truth exists be certain that can not be found be folly to boast of possessing man work duty a man consist not in possessing in seeking happiness true dignity consist in pursuit pursuit of truth be end to be engaged in for own sake a philosophy be love not possession of wisdom so religion be love not possession of truth a catholicism begin with faith so protestantism end with inquiry a there be disinterestedness in seeking so be there selfishness in claiming to posse martyr of truth be who dy professing that be shadow life long martyrdom be to be ever changing fear of error be bane of inquiry charles did not get further than others followed of similar character returned pamphlet to mr batts see enough said of opinion of truth society to admire ingenuity originality excuse not good sense be impossible must subscribe to what be so plainly opposed to christianity mr batts looked annoyed have wish to oppose christianity said only wish christianity not to oppose be very hard that may not go own way when be quite willing that others must go theirs seems imprudent conceive in age to represent christianity a hostile to progress of mind to turn into enemy of revelation who do sincerely wish to 'live let live contradiction can not be true said charles if christianity say that truth can be found must be error to state that can not be found conceive to be intolerant persisted mr batts will grant suppose christianity have nothing to do with astronomy geology why then must be allowed to interfere with philosophy be useless proceeding in discussion charles repressed answer rose on tongue of essential connexion of philosophy with religion silence ensued of several minute mr batts at length took hint for rose with disappointed air wished good morning mattered little now whether be left to not except conversation harassed fretted for a to turning mind to subject be to have be occupation that morning be by time far too much wearied
