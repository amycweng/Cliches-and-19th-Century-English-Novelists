that edict have be promulgated at rome against christian what step have be taken by local authority throughout proconsulate to carry out provision then colonia siccensis must have presented good bad reason for delay that arose from absence of proconsul from seat of government from unaccountable loss of despatch on way from coast perhaps on other hand under secretary must have maintained amid

a agellius became grave however be too companionable good natured to force to be happy in own way imputed to extravagance of friend religion what in christian must have called moroseness misanthropy bade sister give over representation instead of enlivening passing hour did inflict pain friendly intercourse have now gone on for month a leisure of party admitted once twice brother sister have come to suburban farm for most part in spite of intense dislike of city have for sake threaded crowded narrow thoroughfare crossed open place presented at apartment be very strange that youth so utterly ignorant of world unsuspicious of evil must not have heard warning voice called to separate from heathenism even in most specious form be very strange under circumstance that sanguine hope hope of youthful must have led agellius to overlook obstacle beguile into notion that callista might be converted make good christian wife well have nothing more to say for if have not already succeeded in

abundance might have involved so weak innocent fellow in plan against government now at future time might have alienated from uncle in way other made fool of if have consented to have for slave why have rejected so eligible suitor be now useless idle to inquire might be that haughty greedy greek have required to bid higher for favourable notice if negotiation have taken turn then indeed there be still more gratifying evidence of agellius having broken from fantastic peevish superstition still however be not without anxiety now that severe measure directed against christian be in progress overt act indeed beyond publication of edict have be taken in sicca probably must be taken at worst be that something must be done to make show must have wished that of multitude of townspeople half suspected of christianity have stood firm suffered to be tortured executed one two must have be enough magistracy got credit with central government for zeal activity if christian be made example of yet still be question whether strong act at carthage elsewhere must not suffice though lesser town did nothing at least while populace be quiet there be nothing to press for severity there be rich christian in sicca to tempt cupidity of informer of magistrate political partisan among who have made enemy with that class of community supposing bad feeling to rise in populace supposing magistrate to have ill wishers rival what men in power have not who might be glad to catch tripping make case against at rome why must be confessed that agellius be nearly only victim who must be pitched upon wished callista harm if christian must be found held up in terrorem must rather be person like without connection home than member of decent family of sicca whose fair fame must be compromised by

suffer for father offence if must be judged of by parent let rather have advantage of thorough loyalty religiousness of mother most zealous old lady in high repute in neighbourhood of sicca for theurgic knowledge staunch friend of imperial government have before now be indebted to for important information a staunch hater of christian such be plan of proceeding resolved on by jucundus before received news of nephew serious malady did not reach till many day after then did not go to see first lest must be supposed to be in communication with next a having respect for romantic sort of generosity risk chance of contagion for absurd ceremony of paying compliment be thus that jucundus addressed to present state of affair anticipated chance of future a to aristo have very little personal interest in matter sister might have thwarted in affair lay nearer heart than moral emancipation of agellius a generally complied with suggestion wish be did not grudge liberty of action in

when illness of agellius made duty for to stop restore attend to spiritual need have received inward intimation on implicitly relied to do so problem at moment be how to reach refuge in question direct road lay through sicca being impracticable at present have to descend into ravine lay between city turning to left to traverse broad plain campus martius of sicca into opened here mountain must rise abruptly on right with steep cliff have already described a rounding north side of sicca must traverse many mile before must reach point at rock lost precipitous character changed into declivity allowing traveller to ascend be bold undertaking for have to accomplish in dark before morning broke stranger too to locality directing movement only by information of others however accurate distinct
