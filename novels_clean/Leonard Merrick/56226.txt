page died long ago said deep voice again subject be resumed in manner almost intimate wife be living in malvern think there be be common knowledge at time domestic unhappiness late in life perhaps must be more correct to say that culminated late in life for like so many mighty issue believe originated in seeming trifle be man acutely sensitive to noise wife be decidedly noisy woman remember remarking once that if touched cup have collision with china on table that newspaper in hand became instrument of torture doubt must have controlled irritability by account temper grew unbearable however news of death must have be blow to lady for died suddenly soon after have separated death be wondrous peacemaker gravest offence look smaller in eye when be too late to condone yes assented conrad 'and think in life of most woman men there be moment when must go smooth even if only dead must find out when to come back be forgiven be beautiful thought said vicar speaking more strictly must say be ordinary thought beautified from one of owen meredith early poem be do remember line of coventry patmore to dead 'it be not true that love will do wrong poor child did think when so cried

said 'be possible that believe in nonsense ' said 'n exactly believe in never throw away chance ' on sudden inflexion changed utterance be solemn stirring devout ' think sir that most people pray on friend principle believe in never throw away chance have said before whole thing be too assured too finished for impromptu effect of modulation be superb artist in conrad responded to when be sincere questioned after pause for be sometimes wall remind how passionately prayed to be painter own prayer take came from soul when craved to be poet must have be more useful a poet must have contented to write let say 'the better land ' more mind be to be influenced by simple sermon than by great poetry think perhaps that a painter must have be happier perhaps must be often like little child petitioning parent for dangerous will not suggest that merciful god chastises to demonstrate error many observant man must have noticed truth that what have desired most strenuously often prof affliction to while only sunshine in life be shed by thing prayed might never come to pas yes said conrad thoughtfully have seen more than one example of if be mere blunderer beseeching in dark if be like child importuning parent without discernment a say be act of prayer futile be even presumptuous mr irquetson raised head eye looked upward pray said melody of tone gave glory to commonplace pray repeated conrad wanted to kneel to then there on study floor one day perhaps will afford opportunity to make thought on prayer quite clear to pray with fervour with sense with humility sir can not reconcile faith in omniscient creator with idea that be necessary to advise need rain in rutland be withholding little information that be able to give be about to say that mr page so far a know life still in malvern perhaps be matlock eldest girl mary interposed conrad quite so beary ' mary married time before father death be settled in london think wife must know whereabouts better than be
