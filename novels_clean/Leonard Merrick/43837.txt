very long said have neuralgia quite gone feel little weary after be be there anything fresh philip fresh answered vaguely dear know that there be anything very fresh look tired said thought that perhaps be troubled thought too that miss brettan have looked troubled instinct pointed to something having occurred conviction that son be getting fond of companion have be unspoken in mind for time under placid question now rankled little wistfulness in feeling that be not held dear enough for confidence wanted to say to outright philip did tell miss brettan be fond of when be upstairs last night be reluctant to seem inquisitive with never inkling that must suspect love meanwhile reflected that for mary continued peace be desirable that mother must never conjecture have be refused be doubtful whether have ever felt so wholly tender towards a did in moment while admitted that be imperative to keep secret from perhaps mother heart have never turned so far aside from a while perceived that be never to be told exchanged commonplace with one grave subject throbbing in mind of of two woman be more laboured presently noticed what uphill work be sighed heard sigh must have echoed thinking sadly that presence of companion be required now to make society endurable to must not refer to mary bent over wool work needle went in out with feeble regularity while maintained wounded silence man be regarding a unwillingness to talk said at last that must go did not offer to detain want to hurry back afternoon wo mind murmured know what have to do philip better than stooped

phil patted hand reassuringly let out then hand crept slowly up to eye wiped tear away wool work drooped to lap sat recalling little boy who have be used to talk of wondrous thing be going to do for mother when became man who now have become man living for strange woman full of love mother might only guess must not feel quite so cordial to mary a have done to think of holding son confidence while be left to speculate made need for surmise seem harder philip be unhappy companion must be indifferent to nothing must account for unhappiness for reservation must have forgiven engrossing affection in time indifference be more than must forgive still be woman loved endeavoured to hide resentment a have hidden suspicion intercourse during next week be le free than usual nevertheless perhaps resentment be le easy to hide perhaps mary nervousness made unduly sensitive there be pause seemed to significant of condemnation be exceedingly uncomfortable during week sometimes be only deterred from proclaiming what have happened appealing to other fairness to exonerate by recollection that be after just possible that avowal might have effect of transforming bush into officer must not venture to repeat retirement to room next time doctor came nearly fortnight have gone by forced to turn to with few remark be not man to disguise feeling successfully by flow of small talk life have not qualified for be ordeal to to sit there in presence of mary witness attempt in perceived unqualified to co operate knowledge that simulated ease must have originated with rather than with made ineptitude seem additionally ungracious feared must think boorish disposed to parade disappointment for purpose of exciting compassion strongly therefore a have wished to avoid break in social routine subsequent visit be made at longer interval more often than not curtailed on plea of work be a yet at event impossible for to behave towards a if nothing untoward have happened to shun house awhile looked to wiser course than to haunt with discomposure patent thus restraint mr kincaid be imposing on have further burden to bear miss brettan be keeping son from side pause became more frequent to mary more than ever ominous indeed while mother mused mournfully on consequence of engagement companion herself be questioning how long must expect to retain began to consider whether must relinquish to elude indignity of dismissal even if mr kincaid did fail to suspect reason for son absenting responsibility be same reflected be who divided pair who be accountable for hurt expression that old lady face so often wore now felt wearily that woman have great deal to endure in life what with men cared for men for whom did not care there seemed privilege pertaining to sex being feminine only amplified scope for vexation fact did not see be that one of most pathetic thing in connection with unloved lover be irritability with woman so often think about with what sentiment might have listened to kincaid have met prior to intimacy with carew one may only conjecture now touched not at intimacy have be experience engulfed so much of sensibility that have emerged from different being kincaid rival in truth be most powerful one can ever oppose lover rival of constant remembrance always doughty antagonist never so impregnable a when woman be instinctively virtuous woman have fallen for man that remembers occurred to mary to seek opportunity for letting doctor know that be paining mother by so rarely coming now opportunity be not easy to gain for when did come mother of course be present thought of writing by word of mouth hint must suffice while letter in circumstance must have awkwardness more than two month have gone by when mr kincaid made plaint be on sunday morning mary be standing before window looking out while elder woman sat moodily in accustomed seat be going to church asked mary yes suppose so there be plenty of time be there oh yes be early yet not ten what lovely day spring have begun yes assented other absently there be short silence then sha run risk of missing dr kincaid by going out need be afraid of added voice have in so much more of pathos than of testiness after instant dismay companion felt acutely sorry for doctor time be scarcely own be murmured turning mr kincaid did not reply immediately delay seemed to mary to accentuate feebleness of answer mean said that be a if be able to leave hospital whenever liked there may be case used to be able to come often why must be able now yes faltered mary have asked be good reason keep from of
