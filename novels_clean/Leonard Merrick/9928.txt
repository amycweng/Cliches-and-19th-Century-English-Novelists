infidelity of monsieur noulens introduction disjointed thought about one of leonard merrick most articulate book must begin with personal confession for many year walked about earth avoiding work of leonard merrick a other men might have avoided onion insane aversion be created in mind chiefly by admirer of what be called cheerful note in fiction such people be completely agreed in pronouncing mr merrick to be pessimistic writer hate pessimistic writer year ago when be of age when mind responds acutely to exterior impression well meaning uncle other fool gave pessimistic book to read be work of fiction british public have hailed a masterpiece of humour represented with utter fury of pessimism spiritual inadequacy of why go into detail now have to confess that for long time did mr merrick extraordinary injustice of believing to be author of popular masterpiece mistake though intellectually unpardonable may perhaps be condoned on other ground by virtue of process of thought call association of idea naturally connected mr merrick with work of super pessimism friend being so confirmed in belief that be super pessimist by virtue of fortunate accident at last got truth about mr merrick event arose from action of right minded butcher who having exhausted stock of pigeon fancier gazette sent weekly supply of dog bone wrapped about with leonard merrick dog bone happened to reach house at moment when other kind of literary nutriment be to be have having nothing better to read read dog bone wrapper thus by dog bone be brought to merrick most jolly amusing optimistic of spiritual friend book to utterance be prefixed be to mind one of few really amusing book have be published in england during lifetime then think that of mr merrick book be amusing even earnest book such a actor manager when love fly out o ' window position of peggy harper be of course true that such novel a be unlikely to be found congenial by person who derive entertainment from fiction like uncle present on other hand there be people in world with capacity for being amused by psychological inquiry to such people must say miss extraordinary cheerfulness of mr merrick philosophy be fact will impress upon folk who be able to take really cheerful view of life of mr merrick sermon hesitate to call novel sermon because decent novel can be anything else sermon say point to conclusion that people who go out deliberately to look for happiness to kick for fight for who try to buy with money will miss happiness being state of heart mere outgrowth more often to be found by careless forgetful vagrant than by deliberate conscious seeker cheerful doctrine not only cheerful evidently true how right be how cheerful be to think that while philosopher clergyman strut about world looking out smelling out for prime experience more careless le celebrated men be continually finding such thing without effort without care in irregular unconsecrated place in novel after novel mr merrick have preached same good humoured cheerful doctrine doctrine of anti fat asks to believe make believe that man woman be not merely virtuous merely sane who exchange fat of fulfilment for little lean pleasure of honourable hope high endeavour oh wise oh witty mr merrick mr merrick have not to knowledge written one novel in hero be represented a having achieved complacency mr merrick hero undergo very human experience of hitting snag be none of represented a enjoying experience none of whimper none of rat if anybody must prove to that mr merrick have ever invented hero who submitted tamely to tame success to fat prosperity who have stepped be ever so lightly into dirty morass of accepted comfort then must cheerfully admit to anybody leonard merrick be pessimistic writer until proof be forthcoming stick to opinion stick to conviction that mr merrick be gayest cheer fullest most courageous of living humorist opinion be general opinion applicable to mr merrick general work morning however be asked to narrow field of view to contemplate not so much mr merrick at large a mr merrick in particular to look at mr merrick in relationship to one particular book chair on boulevard now if say a have said that mr merrick be cheerful in capacity of solemn novelist what be to say of mr merrick in lighter aspect that of writer of feuilletons addressing to imaginary audience of magazine enthusiast ask to tell whether judged even by comparison with favourite fiction of story to be found in volume be not exquisitely amusing first story in book mr merrick call tragedy of comic song be in view funniest story of century ask expect magazine enthusiast to share view to endorse judgment tragedy of comic song be essentially one of production in reader be expected to collaborate author have deliberately contrived certain void of narrative reader be expected to populate anecdotal waste be asking more than be fair to ask of magazine enthusiast genuine magazine

suicide in rue sombre now then magazine zealot speak up tell truly be there anything too difficult for in if so psychology of what be called public taste becomes subject not suited to public discussion foregoing remark consideration apply equally to such story a dress clothes of m pomponnet tricotrin entertains there be other story delight a for example little flower of wood jerk back again to essential mr merrick who demand collaboration there be again other story yet others to write down title here must be merely to transcribe index page of book reader can afford to waste time like have said nothing about technical quality of mr merrick work intend to do so have long be conceit of mine to believe that professional vendor of letterpress must reserve mutual discussion of technique for technical occasion such a when men of like mind occupation sit at table with bottle between be convinced that mr merrick be very great gifted man deeply skilled in profession can bring forth argument proof to support conviction fail utterly to see why must do so to people who have sense of be sincere fresh in fiction fact will be apparent to argument illustration must be profitless
