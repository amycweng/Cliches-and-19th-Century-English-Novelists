down fell into polite conversation a left honourable john ruffin last word to pollyooly be forbid to scratch scratching be harmonious with female nature statement afforded mr gibson ground for beginning of polite conversation pollyooly lump worked steadily away at building of castle pollyooly did digging now again lump must pat wall placidly have be at work for rather more than hour castle be already beginning to wear rotund air so dear to eye of builder when progressive prince came in sight pollyooly joyful heart began to beat quickly be slouching along to doom nearly fifty yard in front of fragrant baron since there be child to annoy way came slowly gave pollyooly time to lead lump half way to mr gibson send toddling rest be back at castle at work again when prince caught sight of stopped short unhasty mind slowly taking in situation that must be working in loneliness thirty yard beyond line of nurse child along beach seemed too good to be true presently unhurrying mind grasped fact that be true heart blazed in bosom threw back head have nose be larger must have sniffed breeze like warhorse advanced upon in quick shambling slouch pollyooly saw eager advance affected not to see be eager for fray fearful lest display of eagerness must dash royal courage moreover wished prince to be flagrantly aggressor worked at farther wall of castle with back to fray be last thing prince looked for there have be one fray in sheltered life with brother prince carelessly admitted to society fray with child not of blood royal be beyond dreaming sprang on to castle wall began to stamp kick breach in with furious clumsy energy then pollyooly turned sprang prince be hardly aware of spring be only aware of stinging smack then shock of impetus toppled over on to back on sand pollyooly came down too not on sand came down on prince far more heavily than fragile air warranted before must collect scattered wit may have chanced to have be kneeling astride with painful grinding knee on of arm slapping face honourable john ruffin walked briskly down from sea wall with smile of profound pleasure on face perfumed baron have not yet perceived charge plight pollyooly did not smack very hard at first for be resisting wriggling of prince once have dug toe firmly into sand gave mind to delivering smack with full swing of arm prince began to bellow then baron saw terrible treasonable indignity hope of house of lippe schweidnitz be enduring broke into curious toddling run uttering odd short shriek of last horror a came honourable john ruffin placed athwart course of toddling deliverer said quietly hurry pollyooly smack hard smile of understanding wreathed pollyooly flushed angel face did smack hard honourable john ruffin back be turned to headlong baron head be bent little sideways a already breathless rescuer made final spurting rush moved sharply to left be unfortunate since have not eye in back of head must not be helped that left shoulder of honourable john ruffin jerking upward hard must have impinged upon onrushing right shoulder of deliverer baron left firm earth twirled in air in fashion must have won plaudit of most exacting music hall audience came down on back on sand with violence shook little breath left out of body lay gasping in darkened world be full minute half before bellowing of sufficiently besmacked charge came again dimly to comprehending ear then grew aware also dimly that honourable john ruffin be standing over asking loudly with appearance of just indignation what meant by not looking where be going baron be strongly of opinion that interposed shoulder have be no accident be much too busy with breathing to say so then when breath came more easily have power to say so have no longer inclination for knowledge of terrible position in stood rather lay have flashed on german officer have be knocked down by civilian be forever disgraced pollyooly continued to smack bellowing prince honourable john ruffin continued to ask baron what devil meant by poor wit of panting nobleman continued to work on dreadful problem then flash of inspiration showed saving solution must accept noisy questioner view that fall have be accident sat up began to apologise faintly sulkily for having be knocked down hand of pollyooly be sore from smacking prince adalbert not so sore a royal cheek still smacked on interjected between smack request for assurance that must cease to annoy child on beach fine prussian determination not to be robbed of simple pleasure prevented from giving preferred to bellow there be limit even to royal endurance a baron rose shakily to foot prince howled assurance demanded mind do will smack again said pollyooly coldly rose to foot flushed triumphant rubbed gently together stinging hand prince lay where be blubbering ten yard away mr gibson stood holding hand of lump who gazed at scene in placid wonder be laughing gently ten yard away on right stood dozen child surveying blubbering pest with joyful vengeful eye behind distractedly hovered three shocked nurse quivering with horror at upheaval of social edifice horror stricken mother be slowly approaching dreadful spot baron slowly took in humiliating significance of scene saw that glory of royal house have be levelled to dust rather to sand caught blubbering charge by arm jerked to foot led away by one large ear honourable john ruffin looked after laughed quietly joyfully then said congratulate pollyooly excellent piece of work very neatly done haughty foreigner will trouble more mr gibson came forward added congratulation to child gazed at pollyooly with deep respect only nurse mother held aloof earthquake shock must hardly have astonished confused more than have smacking of royalty have one little cousin of honourable john ruffin smacked must have be unable to refrain from outburst of open disapproval to judge from royal progress next morning pollyooly have indeed done work baron von habelschwert still perfumed air a walked be no longer obviously air of conquered country moustache be le fierce stride proprietary indeed might easily have be mistaken by to whom name dignity be unknown for pear shaped inoffensive keeper of delicatessen shop prince adalbert of lippe schweidnitz be also changed no longer roamed afield kept within six foot of protective equerry slouched le have ceased to scowl arrogantly on child who no longer fled at approach regarded little english girl with respectful not to say timid eye edged closer to baron a passed one to mind little english girl be stored with potentiality of powder magazine chapter xiii rapprochement noble hearted humanitarian be ever of opinion that violence physical violence be degrading alike to who employ to on whom be employed in main doubtless may be right there must be nature exceptional nature on doe not exercise disastrous effect be curious that there must be two human being in so small place a pyechurch at same time of very nature there can be doubt that pollyooly have smacked prince adalbert of lippe schweidnitz with far greater violence than ever have smacked abhorred henry wiggins for yelling ginger at there can be doubt that prince have be so smacked yet pollyooly face remained face of angel child devotion to lump politeness to with whom came into contact showed sign of weakening one must honestly assert prince adalbert looked bit more like pig than have always done if anything have lost something of likeness to nutritious animal at rate there be sign of degradation in behaviour now walked about pyechurch beach a peacefully a must wish destroyed castle kicked child even that fierce stout moustachioed military prussian baron von habelschwert seemed to have derived benefit from violent impingement on left shoulder of honourable john ruffin though more mature nature must have be fixed there can be doubt that wore softer air longer trod english sand with air of disdainful perfumed conqueror be by mean observant man stupid a be must not fail to perceive change in pupil for be forced on attention by fact that prince did not kick shin for seventy two hour baron be at first surprised then dismayed feared that fine hohenzollern spirit of young charge might have suffered lasting weakening shock from encounter with angel child when prince for three successive morning afternoon did not assault single little girl however much smaller than who came within reach chanced to be fear deepened oddly enough subdued prince did not seem to regard pollyooly with bitterness might have be expected did not even shun sight of indeed a made royal progress along beach must pause regard with puzzled manifestly quite respectful interest a played actively not far from little brother lump with young friend baron regarded honourable john ruffin in very different manner must not set eye on without scowling horribly be desire of heart to have blood of pollyooly protector though conduct of pollyooly have oddly considerably weakened confident expectation of immediate subjugation of english people by imperial master longed with greater fervour than have ever before burned in for day conversation strictly confined to british tongue between baron pupil be always of briefest often truculent prince be silent child by reason of fact that have nothing to say one morning a came down to beach startled baron by saying want to blay yes whad will blay ad said baron von habelschwert uncomfortably after little hesitation want to blay wiz said prince in tone showed beyond possibility of misconception that on matter mind be made up bud zere be one else for do blay wiz said baron in english want to blay wiz childrens said pupil baron drew heel together became though still pear like splendidly rigid eye flashed with haughty trifle vicarious pride a said zere be child for 'ighness do blay wiz 'ere zese be nod 'igh well born one do care said prince in tone of one who knew own mind quite well id be imbossible said baron in tone of finality rhinocerine eye of little charge flashed in sudden wrath uttered curious pig like snort a sprang at baron got in one severe kick on left shin before thoughtless prussian who must have known so well what to expect must abate rigidity bend forward hold off at length of arm well knew that in constrained attitude to bellowing pupil be presenting dignified spectacle none le be aware that be affording considerable entertainment to visitor taking air on sea wall above joy in young charge be not increased by fact that among visitor honourable john ruffin smiled on scene with amiable interest having ascertained beyond doubting that well shod toe must not reach shin of preceptor young prince ceased futile effort with most ungracious air moved along beach limping baron followed gloomily with itching finger felt that in spite of fact that imperial master must shortly sweep land with fire sword from sea to sea lot of happy english child pollyooly be to be envied since must did smack prince with mind untroubled by sense of sacrosanctity moreover felt sad prescience that young charge careless of magnificent blood flowed in vein must play with child who be neither high well born be quite unprepared for actual group of child young charge chose for playmate passed no le than four animated excited group before arrived at adorned ruled by pollyooly chanced that have decided to play rounder be gathered into excited knot in everybody be discussing at same time process of picking side prince shouldering aside with proud hohenzollern manliness two three little girl thrust into centre of group said want do blay debating voice hushed other child stared at with startled eye then drew aside leaving face to face with pollyooly want to play with cried kathleen who occupied position of chief friend to pollyooly cried two other little girl prince paid heed to looked at pollyooly said want do blay pollyooly considered thoughtfully weighing question of admission to circle with care demanded be not very pleasant to look at since be so podgy snub nosed pasty faced small eyed pollyooly mindful of late encounter inspired by magnanimity of victor did not at once reject appeal will promise to behave properly if let play with said coldly baron von habelschwert standing over group nervously twirling fierce moustache shuddered groaned be bad enough that young pig headed hohenzollern must play at with child who be neither high well born that must only be admitted to play with on term passed limit of human decency have read often in sterner agrarian paper of fatherland that owing to increase of socialist vote world be coming to end felt once so solid mass trembling beneath foot hope of house of lippe schweidnitz insensible to tremor said eagerly yes all right then will try letting play with see said pollyooly there came faint murmur of protest from friend rather from follower added with comforting assurance oh be all right need worry about will see that behaves with assurance be content have to be prince be admitted to circle pollyooly picked on side have first inning baron expected prince to be put in first be annoyed to observe a mere matter of tactic since be by far fastest of side that pollyooly took position be further annoyed when put in friend kathleen next act of sheer favouritism unjustified by kathleen capacity after kathleen put in little boy then little girl a played inning stood beside prince instructed in game once since appeared slow to grasp meaning caught by shoulder shook to make clearer baron von habelschwert ground teeth when at last prince did go in baron heart swelled with proud expectation gallant little charge must display to english child be neither high well born natural superiority of royal blood race prince however did not fulfil loyal expectation hit ball indeed in obedience to pollyooly shriek of instruction started to run started to run wrong way round side shrieked a one child a pollyooly sprang upon swung round shoved along in right direction succeeded in arresting mad course at first base by one of shrillest shriek of stop that ever burst from human lung next time ball be hit set going again by companion shriek with others of like piercing quality seemed to flow from lung in inexhaustible abundance guided safely round base home from blundering stumbling way ran shriek seemed to be only thing in world of be really conscious baron watched confused performance of little charge with strong feeling that something very serious indeed be matter with order of nature when pollyooly side went out to field be more satisfied by prince performance whenever ball came to in spite of fact that encouraging instructive shriek from pollyooly reached first either missed fumbled always shied in short baron feeling that there be something very wrong with cosmos grew stronger became depressed yet more depressed by fact that prince be playing to audience for respectful admiring nurse edged down beach to behold play of whose little charge be playing in same game with assumed insufferable air after while child tired of rounder betook to building sand castle since have be admitted to circle on instance pollyooly seemed to feel responsible for prince seemed also to feel more important that must learn to dig properly than that must dig for giving spade stood over urged to ply with exacting persistence of biblical egyptian superintending making of brick baron walked moodily up down outside castle wall considering bitterly while defect in cosmos morning sped prince perspired at last punctual baron observed that be time to return home to lunch in fact vigilant stomach apprised of fact before watch came close to castle wall said be time for highness to coom 'ome highness took notice of in louder tone baron said coom along highness id dime go 'ome highness shot savage glance at out of corner of eye hunched shoulder went on digging hear baron calling prince said pollyooly in tone of displeasure highness seemed likely to withdraw head right out of sight between shoulder went on digging be still perspiring now go along at once like good boy said pollyooly sharply highness raised disappearing head saw cold resolve in deep blue eye gave little shake stuck spade into sand stretched neck went not like good boy stumbled down castle wall with teeth set very tight immediately on reaching level ground kicked shin of unprepared preceptor baron a be wont bent like bow held little charge out at length of arm beyond range of shin till wrath must have abated pollyooly face filled with horror came springing lightly down castle wall cried do that naughty little boy caught prince resounding slap on cheek pent up feeling of prince escaped in loud yell loosed preceptor pressed hand to stinging cheek be too much for baron tore hat from head flung to earth ground into earth with heel flung arm to heaven in one frenzied movement ach gott cried to unregarding sky thad liddle eengleesh devil child must strike hohenzollern moved by emotion pollyooly looked at in anxious surprise be right said in soothing voice know how to manage will go like lamb surmise must have be more than surmise proved accurate prince went blubbering went like lamb might be supposed that proud hohenzollern blood must have boiled for hour at blow nothing of kind after hearty lunch rose said firmly be going to blay wiz bollyooly went baron followed gloomily now knew cosmic to be mere time honored cheat in order came down on to beach approached group of child in pollyooly reigned prince entered with air of uninvited guest very doubtful of welcome said to pollyooly in tone half assertive half beseeching have coom to blay pollyooly looked at with very stern eye said well quite understand have got to behave baron groaned pollyooly turned to said with polite interest have kicked again ach himmel said baron thrust hand into pocket clenched finger very tightly walked away with bowed head chapter xiv training of royalty on day began real instruction of prince adalbert of lippe schweidnitz in art of life grace of social intercourse pollyooly continued with unswerving firmness method of treating hohenzollern be indeed entirely subversive of current idea on matter of deference due to member of family have practically made history of europe since beginning of century seemed at time a if to hohenzollern be hardly animate object shoved here there a might easy chair kept catching in carpet at other time mere beast of burden shoved shook cuffed gently into doing what wanted with moderate uncertain degree of precision often however piercing shriek be sufficient to produce required action prince be always in perspiration often out of breath seemed to thrive on treatment appetite improved pastiness lessened skin grew clearer flesh became le abundant harder also became quicker in movement showed many more glimmering of intelligence sometimes sustained for second at time baron deferential soul must not endure situation never occurred to to make

lump at ricksborough court plausible fortunately be too young to spoil plan by indiscreet babble have be babbling child to mind of servant at ricksborough court mind so carefully trained in board school of england pregnant grunt must convey meaning then arose question of becoming outfit into matter honourable john ruffin threw with enthusiasm saw way to remove burden of new summer clothes for herself lump from pollyooly slender resource for several year more than once duke protested that be not taking child to live at court for rest of century when honourable john ruffin thoughtfully tried to edge in few winter vest protested hotly that be not fitting out expedition to discover north pole south warm opposition only excited combative instinct of honourable john ruffin coldly urged well known inclemency of english summer surely duke did not wish to have two pneumonic child on hand vest slipped into outfit duke be resolved to give affair strongest possible air of verisimilitude engaged governess miss belthrop for pollyooly led to engaging nurse emily gibbs for lump though pollyooly protested that be quite unnecessary duke be indeed falling more more deeply in love with scheme nearer came to putting into effect on three afternoon came to coach pollyooly in topography of ricksborough court garden in habit of lady marion ricksborough be astonished impressed by intelligence be called on to tell hardly single thing twice spoke of to honourable john ruffin with great respect then on tenth day after first visit came in taxicab greatly excited for luggage drove to waterloo station on platform found emily gibbs in charge of lawrence duke valet awaiting found favour in exigent eye of pollyooly who let take charge of lump without single anxious qualm emily gibbs fell in love with at first sight pollyooly though while kept careful eye on left in care of emily gibbs till train be actually outside london then took into corner pointed out object of interest to be convinced that have made great advance in intelligence since journey down to pyechurch not once did hail sheep a gee gee promoted to use of proper christian name called roger duke have grown calm once more read four penny half penny magazine with appearance of absorbed interest in motor car carried from ricksborough station to court pollyooly insisted on having lump on knee motor drive did not come way so often that must bear to be parted from in hour of such delight once out of peaceful seclusion of railway carriage duke excitement have returned now that real ordeal be at hand have grown uncommonly nervous may be that be unused to deceit have set emily gibbs beside chauffeur that might have pollyooly to way poured jumbled instruction into ear in fashion must have brought to court hopelessly confused have be paying much attention to a followed up step of court fancied that be even shaky on leg rawlings butler greeted with cold dignified civility showed thoroughly aware of own value also there be lack of geniality in tone showed that did not greatly love duke one smile lavished on pollyooly be stiff wooden certainly passed careless scrutiny then have gone few step into hall when slim serpentine dachshund trotted forward to greet avoided duke sniffed at pollyooly then uttered yelp of joy began to dance round at yelp four more small dog hurried down hall flung on pollyooly with sign of warmest affection duke gasped blinked suddenly assumed machiavellian air said for benefit of butler footman in high unnatural voice well at rate dog have forgotten marion papa said pollyooly with angel smile chapter xix pollyooly be introduced to county have never done before to day to surprise of butler duke accompanied supposed daughter up stair to lady marion ricksborough suite of room face be flushed stumbled twice mind be full of strange behaviour of serpentine dachshund other dog when have risen above range of hearing of butler footman in hall said somewhat breathlessly be never so flabbergasted in life fancy dog taking to like when saw hildegarde who be one of most particular dog ever came across dancing round like must have knocked down with feather yes be funny said pollyooly smiled what blessing be duke went on quickly will be over place that dog recognised after that be good whatever one saying that be not marion settle absolutely suppose doe said pollyooly calmly have intention in world of telling that dog have best of reason for recognising in actually have known before did not trouble at to leave in error suited purpose so well that one must know that have ever be at court before suite of room when pollyooly have last occupied have consisted of bedroom school room bedroom sitting room of governess to duke have added nursery bedroom for lump bedroom for nurse in schoolroom found belthorp awaiting duke presented to pollyooly then with air of operating camorrist showed pollyooly be bedroom by crafty device of pretending to make sure that sheet have be aired pollyooly at once demanded that lump must also sleep in seemed very natural desire on part of little girl much to disgust of emily gibbs who wished to have to herself a much a possible duke ordered cot to be brought into then with same machiavellian air said to miss belthorp lady marion have taken strong fancy to little boy be adopting hope will last be sure to grace be such dear little boy said miss belthorp with conviction for too have fallen victim to silent charm of lump having done best to secure first success of plan duke left pollyooly made haste to have trunk unpacked then having put on linen frock while emily gibbs put one on lump took out into garden miss belthorp accompanied seemed to pollyooly that be uncommonly like miss marlow lady marion earlier governess whom have found at court during last stay there realised very soon that be really unnecessary to listen to conversation chance of saying anything of real interest being so very small from window of smoking room duke saw two child crossing terrace accompanied by large proportion of dog of establishment in glowing self satisfaction with success of first part of plan found that greatly improved appearance of garden lump approved greatly of garden be little doubtful about dog kept firm hold of pollyooly skirt be nearly ten minute before encouraged by very friendly way in pollyooly treated really unbent showed truly marvellous instinct for discovering dog must let pull tail must not pollyooly thought wise to relax little from usual exact mothering of have sit by at tea of course let emily gibbs give bath contented with watching operation be pleased that lump did not accept change without objection pointed to said quite severely pollyooly be right roger dear said in soothing tone then turning to emily gibbs added wonder what mean know ladyship be dearest little boy ever see said emily gibbs with enthusiasm never knew a how there be such little boy kissed pollyooly frowned slightly transport seemed to misplaced be invasion of proprietary right in did not frown long after fonder emily gibbs be of more carefully must watch over at supper in servant hall emily gibbs underwent severe cross examination coming of lump to court have indeed set tongue wagging rawlings since have failed to find duke quite satisfactory be doing nothing to check chief housemaid second cook chef be frenchman with strong italian accent marked also cooking seemed to have made up mind that emily gibbs must necessarily have be made repository of secret of lump origin spared effort to extract secret from emily gibbs have most uncomfortable supper of life fellow servant naturally resented bitterly fact that have met lump for first time very day at waterloo station wanted peg on to hang romance did not provide at last second cook said well be a plain a pikestaff to that little boy be son of young lady a grace be in love with before ever met duchess married somebody else be dead grace adopted little boy for old sake sake first housemaid second housemaid accepted theory warmly then emily gibbs said expect have red hair basic fact of affair having be thus comfortably settled talk turned on identity of lady then on colour of hair rawlings be of opinion that redness of lump hair be evidence that father mother have be relation of duke since there be so much red hair in osterley family suggestion met with general approval certainly make adopting more natural like said second housemaid pollyooly be awake next morning before one else at court soon after six rose dressed lump gave biscuit ate accompanied by loose dog in house went out into garden through one of long window of blue drawing room led lump round to stable there unloosed several more dog so that went about world well attended spent two very pleasant hour before exigent appetite demanded return to breakfast duke saw returning from dressing room once more be of opinion that improved appearance of garden a be lady marion first day at court after so many month miss belthorp decided that must be holiday holiday for pollyooly be lump did not appear to be yet ripe to learn even alphabet after breakfast therefore went out again miss belthorp went with be of advantage to for excursion became formal walk much le attractive than erratic wandering when alone also be walk along path there be incursion into heart of wood went through did go in single meadow roll in grass with dog also since hour be undeniably shining thought well to improve by imparting little instruction in botany pollyooly found quite uninteresting did not care at whether flower have four stem fourteen stamen seemed to childish mind quite unimportant colour fragrance of flower seemed to only important thing a came into court miss belthorp chanced to say do hope that have be neglecting piano marion always think that music be so important in formation of character pollyooly have not be neglecting piano because have piano to neglect piano played part in of seven standard have passed at muttle deeping school did not know one note from be taken aback by suggestion that be expected to show accomplished in music evidently must consult duke lump miss belthorp lunched with rather dined lunched after having seen lump safely on way upstairs with miss belthorp pollyooly followed duke into smoking room please grace miss belthorp seems to expect to know how to play piano know how to at said gravely deuce said duke here be thing never thought of mind learning piano said pollyooly with sigh yes if showed that did know anything about must look very suspicious indeed said duke frowned deeply a cudgelled brain for way out of unexpected difficulty expect must said pollyooly frowned on fidgeting then said with decision well only thing to do be to stop altogether must be quite safe said pollyooly brightening right will see to said duke pollyooly left with heart at ease frowned over matter for time for did not seem to to be quite in natural order of thing that duke must actually refuse to allow daughter to learn piano must find other way of concealing pollyooly damning ignorance of art of music at last therefore sent for miss belthorp said er have decided that er poll er lady marion be not to learn piano not learn piano said miss belthorp in tone of one afflicted with last amazement er have never observed er slightest aptitude in for said duke with perfect truthfulness miss belthorp blinked prided on brilliancy with played piano especially scherzo passage b look such intelligent child said yes be why said duke happily miss belthorp blinked again then in somewhat helpless tone said oh very well grace when door closed behind duke smiled happily rubbed hand together pollyooly be expecting to spend quiet afternoon in garden home wood with lump dog perhaps miss belthorp hoped that miss belthorp must have more important way of spending time of emily gibbs must easily dispose since already be giving order with quiet firmness there be gainsaying indeed emily gibbs have be far too well brought up not to receive order from what called lady of title with humble gratitude execute with vigour despatch already be hard at work making linen overall for lump at half past three just a miss belthorp have left to write letter have started for home wood obedient emily came hurrying along garden to say that duke wished pollyooly to put on prettiest clothes come with to pay call pollyooly frowned deeply at thought have not miss belthorp lingered with must by now have be safely hidden in recess of wood for moment almost wished that lump be not so attractive very soon be serene again after be pleasant thing to be prettily dressed ride in motor car there be always exciting anticipation that cake at tea must not only be delicious quite uncommon dressed therefore in complete serenity gave emily gibbs careful exact instruction about care of lump during absence then footman came up to say that car be ready went down stair comfortably assured that be looking prettiest saw that duke looked pleased at sight of face grew quite bright put into tonneau of car stepped in after be not first time have be alone together for moment felt somewhat oppressed at once began to instruct in manner deportment in vogue at garden party presently be talking to with most amiable affability three quarter of hour drive brought to ilkeston tower destination when pollyooly duke coming on to lawn be set with group of brightly dressed shrilly chattering people be loudly announced by strong lunged butler there be sudden hush general quickly checked movement toward then lady ilkeston greeted duke said to in somewhat loud voice be rather dull going about alone so brought marion with how nice said lady ilkeston welcomed pollyooly warmly there be by mean immediate rush to make pollyooly acquaintance for hour lady ilkeston found busy introducing to people who be firmly resolved to make acquaintance since be so to speak sub heroine of most interesting local scandal duke have not looked for anything of kind be on tenterhook have expected that a child must be left peacefully in background found central figure of gathering be in liveliest dread lest must fail to come through ordeal with secret safe never for moment occurred to pollyooly that secret be in danger naturally therefore wore air of perfect ease answered innumerable question about fondness for different thing country doll flower so forth with serene simplicity be somewhat surprised by air be not accentuated even obvious of faintly haughty aloofness have feeling that be exactly right air for daughter of duke wondered how have come to whether honourable john ruffin be right in red deeping theory did not know experienced cousin have often laid before pollyooly advantage of giving air have not be slow to see grew easier in mind lady ilkeston be person really pleased have not expected to have really interesting central figure at afternoon be more grateful at getting one gratitude took practical form of instructing sir mile walpole amiable young man of twenty four very fond of child to take pollyooly to long table under cedar give very nice tea indeed ice cake surpassed hope expectation to small degree compensated pollyooly for loss of untrammelled ramble through home wood also enjoyed society of sir mile walpole be at once thoroughly at home with soon after tea duke took away when car have started said triumphantly well came through that right not soul spotted that be marion how must said pollyooly in tone of lively surprise oh be bit afraid at first said duke be said pollyooly simply took off hat let rushing air cool brow smiled broadly at horizon seemed to that if pollyooly be central figure in yet gathering two duchess must not be long in hearing that have with uncommon success replaced lost daughter chapter xx pollyooly duke duke delight with evident publicity have attended presentation of pollyooly to county have lessened hardly at by next morning thought likely that if duchess be anywhere in united kingdom must learn by post very day that have filled place of marion then occurred to that correspondent must not only condole with duchess on having lost daughter also must condole with on having lost charming delightful daughter laughed more heartily than have laughed for many long day in natural desire for yet more publicity afternoon took pollyooly with drove over to overton grange to introduce to ashcrofts who have tried to play part of mediator with signal ill success between duchess ashcrofts have heard that lady marion ricksborough have be present at garden party at ilkeston tower day before be surprised by news more than little hurt that duchess have not at once informed that duke have recovered also be feeling that duke have brought pollyooly to show off to a triumph therefore lord ashcroft strong silent bearded man be trifle stiff with lady ashcroft trifle cold made up for by giving warmest welcome possible friendliness be almost overwhelming after tea to pollyooly regret there be ice lady ashcroft took up to nursery where found little girl of eight little boy of six enjoyed thoroughly be better than ice lord ashcroft duke smoked cigarette in silence for while after lady ashcroft pollyooly have left lord ashcroft looked rather gloomy duke looked at peace with world then lord ashcroft said gloomily how did get hold of marion oh money just money said duke airily with perfect truthfulness lord ashcroft frowned be silent again duke with same air of content lighted cigarette presently lord ashcroft said be very much improved in look intelligence duke sat bolt upright said quickly with heat be nothing of kind oh yes be know be said lord ashcroft firmly be being with mother be nothing of kind said duke still with heat seemed to absurd to suggest that pollyooly be superior to daughter be will write tell caroline so said lord ashcroft with same firmness never knew such obstinate wrong headed duke broke out broke off short paused began to laugh laughed heartily then said oh well have own way write tell so will said lord ashcroft in tone of one bent on performing sacred duty see anything to laugh at duke again remained silent twice laughed sudden short laugh lord ashcroft looked at suspiciously know quite what be happening to osterley said presently in tone hardly meant to be pleasant be changing yes getting brighter said duke easily may be again may not said lord ashcroft coldly tugged at beard after conversation seemed hard to make soon duke said that must be going lady ashcroft kept waiting nearly twenty minute before brought pollyooly down from nursery then said that pollyooly must come to spend whole day with child pollyooly said that must like to come very much duke looked little doubtful be not sure that pollyooly must stand test of hour of intimacy on way home talked for
