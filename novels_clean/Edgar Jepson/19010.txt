serene unconsciousness of cloud upon relation petrel be soon crossing gulf in immensely important way at full speed of eight knot hour in pursuance of policy tinker took elsie forward left dorothy father to entertain one on quarter deck two child amused very well talking to alphonse steersman adolphe engineer thick set thick witted men who combined picturesqueness of organ grinder with stolidity of agriculturalist nature have plainly intended for plough circumstance have pitched into seafaring hour steering brought across gulf landed made dejeuner at little auberge rather cabaret affected by fisherman folk of landes off grey mullet fresh from bay of biscay grilled over fire of pine cone with second course of ring dove roasted before after coffee tinker suggested that must cross over to strip of sand at point separate gulf from bay others fell in with humour crossed over landed in yacht dinghy tinker insisted on taking two rug though dorothy father objected that sand be quite dry enough to sit on however when came to beach of bay sir tancred spread out dorothy sat on two child wandered away presently elsie found holding tinker hand running hard through pine towards landing place in answer to tinker hail alphonse fetched aboard in dingey honest unsuspecting mariner accepted instruction to take for cruise come back later for father lady without murmur sooner be petrel under weigh than strode to middle of quarter deck folded arm scowled darkly in direction of father dorothy so heedless of plight growled in hoarsest most piratical voice marooned marooned slowly paced deck with arm still folded casting piercing glance of bird of prey across water then of sudden roared once more with true piratical hoarseness hand on deck to splice main brace alphonse adolphe did not understand nautical english when elsie came from cabin with bottle of cognac two glass slow wide grin showed perfect comprehension tinker gave cognac took wheel then became absorbed in steering sternly rejected further consideration of gift must have hand part in hocussing french agriculturalist posing a mariner for absorption in steering care to look past a sat in more than fraternal affection on deck with bottle between be somehow forced on probably by noise made that proceeded from gentle cheerfulness through wild songful hilarity broken by interlude in described to other with eloquent enthusiasm charm of lass who loved best to tearful melancholy from be rapt away into sodden stertorous slumber at third snore tinker turned to elsie who sat by looking rather scared by changing humour of agricultural mariner said with sardonic ferocious smile ship be ours at once divested of hat of civilisation tied round head red handkerchief proper to profession then gave wheel going to cabin came back with black flag neatly embroidered in white with skull crossbones dorothy work sternly bade imaginary quartermaster run up jolly roger then a quartermaster ran up that emblem of dreadful trade became captain once more with folded arm corrugated brow surveyed gloomily then went down to engine room put yacht on half speed a well a must stoked fire for next three hour petrel forgot innocent tradition of youth a pleasure boat traversed gulf of arcachon shameless ravening pirate while captain hildebrand scourge of spanish main issued curt sanguinary order to imaginary a blood dyed gang of villain a ever scuttled indiaman jolly roger three four blank shot from little signal gun drove three panic stricken fishing boat from fishing ground a fast a oar sail must carry to spread abroad legend of piracy in gulf must last generation be nearly sunset before captain hildebrand returned to serious consideration of business a cupid ally then set petrel going dead slow ran gently on to sandbank let fall anchor be hanging from bow done again pirate looked at recumbent still stertorous alphonse adolphe with cold cruel eye said be time lubber walked plank illustration be time lubber walked plank ay ay sir said elsie cheerfully then added in doubtful voice wo poor men get drowned not in four foot of water said captain hildebrand set briskly about preparation for fell deed with elsie help brought plank to gangway then either taking by arm dragged grunting adolphe slowly down deck arranged on plank with capstan bar many hearty yo heave ho levered plank out over side till adolphe weight tilted up soused into water for moment disappeared then rose spluttering choking sank again found footing stood up roaring like flabbergasted bull captain hildebrand lay quietly down on deck writhed kicked in spasm of racking mirth trusty lieutenant after laughing while looked grave said poor man will take cold have sympathy with drunkard said captain hildebrand with cold severity rose going forward by kicking alphonse hard freely in rib roused from dream of lass who loved sailor said adolphe have fallen overboard took time for information to penetrate alphonse skull when did be vivid alertness staggered swiftly aft to gangway in rather le than five second with conspicuous agility have precipitated into adolphe arm rose clinging to one roared like bull while shrieking tinker danced lightly round deck presently recovered enough to throw rope climbed on board difficult feat seeing that deck be not two foot above head before thought of yacht went to forecastle changed wet clothes while dusk deepened tinker went to galley made tea have brought to cabin elsie be making well earned hearty meal discoursing with gusto of blood dyed career during afternoon when alphonse very sad glum came told that yacht be aground adolphe be getting up full steam to get off tinker with great readiness said must come up help in hour heard rattle of propeller coming on deck said must go to bow while alphonse took wheel adolphe worked engine went right forward peered into darkness adolphe set engine going full speed reversed tinker cried be moving saw anchor chain slowly tauten then petrel moved more propeller thrashed away to purpose to great joy be sure that anchor held however cheered on to persevere for nearly hour propeller thrashed away then gave up sat down gloomily on hatch of engine room lighted pipe tinker elsie went back to cabin rolled in rug be soon enjoying innocent sleep of childhood be twelve o'clock when tinker awoke at once went on deck found that alphonse by way of keeping watch have gone comfortably asleep in bow while adolphe snored from forecastle kicked alphonse awake said think must get off if hauled up anchor for minute two alphonse turned idea hazily over in apology for mind then with hasty exclamation ran to side saw dimly taut anchor chain blundered below lugged adolphe out of berth on deck for five excited minute explained to one that anchor be embedded in sandbank that held petrel on then soberly slowly got to work on capstan hauled up anchor dozen turn of propeller drew petrel off bank into deep water in three minute have about steamed off towards marooned while tinker in galley be heating water for coffee making soup in meanwhile dorothy sir tancred ignorant of plight have spent delightful afternoon exploring with never tiring interest one soul for long time chided gently for aimless manner of living defended with half mocking sadness at about sunset rose reluctantly sighed with one accord that pleasant hour be over looked at one with sudden questioning eye at sound of sigh looked quickly away walked slowly on foot reluctant to leave pleasant place through pine silent save twice sir tancred sent voice ringing among tree in call to tinker came to landing place to find empty sea looked at one blankly child must have persuaded men to take for cruise said sir tancred be late coming back said dorothy for while eye explored corner recess of gulf within sight found petrel then sir tancred said well must wait spread rug for at foot of tree paced up down before keeping

of being trackless anyhow must mean walking for hour be le exhausting for to sit here petrel must turn up sooner later remembering talk with tinker in morning dorothy believed that must be later much later a must hardly unfold reason for belief said nothing for long time be silent listening to faint thunder of bay behind lapping of water at foot stirring of pine filled slowly with sense of aloofness from world perfect content in being out of alone with for part sir tancred be ill at ease foresaw that unless petrel came soon lot of annoying gossip might spring from accident be distressed on account on other hand too found enjoying being alone with out of world at last said softly feel a though be on desolate far away island wish to goodness be cried with fervour thrilled 'd find very
