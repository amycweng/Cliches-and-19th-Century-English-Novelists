not till third afternoon that came upon wiggins walking briskly about three mile from little deeping twin a rule be wont to shun mr carrington have great respect for attainment much greater for humor in erebus respect often took form of wriggling in presence did not know what might say about next be therefore somewhat surprised when slipped off bicycle joined wondered what wanted apparently be merely in gregarious mood yearning for society of fellow creature in about three minute talk be running on pheasant mr carrington did not like pheasant except from point of view of eating dwelt at length on devastation sacred bird be working in english countryside village be being emptied let fall to ruin that might live undisturbed song bird be being killed off to give wood to seemed natural step from pheasant to poacher be not aware that took at prompting of terror bewailed degeneracy of british rustic slow reversion to type of neolithic man owing to fact that town drained village of intelligent skilful poacher who harried sacred bird be fast becoming extinct then at last came to important matter of wile of poacher thirsty ear of terror drank in golden word discussed method of gang of poacher single poacher with intelligent relish more sympathy than be perhaps wise to display in presence of young terror came from talk with firm belief in efficacy of raisin next afternoon twin rode into rowington bought pound of raisin at leading grocer might well have bought at little deeping encouraging local enterprise thought rowington safer always took possible precaution at beginning of enterprise did not ride straight home three mile out of rowington be small clump of tree on hill at foot of hill hundred yard below clump lay great deeping wood acre upon acre have lately passed along with rest of great deeping estate into hand of mr darcy rosenheimer pudding faced stanch young briton of old pomeranian strain be not loved in county even by landed proprietor of le

illustrated weekly be in deep december dusk that twin came to clump on hill terror lifted bicycle over gate set behind hedge removed pound of raisin from bicycle basket to pocket leaving erebus to keep watch stole down hedge to clump crawled through gap into walked through one pheasant scuttled out of down hedgerow to wood below occurrence pleased crawled out of clump on farther side proceeded to lay train of raisin down ditch of hedge to wood did not lay right down to wood lest inquisitive gamekeeper might espy then returned with fine red indian caution to erebus rode home well content next evening with bag of raisin sought clump again again terror laid trail of raisin along ditch from wood to clump evening set snare in hedge of clump just above end of ditch later took from snare plump sacred bird later still sold to cook of mr blenkinsop for two threepence chapter vi landed proprietor on reaching home terror displayed two shilling threepence to erebus with unusual air of triumph a rule showed serenely unmoved alike in victory defeat thats right said erebus cheerfully that makesthat make twenty eight eleven penny be getting on twenty eight eleven penny now said terror quickly dont seem to see that when weve got stole for mum pheasant will still be going on of course will cried erebus eye shone very brightly indeed at joyful thought next day terror obtained sandwich

lodge of great deeping park then way up drive saw keeper prey keeper held wiggins with left hand wheeled captured bicycle with right twin dismounted even at distance must see deep dejection of friend there not really reason for to be frightened be never in wood at never touched pheasant said terror what doe matter will be frightened out of life he so young cried erebus in tone of acute distress gazing after receding friend with very anxious eye he not like wont cheek keeper way like must oh wiggins have plenty of pluck said terror in reassuring tone wont understand he right he only ten there

to get out of somehow cried erebus in furious desperation with mounted bicycle rode swiftly up drive terror mounted started after stopped at end of fifty yard have occurred to that after be only poacher of three only one in real danger a leaned on machine watching vanishing sister ground teeth for natural serenity inaction be in highest degree repugnant to erebus reached great deeping court few minute after wiggins keeper be about to ride on round house thinking that keeper must a befitted station enter by back door when saw wiggins bicycle standing against one of pillar of great porch in natural elation at having captured poacher eager to display prize without delay keeper have gone straight into great hall erebus dismounted stood considering for perhaps minute then moved wiggins bicycle so that be right to hand if came out set own bicycle against of pillar out of sight lest must take by mistake walked up step hammered knocker firmly rang bell moment door opened stepped quickly past footman into hall keeper sat on chair facing on chair beside sat wiggins looking white woebegone erebus gazed at with angry sparkling eye then said sharply what be doing with little brother adopted wiggins with suddenness in order to strengthen position keeper opened eye in surprise at uncompromising tone said triumphantly caught im poachin stand up what do mean by speaking to

aidin abettin ive brought im to mr darcy rosynimer for im to say said keeper stubbornly there came faint click from beautiful lip of erebus gentle click by twin called other to attention at sound wiggins face faintly flushed with hope braced erebus measured distance with eye of expert just a there came into farther end of hall large flabby pudding faced young pomeranian briton mr darcy rosenheimer wheres boacher roared in eager angry voice reverting in emotion to ancestral b a keeper turned to erebus sprang to door threw wide bolt wiggins cried wiggins bolted for door keeper grabbed at missed footman grabbed grabbed interposing erebus slammed door behind vanished wiggins mr darcy rosenheimer dashed heavily down hall with thick howl erebus set back against door caught by left arm

carrington let have matter of pheasant clear be terror exploring wood on chance of finding pheasant have reason to expect that pheasant must be there ready to be brought home erebus blushed faintly

quinine presently fell asleep terror have taken coat off wiggins be still without stocking jersey borrowed stocking sweater from mr carrington now that business of seeing after wiggins be over told how have come to pond to find wiggins in water erebus spread out on ice holding back from sinking be careful not to tell that have forbidden erebus to let wiggins go on ice when mr carrington began to thank for saving insisted on giving credit to erebus mr carrington made also take dose of ammoniated quinine then further fortified with cake very agreeable port wine on way home terror went briskly round by pringles pond picked up skate garment have be left there when reached home found that erebus be in bed seemed little worse for lying with arm chest in icy water keeping wiggins afloat when learned that wiggins also seemed none worse be sleeping peacefully ate lunch with fair terror did not point out that trouble have sprung from disregard for instruction only said just told mr carrington that wiggins be already in water when got to pond be awfully decent of said erebus after pause in have gathered full bearing of reticence chapter viii muttle deeping peach dreadful fright have suffered did not throw cloud over spirit of erebus for a long a might have be expected be a quick a one to realize alls well that end well wiggins escaped lightly with couple of day in bed adventure however induced change in attitude to be far le condescending with than have be indeed seemed to have acquired something of proprietary interest in be uncommonly solicitous for welfare to point did solicitude go that more than once remonstrated bitterly with for fussing about during rest of winter spring early summer life followed even tenor did lesson played game then tended inmate of cat home selling a grew big replacing sold with threepenny kitten just able to lap in spring fished free water of whittle little trout stream run through estate of morgan of muttle deeping grange free

sir james morgan preserved water higher up stream mr hilton agent of estate be very firm in refusal to give leave for reason that twin must see since sir james be absent shooting big game in africa resented refusal bitterly seemed to wanton waste of stream be consolation to to make well judged raid one early morning on strawberry bed in one of walled garden of muttle deeping grange about middle of june terror went to london on visit to aunt amelia sir maurice falconer miss hendersyde saw to that be not unbroken series of visit to cat home lady ryehampton have arranged for enjoyed very much on return be able to assure interested erebus that aunt parrot still said dam with perfectly accurate monotonous iteration soon after return news be spread abroad that sir james morgan have let muttle deeping grange in life of deeping village mere letting of muttle deeping grange be unimportant event inhabitant of great deeping muttle deeping possibly corruption of middle deeping little deeping be stirred to very depth of being when news came that have be let to german princess woman at rate awaited coming with liveliest interest curiosity emotion dashed way from fine height when learned that princess elizabeth of cassel nassau be only twelve year seven month old twin did not share excited curiosity of neighbor resenting deeply fact that tenant of muttle deeping be german princess assumed attitude of cold aloofness in matter refused to be interested impressed erebus be more resentful than terror be to be suspected that high patriotic spirit displayed in matter be in degree owing to fact that mr blenkinsop who came one afternoon to tea gushing information about grandfather grandmother parent uncle cousin aunt of princess ended by saying with meaning what model will be to little girl of neighborhood erebus told terror thing be indeed come to pretty pas when be suggested to english girl dangerfield too that must model on german dont suppose must really make difference who modeled on said terror desirous rather of being frank than grammatical when presently princess came to grange lively curiosity of neighbor be gratified by imperfect vision of did not a have expected attend of three church for have brought with own lutheran pastor only saw on afternoon drive stiff little figure thickly veiled against sun sitting bolt upright in victoria beside crimson baroness crimson in face wore black in whose charge have come to england learned presently that princess have come to muttle deeping for health that be delicate doctor feared lest must develop consumption hoped that few week in excellent deeping air must strengthen news abated little cold hostility of erebus twin paid little attention to young neighbor mother be finding summer trying be sleeping badly appetite be poor doctor arbuthnot put on light diet in particular ordered to eat plenty of fruit be not best season for fruit strawberry be over raspberry be coming to end mr dangerfield made shift to do with banana twin be annoyed that be best must be done to carry out doctor order there seemed help for be in afternoon sweltering afternoon after doctor visit that a twin bent on aimless ride be lazily wheeling bicycle out of cat home sudden gleam came into eye of terror said ive got idea answering light gleamed in eye of erebus cried joyfully thank goodness be beginning to get afraid that nothing be ever going to occur to again thought be hot weather what be german said terror darkly now that theyve got grange why shouldnt make raid on peach garden say grange peach be better than hothouse one watkins told ripen uncommon early theyre probably ripe now thats splendid idea will just teach german cried erebus piquant face be bright with sterling spirit of patriot then after pause added reluctantly if princess be invalid perhaps ought to have peach couldnt want of why couldnt there be hundred said terror quickly theyre very thing for mum banana be very well in way theyre not like real fruit of course mum must have said erebus with decision how be going to get into peach garden door in wall only open on inside be not ive worked out now just hurry up get big leaf to put peach in mum will like ever so much better with bloom on though doesnt really make difference to taste erebus ran into kitchen garden gathered big soft leaf of different kind when came back found terror tying landing net have borrowed from vicar for trout fishing to backbone of bicycle put leaf into bicycle basket rode briskly to muttle deeping twin knew approach to muttle deeping grange well since have spent several day in careful scouting before have made raid earlier in summer on strawberry bed screen of tree run down from home wood along wall of garden twin after coming from road in shelter of home wood came down wall behind screen of tree about middle of peach garden terror climbed on to low bough raised head with slow caution above wall surveyed garden be empty silent save for curious snoring sound disquieted little since ascribed to distant pig stepped on to higher branch leaned over wall surveyed golden burden of tree beneath ready erebus handed landing net up to chose peach ripest must see slipped net under flicked lifted peach in over wall lowered down to erebus who made haste to roll in leaf lay gently in bicycle basket terror netted garden be not a empty a believed on garden chair in little lawn in middle of sat princess elizabeth hidden from by thick wall of pear tree in chair beside sat rather sprawled guardian baroness frederica von aschersleben who be following faithfully doctor instruction that little charge must spend time in open air be doing best to bring about that practise must do a little good a possible by choosing sultriest most airless spot on estate because be so admirably adapted to own comfortable sleeping baroness added nothing to old world charm of garden eye be shut mouth be open face be most painfully crimson from short extremely tip tilted nose came sound of snoring terror have ascribed to distant pig princess be warmlyvery warmlydressed for sweltering afternoon sweltering spot little bead of sweat stood on brow story book have be trying to read lay face downward in lap be looking round simmering garden with look of intolerable discomfort boredom on pretty pale face then moving object came into range of vision just beyond end of wall of pear treea moving object against garden wall must not see clearly what be seemed to that peach rose vanished over top of wall stared at part of wall whence have risen in few second peach seemed to rise disappear curious behavior of english peach so roused curiosity that in spite of heat rose walked quietly to end of wall of pear tree a came beyond saw leaning over wall fair haired boy even a saw something rose vanished over wall far too swiftly for to see that be landing net surprise did not rob terror of politeness smiled amicably raised cap said in most agreeable tone how do do did not know how much princess have seen be not going to make admission of guilt by hasty perhaps needle flight provoke pursuit risk peach how do do said princess little haughtily hesitating what be doing up there im looking at garden said terror truthfully not quite accurately for be looking much more at princess gazed at brow knitted in little perplexed frown thought that have be taking peach be not sure serene guileless face limpid blue eye gave suspicion lie thought that looked nice boy gazed at with growing interest approvalas much approval a one must give to girl princess elizabeth have beautiful gray eye though pale cheek be little hollow line from cheek bone to corner of chin be so straight that made face almost triangular be pretty face looked fragile felt sorry for garden very hot said like holding one face over oven oh be said princess with impatient weariness yet there quite decent little breeze blowing over top of wall said terror princess sighed gazed at other with curious examining eye certainly looked nice boy tell what come out into wood know awfully cool place youd find very refreshing said terror in tone of one who have of sudden be happily inspired princess looked back along wall of pear tree irresolutely at sleeping baroness sight of richly crimson face made garden feel hotter than ever do come sister here will be very jolly in woodthe three of said terror in most persuasive tone princess hesitated again looked back at sleeping unbeautiful baroness then said with truly german frankness be well born terror smiled little haughtily in turn said slowly well from what mr blenkinsop said dangerfields be baron in weald before be hohenzollern did very well at crcy agincourt too added pensively princess seemed reassured still hesitated suppose baroness be to wake said light of understanding brightened terror face oh be that baroness snoring thought be pig said frankly wont wake for hour nobody snoring like must assurance seemed to disperse last doubt of princess cast one more look back at crimson argus said very goot will coom walked to door lower down garden wall when came through found twin wheeling bicycle toward terror in very dignified fashion introduced erebus to a violet anastasia dangerfield a hyacinth wolfram dangerfield gave full so little used name because felt that in case of princess etiquette demanded then moved along screen of tree up side of garden wall toward wood twin shortened stride to suit pace of princess be uncommonly slow kept looking from one to other with curious rather timid pleased eye saw landing net erebus have fastened to backbone of terror bicycle saw connection between vanishing peach passed straight from screen of tree through gap into home wood gap of size to let carry bicycle through without difficulty took narrow little used path into depth of wood moved down in single file expect never found path said terror to princess who be following closely on back wheel of bicycle haf not found haf never be in wood till now said princess havent be in wood home woodthe jolliest part of estate cried terror in liveliest surprise there be two path straight into from garden stay always in garden said princess sedately baroness von aschersleben doe not walk mooch will not that go out of sight of must get awfully slack sticking in garden time said erebus slack what be slack said princess mean feeble said terror same garden be big enough there plenty of room to run about in run be not dignified baroness von aschersleben must be shocked said princess with somewhat prim air wonder youre delicate said erebus politely trying to keep touch of contempt out of tone failing one can not help being delicate said princess dont know said terror doubtfully if youre in open air lot do run about dont keep delicate wiggins used to be delicate isnt now who be wiggins said princess he friend of oursnot so old a arequite little boy said erebus in patronizing tone wiggins have be present must have resented with extreme bitterness besides doctor arbuthnot told mr blenkinsop that if be always in open air playing with child of own age youd soon get strong thats what ive come to england for said princess dont think there much chance of getting strong in peach garden didnt feel to like open air at said terror firmly be open air said princess came out of narrow path have be following into broader one presently turned aside from at foot of steep pathless bank twin started up a if be neither here there to a indeed be not princess stopped short said in tone of dismay be to climb terror stopped looked at dismayed face set bicycle against trunk of tree said ill help up with dismissing etiquette from mind slipped arm round slender waist of princess firmly hauled to top of bank relieved of most of effort needed to mount none le reached top panting little certainly arent in very good training said rather sadly training what be training said princess being fit said erebus in faintly superior tone what be being fit said princess being strongand welland able to run mile mile said erebus raising voice to make meaning clearer neednt shout at said terror im trying to make understand said erebus firmly do understandwhen be not slang be using know english quite well said princess certainly speak awfully well said terror politely went down bank hauled up bicycle went little deeper into wood reached goal bank of small pool sat down in row princess looked at cool water in cool green shade of tall tree with refreshed eye be different said with faint little sigh of pleasure illustration be different said yes be real open air said terror do get lot of open air protested princess why sleep with window openat least that much held out two forefinger six inch apart baroness did not like said be very dangerous must give chill doctor arbuthnot said that must be open think sleep better have bedroom window a wide open a theyll go then theyre not wide enough in hot weather said erebus in tone of superiority be beginning to sound galling think if took off hat jacket youd be cooler still said terror rather quickly princess hesitated moment then obediently took off hat jacket breathed soft sigh of pleasure have quite lost air of discomfort boredom eye be shining brightly pale cheek be little flushed with excitement of situation be by mean improbable that twin a well brought up child be aware that be not etiquette to speak to royal personage unless first speak to if be did not let that knowledge stand in way of gratification of healthy curiosity may be felt that in free green wood etiquette of court be out of place at rate did not let trammel since healthy curiosity be of liveliest kind submitted princess to searching even exhaustive interrogation about life of royal child at german court questioned about hour rose breakfast ate lesson learned walk took lunch ate game played afternoon occupation doll pet tea occupation after tea dinner occupation after dinner hour went to bed there seemed nothing impertinent in curiosity to princess be only natural that detail of life of person of importance must be of greatest interest to le fortunate mortal be not even annoyed by carelessness of etiquette in not waiting to be spoken to before asked question indeed enjoyed answering question very much for be seldom that one displayed genuine interest in be seldom indeed that found on intimate human term with of fellow creature have brother sister have never have really sympathetic playmate child of cassel nassau be always awed stiff in society mind be harassed by fear lest must be guilty of appalling breach of etiquette manner of twin therefore be pleasant change for be polite quite unconstrained obsequious people by whom have always be surrounded have never displayed that engaging quality save when like baroness be safely asleep in presence account of glory did not have effect on new friend looked for a exposed more more of trammeling net of etiquette in from rising to going to bed be enmeshed face did not fill with envy must have found so natural on grew gloomy at end of interrogation erebus heaved great sigh said with heart felt conviction well thank goodness im not princess must be perfectly awful must be nearly a bad to be prince said terror in gloomy tone of one who have lost dear illusion princess must not believe ear stared at twin with parted lip amazed incredulous eye word have given shock of short lifetime a far a memory carried back have be assured frequently solemnly that to be princess german princess hohenzollern princess be most glorious delightful lot female human being must enjoy only little le glorious delightful than lot of german prince b b sp p plendid to be princess everybody say so stammered be humbugging youve just made quite clear that horrid in kind of way why cant do single thing want to there always somebody messing about to see that dont said erebus with cold decision b b one be p p princess stammered princess with something of wild look of one beneath whose foot firm earth have suddenly given way terror perceived distress set about soothing youre forgetting food said quickly to erebus dont suppose ever have to eat cold mutton expect can have sweet ice want of course said princess then went on quickly b b isnt what have to eat make sososo important being princess awfully important what have to eat cried terror must jolly well think so cried erebus princess tried hard to get back to moral sublimity of exalted station twin must not have kept firmly to broad human question of german cookery sweet princess used to having information poured into by many elderly bespectacled gentleman lady be presently again enjoying new part of dispenser of information cheek be faintly flushed eye be sparkling in animated face in interrogation discussion time have slipped away unheeded by interested trio crimson baroness have awakened missed little charge waddled off into house in search of slow search of house garden revealed fact that be not in a soon a be clear baroness fell into panic insisted that whole household must sally forth in search of princess be earnestly engaged in effort to make quite dear to twin exact nature of one of obscure kind of german tartlet kind indeed only found in principality of cassel nassau where keen ear of terror caught sound of distant voice calling out rose sharply to foot said listen there one calling expect theyve missed youll have to be getting back princess rose reluctantly then face clouded said in tone of faint dismay oh dear how annoyed baroness will be take great deal too much notice of baroness said erebus have to shes mymy gouvernante said princess dont see what good be being princess if do just what baroness tell time said erebus coldly princess looked at rather helplessly have never thought of rebelling dont think must tell youve be with mightnt think be good for people round here dont seem to understand said terror suavely princess looked from one to other hesitating with puckered brow then with touch of appeal in tone said be coming to morrow twin looked at other doubtfully have plan for morrow have hope that fortune must find more exciting occupation than discussing germany with one of inhabitant at hesitation princess face fell woefully appeal in touched terror heart must like to come very much said face of princess brightened grateful eye shone on dont think will be able to come said erebus with important air of one burdened with many affair face of princess did not fall again said if brother come oh ill come anyhow said terror voice called again from wood below louder oh isnt baroness miss lambart said princess in tone of relief take too much notice of baroness said erebus again firmly who be miss lambart shes english lady in waiting always have one when im in england of course like try to amuse baroness doesnt like said princess sighed come along ill help down bank take pretty close to miss lambart do for to know of place secret lair said terror see said princess walked briskly to edge of steep bank half carried down led through wood toward drive from miss lambart have called a went adjured to confine to simple if incomplete statement that have be walking in wood last word to a stood on edge of drive be dont stand so much nonsense from baroness miss lambart called again princess stepped into drive found thirty yard away terror slipped noiselessly away through undergrowth miss lambart turned at sound of princess footstep said oh here be highness weve be hunting for baroness thought be lost thought must walk in wood said princess demurely certainly seems to have done good youre looking brighter fresher than youve looked since youve be down here wood be real open air said princess chapter ix cause of freedom terror returned to erebus found stretched at ease eating peach must have liked one good deal sooner said a took one from basket didnt like to say anything about mightnt have understood have mattered if hadnt said erebus somewhat truculently be feeling slight resentment that new acquaintance have so plainly preferred terror to shes not bad kid said terror thoughtfully shes awfully feeble why have to carry up bit of bank shes not use to said erebus in tone of contempt in fact if be to have much to do with expect must find perfect nuisance perhaps still may a well amuse bit seems to be having rotten time with old red baroness etiquette said terror in kindly tone neednt stand if doesnt like shouldnt said erebus coldly then face brightened added tell what though must be rather fun to teach to jump on old red baroness yes said terror doubtfully expect shed take lot of teaching dont think shes kind of kid to do much jumping on people oh never know can always try said erebus cheerfully yes said terror warmed by noble resolve moved quietly out of wood be not so difficult matter a may sound to move even encumbered by bicycle about home wood for be not so carefully preserved a wood farther away from grange indeed keeper paid little attention to twin moved out of safely returned home with easy mind did not occur to of that have be treating princess with singular firmness be at troubled about acquisition of peach since curious mental kink prevented from perceiving that law of meum tuum applied to fruit mr dangerfield be presented with only two peach at tea afternoon took that twin have ridden into rowington bought for there when two more be forthcoming for dessert after dinner reproached gently for spending so much of salary for overseering on twin said nothing be only when two more peach came up on breakfast tray that began to suspect that have come by way of warfare not of trade then having already eaten four of be little late to inquire protest moreover if there have be crime twin have admitted to full share in by letting eat fruit of plainly be once more occasion for saying nothing on next afternoon erebus set out with terror to muttle deeping home wood early enough owing to matter of young rabbit who met on way kept

indeed questioned wiggins terror be mindful of fact that lady rowington be always very careful to address a lady rowington not princess be at knoll be thus able to assure with sufficient truthfulness that must not tell where princess be burst of suspicion therefore be brief there be one man in england in whom suspicion have not died down suspicion be indeed hardly word for feeling of sir maurice falconer in matter when first read in morning post of disappearance of princess elizabeth of cassel nassau from muttle deeping grange said confidently to twin again to conviction mind clung be greatly strengthened by study of reproduction of socialist manifesto on front page of enterprising halfpenny paper told that socialist be educated even over educated folk if one of did set to draw skull cross bone drawing must be if not exquisite at rate accurate unsmudged that be highly improbable that socialist must spell desperate with two a in important document without being corrected by confederate on other hand drawing of skull cross bone seemed to to display skill to immature genius of terror might easily have attained while must readily conceive that must spell desperate with two a in document sir maurice be not man to interfere lightly in pleasure of relation must not have interfered at have not be for international situation produced by disappearance of princess a be be so busy with lunch race meeting dinner theater party dance supper that be compelled to postpone intervention till sixth day when socialist organ organization from san francisco eastward to japan be loudly

child wont make easier to catch may a well tell so so may bring here mawley fetched twin ushered into smoking room entered with self possessed air of person quite sure of greeted sir james politely be somewhat taken aback by appearance air for steward have somehow given impression that be thick red faced robustious felt that pleasant looking young gentlefolk must never have really earned unfortunate reputation there must be mistake somewhere twin be on part also far more favorably impressed by than have looked to be lean tanned face with rather large arched nose thin lipped melancholy mouth not at hidden by small clipped mustache keen eye almost a blue a of terror pleased looked uncommonly dependable baronet well what be important matter wished to see about said in more indulgent
