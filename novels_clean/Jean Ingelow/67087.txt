must not have told where have be mopsa said not word for fairy ever interferes with stronger fairy looked on earnestly when white stranger smiled be satisfied then white stranger walked away mopsa fairy sat down on bank under splendid cedar tree beautiful castle looked fairer than ever in afternoon sunshine lovely waterfall tumbled with tinkling noise near at hand bank be covered with beautiful wild flower sat for long while one spoke what be thinking of be not known sweet mopsa often sighed at last noise very very slight noise a of footstep of people running be heard inside rock then little quivering be seen in wand quivered more more a sound increased at last that have looked like door began to shake a if one be pushing from within then noise be distinctly heard a of key turning in hole

through little door of boy must now have be very glad to go back neither liked to speak at last jack thought anything must be le terrible than listening to dismal moan so suddenly dashed through door other jack followed there be nothing terrible to be seen found in place like immensely long stable be nearly dark when eye got used to dimness saw that be strewed with quantity of fresh hay from curious thing like stick stuck up in direction be be dry branch of tree said boy king be table leg turned upside down said jack then other jack suddenly perceived real nature of thing shouted out no

sorrowful eye sun be just touching top of purple mountain when jack lost sight of mopsas home remembered how have penetrated bed of reed in morning hoped to have same good fortune again so on on walked pressing way among a well a must till sun went down behind mountain rosy sky turned gold colour gold began to burn away then on sudden came to edge of reed bed walked out upon rising ground jack ran up looking for castle must not see so climbed far higher hill still must not see at last after toilsome ascent to very top of green mountain saw castle lying so far so very far off that peak battlement be on edge of horizon evening mist rose while be gazing so that outline be lost very soon seemed to mingle with shape of hill forest till have utterly vanished away then threw down on short grass word of white fairy sounded in ear name be jenny burst into tear again decided to go home looked up into rosy sky held out arm called jenny o jenny come in minute two saw little black mark overhead small speck grew larger larger larger still a fell headlong down like stone in instant saw red light green light then heard winnowing noise of bird great wing alighted at foot said here be
