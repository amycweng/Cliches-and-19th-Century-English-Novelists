be picked up by captain graham whose grand daughter think miss graham be old gentleman niece have be staying summer with mr daniel mortimer mr brandon ye will understand be only half brother to valentine mortimer whom ye frequently see valentine be too young to interest grand lady when by combined carelessness of manner with judicious questioning have discovered that so called st george have moderate independence prospect besides felt longing wish to carry down little anastasia to see godfather be hardly restrained from doing so by sense of propriety never forsook in mean time brandon passed out of view into room where breakfast be spread little anastasia so named because birth have taken place on easter day be brought down smiling in sister barbara arm peter little love fair dimpled creature be forthwith accommodated with chair close to godfather while twin withdrew to practise duet more viand be placed on table child then began to wait on father guest during short conversation ensued concerning mr peter melcombe boy be quite silent till pause took place little anastasia lifted up small voice distinguished by saying fader peter dot dhost in darden got ghost exclaimed john mortimer with look of dismay for ghost be last thing wished child to hear anything about yes said youngest boy hugh say be going to be rather grand gentleman when be grown up wish have got ghost then why doe sell asked guest with perfect gravity little fellow opened blue eye wider think know what ghost be remarked oh yes do answered brandon have often read about people think good

mind father dear said eldest child present peter ghost wo come here doe belong to 'grand ' to of name be melcombe came from sea that might know be dead john brandon looked at one information be far too circumstantial to be forgotten by child who continued confidence now without more irreverent interruption mr melcombe gave peter four half crown to give to nurse have to say 'thank nurse for kindness to ' be kind did like peter slapped several time mr melcombe gave more shilling to maria said bertie like garden slug observed brandon leaving trail of silver behind said maria who be little nursemaid now came in to fetch away child be provoking exclaimed john mortimer when be gone have notion that child have be neglected left to pick up pernicious superstition though never liked mother from first moment set eye on why did ask to stay at house then said brandon laughing giles know a well a do thereupon having finished breakfast set forth to walk to town arguing together on subject interested till reached bank behind in comfortable room fitted up with library table chair case for book paper sat old augustus mortimer grand a be always called by descendant that being easier to say than full title of grandfather if john mortimer have not taken brandon into room to see talk about ghost might have faded away altogether from mind of latter a be grand asked after little one brandon standing on rug looking down on fine stern feature white head began to give graphic account of what little peter melcombe have be teaching john mortimer while unlocked desk sorted out certain paper now then adding touch two in mimicry of child little voice old augustus said nothing brandon to great surprise noticed that a narrative went on produced marked effect upon listened with suppressed eagerness then with cogitative air a if be turning thing over in mind conclusion of story how janie have said name of ghost be melcombe john mortimer related for brandon by time be keenly alive to certainty that be disturbing old man much short silence followed john be still arranging paper then father said deliberately be first hint ever received of presence being supposed to haunt place ghost have never produced slightest effect on john mortimer thought of be consequence of tale on mind of child will take care little monkey doe not come here again in hurry remarked at same time proceeding to mend quill pen father watching rather keenly brandon thought from under bushy white eyebrow now of men thought brandon never must have supposed that grand be superstitious believe be what doe mean a there be still silence became so certain that grand must fain ask more question did not like to do so that said in careless tone be child told thereupon being satisfied willing to change subject a brandon thought old man said doe brother dine at home to day st george yes uncle will tell will come over to dinner well dear fellow if be sure will be convenient to have be good while since saw so may will be delighted will tell will stay night yes well done father said john looking up be glad be getting over notion that can not sleep away from home will come over to breakfast st george drive father in do said brandon taking leave a walked to railway be to take home must not help still pondering on effect produced by mention of ghost little supposed however that ghost be at bottom of visit to stepfather be chapter vii old man dig well travel finish fool gay mr peter melcombe unconscious of unfavourable impression son have made on late host continued to think good deal of agreeable widower made peter write from time to time to little janie mortimer report progress of puppy at same time taking care to mention dear mamma in manner that thought must be advantageous cost peter world of trouble to copy recopy epistle till mother be satisfied with always told that must not be remembered so well invited again unless wrote be true little friend wrote in reply by mean such carefully worded letter also favoured with shoal of christmas card shower of valentine letter never got beyond schoolroom if john mortimer keen eye have ever fallen on must have availed nothing must have discovered at once that be not child sole production must have be more decided not to invite again when first mr melcombe came home perceived certain change in laura who be hardly able to attend to peter lesson have fit of elation seemed to alternate with curious kind of shame mr peter melcombe did not doubt that laura fancied have got lover be so tired of laura lover that determined to take notice if laura have anything to say to make say without assistance seemed to so right natural proper that must wish to marry again so ridiculous of laura to fancy that wished to marry also on valentine day however laura have letter flushed high while trying to look careless actually almost wept for joy for moment mr melcombe be thrown off guard asked question laura in triumph handed valentine to sister in law be strange said tremulously very strange what be woman to do when be object of passion be common piece of paper with two coloured figure on taking hand smiling underneath in clear careful hand be written what must give lover true just for one little sight of j j said mr melcombe in questioning tone be joseph dear replied laura hanging down head smiling joseph be head plumber who have be employed about now finished house mr melcombe dismay be great when found that joseph having discovered how young lady thought be in love with be actually taking up part of lover dreaded to think what might occur in consequence joseph be very clever young workman of excellent character laura be intolerably foolish to last degree credulous if young man have be greatest scamp villain in own rank of life must have be nothing to compare with in eye of mr melcombe indeed in most people eye turned pale felt that be stricken woman be not well educated herself have not be accustomed to society aspired to better thing house be just finished have written to mr mortimer to tell so thought of giving house warming for several of family round whose father mother have be kept at arm length by old madam melcombe till child almost forgot that there be such person have now begun kindly to call on lonely lady express wish to see something of also have be rubbing up boarding school french hoped to take trip to paris for wanted to give herself son advantage must be got with money knew there be something provincial about herself sister in law a there have be about old grandmother indeed about melcombes wished to rise oh what must do how must ever get over if laura married plumber distress be such that took only course must have availed be silent be afraid dear might must must think very imprudent said little struck by silence what be to be done amelia be dying for still mr melcombe be silent told that if must have must drive to drink laura exclaimed mr melcombe with vehemence be not credible that can take up with lout who court in such fashion a o laura exclaimed in such distress a to give real pathos to manner little thought to see day must not have believed of burst into agony of tear here be letter presently found voice enough to say here be letter from mr mortimer to say that brother coming to look at house perhaps mr john mortimer will come with oh what will do if hear of laura be very much impressed if scorn anger incredulity have confronted must have held to intention alarm grief at least have merit of allowing importance to affair consequently to imagination conjured up vision of sister in law future year saw always wringing hand be touched for then so happy a meant to be having foreign tour seeing paris so a have talked over together such friend a always be be perfectly true mr melcombe laura be not of nagging order of woman never said sarcastic ill natured thing to one foible of one suited other if have few uncomfortable word now then between have enough esprit de corp to hide from outsider affecting scene took place laura rose threw into amelia arm weeping passionately will give up laura dear for sake for poor dear peter sake who be gone laura must not go quite so far in heroic self sacrifice a did promise solemnly that however many time joseph might say be dying for must what must promise to decide nothing till have be to paris be very happy that morning amelia have not made game of there have be scene laura enjoyed scene amelia have pleaded so hard so long with for promise at last have given if have not be remarkably foolish woman must have known be glad on whole that promise have be extorted from a be thought be sorry after little more urging pleading gave up precious valentine saw devoured by flame have birmingham postmark mr melcombe heard with pleasure joseph must be away at least fortnight laura have wanted little excitement just least amusement if not just least recognition of place in nature a woman young one at present imagination have not be long at work on unpromising payer of tribute if one whose household way daily english be like own have come forward must soon have forgotten joseph for a individual be almost nothing to be only in having paid tribute that power lay late in afternoon mr augustus mortimer arrived be received by mr melcombe almost a seemed with devotion of daughter room be strewed with account book card have be intended that must make remark about then be to say with careless ease only account of parish charity courteously feigning to see none of litter be put out presently went to inspect repair restoration to look over garden stable be not till next morning that found occasion to ask advice of cottage on land be let with farm so that farmer put labourer into charged be true very little rent allowed to get very much out of repair be farmer duty to keep in repair there be agent no one to make do moreover must have that repair worth mentioning be wanted did mr mortimer think if spent money have devoted to charity in repairing cottage must fairly consider that have spent in charity be nice point certainly for must be improving son property avoiding dispute with valuable somewhat unmanageable tenant on other hand must be escaping bad precedent of paying for repair out of estate so went on laying casuistry before old man while pulled down shaggy white brow looked very stern over whole affair of poor old woman do suffer so sadly from rheumatism continued parish doctor say come from damp place live in then there be so much fever in lower part of hamlet have better let see farmer cottager said old augustus will go into whole affair tell what think of accordingly went way among people if have sorrowful reason for being glad of what rendered duty to pick up information must did not make le energetic in fighting farmer very little however must be done with obvious hole in roof must repair rotting door must replace be felt strongly impolicy of taking money out of estate to do whitewashing plastering carpenter work painting be desirable besides be sure water be not pure that people drank that ought to have well when mr melcombe heard report of when acknowledged that must do hardly anything with farmer wished have not asked advice particularly a chose to bring certain religious remark into be indeed most inconveniently religious man religion be of very expensive kind be mixed up with philanthropy a if one must not be religious at without loving whom god loved a if one must not love without serving to best of one power listened with dismay if be useless to expect much of farmer impolitic to take much out of estate be use of talking mr augustus mortimer did talk for several minute first remarked on expressed wish of mother that needful repair must be attended to then said brother began to feel infirmity of age also be poor man then made mr melcombe wince by observing that condition of tenement be perfectly disgraceful next went on to say that being old did not wish to waste time for must have little therefore a be rich be content to do what be wanted house continued be great deal too large for small income son will have very large sum have be spent a will directed in putting into perfect repair be not surprised therefore that have felt perplexed now if have objection will have estimate made at once excessively surprised little humiliated yet on whole conscious that offer relieved of great responsibility mr peter melcombe hesitated moment then said in low voice thank mr mortimer will give little time to think of certainly answered with composure till to morrow morning then went on a if matter be quite settled enough have be said about there be one person whom must much like to point out to a object for charity old shepherd wife who be bedridden if be inclined to provide one to look after oh becky maddison interrupted mr melcombe dear grandmother did not approve of woman used to annoy by telling absurd ghost story indeed still a think ought to do something for certainly will will go see afternoon answered mr augustus mortimer hastily will not fail to report to how find talk be naturally painful to dear grandmother continued mr melcombe mr mortimer looked keenly attentive did not ask question a said more almost immediately withdrew walked straight across field to cottage of old woman nothing more be said that evening concerning repair concerning visit next morning mr mortimer renewed proposition after little modest hesitation accepted then remembering request concerning old becky told have that morning sent blanket soup by bye mr mortimer did tell story used to annoy dear grandmother inquired mr mortimer be so long in answering that looked up at when caught eye answered yes doe like more than mother did thought so said more almost immediately went away to give order about proposed estimate mr melcombe laura made mr mortimer very comfortable when went away left highly pleased for having be told of intended journey to paris have proposed to to come spend few day at house considering first stage of tour so departed more dirt be thrown at tide began to turn in favour of mortimer people have seen mild face venerable gentleness of mortimer who be poor have now handled gold of one be rich old madam be saint observed must come look arter hersen poor dear farmer be allers hard on poor folk so be bent on having well atop o ' hill o ' bottom why let then if liked anyhow there be good in full bucket must be to carry down hill betead of up a to water o ' ould well being foul breeding fever might be then again might not be if folk be to be for ever considering whether water be foul 'd never drink in peace moment be gone mr melcombe turned thought to laura swain excited such hope of pleasure from visit to paris in mind of sister in law that joseph devotion began to be le fascinating to besides there be something inexpressibly sweet to imaginative mind in notion of being thwarted watched pictured to herself fine young man haunting lonely glen hoping to catch sight of smiting brow a men do in novel sighing groaning over lowly birth slender mean wished joseph must write that sister in law might rob of letter joseph did write knew better at end of fortnight appeared coming to church sitting in full view of lady looking not so well in shining sunday clothes of birmingham make a have done in ordinary working suit laura be good deal out of countenance mr melcombe perceived not without surprise that while felt nothing feminine exultation in being admired young man homage be deep real nothing be either fancied feigned so by monday morning mr melcombe have got ready delightful plan to lay before laura actually offered to take to london fired imagination with account of concert theatre that be to do see mortal plumber must hold own against sister in law laura let be carried off without having interview with joseph who began to think be bad job did not know how supposed faithless lady wept during railway journey then did not know how completely when went to first oratorio be delighted consoled longer stayed in more delighted be so be peter polytechnic alone be worth joy of country put together when came back again at end of april land be full of singing bird tree be in blossom sweet smiling landscape looked so full of light be so fresh still then now absent joseph got hold of laura imagination again went gazed at window that have be glazing when a passed lifted up fine eye looked at in such particular manner what really have taken place be joseph with lump of putty in palm be just about to dig bit out of with knife that held in other hand laura passed when young man looked up affected to feel confused turned away face with sort of ridiculous self consciousness joseph be surprised knife held suspended in hand be staring at when glanced again naturally be little put out of countenance so laura now walked about place recalled romantic past if joseph have appeared did not because have mean of knowing that have returned be highly doubtful whether laura must ever have seen paris a be with sigh smile with regret over dead nosegay that young man have given with eager longing to see paris perhaps geneva laura spent next fortnight then taking leave of melcombe again be received in due time by mr augustus mortimer on step of house son being with be nearly dinner time sister in law be delighted to meet gentleman find that be going to dine day with father peter too be

have not yet decided to accept brother there be likelihood that must a time went on however felt happy in consciousness that absence be doing work upon that change have refreshed mind be beginning to forget when woman whom one love be to marry one brother that brother happens to be of family one whom one prefers what quality can be so admirable a inconstancy still for man who be really forgetting argued matter too much in mind even when got far south among florida key saw legion of heron ibis stalking with stately gait along wet sand now then thrusting in javelin bill spiking bringing out long wriggling flash of silver went alive down throat must still be thinking over yes be forgetting began to be in better spirit be in very good spirit one day in january when quite unknown to snow be shovelled away from corner of quiet churchyard in mother slept room be made beside for old man who have loved a own old daniel mortimer have such following a have attended funeral of mother such peaceful sunshine sleeping on landscape blossom growth wind raged snow whirled about grave in coffin be white before first clod of earth be thrown on mourner be driven out of churchyard when solemn

not what must have done brandon laid letter down took moment for thought before must make up mind to read through crime deep disgrace perceived be about to be confided to with hurried sense of dislike shrinking from acquaintance with wondered whether own late mother have known anything of then whether be there called upon to divulge now to act if not argued with why be to be confided to then addressed to task read letter through coming to last word only to be still more surprised a perceived plainly that beyond what must gather from two short sentence already quoted nothing be confided confessed nothing at only request be made to very urgently solemnly concerned not young brother valentine for not content with repudiating family property for old father be desirous be evident through step son to stand in way bar own son very remote chance of inheriting thing be very unexpected moderately strange meet with wide opened eye with start perhaps exclamation thing more than strange utterly unaccounted for quite unreasonable last thing one must have supposed possible a coming from person who demanded be met in far quieter fashion brandon leaned back in chair slowly looked about be conscious that be drawing deeper breath than usual that heart beat quickly be so much surprised that for moment thought appeared to scatter about knew not how to marshal make help a to what might mean mystery in romance in tale be such common vulgar thing in tragedy even in comedy be so completely what demand expect that seldom consider what astonishing very uncommon thing be when appears in life here in commonplace well conducted happy united family be mystery pointing to something that one of best loved member have never have hint of whatever be concerned place little more than fifty mile off man in whose presence have lived from early childhood utmost caution of secrecy be demanded matter spoken of entirely changed notion have always held concerning step father whom have thought knew better than man living when one have believed that one absolutely understood how startle mind to discover that be mistake beautiful old man have be pious not very worldly wise having sweetness of nature sunny smile native ease about must not have be possible without quiet conscience have possessed forbade mother to leave property to step son turned back page looked at word again then eye fell lower in case know not what must have done when did forbid be ten year ago twenty year fifty year be really very well off when married mother now where did get property that lost by speculation not by law profession never brought in more than two hundred year oh have from old cousin that grand often talk of old john mortimer be where old silver plate came from of course where john got name always knew think that there be aged mother now why did take for granted that must be in second childhood wonder whether john put that into head think did remark to once when be boy be living at home that be odd there be portrait of in of house more there be of grand now come to think of john never must make sit before dear old man got so infirm used generally to go out about once year come back in low spirit not liking to be questioned may have gone then to see mother know sister used to think went to see relation of wretched woman first wife who will say now then sat down thought thought nothing came of thinking peter melcombe so far a knew be perfectly well that be comfort valentine be very docile that be also comfort considering that what father have wished for nearly four year ago be actually coming to pas everything be in train for going to one of very best healthiest of colony there seemed little danger that even if melcombe fell to must find putting from great act of self denial what strange thing be brandon thought through force of circumstance must have be made to bring about such unlikely thing so young man must want to marry be strange enough be more strange that must have fixed on only woman in world that brother wanted said brother have thought very climax of be strange that must have devolved on who have command of money who knew colony to make early marriage possible surely climax of strangeness be rather here that have time be working a if on purpose to bring about longing desire of old step father till then have never heard of depriving valentine a much a be possible of freedom shutting up to course father wanted to follow preparing to send a far a in world must be sent from dreaded precinct of melcombe brandon have devoted out of moderate patrimony thousand pound to step brother step sister in case of valentine have done more have in recent visit to new zealand bought land with dwelling house on to place be arranged that immediately on marriage valentine must sail brandon felt strong desire to go look at melcombe for step father conduct with regard to kept coming back to mind with ever fresh surprise though searched memory must yield nothing not hint not look from one threw least light on letter that there be crime at core of deep disgrace soliloquized appears to most evident take assurance in fullest meaning that have nothing to do with next morning having slept over content of letter went to upper room locked in read again then after pausing while to reconsider went up to wall to look at likeness of dorothea graham valentine have photographing machine have filled house with portrait of beloved be supposed to be one of best lucky enough that have sense to leave behind thought brandon yes sweet thing be by mean breaking heart now about love for boy be sure to marry have faithful heart so best thing for will be to let marry a soon a possible will tell so a walk to john mortimer to day will tell may do a soon a like accordingly a about six o'clock valentine walked through wood across common then over field brandon began to make remark concerning frequent letter passed between youthful lover be not to be supposed observed that lady must correspond with thus for year if have not fully made up mind to accept in end answered valentine with perfect confidence know that promised father to wait few month more before decidedly engaged for promise be to have have answer from half year ago brandon fully believed that dorothea graham loved brother that happiness be in own hand have found easy to put possibility of early marriage in valentine way nothing must well go forward without sanction since return have hitherto felt that word must give be too difficult for to say now however that remarkable letter cutting in across usual current of thought have thrown back for awhile so that dorothea seemed le real le dear le present to difficult word be about to be said if know why speak wait there certainly be understanding between amount almost to same thing yes said valentine in august a know will ask again then said brandon almost taking valentine breath away with sudden delight think old fellow that when have once said 'yes have better make short work with engagement will never be more ready to marry than be now be few month older than john be when went did here be with house in new zealand ready built garden planted flock of sheep bought there be to do be to turn out people now taking care of place a soon a be ready to come in brandon be standing on little plank bridged stream about two foot wide have turned to say for valentine be behind valentine received communication first with silence then with shout of triumph after ran completely round brother several time jumping over stream flourishing great stick that held with boyish ecstasy not at dignified very sincere when have made at least three complete circle jumped stream six time giles gravely walked on valentine presently followed wiping forehead nobody must have expressed own sentiment in more charming english exclaimed never heard such grammar in life what brick be st george giles have great faith in theory that absence always cured love also in belief that be cured half forgotten at moment experienced sharp pang however be not very like forgetfulness valentine converted almost into self scorn when said know giles always did show most undisguised liking for from first meeting then look how constant have be what beautiful letter writes always trying too to improve of course can not even pretend to think must not have engaged to month ago if might have asked true perfectly true thought to love love believe if have never met with valentine must still never have married what fool be why must take view of thing yesterday when tried to make asked valentine be not ready for answered giles be not ready for thereupon passed through wicket gate into kind of glen wilderness at end of john mortimer garden beyond stream where little girl acted nausicaa little boy have preserve of minute fish ingeniously fenced in with stick fine netting there be grand exclaimed valentine have brought out to look at water snail what venerable old boy be look quite holy doe hold tongue said brandon will hear be come to see newt have lot yesterday at bottom of punt little hugh have one in hand beast with orange breast be squinting up at must be hard to say of man that be never right if be always thinking that have forgotten certain lady surely be right sometimes went in to dinner party of four for john mortimer since wife death did not entertain lady miss christie grant always presided at early dinner when governess child dined a dinner advanced st george valentine got into high spirit former because stronger conviction than usual assured that be forgetting dorothea graham latter because instead of being pulled back have at last got shove in other direction in short valentine be so happy in joke so full of fun that servant have sooner withdrawn than john mortimer taxed with having good reason for being so mentioned probable cause asked to see miss graham portrait doubt said have got in pocket why have have that for year said valentine scornfully dozen of said brandon took when be to be asked old grand with great interest exactly know uncle even giles doe know that

have almost forgotten other dead brother also a evidently being preface to larger gift than have anticipated thank uncle said valentine almost accomplishing blush of pride pleasure a be so kind a to let choose must like present in money in pocket know because there be tour must go towards that in pocket exclaimed john mortimer with laugh of such amusement raillery a almost put valentine out of countenance why do think father want to give school boy tip think good deal depends on lady said grand who also seemed amused if have fortune might be wise to settle on if have might wish to lay out in more land to invest here giles must consider mean to give two thousand pound then when saw that valentine be silent from astonishment went on if dear father have be here must not have be at surprised many circumstance with be not acquainted assure of consider owe everything to there be certain sternness about word must have be evident discussion john mortimer heard father say with surprise must mean that owes religious view to uncle be thought to brandon who did not trouble about last word others be full of meaning amount of gift together with hint at circumstance with

cheerful heart went to sea side with mr henfrey valentine very soon wrote home to miss christie grant dorothea have joined that long talked of offer have be made of course accepted that giles be come did not add that giles have utterly lost heart again to brother bride elect that must not have done if have known miss christie be wroth on occasion be just shameful remarked everybody knew miss graham must accept why ca say how be when be be worse than mother 'dear aunt ' mother wrote to `` m going to marry mr mortimer on saturday week hope will come to wedding be not to wear blue gown affectionate niece emily grant ' be word said 'd never heard there be anything between mr mortimer before why be not to wear blue gown inquired john mortimer well replied miss christie deny that if

mortimer came home from school for long holiday friend excited more noise bustle commotion in house than other child put together john mortimer eldest son always called johnnie to distinguish from father be ridiculously big for age portentously clever keen witted awkward blunt rude full of fun extremely fond of father exceedingly unlike in person hair be nearly black forehead be square high hand foot almost rivalled of parent in size height be five foot three in other eye than of fond parent must have appeared a awkward noisy plain intolerably active boy father who almost from infancy have pleased with mental picture of manner of man must probably grow into saw nothing of merely added in mind two inch to height of future companion be to find in wished that boy must get over lisp still disfigured of word brought surprising account of merit with how must learn anything pleased how never forgot anything how in fact master a regarded lesson have not fault to find with that when twin sister have seen there seemed to something strange in being a fond of tart lollipop a ever a for john nothing surprised miss christie saw great diversity in child in regard to showed aggravating degree of contentment with what providence have sent miss christie wore through johnnie sojourn at home a well a must be very happy when saw off to school again happier still when walking towards home across field with john mortimer four younger child saw brandon valentine at distance coming to meet so be at home again exclaimed now will hear about wedding be to be have be just wearying for parteeculars there never be such bad letter writer a girl anyhow there will be handsome bridegroom ah said john mortimer lady admire val be quite woman man well st george be man man then retorted miss christie ye admire be sure what be papa dearest asked janie who have hold of hand be own man little queen regnant answered father with somewhat exultant laugh ay mr mortimer be just surprised at ye miss christie shaking head over vainglorious word think father most beautifullest man of said little janie with sort of jealous feeling a if somehow have be disparaged though did not exactly know how goodest too presently added a if not satisfied with first tribute to valentine who be seldom out of countenance on occasion received congratulation of party with certain rather becoming pride complacency seemed however to be taking thing very easily presently became rather silent john who felt keenly that brandon be not so indifferent to bride elect a wished to be turned conversation a soon a must to other matter there be talk about valentine land have be bought for in new zealand after brandon said suddenly john when fellow be gone perhaps before mean to have something to do regular work think of taking to literature in good earnest right answered john a evidently intend to question will ask first whether giles brandon mean to write on subject that understand on one know nothing about brandon laughed there be more to be said in favour of last than think answered may be that there be everything to be said if practise put name to work be will not do so in case how do know whether only use people may make of that metaphorical one may not be to throw at ever after like said miss christie must wish man must own own remarked john mortimer if man in youth writes foolish book give name to have so far a name be concerned used one chance if in maturer life writes something high good then if want wise child to live must consent to die with foolish one be much same with one who have become notorious through doing of base foolish action if repent rise to better thing write noble book must not claim a if must elevate must go forth on own merit will not be recognised for what be only for what be be if man want to bring in new thought work elevating change must not clog with name have be despised think dorothea may a well write book together said valentine did begin one somehow stuck fast have better write about yourselves then said john that being nearly study just now must think many novel contains author little else explains in trying to describe human nature human nature exclaimed valentine must have something grander than to write of can tell have read so many book that turn 'the seamy side outward point out join a if be glove that can not condescend to said john setting off on subject again a if be most seriously considering valentine meanwhile smiling significantly on others be mistake to describe too much from within external life a see must rather be given about a much of motif spring of action a intelligent man with good opportunity must discover want to be told know about live with always have lived with if ever took to writing fiction must not pretend to know about character author world appears small if make manifest that reign there understand thoroughly how can understand so many other people can not fathom own child often surprise if believed thoroughly in child of pen must write down sometimes in fashion have not intended john talk like book observed valentine propose subject lay forth view a if have considered for week on samivel ' agree with said miss christie when read book aye dislike to be left in doubt what man mean what story mean always think great proof of power in writer said brandon when consciously unconsciously make reader feel that know vast deal more about character than have chosen to tell what keen sense have of reality of invented men woman so much so that may occasionally see evident token that be jealous of can not bear to put witty clever speech into mouth of 'fetches of own imagination must be saved up to edge in a sly aside sage reflection of author own there never must be author aside know about john answered often feel offended with author who lack imagination to see that group of own creation must not look in one eye just what look in own author pretty woman be too often pretty to wit be acknowledged a wit by difference of opinion come from reader differ certainly even observed valentine if be author wit might be voted bore how sad must be for in real life be only right to testify find little difference of opinion spoke in melancholy tone heaved up sigh be cousin val wit asked little hugh be afraid be said valentine be always saying so be very unkind of to talk about because must help must here little anastasia touched with pity by heartfelt pathos of tone put dimpled hand in said tenderly never mind dear will be better soon p'raps did do on purpose doe hurt asked hugh also full of ruth be ashamed of whispered miss christie to work on dear child feeling so sweet mannie doe hurt bit be very much to be pitied proceeded valentine be all sighed again be born with bad french accent without single tooth in head out of while such be weakness that took two strong men master of art to drag through rudiment of latin grammar anastasia eye filled with tear seemed so sad tender little heart have not gone yet into question of seeming teached latin grammar did said bertram who have also be listening be relieved to hear of something in list of misery that must understand be what miss crampton teach like did either then be six three quarter how old be before valentine have answered john brandon finding before party have stopped turned brandon be surprised to see how earnestly two elder child while talked have be looking at then at father valentine at last when pause occurred two group met janie said be sure papa be great deal prettier than mr brandon cousin val look quite ugly beside yes janie said bertram with air of high satisfaction papa much more beautiful than of others will ask miss crampton when go in if doe think so must like to know what think must father john have opened mouth to say when better sense coming to aid forbore to speak for lady taught child to perfection friend always must insist that wanted to teach too something that must learn aunt christie constant friend champion presently spoke for child said a soon a have composed voice to due gravity be natural ye must admire father good child generally do now if be must never tell anybody at not even miss crampton do ye hear of must never tell anybody opinion of if ye do will certainly think ye highly conceited for ye know quite well that people say four little one be just a exactly like a ye can be child be evidently impressed in fact said valentine now take good look at must say that be even more like than be may be mistaken wo say then said bertram now quite convinced wo wo added others a ran forward to open grate cheer up john said st george let not see so much beauty virtue cast down there be miss crampton looking out of school room window though laughed did not deceive john mortimer who knew a well a possible that loss of dorothea graham pressed heavily on heart two be going to dine with of course said when party have passed into wilderness beyond garden on contrary with leave answered valentine be going to take lesson of swan in art of budding rose can not manage to mind dined early suppose will agree with val observed brandon that rose garden be one of necessary of life dorothea must have one must out in new zealand well swan will be proud to teach anything know doe know will give opinion if ask on subject accordingly john went into house to dine perhaps be in consequence of assertion that two young men asked old friend opinion on various point not at in line valentine even told that brother intended to write book asked what thought have better be about whereupon swan while deftly shaping bud shook head gravely said that wanted deal of thinking over if be sir continued speaking to brandon must get mr mortimer mr john to help specially if there be going to be foreign talk in word believe there be language going that mr mortimer ca lay tongue to chapter xi wanted desert island too have autumn when leaf drop loosely through dampened air when good seems bound in sheaf stand reaped bare lowell laura mr melcombe went home laura saw window again that joseph have so skilfully glazed joseph be not there laura must not have occupied with constant thought about if there have be anything rather anybody else to think of soon began to feel low spirited restless while like potato plant in dark cellar put forth long runner towards light light be to be found homely simile ought to be forgiven because be such good one peter be getting too old for teaching have tutor tutor be married man have taken lodging for wife in one of farm house laura have career before worthy occupation came to pas in day be short saunter drive visit to market town where sat looking on while sister in law did shopping melcombe be six seven mile from visitable family excepting two three clergyman wife be shut up in three cornered nook of land must not be approached excepting through turn pike up down specially steep hill thing make havoc with country sociability a long a there have be plenty to do see laura have enjoyed life on continent have fed with hope so many people a passed before must be strange thought if not one of have be made for not one be to give love wanted devotion knew must return be certainly strange yet came to pas though travelled fool returned improved in style dress even in appearance while conversation be naturally more amusing than before for have seen most place thing people like to talk of not one man have asked to spend life with came back more given to flight of fancy than ever far better acquainted with more humble for have spent so much of time in imagination with joseph that have become accustomed to slightly provincial accent have ceased to care about joseph however did not speak like good father have be endowed with a much learning a must consent to acquire swan having felt great ambition to make certified schoolmaster joseph having be at early age rather idle young dog have tormented father into letting take to mere handicraft have left school writing hand almost like copperplate being very fair accountant without thirst for knowledge without worthy ambition laura have always known that nothing desert island be wanted must be contented wife desert island be not to be have such thing be getting rare in world now thought that remote locality where nobody knew must do where be joseph have certainly gone away without giving interview have persistently kept away yet though be doing what must by fit start to forget that perverse imagination of hers always pictured a waiting constant ready there be particular tree in glen behind have so frequently represented to a standing patiently while approached with furtive step that when came home went to look at there be feeling almost akin to surprise in mind at seeing place drenched in sparkling dew overgrown with moss footstep be feigned never tread anything down leave print excepting in heart feigns when laura saw place in glen perceived plainly that there be one with whom might be humbly happy poor not even plumber form of human sorrow certainly one of worst be not half enough pitied by happy of course laura be fool nobody claim for that be not fool be not rare male female a arrange world way in great measure be odd that understand one better whether laura showed folly most least in thinking that must have be obscurely happy a wife of man who belonged to different class of life from own having small intellectual endowment little culture be subject too vast too overwhelming for decision here ought to have treatise in twelve volume to mr melcombe have come home also somewhat improved good deal disappointed have fully hoped intended to marry again because son who be to live to be old must wish to marry early future daughter in law must be mistress of house be desirable therefore that peter mother must not be dependent on for home have twice be invited while on continent to change name in case must have be in worldly point of view very much to disadvantage be specie of second marriage that by mean contemplated did not want second husband to take that might nurse in old age fast approaching that might live upon income so came home mr melcombe continued to be kind to laura though did not sympathize with be fault of hers sympathy be much more intellectual than moral endowment however kind dull stupid people may be can rarely sympathize with trouble unless have gone through one just like may hear said ah can sympathize with poor fellow for have wooden leg yes being widow know what widow feeling be so on one have right to blame people be a kind a be not fault that be living among to whom experience at be necessary who not only must sympathize do in thought with very angel that never fell when consider what must be to if mortal child have to watch go wrong with poor weak drunkard who wish must keep sober feel when must fain pas by that gin shop like devil fish sends forth long tentacle ruthlessly suck in with mother whale when wilful young one insists on swimming up fiord who have risked life to warn must hear thud of harpoon in side with old tired horse when fetch in from sober reverie in field put blinker on with anything else yes with bluebell whose life above ground be so short when wasteful child tread down feel something one must fain save from so perhaps doe rose tree also when careless boy go by whooping in joy of heart whip off bud with cane fruitful sympathy must doubtless have likeness of nature also certain kindliness to found on come more from penetrative keenness of observation from patient investigation of thought from vivid intuition wait on imagination from good memory can live over again in circumstance be changed from intelligent possession of whole of one foregone life make impossible to ignore power of great emotion passion merely because be past where quality be there must be for there can be sympathy mr melcombe be fond of one child have forgotten what own nature thought fear wish a well a joy have be in childhood in like manner a be on whole contented not only thought that own example ought to make laura contented frequently pointed out to child be to father mother who imparted life to who see youth most excellent consolation that nature can afford for loss of own youth for shortness of life in if mother be therefore convinced that child be consoler to who have none be sure at time other to be considered unmitigated bore mr melcombe often thought laura have child with constantly to amuse have none of responsibility about have laura go to shop with see give order frequently even consult go with into garden see interest take in wall fruit new asparagus bed yet never take example by will eat just a many of thing a will though often follows about place looking a if scarcely cared for at laura be pleased however to go to wigfield stay with grand have for

girl liz took manner of pain to improve more than laura did laura be full of uneasy little affectation capricious change of manner shyness liz be absolutely simple a confiding a child only useful thing girl did while stayed with grand be to go into town twice week devote couple of hour to coal clothing club setting down saving of poor keeping book bi weekly visit have consequence a regarded one of be one who did not care what happened parted at end of visit having become good deal attached to other intending to correspond a fully frequently a be manner of girl intelligent mind may be

temper said be old adam be strong in still ' chapter xii valentine if have known where be going to fall must have put down straw russian proverb laura wrote with difficulty answer to lizzy grant letter be easier for sister to say brother be dishonourable young fellow have behaved shamefully than for friend to answer without offence quite agree with next letter made matter in degree easier for at least showed direction that family gave to excuse now offered for behaviour of young scapegrace first have be very unwell in london almost seriously unwell next lizzy said have be quite right a to st george love for dorothea for have made offer before left house in fact continued liz have decided so far a can to overlook what val have done for be deeply attached to girl who without fault of own have supplanted dorothea be already engaged to if be allowed to marry early in spring sail for new zealand be not likely ever to return at rate will not for very many year in case know laura will only be with about six week longer so hope friend will forgive for forgiving be fond of be fact observed mr melcombe to be sure other brother wanting to marry miss graham doe seem to make difference excuse a to illness think much of remember when old father came here to funeral remarked that valentine looked overgrown not strong mr mortimer said have be very delicate youth often have cough far more delicate in fact than son be have outgrown enjoyed very fair health for many year then laura went on reading besides think that though dorothea refused st george point blank when made offer yet must hardly write to week a doe if did not like must hardly be so very silent reserved about yet evidently in such good spirit if did not think that something in end must come of said mr melcombe laughing in cynical spirit ridiculous scrape be in doe not end with valentine if be really ill there must be thought of marriage with other girl besides miss graham if be true will have far best of two brother st george a be so fond of calling suppose because giles be such ugly name be far better off than valentine have ten time more sense dorothea be gone to isle of wight continued laura finishing letter to live with old friend have relative poor girl excepting father who be somewhere at other end of world seems to take very little notice of there be indeed old uncle life at sea be almost always at sea in yacht only brother sail with nobody know in least where be now be very sad for told st george sister too that have only loved val out of gratitude because seemed so much attached to because wanted somebody to devote to in next letter liz told laura that be to be married shortly to dick a'court who say fell in love with when two used to add up coal clothing card in word in more information be imparted rest of letter be so stiff formal that laura pleasure in correspondence ended with reality of life be beginning to make child friend feel sober reticent laura wrote long effusive letter in reply full of tender congratulation on high lot that awaited liz a helpmeet of devoted clergyman also on joy of happy lover composition did not touch feeling of liz in right place just a if have not told thought that emily be come home from india have consented to accept dick partly to please because be sure must be sorry for afterwards if did so dare say must have be continued thoughtfully in fact be almost sure of know very well whatever emily may say that dick will make do just a like be sure will have to practise quire boy of will bawl in ear call so thinking liz allowed to drift towards matrimony without enthusiasm with general notion that a most people be married sooner later doubt matrimony be proper thing best thing on whole will certainly go through with now have promised further reflected for must never do for of to behave badly just at last be last week in march laura be loitering through garden one morning before breakfast when mr melcombe came out to in excitement with note in hand have be sent on from inn set forth that mr brandon having business in immediate neighbourhood must if agreeable to do pleasure of calling time that morning added that have brought book for miss melcombe from sister have sent to inn said mr melcombe to beg that will come on here to breakfast laura have be gathering bunch of violet rushed up stair put into hair then in great hurry changed toilette after ascertaining that guest have arrived came languidly into breakfast room straw hat hanging by string from arm filled with primrose other flower felt a approached that looked quite romantic did not look so real so unpremeditated a might have be wished mr melcombe have also changed array little peter like most other child be always picture of cleanly neatness when first left nurse hand in morning mother be much pleased at evident interest with guest regarded asking various question about lesson sport pony have be deeply gratified at kind way in mortimer connection have received boy none of seemed at jealous even valentine have never hinted even looked at a if felt that property ought not to have gone to younger branch peter now ten year old small boy for age have average degree of intelligence a sat winking blinking in morning sunshine constantly shook back lock of hair fell over forehead till brandon quietly putting hand to moved away while boy related childish adventure that have encouraged to talk of looked at with scrutinizing a seemed to mother with almost anxious attention peter have be very poorly several time winter remarked mean shortly to take out for change of air forehead look pale said brandon withdrawing hand for minute two seemed lost in thought till mr melcombe expressing hope that must stay at house a long a affair detained in neighbourhood accepted invitation with great readiness must spend day next with if must permit must walk with young hopeful to tutor house come back again in time for luncheon declare scarcely spoke to breakfast time thought laura consider decidedly proud man one might think have come to see peter rather than to see brandon evidently did wish to walk with boy accordingly rose a soon a have finished breakfast mr melcombe giving direction key to let in with by side gate intelligence brandon possessed keenness of observation exercised during walk with little heir must generally attract child peter be already well inclined toward for have shown to be knowing about country boy pleasure also knew about little mortimer doings brandon wished to see melcombe even to examine part of house ground wanted if possible to hear something more about ghost story did not suit to betray special interest so left to work way to surface if must be not business have come about have undertaken to transact on purpose because gave chance of looking at place be deep glen then that have heard valentine speak of yes mother say old uncle mortimer that one who lived at wigfield improved so much have so many tree thinned out pond dug where there used to be swamp have got carp in pond do think if fed must get tame brandon told anecdote of certain carp that have seen abroad then asked do like glen boy be favourite place of yours pretty well answered peter there be not so many nest though a there used to be used to be quite dark with tree did like then yes be jolly what asked brandon carelessly grandmother did like said boy brandon longed to ask why be very old grandmother yes so did like glen old uncle have have walk sort of path made through mamma say may like a much a please so doe aunt laura know continued child in argumentative tone there be place in world where somebody have died now what doe mean thought brandon must fain raise ghost if must be coming up now be not presently however peter made allusion to family misfortune death of eldest son by brandon perceived that have taken place in glen then dropped subject nothing more be said till few minute before reached tutor lodging being of least interest then a turned edge of wood peter looked back wo forget turn of lane be to take will mr brandon have got key yes said brandon be green sort of door in park paling new one have be made because one be so shabby be one uncle went through when ran away know what uncle asked brandon not at suspecting truth not much interested why one who belonged to said peter other one who belongs to bertie hugh did know exclaimed having observed momentary flash of surprise that brandon made haste to conceal ran away repeated a brandon walked beside making answer very long time before mamma be born never came back more till be nearly six year old so be tutor house be said brandon thereupon took leave of amazing said to a walked away what next wonder a returned revolved information in mind with increasing surprise john mortimer have proud confident way of talking about father did not sound a if knew that have begun life by running away from home valentine be well aware knew nothing about coming on turned aside to talk to men who be digging well knew how to talk to working people what be more to purpose knew how to make talk though proffered good deal of information about neighbourhood nothing be said that gave of knowledge wanted shortly went on let in at little gate with key be not yet eleven o'clock a did not want to see lady of family so soon determined to go down into steep glen look about have doubt now to place superstitious story belonged first skirted about from above be nearly a round a cup a deep in proportion to size large old tree

topmost twig there be great cawing crowing of cock bird while flew about fed mate leaf be not out bud only looked like green egg spotting tree excepting that here there horse chestnut forwarder than brother be pushing crumpled foliage out of pale pink sheath everywhere sapling have be cut down number of strewed damp mossy ground light penetrated water trinkled there be pleasant scent of herb flower whole place be cheerful with growth spring set of winding step cut in soft red rock led into glen just where side be steepest brandon intent on discovery sprang lightly down wandered almost everywhere about place seemed to hold within different climate from world above where keen spring air be stirring here hardly breath moved in soft sheltered warmth leaf appeared visibly to be expanding forgot object also object that have in view business in fact have brought leaned against trunk of horse chestnut listened to missel thrush looked at pine tree little way off be letting down mist of golden dust presently lost in reverie finding a be way with lover that scene present whatever may happen to be be helping to master everyday self be indeed just scene to send plunging yet further down into depth of passionate dream have stood leaning against tree with hat at foot arm folded for perhaps hour have inherited world with ideal companion have become absorbed into lifetime of hope love appeared to grow without let hindrance in growing freshness glorious expansion of spring hour of hope joy console for much foregone trouble further satisfies heart by making easier thing to believe in more yet to come sudden exclamation little crash roused laura have come to visit favourite tree lo man there at last leaning against lost in thought so absolutely still that have not noticed knew in instant that be not joseph yet a sight of flashed on sense before recognition nothingness always found gave way to feeling a of something real that almost might have be right thing a for though saw flitting figure did not for twinkling of eye pas for ghost have come to look for roused up in instant whew be inward thought be alone what must be so lucky will do business at once get over picking up hat sinking at step into soft cushion of moss accordingly approached said perhaps just little coldly did not expect to see here miss melcombe laura perceived slight tinge of coldness a plainly a did improvement in appearance since have first seen in morning for surprise at detecting have overpowered affectation have coloured from having be startled while from habit moved on mechanically to tree answered quite simply naturally that walked way almost day brandon turned walked with opposite to said tree very near be under stood bench laura sat down while pointing out spot where certain heron have built platform like nest began to recover rather to put on damaging affectation in moment of forgetfulness have thrown off brandon did not sit beside while arranged dress to mind threw plaid shawl into becoming fold laying hand on bracelet furtively drew ornament upon to upper side looked at thought what goose be wore straw hat with so wide brim a stood before did not see face be not sorry for be not business to reprove what have to say must supposed put good deal out of countenance be just about to speak laura be in full enjoyment of feeling how romantic be to be there alone with young man be just wishing that of friend must be looking down from above to see interesting picture draw certain conclusion when decidedly sharp voice called out from behind laura what can be doing here know like to be for ever coming to tree laura yes be here said laura mr melcombe arrayed in blue poplin stepped into view made brandon feel very foolish laura very cross oh have brought mr brandon here to see carp said amelia graciously hardly knew what to think presently went to pond watched creature flashing up golden side wondering time what two others be thinking of then

other people chapter xvi wearing willow lord sebastian truth speak lack gentleness time to speak in rub sore when must bring plaster tempest when john mortimer reached banking house next morning found valentine waiting for in private sitting room thought uncle must hardly be coming so early john said that perhaps must spare few minute to talk thing over to be sure said john looking more directly at valentine noticed air of depression gloom seemed rather too deep to be laid to account of true blue be stooping a sat slightly swinging hat by brim between knee have reddened at first with sullen half defiant expression soon faded biting lip brought with evident effort to say well john have done for see giles have married serf right quite right have nothing to say against devoutly hope have not exclaimed john to whom unlucky situation became evident in instant grand always have done justice to take part a regard conduct about hateful second engagement always knew must have married poor lucy if must have let married made best of frightful shameful mistake a know mr nelson lucy mother made return letter month ago said must be broken off unless must let go dragging on on for two year at least be impossible know john because because so soon found out what 'd done wait minute dear fellow john interrupted hastily have said nothing yet what express very natural feeling remark in reply that regret at what have long seen to be unworthy conduct need no longer disturb on lady account having now married somebody else yes said valentine sighing restlessly john went on looking intently at on own account think need not at regret that have chance of going humbly offering to again for feel certain that must have considered insulting to suppose must possibly overlook such slight let speak plainly say that must have regarded thing in other light then giving time to think over word evidently impressed john presently went on must be ridiculous however now for dorothea to resent former conduct st george of course will be quite friendly towards may depend upon that will very soon appear a natural a possible will soon forget former relation towards brother wife in fact must valentine be silent awhile when did speak said feel sure then that must have thought thing insult meant feel sure then must have have chance even if brother have not come forward perfectly sure answered john with confidence be step from hour made never must have retraced here there be silence then well john if think so said poor fellow be rather sudden blow to though john pitied have made great fool of be smarting for keenly handsome young face be very pale john be helping to recollect better self knew will not allude to more continued be very glad to hear say so said john came partly to say to tell now be better quite well in fact can not live at home longer at home well meant in st george house longer additional knowledge john have that minute acquired of state of valentine feeling what supposed to feel gave more than usual confidence cordiality to answer of course not will be considering now what mean to do father must help in first place there be that two thousand pound have never have shilling of yet father be speaking of yesterday oh answered valentine with evident relief with rather bitter smile thought proposed to give that a wedding present if so goodness know never expect to touch farthing of be a hereafter may be said john leading away from dangerous subject valentine began sentence with restless sigh never chose to mention remarked have right to consider a anything else did doe not regard in such light said john have left to in will decided afterwards to give now know talk of death dear old man a composedly a of to morrow morning be reminding of money other day when be unwell saying that married unmarried must have made over to be very deeply deeply obliged to said valentine with fervour be almost emotion seems john a if must help might get out of scrape for really did not know where to turn have got nothing to do have nothing to live on be two twenty yes do feel a if be altogether in such ignominious position a john quite agreed with in view of position remained silent valentine went on first going to cambridge came to nothing on account of health then month ago a did want to go live out in new zealand by must in fact new zealand place be transferred to liz dick be to go to giles saying that must give thousand pound instead of will not take that of course because will want income for john interrupted valentine proceeding now since left off learning to farm for be use here have got nothing on earth to do have thought of anything yet yes well out with john remarked valentine a shadow of smile flitted across john face always seem to to know what fellow be thinking of perhaps must not like such thing must have john observed that be getting little le gloomy a proceeded whether not that two thousand pound will help to career certainly entirely save from what must not bear to think of knowing be dependent on giles despising for pooh exclaimed john little chafed at talking in way what be st george wife likely to know to care a to how brother in law derives income quite agree with that have business to be dependent on giles have done great deal for sister must now have income for yes said valentine have always be wonderfully united family observed john pointedly there be reason why state of thing must continue yes repeated valentine receiving covert lecture resignedly there be earthly end good bad to be served continued john by showing of irritation gloom on part because brother have chosen to take for what have previously with deliberation thrown away suppose not john said valentine quite humbly then what can be thinking of know have not talked to one a have done to morning certainly not well then decide while game be in own hand that never will so far from being irritated sulky at wigging that john be bestowing on valentine be decidedly better for colour returned to face sat upright in chair then got up stood on rug a if john energy have roused opened eye also to true position want to cover with ridicule do continued john seeing advantage why even if cared to take reason duty honour into question surely only way to save own dignity from utter extinction be to be at least seem to be quite indifferent a to what lady may have chosen to do very glad that brother must have taken step make only fair to that wife must forget former conduct john said valentine acknowledge that be right john have spoken quite a much indeed more in brandon interest than in valentine manner in elder have suffered younger to make agreeable engage to dorothea graham how when believed loved have made possible for to marry be partly known to partly surmised now seemed in mockery of everything be decent becoming fair that one who have forsaken must represent a having waked after short delusion discovered that loved still letting brother know perhaps world such must be painful humiliating position also for bride might even affect happiness of newly married pair john did not wish to hint at graver view of subject be afraid to give too much importance confidently reckoned on valentine volatile disposition to stand friend soon enable to get over attachment seemed wanting be degree of present discretion john acknowledge that be right repeated valentine after interval of thought acknowledge now have probed subject got to bottom of that demand of absolute silence at first discretion yes be settled mean to take view yes do a stood time lost in thought john let alone began to write till thinking have pondered enough looked up alluded to business valentine have come about may a well tell unless want to take father into council also will be here soon thought must be more right if spoke to first john before uncle heard of said valentine because be likely to concern longer asked john yes see what mean must like if uncle must let to go into bank mean a clerk nothing more of course must want time to consider matter said john be half afraid must propose val be so like to take easiest thing that offer be on account on own that will take time on so far a be concerned be career to be banker clerk john though hardly ever think of can not always forget that there be only one life between melcombe very true said john coolly if be ill waiting for dead man shoe what must be waiting for dead child shoe even wish care to be ever more than clerk said valentine that think must fill up time pleasantly between what between time when will have finally decided what will do think eventually will go abroad john knew by time that must very gladly not have valentine with rather under almost unfailing instinct where father be concerned assured that old man must like will speak to father about for said john by mean if like must not be so unfair a let have hint of till have taken time said wanted

to bring other people into father house specially in old age of latter john mortimer be not only confident of own supreme influence be more than commonly attached to father have long be made to feel that on own insight forethought depended almost gave old man pleasure father seldom disturbed existing arrangement though often found comfort from being altered for so john decided to propose to to have brother son to live with in few day therefore wrote to valentine that have made up mind must speak to father for did saw that nephew wish gave decided pleasure when made other proposal be quite

know next said then succumbed be asleep again favourite son natural heir thought valentine quarrel yet not inherit shilling be queer to say least of will go up to london have look at will have told john something other unless thought be abroad then must have be alluding to two perfectly different thing valentine now went to carriage fetched in footman hoping that at sight of uncle might be persuaded to come home be done with so much difficulty that when at last be accomplished valentine sent carriage on to fetch john sat anxiously watching till came medical man with sleep weakness pain disquietude be so at end of week be so at end of fortnight then became evident that sight be failing be not always aware whether not be alone often prayed aloud also sometimes supposed to be recovering where be valentine said one afternoon when john having left to get rest valentine have taken place be alone asked when valentine have spoken to what time be about four o'clock uncle getting dusk snow fall yes heard mention snow when nurse went down to tea be often aware of john presence when can not show tell so yes will be dear good son to yes ought not to make sorrow of removal disturbs sometimes to perceive that doe know where will be paper have never concealed anything from have never cause indeed uncle till now proceeded old augustus valentine looked attentively in failing light at majestic wreck of tall fine old man made out that eye be closed that face have usual immobile untroubled expression last word startled have thought best continued not to leave anything in will said valentine because gave that two thousand pound during lifetime yes dear memory doe not fail john will not be cursed with one guinea of ill gotten wealth valentine yes uncle yes be here be not going away have key of cabinet in library go fetch parcel be in drawer inside let ring then first for one to come for must not be left alone leave say do a tell valentine vexed not able to decline ran down in breathless haste found packet of peculiar sort size usually called banker parcel locked cabinet returned to old man bed be alone asked when valentine have made presence known to let feel that parcel ah father be very dear to owe everything to everything valentine who be not easy a to what must come next replied like honourable man so said uncle when generously gave that two thousand pound ill gotten wealth old augustus murmured never prospers be curse to possessor son john will have none of valentine yes what do think be worst earned money that human finger ever handled question so put suggested one answer thirty piece of silver said valentine ah replied augustus with sigh well thank god none of can match that crime murder have be done murderer have profited by spoil when piece of silver be lying on floor of temple after murderer be dead to whom do think belonged valentine be excessively startled voice seemed higher thinner than usual conversation have begun so sensibly wrinkled hand kept such firm hold still of parcel that surprised to feel a now did that dear old uncle be wandering answered nothing not to priest continued augustus a pause followed valentine felt impelled to reply said belonged to family doubt if have chosen to pick up ah be what suppose if father poor wretch perhaps miserable mother have gone into temple that day must have be strange sight surely to see gather up yes said valentine faintly shadow of something too remote to make substance visible appeared to fall over then causing vague wonder awe revulsion of feeling knew not whether old man be taking leave of sober daylight reason whether fresh sense of worthlessness of earthly wealth more especially ill gotten wealth have come to from sudden remembrance of silver tried gently to lead thought away from what seemed to be troubling for head turned restlessly on pillow have need to think of said kindly quietly for a have just be saying john will inherit nothing well earned property john doe not know of said augustus have drawn out for year by degree a supposed for household expense be in bank of england note month that lived must have become more more uncommonly circumstantial contains seventeen hundred pound take in hand hear yes uncle can not live on very small income have evidently very little notion of value of money john may not agree may not suit to have with on other hand on other hand what be saying that might not suit john to have with yes yes on other hand where be gone on other hand might excite curiosity surprise if left more in will now what be doing for what be daniel son yes dear uncle try to collect thought there be something want to do with money try to tell what be have got in hand yes have keep then use for own purpose thank be sure be what meant be that be that said be not to tell john will tell then asked valentine think must mind having by way of answer to old man actually laughed valentine have thought be long past be joyful laugh almost exultant mind said john attend to desire to have said also be agreed between son that if ever two part company be to give thousand pound tell that may not suppose have anything to do with money in parcel father be everything to continued voice getting fainter speech more confused a went on never expected to see again in world so have come over to see daniel give hand come over to see there be light god have be very good to brother begin to think will call into presence soon valentine started up be really more in order to carry out old man desire so solemnly expressed than from joy of possession that put parcel into pocket before rang for nurse went to fetch john have borne part in last sustained conversation old man ever held day month in just snow storm a have fallen about much loved brother stately white head be laid in grave chapter xxi dead father entreats prospero have done nothing in care of thee of thee dear one tempest valentine rose early morning after funeral john mortimer have left alone in house gone home to child john have regarded impending death of father more a loss misfortune than be common old man besides being constant companion have be very intimate friend rending of tie between be very keenly felt by son nothing perhaps differs more than amount of affection felt by different people there be gauge for language can not convey yet instinctive perception show where be great feel little show little becomingly others feel much reveal scarcely anything on whole men be not deceived get degree of help sympathy be due to valentine have be very thoughtful for john invitation order connected with large funeral have be mainly arranged by afterwards have be present at reading of will have be made to feel that seventeen hundred pound in parcel have not yet opened must signify nothing to son who be to enter on rich inheritance a set forth specified still wished uncle have not kept giving of secret while be dressing detail of last conversation falling snow failing light high thin voice changed yet so much more impressive for change recurred to thought more freshly than ever perhaps because before went down meant to open parcel accordingly did bank of england note be in not line of writing on white paper enfolded turned over then mechanically began to count add up amount seventeen hundred pound neither more le most assuredly own with two thousand pound already possessed sum must independently of exertion of own bring in nearly two hundred year in case of failing health must be enough to live on modestly in england on continent leaned chin on hand with dull contentment looked at thin crisp paper have cared for old uncle very much be exceedingly comfortable with now that be forbidden to mention last gift began to feel though have fretted at first that must make more independent of john why must old father have disliked to excite son surprise curiosity why indeed when have laughed at notion of john being capable of minding doing a pleased valentine pondered over a locked up property be not yet eight o'clock a put out candle have lighted to count note by for march morning be dark heard wheel on going down met john in hall have come in before breakfast hour a have often be custom when meant to breakfast with father john countenance showed certain agitation valentine observing gave quiet matter of fact greeting talked of weather thaw have come on snow be melting rapidly for moment john seemed unable to answer when got into dining room said overtook st george groom have be to house said thinking be there brother sent message rather urgent one note to want seems want want exclaimed valentine what for john shrugged shoulder be ill continued valentine man did not say so valentine read note merely repeated that brother wanted what extraordinary piece of thoughtlessness seemed brandon might have perceived that valentine must be much needed by john that day told yesterday said valentine that there be various thing must like to do for in house to day over at town too so will send word can not go think have better go said john valentine be sure that john must have be glad of company must be easier for man with peculiarly keen feeling not to have to face clerk alone first time after father death must go repeated however st george must never have thought of sending for unless for urgent reason if take dog cart will be in time for breakfast there be at nine horse be not taken out valentine still hesitating john added may a well say now that father removal need make difference in being together a far a be concerned be very well pleased with present arrangement find in aptitude for business affair must by mean have anticipated so if st george want to consult about new plan for hardly think can be case have better hear what have to say before turn out valentine thanked cordially emily have pointedly said to during uncle last illness that in event of change must be pleased if must come live with have made answer because have not thought john must wish connection between to continue now everything be easy dear old uncle have left riding horse book have only to move to emily house so without trouble enter home be not yet nine o'clock when valentine entered dining room in brother house gloom be over sun have burst forth lump of snow shining in dazzle of early sunlight be falling with dull thud from tree while smaller particle dislodged by waft of air dropped with flash a of diamond first mr henfrey came in looked surprised to see valentine wondered have left john have never seen man so overcome at father funeral then giles came in with purple orange crocus laid upon wife plate said nothing about note went fetched dorothea who be also evidently surprised to see valentine how lovely interesting looked in eye that morning so serene object of such watchful solicitude to husband old step sister man may feel interested in now thought valentine excusing to for glow of admiring tenderness filled heart sweet thing oh what fool have be there be little conversation lady be in mourning merely asked few question a to arrangement of late relative affair brandon sat at head of table wife at right hand there be something very cordial in manner evident turning away from mention of having sent for valentine perceiving matter to be private followed lead when breakfast be over went with up stair to long room at top of house library workshop now then exclaimed when at last door be shut be alone suppose may speak what can be old fellow induced to send for at time so peculiarly inconvenient to john be partly something read in newspaper answered giles also also letter letter be left in care by father oh then be to give to after uncle death be for answer giles said there be valentine following eye saw sealed parcel not unlike in shape size to one have already opened that morning be lying on small opened desk take time dear fellow said giles read carefully will come up again soon tell how came into possession thereupon left room valentine very much surprised advanced to table packet be not directed to person outside be written in brandon clear hand read by on rd of july sealed up following morning gb valentine sat down before broke brother seal took out large letter seal of father have already be broken be addressed in father handwriting giles brandon esq wigfield house be never so well inclined to believe in stroke of good fortune a when one have just be dealt to valentine be almost sure be going to read of something must prove to be to advantage uncle have behaved so strangely in providing with last bounty that be difficult for not to connect letter with gift something might have be made over to father on behalf with thought in mind unfolded sheet of foolscap read a follows much loved son will see by date of letter dearest boy valentine be between seventeen eighteen year of age when write perceive possible peril for brother being old there be one to whom can so naturally appeal on behalf a to have have great anxiety about lately now be happily restored to from sea know may fully trust to love discretion men dear giles be happy enough to have nothing to hide be not of number bless god can say if conceal aught be not work of own doing be kept secret for own sake be now seven week since laid in grave body of aged mother left great grandson peter melcombe only son of nephew peter melcombe whose father be fourth brother sole heir think wise to conceal from that being eldest surviving son desired of that must not mean that forbad mother to leave property to be not for to judge have never done so for in case know not what must have done write in full confidence that of will respect wish that giles will never divulge secret even to valentine unless what fear must come to pas render necessary if peter melcombe now child must live to marry heir must be born to then throw letter into fire let be to a if have never be written if even life to come of age at time can make will leave property where plea may destroy feel afraid that child will die be scarcely to be supposed that will pray god that may not be so in case must in case child must be taken away during minority being already gone then grandfather will be so worded that son valentine only son will be heir let valentine know in such case that dead father who delighted in must rather have seen die in cradle than live by land inherit that gold have be poor have never turned to anything at melcombe with one thought that must mend case a have renounced for must fain renounce for heir for ever nothing be so unlikely a that property must ever fall to son if must trust to love duty to let be trust to giles to make easy for to get away while be yet young to lead fresh manly life in one of colony to find career at home for will provide with competence that if temptation must come in way may not find too hard to stand against may blessing of god light upon for for know will do more than for other act of dutiful affection have ever shown when desire to keep secret a hope always make exception in favour of person letter be written with much thought full deliberation signed by who ever feel a loving father towards daniel mortimer valentine have opened letter with preconceived notion a to content together with excessive surprise made fail for moment to perceive one main point that might have told when brandon just a finished reading came back found valentine seated before letter amazed pale what doe mean exclaimed when two have looked searchingly at one what on earth can mean have idea said giles have have for year continued valentine very much agitated surely have tried to find out what mean have made inquiry yes have be to melcombe must discover nothing at in answer to look then at other time be older than be so much older have never suspicion of anything at did nothing ever occur before be old enough to notice thing roused in suspicion suspicion of what of disgrace suppose of crime perhaps mean know what mean do think john know of be sure doe not agitate went on observing valentine hand trembled remember that secret be that father kept buried in breast have never be found out be evident therefore be most unlikely now that ever must be in opinion be only one have fully formed about matter crime disgrace quote own word must have taken place between sixty seventy year ago father expressly declares that have nothing to do with if old woman have began valentine vehemently paused how can that be answered giles say ' know not in case what must have done that have never judged valentine heaved up mighty sigh excitement made pulse beat hand tremble what made think said that be so long ago be so surprised that can not think coherently to tell why think so be to tell something more that believe know well said poor fellow sighing restlessly out with giles father began life by running away from home oh know that do yes dear father told to week before died did not like wished to dismiss from thought indeed will try to remember now how told to what said be very simple though now come to think of with new light thrown upon yes did put very oddly very strangely so did not like affair to think of said that a there be now intercourse between melcombe place that have not gone near for so very many year be almost certain that sooner later must hear something concerning must surprise be singular that have not heard already did not like to hear talk in usual pious way of such occurrence for though of course know that thing be overruled for good to who love god well said brandon when paused to ponder well repeated valentine for though referred to very text did not like to hear say that blessed god have be led to do that if ever heard of be to remember that thought of with gratitude saying turned over page again there be nothing of here said how did discover be told of at melcombe said brandon hesitating by whom seemed to be familiarly known there glanced at time be laid on table just beyond desk at valentine sat be little peter melcombe said gravely who mentioned to what poor little heir exclaimed valentine rather contemptuously must not be in shoe for good deal giles giles have shown letter started up yes there be said giles glancing again at time for perceived instantly that valentine for first time have remembered on what contingency be to be told of matter there be indeed crisis of fate in few sorrowful word have come before at corfu on th of february to inexpressible grief of mother peter only child of late peter melcombe esq great grandson heir of late mr melcombe of melcombe in twelfth year of age good heaven exclaimed valentine in awestruck whisper then have come to after sat silent so long that brother have full time once more to consider subject in bearing to perceive valentine be trying to discover reasonable cause for what father have done then to see countenance gradually clear now flashing eye lose troubled expression know have respected poor father confidence said at last yes have never heard anything from by word of mouth seemed afterwards to connect with affair yes did brandon answered said to just before last voyage that have written important letter told where be desired to observe that faculty be quite unimpaired long after writing of think must have be valentine put in continued question think that have never never heard say anything at time at puzzled startled remembered after never did never surprised excited suspicion at time about anything till have broken seal of letter after valentine said turning page how little there be in how little tell hardly anything there be great deal there be everything in having be impelled to write well poor man giles be rather struck by epithet if secrecy be object have made that at least impossible must soon know whatever be more than if act a wish in fact a command world will set to investigate reason yes be afraid so brandon answered have often thought of valentine went on always knew felt rather that must have have tremendous quarrel with elder brother never must mention if must help showed ill disguised unforgiving sort of almost dread be going to say of a if have be fearfully bullied by in boyhood must not forget continued still pondering surely be carrying anger superstition little too far to think that when be in grave will do son harm to inherit land of brother quarrelled with yes said giles when one considers how most of land of country be first acquired how many crime lie heavy on various conqueror how many more have be perpetrated in transmission from one possessor to then paused valentine took up word seems incredible that must have thought old quarrel however bitter between two boy ought more than century afterwards to deprive son of one of from taking lawful inheritance yes brandon said be fool must not have thought so therefore must not have be anything like must have felt that be in sense answerable for poor man death for have ascertained that there have be communication between two branch of family for several year before laid violent hand on valentine sighed restlessly whole thing be perfectly unreasonable said in fact must be impossible to do a desire even if be ever so willing impossible exclaimed brandon yes estate be already mine how be possible for not to take must prove will old will law must see to for there will be legacy duty to pay even if chose to fling income into pond must save out enough to satisfy tax gatherer seem to take for granted will can calmly secretly let estate be have thought out detail at have formed theory a to how be to be done spoke with impatience irritation vexed to perceive that brother have fully counted on dead father letter being obeyed brandon have nothing to say besides continued valentine where be sort of thing to stop if die to morrow john be heir be to let alone must know answered brandon have not same temptation to take that have temptation repeated valentine brandon did not retract explain word doe know reason wonder why must renounce continued valentine a spoke hand have put out to take time paused on way eye involuntarily opened little wider something seemed have struck be recalling puzzling out two three lily thrown under lilac tree by john father have come back to report nothing more recent more startling than for be still thinking of elder brother must have hated to full a much a poor father did be thought that garden have be shut up for sake many many year wait minute if man got estate wrongfully will have nothing to do with after nonsense why do slander dead in thought a if have not read that will many time inherited after old woman sickly brother who died at sea after thought wandered into sort of vague intricate path led to certain goal be not even certain at last that there be anything real to puzzle about father might have be under delusion after at last wandering eye met brandon well exclaimed a if suddenly waking up how composedly take yet how amazed be thought brandon well replied by way of answer will ask giles a have kept matter absolutely secret so long to keep secret still at rate for awhile from person think have right to expect that of will poor little fellow died at corfu then news be over wigfield by time doubt john know of course now again paused time be uncle last conversation recurred to memory be most unwelcome brandon must see that looked more than disturbed be also angry yet after awhile feeling melted away be like man who have walked up to cobweb stretched before face when have put up hand cleared off where be remembered how vague talk of dying old man have startled manner of gift odd feeling have suffered at time a if might be somehow connected with word said appeared to rise up to be looked at one can hardly look straight at thing of sort without making change aspect sensation impression be subject to may be reasoned down reason be stronger than fear have be made look foolish brought back word be disjointed accused one must not be put together so covered that recollection over threw aside did not consciously hide from did know in own mind that must not relate to brother well have done part said at length now must see about doing mine one must feel more keenly than do how hard be upon said brandon valentine detected tone of relief in voice a if took word to mean submission to father wish a if be glad poor father might have placed confidence in instead of treating like child said bitterly why on earth must not tell why dear fellow exclaimed brandon surely if be to renounce property must have be hard upon john to be shamed tortured by knowledge of crime disgrace that came with that came with repeated valentine take that for granted then have got further than have think of course that crime be committed disgrace incurred for sake of property well said valentine be much more uncertain about whole thing than seem to be will make duty to investigate matter must find out everything perhaps will be only too easy according to what find will act one generation have right so to dominate over a to keep always in childlike bondage to command for reason be given if when know consider that dear father be right will of own free will sell land divest myself of proceeds if be wrong will go live fearlessly freely in house on land in course of providence have come to reasonable cool thought brandon have right to say more will do just what say one be ever more free from superstition be of age a reminds very well then said aloud have right to do a please still must remind of father distinct assertion that in case have set example must not have land doe mean said valentine confused between surprise at letter own recollection secret wish doe can mean that old mother positively asked to be heir refused can not tell how be will worded great grandfather left estate to only son if died childless to eldest grandson be mere boy at time if lived to marry then old man left estate to only daughter be grandmother know have for many year have power to will away a be evident yes might leave to one of son representative be not to divide into share in case of branch favoured dying out estate be to revert to heir at law old man heir at law know nearest of kin must have be father if have lived year two longer be second son be most complicated voluminous will brandon asked one more question provision come to end with be not so be not entailed can do with exactly a please valentine countenance fell little when brother said perceived that chanced to be more free than most heir have more freedom than cared for yes replied be so chapter xxii sophistry 'as have not trusted will never know how must scorn to be thief ' school boy yesterday when master orchard gate be locked be own fault same boy to day while be stealing master plum did leave gate ajar ' val said brandon do hope will give time to consider thing in bearing before decide be afraid if make mistake will prove momentous one spoke with certain feeling of restraint advice have not be asked two brother began to perceive by time that be hard to keep up air of easy familiarity when felt really at ease be thinking of lovely young wife down stair one felt that must hardly preach to man whose folly have be own opportunity other felt that nothing must be more sweet than to let see that after have married man not so rich in so good position a first love for so chose to consider how utter how thorough escape must be also from least fear of further dependence on giles a to having made fool of having be well laughed at for pain be perfectly aware that a melcombe of melcombe with personal advantage that by mean undervalued nobody must choose to remember that story against might marry almost wherever pleased a turned in chair to think caught glimpse of old uncle house just corner through tree of own bedroom window there place where parcel be knew that think a long a must giles must not interrupt yes that parcel well be independent anyhow considered exultingly further thought came into mind be well enough off what if be to give up stay with john know be surprised pleased to find so useful will be more so work suit brings out have in like then always liked being with emily must soon be master in house bother estate felt at first must not possibly fling by really really believe that in few year when john go into parliament will make partner be very perplexing yes will think well over a giles say will do a please have great mind to let doomed old den alone after though expressed mind in undignified word be not without manly earnestness that turned back to brother said seriously giles do assure will decide nothing till have given whole thing very best attention in meantime of course hear will say nothing will certainly not go to melcombe for few day have got so attached to john somehow can not think of leaving in lurch just now when be out of spirit like to have with thereupon brother parted valentine going downstairs brandon sitting still in room smile dawning on face laugh following leaving john in lurch repeated what must lord john think if must hear that have noticed for time that like one what notion val have suddenly formed of own importance there be really something like dignity in leave taking doe not intend must interfere a be evident be not certain that if asked for advice must know what to say be very clear in own mind that when consulted must say 'follow father desire ' be still clear must do so in case be not asked for opinion think will renounce inheritance on reflection if doe will be truly glad that be not at all by advice to please if doe not well will not wish to make thing out worse than be always thought that letter weak a command strong a warning must be to say least of dutiful filial action to respect that warning warning not to perpetuate wrong for instance what wrong saw miniature of daniel mortimer elder smiling handsome fair haired not only reminded strongly of step father of whole race john valentine john child therefore be sure there need be 'no scandal about queen elizabeth mortimer discovery on part of son meanwhile valentine instead of driving straight back to wigfield stopped short at sister emily new house intending to tell simply of death of little peter melcombe notice how took o that letter have be left to instead of to giles how difficult be moreover to believe that giles have possessed so long yet that content be dead to one else that breathed if giles have not shown by manner what ought to do thought might have felt better inclined to do certain be that being now alone thought of father desire with more respect emily have be settled about month in new house miss christie grant be with there be pretty drawing room with bow window at back of emily have put there indian cabinet many other beautiful thing brought from east besides decorating with delicate fern bulb in flower be slightly inclined to be lavish so far a must afford scotch blood kept just on right side of prudence so gave more grace to undoubted generosity house have be chosen by mr henfrey be le than quarter of mile from john mortimer be approached by same sandy lane in front on opposite side of lane house be sheltered by great cliff crowned with fir tree enriched with wild plant swallow cave behind at end of garden ran same wide brook made boundary for john mortimer ground circumstance be great advantage to little mortimer who with familiar friendship made at once at home over mr nemily premise forthwith set little boat ship afloat on brook in happy certainty sooner later must come down to rightful owner valentine entered drawing room glance a stooped to kiss sister served to assure that knew nothing of great news put two hand upon shoulder sweet eye looked into slightly shamefaced expression struck doe dear boy think be in love again thought who be wonder look became almost sheepish rather surprised said to well val see house be ready yes answered looking round with sigh emily felt that might well look grave sad be common friend that have lost how be john asked why be very dull very dull indeed when left morning natural enough must be yes most natural then said after little more conversation on recent loss emily came to tell something very important to at least here shamefaced look came back oh no exclaimed a flash of amazement leaped out of eye nothing of sort be glad to hear answered not able to forbear smiling sit down then great long legged fellow put out of conceit with room make ceiling look too low oh do said valentine sat down in comfortable chair thought must have be very happy with emily did not know how to begin to tell must say admire taste emily then said looking about shirking great subject emily be little surprised at holding off in way so in turn took opportunity to say something fresh something that thought might a well hear so john dull be poor john do know val last time saw be very cross indeed why be cross be about month ago laughed know be cross st george went over at breakfast time to get key of house have be left with while ran up stair to see child told st george how drawing up blind to shave morning have seen chasing barbara miss green little temporary governess of theirs about garden barbara threw snowball at caught kissed be kind of cousin valentine murmured besides be mere child be very tall child said emily be within two inch a tall a be miss green be certainly child valentine did not wish to enter on side of question be sure know how one can find out when to leave off kissing one cousin observed can give easy rule for said emily leave off moment begin to care to do will probably help by beginning just about same time to think have bestowed kiss enough arose out of kindness said valentine john have already begun to be anxious about dear old man so went over morning before breakfast sent up message father be decidedly better a have to take journey that day thought must know a soon a possible emily yes dear boy really did come to say something important instantly a spoke felt what tragical circumstance be for one else that such must be emily first thought view of be exclaimed now little startled valentine have turned rather pale tasted bitter ingredient in cup of prosperity more plainly now wished that letter be at bottom of sea why why be something will be very sorry for too said voice faltering be poor little peter melcombe oh exclaimed emily with awestruck shudder there said so what did say cried valentine so much struck by word that recovered self possession instantly poor poor woman went on ready tear falling on cheek be only child what do mean emily continued valentine startled suspicious what did say oh answered nothing have particular reason for saying felt that might be great risk to take delicate boy to italy again where have be ill before told john wished must prevent must not forget that death must be fine thing for brother felt sort of fear that must be end of valentine be relieved evidently knew nothing must listen calmly while went on mere sense of danger made necessity for to act suppose will be surprised when tell here two more tear fell that wrote to mr melcombe knew be determined to go on continent said if liked to leave boy behind must take charge of be day before dear fred be taken ill declined said valentine well be very kind of very good of just like let hope poor mr melcombe doe not remember now yes declined said boy have excellent constitution where did poor little fellow die at corfu emily wept for sympathy with mother valentine sat still opposite to be glad of silence pleased to think of emily have done till on sudden familiar word out of bible flashed into mind strange quaint word seemed much more a if somebody kept repeating in presence than a if have turned over to surface from among mass of scrap be lying littered about in chamber of memory word of jonadab son of rechab that commanded son may see letter asked emily there be letter saw in time said valentine again mental repetition began son of rechab that commanded son be performed for unto day emily have dried eye now well val dear said hesitated oh wish must give time to get once straight through to end have done with thought valentine 'the word of jonadab son of rechab that commanded son be ' yes only point of be that be not not yet at rate word of jonadab here emily spoke again well val nobody ever came into estate more naturally rightly than do for however well may have behaved about nobody must have behaved better must have felt that a old lady chose to leave to one son must not have be youngest hope will be happy know will make kind good landlord seems quite providential that must have spent so much time in learning about land farming have always felt that be best nicest in must come out if must have prosperity now see that be intended for cordial delightful word to valentine almost made forget letter that have never heard of oh if please ma'be exclaimed female servant bursting into room mr brandon love to have sent pony carriage want to come back in directly something in instant attention paid to message alacrity with

through sail till reach mind can take in there strike root whole crop of same sort come up just a if be indigenous naturally belonging to entertainer be even more true in great matter than in small miss fairbairn a usual when saw john became gracious john be thought to be very intellectual man be intellectual meant to be more so john be specially fond of child talk concerning child must be wise kind real love of child childhood be however quality that one can successfully feign john have occasionally be seen by observant matron maid to attempt with certain uncouth tenderness to do child womanly service must tie bonnet string sash when came undone have be known to apply to during walk to take stone out of boot also to lace up again why must write of child a if be just like grown up

after donation of buttered toast upon became a happy a ever in ordinary life devolves on mother to lend handkerchief if child have none there be father who can rise to such occasion not feel afterwards a if heroic sacrifice have be demanded of john mortimer felt that miss fairbairn have never before greeted with so much empressement sat down immediately began to talk to flattering hope that have known of presence have come at once to see gave just degree of excitement that wanted to enable to produce thought at best while accustomed by experience to caution not ready yet to commit longed to remark that have be surprised a well a pleased to see found opportunity at first to do in meantime emily sat looked on listened to conversation with air of easy insouciance very natural becoming to emily be seven twenty have always be accustomed to defer to miss fairbairn a much older a well a wiser than deference did not seem out of place for large fair spinster made young matron look slender girlish john mortimer remembered how emily have said year ago that must not do better than marry justina thought have invited there to end a talked took care to express to by look good humoured defiance whereupon defended with eye punished by saying thought must come to day perhaps see little house do like have be in le than three month be already quite attached to miss fairbairn only came last night be delighted with yes said justina only came last night air of irrepressible satisfaction spread over face that mr mortimer must have walked over to see very first morning be beyond utmost hope have caused emily to invite at particular time that might often see john here be emily think pointed thing coming at once cogitated reminds too that friendship for did not bring well be too much out of spirit to come month ago emily eye flashed softened when saw out of countenance little twist came in lip where smile must like to have broken through be still in crape wore delicate gossamer of widow cap with long wing like streamer falling away at back while sat at work on cumbersome knitted shawl listened with air of docility to justina conversation without noticing that touch of dismay be beginning to show in john face for miss fairbairn have begun to speak of italian literature subject have be getting up lately for certain good reason of own dared to talk about dante john be almost at once keenly aware that learning be sham be outcome of real taste felt like fool while one of lady did wooing other a thought amused with watching be accustomed to be wooed to be watched have be trying for time to bring mind to like present wooer while away from fancied that have begun to succeed now knew well that sort of talk must drive wild in week represented nothing real no thing must not do be good woman must have ruled house well must have be just to child if have established in comfort elegance over family might have left attended to prospective parliamentary duty a long a liked without annoying be lady too mother old lady fairbairn be pleasant unexceptionable woman be making ridiculous now no must not do giving up then there suddenly started from seat a if felt relieved drawing to full height looked down on two lady one of whom lifting golden head continued wooing with eye while other said carelessly with dispassionate air well can not think how john one can like bitter hearted odious cruel dante emily exclaimed miss fairbairn how can be so absurd dear wonder did not tear into little bit continued emily audaciously instead of merely banishing be did be john can not imagine what mean exclaimed miss fairbairn while john laughed felt that at least here be something real natural can not be because consider then what must feel if somebody now be to write grand poem about father mother aunt uncle dear friend deceased setting forth how have seen in nether region how have received confidence how penitent most of be persecuted indeed misunderstood consider that be deadliest revenge man ever took upon enemy miss fairbairn brow on hearing contracted with pain for john laughed again turning slightly towards emily a stood leaning against window frame took opportunity to get away from subject of italian literature ask question about knitting must be something to give away be sure be always giving know john answered a if excusing be not at sure that will have possession anything of own in future life anything consequently to give away perhaps will all belong to so let have enough of giving while can enjoy best part of possession dear emily said miss fairbairn kindly must not indulge in unauthorised fancy so chance that be not for poor person observed emily for dear aunt christie ah be always very well while lived with said john hear very different account of now yes have rheumatism in foot so that be obliged to sit up stair john must go see will take mr mortimer to said justina rising serenely thought must break off conversation in have part so john went up to miss christie little sitting room there be bolt upright with lame foot on cushion by visit gave unmixed pleasure to old lady afforded opportunity to younger one for pleasant reasonable speech for little effective waiting on invalid a well a for covert compliment ay john mortimer miss christie with audacious twinkle in eye be clear that deserve pain have got for sin against ye against exclaimed john amazed very bad advice gave ye john continued while miss fairbairn little surprised looked on make mind easy john answered with mock gravity for knew well enough what meant never follow bad advice promise not to follow yours what be advice dear asked miss fairbairn sweetly golden head within yard of john a stooped forward wonder must have ventured to give advice to man a mr mortimer people always seem to think that in matter of consequence be lucky if can get advice from john drew long breath experienced strong sense of compunction miss christie be merely relieved began to talk with deep interest about new governess new housekeeper miss fairbairn brought john down again a soon a must took opportunity to engage attention on stair by asking question on political subject really interested like straightforward man falling into trap began to give view respecting a opened drawing room door for three child who time have be in garden came running in at window before miss fairbairn be seated two little boy treading on mr walker crape be thrusting large handful of flower almost into face while anastasia emptied lapful on to knee emily accepted graciously so little hugh exclaimed a father said be not to have garden thought have better gather flower because be own know proceeded for bought most of bulb with own money be for hyacinth narcissus wallflower polyanthus continued to be held up for inspection will let put in water wo said bertram yes will bertie cried hugh tread on mr walker dress john began sprite a if in ready obedience be off in instant in reality be gone to find vas for flower emily looking up with composure though good deal of scrambling arguing be heard through open door found in pantry exclaimed two little boy returning with dish in hand nancy wanted to get water must let come here exclaimed john with gravity come here shut door emily brought imp on purpose to apologize for high misdemeanour thereupon two little boy blushed hung head be nothing to have taken garden daunted to have to acknowledge fault before have said word however shrill little voice cried out behind ca do apologize yet father because have got pin in cape prick somebody must take out can not get least pretence of penitence out of one of exclaimed john unable to forbear laughing must make apology emily be very much afraid that garden be taken without leave be not given at have heard say more than once answered emily with easy smile that be privilege of giver to forget never have very good memory confessed that took well john then if said be to apologize answered emily giving just shadow of smile of course must so did little boy with hot blush flashing eye little girl with innocent unconsciousness of shame then mr nemily rather spoilt dignity of occasion by taking up kissing upon child inquired in loud whisper now have done apologize may keep garden may at john must help laughing may if papa have objection said emily suddenly aware of certain set look about miss fairbairn lip glance of reproof almost of anguish from stern blue eye miss fairbairn have that morning tasted sweetness of hope now experienced sharp pang of jealousy when saw child hanging about emily with familiar friendliness treading on tuck whispering confidence in ear putting flower on clean chintz of ottoman thing justina must have found intolerable if done to herself unless in father presence even then must have only welcomed for sake of diverting from emily felt sure that at first have be a hoped a ought to be must not refrain from darting glance of reproof at emily even felt a if be wrong of john to be thus beguiled into turning away when ought to have be cultivating acquaintance with mind character be still more wrong of emily to be attracting notice drawing away from true place interest now almost duty emily with instant docility put little anastasia down took up knitting while miss fairbairn suddenly feigning great interest in horticulture asked after john old gardener who heard have just taken prize old man be very well said john if mr walker must come over morning be sure must be proud to show flower miss fairbairn instantly accepted proposal always took interest in old man observed be so original yes be said john at what time of day be generally at home continued not observing perhaps not intending to observe that flower must have be shown during owner absence at luncheon time at what time john thus appealed to paused instant have never thought of coming home to entertain lady must not be inhospitable concluded that mistake be real at luncheon time presently said named day when must be at home being very careful to address invitation to mr walker then retired with child who be now in very good spirit gave hand to justina who must have liked to kiss sprite skipped away in father wake while walked home lost in thought on grave serious thing broke in now then with childish speculation on life manner swanny must put on sunday coat when come orange handkerchief that janie hemmed for because mr swan finger be crumpled up said little girl father what be methodist asked hugh before john must answer little bertram informed brother be thing about not going to church have nothing to do with finger being crumpled up be rheumatism chapter xxiv self wonder scorn something there be move to love do know love know not how why brome a john child withdrew together through garden justina fairbairn sat with work on knee watching mr mortimer be six thirty be not asked yes answered emily how much improves in appearance observed used not to be thought handsome when be very young be handsome stately now be way with mortimer think said emily must not wonder if in ten year time val be just a majestic a old men used to be though have dignity at about now yes majesty be right word said justina serenely mr mortimer have finer presence finer carriage than formerly may be partly because be not so very thin a used to be perhaps so said emily be first call continued justina obliged to make opening for through to push what have to say suppose dear must hardly fail to notice how matter be going calling at once bringing child too wish to find out opinion tell own on various subject silence on part of hostess must almost have wished dear emily that have not paused have not what asked emily miss fairbairn remembered that be mr walker guest that behoved not to offend hostess because wanted to stay in house a long a possible must like to have finished speech thus that have not engrossed child so completely said instead with little smile meant to look conscious believe meant dear must have be very glad to talk to child felt that reply fell rather flat knew that emily must immediately be made aware of what now hoped be really state of case must also be made to help surprise be expressed mr walker did not make reply so continued look surprised dear surely what have hinted at can not be new thought to a did not suit to drop subject yet proceeded see by smile that be not confess must have liked to talk to for added with sigh of contentment task see very plainly before be always difficult one to undertake still emily be silent seemed lost in thought indeed be considering among other thing that be little more than year since john have discussed justina together be there must there really be anything between now justina watched wished must know what effect hint have taken emily have always behaved in such high minded noble way to lover be so generous to other woman that justina depended on now lower nature paid homage to higher even to point of believing in sense of honour quite alien to own experience there be not least reason to suppose that emily cared about john mortimer wanted to stand aside lest must take into head to begin to care for so many men have be infatuated about emily emily have never wished to rob woman for mere vanity of spoliation justina opinion of actually be that if must be made to believe that justina have right in john mortimer must not stand in light even though might have begun to think highly of house position a advantageous for love did not take into consideration felt that imputed to others be thoroughly mean if emily have done anything mean must positively have shaken faith trust in goodness must actually have be bad for there be saying how much lower might have declined if one of few person believed in have made descent though thought thus of emily have notwithstanding felt towards kind of serene superiority a might be felt towards one who must only look straight before by one who must see round corner that morning for first time have begun to fear to acknowledge certain charm in careless by mean ungracious indifference in sweet natural way with john child in dark lash clouded soft grey eye contradiction in face be dangerous there be wistful yearning in smile joyous a laugh sounded often put stop to sudden sweetness with sigh justina felt emily silence very oppressive while lasted fully expected that must be broken at last by important word emily might tell that must be deceiving might be able to give such decisive proof of fact a must oblige to give up new hope be what justina feared on other hand might show ignorance lighten justina heart by merely asking whether thought must love bear with woman child might even ask whether john mortimer have made intention plain when emily did speak appeared completely to ignore hint though face retained air of wonder cogitation by bye justina said put little out of countenance just now john mortimer never meant to ask to luncheon know seldom ever come home in middle of day be sure of said justina quite sure invited did make mistake well if did not at first intend certainly caught at notion afterwards do think so thought on contrary that spent moment in considering what day must spare to come receive perhaps be just a well answered justina must have felt very awkward going about house garden in absence justina said emily driven at last to front question how much do wish to understand nothing at dear what see replied without lifting head from work then added do child come here often two three time week think answered emily with degree of carelessness attracted miss fairbairn attention have appeared more than commonly indifferent that morning have hardly responded to loving caress of john child have seemed to signify nothing came hung about just same have taken garden time before found out continued run through copse through three four field belong to john get into garden over stepping stone in brook must feel very sure of welcome said justina rather pointedly yes answered emily also rather pointedly have never invited to come never once there be a see occasion holding graceful head little higher than usual folded up now finished shawl ran up stair with to miss christie room be conscious almost at once fancied so that old aunt looked at with certain air of scrutiny not unmixed with amusement be relieved when have put on gift to hear miss christie say well ye will be glad to know feel more at ease now than have done for time there have be air of triumph in miss christie glance that emily be pleased to find be only exultant on account of health expressed gladness assured old lady must soon be a active a ever be foot be thinking of answered miss christie bad advice weighed on mind bad advice that have given to john mortimer thereupon related conversation in have recommended miss fairbairn to emily sat very still so still that hardly seemed to breathe then looking up said perhaps rather more calmly quietly than be wont several people have thought must be good thing for john to marry justina fairbairn be one of miss christie eye sparkling with joy malice have thought lately be just mistaken presently related what have passed between john that morning emily fair cheek took slight blush rose tint if felt relieved did not appear perhaps thought under like circumstance john must speak just so of old lady have be silent moment before emily answered when did speak said what john actually joked about poor justina in presence auntie did see in absence inquired miss christie excusing tell ye child have changed mind john mortimer world too good for aye looked grand morning yes answered emily be pity think woman be in love with then feeling that have be unjust corrected mean that be so keenly aware how many woman there be in neighbourhood who must gladly marry aware quoth miss christie instantly taking part aware indeed can ever go out stop at home that somebody doe try to make aware small blame to added with laugh few men can hold head higher either moreally pheesically have pocket full of money besides emily got away from miss christie a soon a must put on bonnet went into garden air be soft almost oppressively mild for bracing east wind be gone tender wooing zephyr be fluttering among crumbled leaf helping to expansion before knew what instinct have taken there found standing by four little garden listening to cheerful dance of water among stepping stone looking at small footstep of child be printed over property yes there be mistake about empty heart have taken in with thought fear of anything might follow only other day thought have be a free a air there be sorrowful shadow lying behind when chose looked back into recalled confiding trust marital pride instinctive courage of late husband be sufficiently mistress of past to muse more on unopened mind petty ambition small range of thought be gone to heaven must see farther now a for matter have hidden be shut down into night oblivion with dust of what have once be faithful heart fred walker have be a one short sighted who only see thing close at hand see clearly emily be very long sighted in vast range of vision be comprehended many thing that keenest eye can not wholly define be confused with own shadow thing near saw a plainly a have done wondrous wide distance drew now again away from life of to day must sometimes spend in gazing over life in whole day life a felt yearning passioning must appear to overflow little cup of separation take reflection from other life till be hardly so much a small part of great whole god immortal child wonderful race of mankind held in hand of fashioner conscious of yearning ancient yearning towards source emily moved slowly home again felt rather sensitive about proposed luncheon at john mortimer house wished have managed to spare from being obliged to give invitation even considered whether justina must be induced to go alone there be engagement must be pleaded a reason for absenting what must be done be before went to try without giving needle pain to place matter in truer light must only be fair to poor justina emily scarcely confessed to own heart that be glad of what miss christie have said be not from thought that must make least difference to herself upon reflection felt ashamed of how john mortimer have be wooed of how have betrayed by smile that knew that day be tuesday luncheon be to take place on saturday on friday afternoon emily have not found courage occasion to speak to friend more thought about more difficult ungracious matter seemed such be state of thing miss christie be still up stair justina be seated at work in drawing room emily arrayed in lilac print apron be planting fresh fern in jardiniere when door be opened servant announced mr mortimer emily be finishing horticulture be not at kind of person to be put out of countenance on being discovered at occupation that suited fancy to be engaged in however blushed beautifully just a other woman might have done on being discovered in drawing room so arrayed hand acquainted with peat presently left room john knew be gone to wash hand hoped must not stay away long for wo do lady thought however long leave will not make offer to present candidate be determined in meantime justina wishing to say something of emily must sound amiable yet help own cause remarked pleasantly emily be dear careless creature just like what be a girl careless creature by bye be not at all suited to be stepmother yes answered john in abstracted tone a if be not considering mr walker mental characteristic be case for be merely occupied in wishing must return wish to look well notwithstanding continued justina a if excusing so wonder go to divest herself of housemaid apron ah said john who be great observer of apparel thought be not dressed a usual added be so graceful that in array can not fail to look well justina looked up feeling hurt also little surprised here be alone with john mortimer for first time in life be entertaining with praise of woman have great deal of self command began almost at once to ask question about child have most excellent governess to recommend be not true that wanted nurse also yes mr mortimer did want a justina have be writing to friend have about functionary have heard of several mentioned in case one thought most suitable john much pleased at happy chance brought such treasure before be deep in conversation about when emily reappeared then to justina great annoyance took down two address broke off conversation with instantly to say emily be come to make humblest apology possible find that be absolutely obliged to go to london to morrow on matter can not be postponed justina be greatly mortified answered instantly not emily ah then of course be come to put off mr mortimer there be undue stress on word put off suggested idea to john be new to must have felt called upon to act upon renew invitation if emily have not answered just a if have heard not syllable will be sorry to miss john when come doubt child will be at home girl yes said john slipping into arrangement so easily that how little cared about visit ought to have be at once made plain to justina oh yes will be so proud to entertain hope will honour a be intended by coming to lunch yes to be sure emily answered with readiness hope auricula will not have begun to fade be miss fairbairn favourite flower then to intense mortification of justina john changed subject a if have be one of moment to have be over to wigfield house afternoon to pay respect to mr brandon boy found well know for be there morning perfectly well said john laughed giles be marching about in garden with astonishing infant lying flat on arm with long robe dangling down dorothea come out be told for first time be walking beside looking like girl of sixteen believe when approached be discussing to what calling in life must bring up youngster be desired to remark uncommon likeness to father told that be considered very fine child must have have privilege of looking at little downy black head mother decided not to accord lest must take cold so laugh at maternal folly said justina smiling not displeased at what sounded like disparagement of attractive young woman laugh at yes a man who feel that be one lovely folly of world who must bear to think of childhood demand of womanhood if did not bear in mind sweet delusive glamour wash woman eye ere catch sight of small mortal sent to be charge then justina who have found few moment for recovering deciding how to act took conversation again into own hand very soon in spite of emily who did not dare to interfere again john mortimer be brought quite naturally inevitably to add to desire that must next day visit child invitation to luncheon after must have returned justina accepted must not be day week observed with quiet complacency for be to be baby christening day be asked to be godmother emily must not forbear to look up john face be quite study have just be asked to stand for child have consented whom might have for companion have not thought of asking will be first anniversary of wedding said emily by way of saying something for john silence began to be awkward mr brandon having be charmed with sensible serenity of miss fairbairn conversation with candour straightforwardness that distinguished have cultivated

heart yearned with painful pity returned upon over two girl saw in what light regarded thought of stepmother heart ached to think that have not remotest chance of ever standing in such relation towards yet in despite of be full of tender distress when considered that if blissful possibility must ever draw near love of child must melt away elder one must resent presence teach younger to read writing of story wrong way must feel presence division from father whom loved must brood with just same sullen love pouting tenderness must pity father just same whoever wore ring reigned over in

emily side with gesture of discomfiture almost of disgust step mother at continued johnnie say hate thought of that one oh what lesson for thought emily put letter in pocket be very rude whispered barbara must mind with better grace than must have be expected allowed justina to kiss two lady walked back through field younger child accompanying nearly way home chapter xxvi mr brandon asks question baby day flowed in much troubled channel see a then in impotent strife tight little bundle of wailing flannel perplexed with newly found fardel call 'd life locker john mortimer be last guest to make appearance on morning of christening found baby who have be brought down to be admired behaving scandalously cry till be crimson in face declining aunt loving persuasion to to go to sleep emily be moving up down drawing room soothing cherishing in arm assuring that be sleepy time shaking patting a be way of who be cunning with baby be in vain be carried from father house in storm of indignation from time to time repeated protest against thing in general till service be over of party walked home to house justina lingered hastened accosted john mortimer in vain kept a far a possible from while emily who have gone forward very soon found close at side madam said will have honour of taking in to luncheon did know john answered laughing because did feeling a if occasion have suddenly become more festive though knew explanation must be coming will easily find opportunity said of telling st george what have done went through dining room saw name on plate took liberty to change one two can sit by curate at time in fact must think old friendship kind heart might make prefer to sit by say that do mr walker do answered emily reason john little creature be match maker why must need give golden head oh did perhaps be because thought must expect expect expect be in blessed case of who expects nothing who therefore can not be disappointed always thought be friend of so be john know be then how can wish thing for emily can not think how utterly tired be of being teased about woman that lady now st george have begun to do declare if can not put stop to in other way will do by marrying somebody else be indeed fearful threat john said emily meant doubt to show that have reached last extremity of earnestness be condition will never reach said john laughing lapsing into old intimate fashion with be always way to slip into thing easily john emily have walked on believed to be well in front out of hearing of others when right time have come for anything to be found out what be use of trying to keep hidden justina seeing opportunity went forward just a brandon drew rest of party aside to look at rather rare fern whose curled up frond like little crosier be showing on sandy bank drew on one more step must have brought even with when john mortimer uttered word if can not put stop to in other way will do by marrying somebody else justina stopped stooped instantly a if to gather delicate leaf of silver weed grew in sand emily who have caught step turned for one instant saw without being perceived justina knew what word meant stood still arranging leaf to let pas on others come up soon after merged into one group john gave arm to mr henfrey emily falling behind began to consider how much justina have heard what must do now dorothea have said in easiest way possible to justina will ask new clergyman to take emily in to luncheon mr mortimer to take justina knew now that game be up be not quick of perception be vacillating when once have decided on course never have discomfort of wishing afterwards that have done otherwise there be undoubtedly rumour going about to effect that john mortimer liked be coming forward one knew better than mother how rumour have be wafted on how little there be in yet reflected be best chance be necessary to put into head somehow to think about in such light that others have thought too much said too much might have succeeded what must like best now further considered pondering slowly over word in mind must be to have people say have refused have reached point when emily joined walking silently beside that might not appear companionless emily be full of pity for in spite of lightening of own heart people who have nothing to hope best know what lifting of cloud be to have also nothing to fear poetical temperament of emily mind made frequently change place with others indeed become in thought others fear feeling what be cry for emily mother have once said to when be little child be not emily now answered be poor little owl ca help cry because cruel smokey barked at frightened pulled several of best feather out now just same emily be justina such thought a justina might be supposed to be thinking passed through emily mind somewhat in way be not at fair have be like ninepin set up in game of other people life only to be knocked down again yet without game must not have be played yes have be made useful for through other people have unconsciously set against matrimony if must have let alone oh justina how can help thinking now must have managed if might have have game to myself next to power of standing outside one self looking at a other folk see most remarkable be of by insight of genius imagination becoming first make one sometimes only too reasonable too humble second warms heart enriches soul for give charm of selfhood to being not yet be happy thing for of thought emily finishing cogitation in own person that others be not allowed to play game when brandon got home john saw wife quietly look at now what doe mean thought be something more than mere observance of entering two have mean of transport for thought past significance of word yes be right go into dining room will follow have found out guest be standing in small morning room taking coffee brandon presently walking out of french window into garden came up to dining room outside there be dorothea love said looking out what do think of name have be changed perhaps waft of wind floated off plate said brandon climbing in over window ledge servant restored amiss mr brandon think if baby of yours squall again after lunch have better drink own health somewhere else say how nice look love like gown must come in st george do attend to business look whew exclaimed brandon having inspected plate must have be very intelligent waft of wind did two minute after brandon sauntered in again by window john mortimer observed door when mr brandon entered saw standing on rug keeping emily in conversation mr brandon admired mr mortimer be tall fair stately have just such likeness to valentine a must not fail to be to advantage in opinion of one who remembering valentine smiling face small forehead calm eye see same contour of countenance with expression at once grave sweet feature le regular with grand intellectual brow keen blue eye not so handsome a valentine with twice a direct outlook twice a much tenderness of feeling in have enough insight to perceive difference of character announced by variety in type john mortimer who be persistently talking to emily felt that brandon eye be upon that looked amused never doubted that work have be observed that wish must be respected luncheon on table john said brandon instantly will take in wife john obeyed knew did not sit at head of table so took placed on right while emily curate be on left be very large party during two minute have be alone together brandon dorothea have altered whole arrangement of john saw that brandon have given to own usual place have taken bottom of table thought own way of managing that matter must have be simpler be very well content made highly agreeable till there chanced to be little cessation of clatter of plate noticeable pause in conversation then justina began to play part mr mortimer said leaning little before emily curate be not at all too late for north of italy be want to visit italy must not set out so late in year john answered must not stay even at florence day later than end of may oh say that answered have be so longing know for year to go to north of italy now seems a if there be chance a if mother must consent know thought john know nothing of kind how must really doe seem now a if might leave england for few month continued there be nothing at to keep here if must think so saw brother other day yes thought looked tolerably well again did not yes think did then continued persuasively with serenity several people being now very attentive to conversation then if mother must chance to see mr mortimer must consult about will not be so unfriendly to a to tell that be too late must not know mr mortimer because think so much of opinion be said in slight degree more distinctly than usual with repetition of name that one might doubt whom be addressing made decided impression on one so much a on what fool have be thought in spite of appearance have be very far from thought perhaps annoyance at ridiculous rumour be what make so much want to be off then entered with real interest into matter before luncheon be over splendid tour have be sketched out in austrian tyrol proved to demonstration be far better in summer than italy justina be quite animated only hoped mother must not object be just a well expressed doubt fear on head for lady fairbairn have never in life have hint even that daughter be dying to go on continent justina have only decided that be well to intend thing not that must be wise necessary to carry intention out exerted keeping most careful watch guard over voice smile be not easy for to appear pleased when felt piqued to feign deep interest in austrian tyrol when have not known till occasion whereabouts on map might be found be becoming tired quite flushed when opportune entrance of baby that morsel of humanity with large name diverted one attention from relieved from further effort there be nothing so difficult a to make good speech at wedding christening without affecting somebody feeling people stand so much in fear of that can hardly say anything others enjoy doing be dreaded accordingly for beside pain of having one feeling touched being obliged to weep there be red nose follows john when stood up to propose health of godson st george mortimer brandon who luckily be sound asleep have unusual good fortune to please interest everybody even parent without making one cry be commonplace of tenderness day thing about time change be affecting if speaker can add to touch concerning man life love destiny something reached down from dominion of thought beautiful fresh enough to make hearer wonder at experience elation of heart be universal tribute paid to beautiful thing then will feel deeply perhaps joy of beauty will elevate mind will save eye from annoying tear before guest retired emily having lingered up stair with baby dorothea found for few minute alone with justina who be very tired felt that task be not quite finished so a took up bonnet advanced to looking glass to put on said carelessly wonder whether colour will stand italian sunshine dorothea fair young face be at once full of interest justina saw curiosity too none be expressed only said with least little touch of pique never told that be wishing so much to go away justina turned from superior height stooped to kiss dorothea a if by way of apology whereupon added have hoped indeed felt sure that liked place neighbourhood what be alluding to dear said justina though dorothea have alluded to nothing dorothea remaining silent justina have to go on think if be what mean that one who care for must wish to undertake very difficult task very difficult task a one perhaps be not at fit for on dorothea betrayed certain embarrassment rather painful blush tinged soft cheek must not have taken liberty to hint at thing answered must not have liked thought justina with not unnatural surprise for dorothea have shown fondness for of course know there have be idea in neighbourhood that that what asked justina why that might might undertake oh nonsense dear nonsense talk said justina believe word of tone seemed to mean just contrary dorothea looked doubtful there have be attention certainly continued justina turning before glass a if to observe whether scarf be folded to mind of course one must have observed that really dear such thing put up large steady hand fastened veil with due care thing a must never do who must have put into head to think of doe not care for in least then thought dorothea seems that have cared for think doe now for seemed rather pleased to sketch out that tour will take away from like even if be base to must still be glad be not going to marry john mortimer justina be in many respect pleasant woman be good daughter have very good temper serene never peevish did not forget what be due to others be reasonable on whole just felt what pity be that mr mortimer be so unwise regretted with sincerity not disturbed by misgiving taking deepest interest in a way worthy desirable did for herself what must really felt a if be privilege duty something like glow of satisfied conscience filled mind when reflected that to end have worked left nothing undone just a such feeling rise in mind on so reflecting about effort made for person with foible old people liked own sex liked for be comfortable person to be with one whose good point attracted regard whose fault be remarkably well concealed with last speech bowled out of imaginary game of ninepin next stroke be made by dorothea went down to long drawing room found guest departed excepting john mortimer who came up to take leave of smiled wanted to apologize said taking hand be great liberty for change made in table change did say answered oh so softly change then became suddenly shy withdrew hand be still holding drawing up to full height stood stock still for moment a if lost in thought in surprise be such very slight hint to that two lady have be concerned took remembered that one of be sister of host also that have not be allowed to carry out change just a have devised asked emily leave said to take in oh did answered dorothea with what seemed involuntary interest then took leave why did never think of before believe there ever be such fool in world said to a mounted horse rode off of course if be driven to emily must be fifty time more suitable for than calm blond spinster liberty be sweet however will not do if can help worst of be that emily of woman of acquaintance be only one who doe not care one straw about there be hurry fancy making offer getting laughed at for pain then john mortimer amused with recollection of poor fred walker wooing how ridiculous have made how have laughed at yet out of mere sweetness of nature taken be not in to be in love with man reflected suppose be not in to be in love with woman so far at least might meet on equal ground in meantime dorothea be cosily resting on sofa in dressing room husband be with st george mortimer brandon latter a quiet a possible in cot now nobody cared whether behaviour did credit not love said do know must be at surprised if john mortimer have made justina offer have refused must be very much surprised indeed said brandon laughing think highly of good sense of hers for reason feel sure darling that have not made offer have not refused be almost sure have proceeded dorothea otherwise must be obliged to think that kind of thing said to day be not quite fair what did say dorothea told think that amount to much said brandon oh then think never did ask hope trust be right why do hope trust mr brandon what can signify to then when made answer went on to be sure must make highly natural that must be glad at prospect of absenting be just thinking so did not speak well st george did be wishing time must speak a well just a if did not speak twice a well besides have much finer voice like so much to hear when get excited ah be thing have taken great pain to learn art of speaking when to art excitement be added get on well enough john without being excited say care nothing about very thing must like to have said will not perfectly reveal to till speech be over be not eloquent no doe not on particular occasion rise above ordinary level of thought everyday self suffices for what have to do say sometimes if two have spoken at same meeting see speech reported though mine may have be most cheered find little in while have often said perfectly thing of real use to party chapter xxvii

be about sir what be thinking of come down moment open door one of little boy have be already dispatched down stair be turning key in instant john mortimer coming quickly up beheld party seated on floor looking very foolish mr walker in throne laughing crayshaw got up to present take blame on own shoulder john be so much surprised to find emily present perhaps aiding that stopped short in inquiry how have dared to bring home when be so busy observing ridiculous side of question sat down at once laughed also while said something by way of excuse for made best defence must emily have little anastasia in arm child tired of inaction have fallen asleep with delicate rosy cheek leaning against emily fair throat john felt beauty of attitude perceived how emily be presence gave completeness to group much too young to be mother of elder child there be still something essentially like in way child excepting one asleep in arm be grouped on floor at foot just so janie must have sat if have lived thought must often have seen something like here a child grew older while listened to account given by two boy of doings must not help looking at emily thinking a have sometimes done before bore in slight degree resemblance to wife wife whom have idealised good deal lately who generally in thought presented to a have done when a mere lad first saw dark haired grey eyed young woman older than a very young man first admiration frequently be felt that emily be more graceful have charm of manner sweetness of nature janie have never possessed seldom allowed to admit even to own mind that wife have be endowed with very slight power of loving on occasion however fact be certainly present to thought cogitated have quarrel man may sometimes do with little love from wife if be quite sure love other man more started from reverie a crayshaw ceased to speak thought have more sense said with smile still on mouth have come while mused on emily now flatter that be to be torn from friend hurled on continent against will nothing of sort boy have more difficult part to play be to do a please crayshaw countenance fell little be george really angry sir asked did not seem so remarked that be nearly seventeen that did not specially care about journey something very like disappointment stole over cray face then something of feeling now then show that be rather blow to to have on sudden what wanted what must have then can not exactly tell seems be not brother thought johnnie might be with came to ask of course felt sure be here if decide to go with be to be back by six o'clock if not go to mr tikey on monday now boy be not going to turn out of door so adieu thus saying because emily little charge be awake have risen be taking leave of girl brought down stair wishing good bye ' at gate went back to wigfield while returned home young woman who have be accustomed to reign over most of men about felt in newly learned humility sense of elation from merely having be little while in presence of man whom loved reflected on musing smile have thought that concerned hoped nothing better than that might never find out how dear be to a for john mortimer returned to town musing over turn in political affair pleased cogitating over content of bill then under discussion in parliament wondering whether must get much altered before second reading while time half unconsciously to scene in other parliament be present to just a scene nothing more emily sitting on throne with smallest child nestling in arm so satisfied one knew not of two have most assured air of possession half unaware seemed to hear again contented sighing of little creature in sleep emily low sweet laugh when saw astonishment at presence then there be young american stepping forward through narrow sunbeam into brown shade to meet with shamefaced boyish air of conscious delinquency conscious indeed that be author of certain commotion very far assuredly from being conscious that gifford crayshaw by mean of schoolboy prank be taking decisive step towards change in destiny of soul then bearing part in john mortimer reached town have rallied boy made see folly fine young fellow reflected full of fun care how often come here so in thought dismissed crayshaw boyish escapade to attend to more important matter emily a went towards home be soon overtaken by twin johnnie crayshaw opposition being now withdrawn latter young gentleman have discovered that ought to go with brother be moderately good tempered about johnnie mortimer on other hand be gloriously sulky declined to take notice of fellow creature even when spoke to at stepping stone over brook emily parted with young people receiving from crayshaw verse have copied gladys have possessed for week liked said young poet meant one of for parody mr mortimer said be not half enough like for parody only amounted to kind of honest plagiarism considering crestfallen air of author sigh with parted from went way to join

god bless loss better suit with degree eb browning shade of twilight be just fleeting faint glow waxed over eastern hill great orchard of pear tree pressed up to one end of melcombe house showed white a army of shrouded ghost in dim solemnity of dawn house be closely shut up one met valentine a tired after night journey dismissed hired fly at inn came up slowly to grand old silent tree without sunshine white in nature be always most solemn here stillness be added not bird be yet awake not leaf stirred faint bluish haze appeared to confuse outline of tree a lingered looking at at house have now fully decided to take for home mr melcombe saw haze dissolve retreat there be light enough to make paleness whiter to show distinct brown trunk of pear tree with cushion of green moss at root formless whiteness visible dusk have divided into light shade then came shaft of sunshine bough laden with dewy blossom sparkled like snow in one instant oppression of solemnity be over appeared to smile upon approach to home have done everything must think of knew not how to devise anything further yet secret if there be one must not come forward look in face have searched house in first instance for letter paper there be old letter old paper also not one did not seem to be a clear in innocence of meaning a possible there be even one set at rest doubt fear have hitherto entertained have found no closet in wall locked chamber have met with mysterious silence mysterious look mysterious word then have gone to meet bereaved mother that if have anything to say in way of warning to repentance for herself might lay out to hear have found generally not willing to talk did say showed tender reverence for dead melcombes passionate grief for boy who have be taken a said before be old enough even to estimate at due value prosperous happy career have before tried laura laura though sincerely sorry for poor little peter death be very sentimental told valentine to surprise that be mainly on account have wintered on continent with downcast eye mysterious confusion that made tremble at first utterly declined to tell reason when found therefore that mr melcombe did not care at present to return to england be far better able than be to arrange journey when did might have come home at once for mystery of laura when after cultivating intimacy with for nearly month at last found out beyond doubt that related to love affair amelia have not approved of felt a if everything approached concerning matter of father letter melted into nothingness at touch acknowledged to that must have be deeply disappointed if have discovered anything to justify letter when full low sunlight shone upon large comfortable old house glorified blossoming orchard set off darkness of ancient yew felt touch of sensation people think be not fancy only everything about seemed familiar old fashioned quaintness be part of very first time saw that clean empty coach house reflected felt a if have often played in almost seemed to hear other boy shouting to be true that never let off squib cracker in yard walked nearer how cheerful looked swept up with extra neatness made orderly for new master eye by bye thought catching sight of heavy old outhouse door there be ghost story having examined reality so far a can will try hand at thing unreal for even now though be very grateful to providence for such house inheritance once show good reason over go a must have done at first if father must have given one door seems just sort of thing for ghost to pas through will look at book laura told of see door be so house being now open mr melcombe observed by servant who alone be there to give welcome entered ordered breakfast be spread for in great parlour having now got into habit of making investigation have sooner finished meal than began to look at note have made from what mr melcombe have told of ghost story be story that have not half finished when recognised have read with particular in book only with name locality disguised oh yes answered when said so be very well known have always be considered one of best authenticated story of kind on record though be not known beyond family village for several year augustus melcombe know be name of dear grandmother only brother father heir be father only son two daughter born between died in infancy that poor young fellow died at sea just at time a be supposed that expired wraith appeared to old woman becky maddison then very young girl be sorry to say old woman have made gain of story people often used to come to hear certainly doe not always tell exactly same people inquiry suppose suggestion have induced to add to version be giving be what first told mr melcombe mentioned book in valentine must find repeated from memory impressive conclusion story of young man appearance to have be repeatedly told by girl before family became alarmed at protracted absence be during long war worst feared be that might have be taken prisoner more than three year after member of family met by accident when hundred of mile away from home naval officer who have sailed in ship to young lieutenant belonged heard from not without deep emotion at very time at very hour youth have died at sea there be only one mistake in version continued mr melcombe be that know exact time when young man died cuthbert melcombe be not told month even only year surely be very important mistake said valentine yes for to consider who believe in supernatural stone be certain however that girl told story within day two told often so that be known in village be certain also that be at sea that never came home be undoubtedly true that cuthbert when in london heard account for wrote mother home description of whole interview with officer name ship have seen letter read over several time year of death at sea be mentioned not day now day of ghost appearance can not be wrong about be that before night of great gale did such damage in part that for year must not be forgotten have read letter say yes be important one suppose fancy that be not read by one dear grandmother till after poor cuthbert melcombe sad death then think family lawyer found among paper when have to inherit estate may have wanted evidence perhaps that augustus melcombe be dead perhaps so said valentine be just of usual sort see story blue light hovering about head ghost walked in shroud saw seam in yes then passed through door without opening added laura who be present how dear grandmother disliked woman showed sort of fear too of door made sure believed story very natural said mr melcombe sighing that must not bear to have misfortune made subject for idle talk curiosity be sure must feel keenly hurt if be ever said that poor innocent darling haunted place have anything be said against in lifetime valentine next ventured to ask have done anything be likely to put into people head to say might be uneasy in grave oh nothing of sort said laura then old becky be thought to have added circumstance to story so that came from cause to be discredited of late be almost forgotten now never believed at certainly be odd coincidence that must have told of man who never came back to contradict who really did die appears about time valentine accordingly went in course of few day to find old becky maddison cottage be not far from village only daughter be below when valentine have told name errand went up stair perhaps to prepare mother to whom presently conducted valentine found poor bedridden creature weak frail querulous be in clean moderately comfortable bed when saw puckered face faded eye began to look more intelligent attentive presently remarked on likeness to father chair be set for sitting down showed sovereign in palm said want to hear ghost story tell a really be will have shabby book be lying on bed can tell better'n be told here said daughter valentine took up book be same that knew blue light shroud appeared in put money into hand said will have money beforehand now then say what really saw old becky clutched gold said in weak whimpering tone 'tai often tell ai told sin christmas marnin ' old madam must abide to hear o old madam gone said valentine seriously ay be wer saint sings in heaven now want to hear thereupon old woman roused little with voice manner of one repeating lesson told valentine word for word trumpery tale in book how have seen mr melcombe early in morning a went up to house on washing day to help servant for madam widow already have leave to live there till must return be walking in shroud among cherry tree looked seriously at passed turned instantly have disappeared must have gone right through crack of door valentine be vexed yet relieved ridiculous tale must only be invention yet if must have told in different word have added anything might have led to discovery might at least have shown how came to pas story have obtained credit be be said feigning content must like to ask question perhaps daughter will not mind going down with evident reluctance daughter withdrew valentine door came back to place naturally enough cared nothing about story so approached only thing did care about in matter want to ask one thing ghost say appeared to well what do think be for what did want what did mean evident surprise on part of listener must have come for something valentine added when remained silent have never considered what ay sir sure ly came to let folk know be gone be think what else must come for answered nobody have ever said then that came for anything else thought valentine poor ghost be not accused of crime there be crime known of concerning family place must be imputed to be sure have nothing more to say to ne'er word sir blessed marnin ' thank kindly perhaps valentine have never felt better pleased in life than did when went down narrow dark stair after interview with becky maddison to find without doubt be fool impostor be not what must have softened heart opened purse for have feared to encounter story far more than have known till now that fear be over so when got down to daughter be gracious generously gave leave to come to house for wine other comfort that old woman might require will come see from time to time added a went way for with old woman last word have snapped chain have barred road to melcombe be must dispense charity pay due from henceforth without fear superstition enjoy revenue about time something occurred at john mortimer house made people hold up hand exclaim what next must be difficult matter to tell that story correctly considering how many have hand in telling of that two of told in least degree alike considering also that mr mortimer who certainly must have told greater part of have so far a be known never told at everybody said have knocked up swan mr swan at six o'clock one morning sent former to call up matthew coachman who also lived out of house said swan when admitted fact to after questioner matthew never will forgive for doing hate to get order through other folk specially through allus grudge respect a family ca help feeling for not that get share count nothing if be mine too 'd like to pluck very summer out of almanack keep in own little back parlour everybody said also that mr swan have made fire that morning in mr mortimer kitchen that matthew have waited on four daughter at breakfast nobody else being in house gentle simple gentle simple be certainly true for governess have taken departure two day previously after everybody said that matthew brought carriage round mr mortimer put in girl got in telling matthew to drive to wigfield hall where mr brandon coming out to meet with look of surprise said giles be early visitor mr brandon answered more welcome john everybody said also that four miss mortimer remained for several day with mr brandon very happy seemed though people knew more naturally said good deal more always do said that mr mortimer coming home unexpectedly after journey in middle of night found kitchen chimney on fire of servant asleep on floor nothing like so sober a must have be others said found dance going on in servant hall cook waltzing with policeman several gentleman of same craft being present others again said that when returned found house not only empty open that sat down waited in lowering passion till returned in two fly from festivity at public house in wigfield then meeting at door retained fly waving hand ordered off premise saw very shortly depart locked door behind be comfort to be able to invent so many story not necessary to make tally for one must contradict certainly not one of four miss mortimer for have be fast asleep whole time mr mortimer held peace while staying with mr mr brandon till must reconstruct household be observed at first to be out of spirit vastly inclined to be out of temper did very best to hide must not hide sort of look half shame half amusement must now then steal round corner of mouth a if have come out of hiding place to take survey of thing in general john mortimer have perhaps rather prided on penetration power of good government order respectability of household other matter of description have be taught in rather ignominious fashion that have overvalued in particular be always treated by stranger whom employed with great deal of respect deference be mainly owing to somewhat commanding presence good deal of personal dignity when same people got used to perceived bonhomie of character carelessness about money matter easy household way be sometimes known to take more advantage of from having needlessly feared at first said to giles be very evident now that must marry owe to mother of child in fact to mr brandon said to mr walker when next day two lady met be alone together excepting for presence of st george mortimer brandon did not signify house might have be robbed continued child burnt in bed giles told afterwards yes emily looked uncomfortable one never know how men may discus matter when be alone hope if john ever asked advice of giles must not here pause must not recommend one in particular said dorothea looking down on baby face oh be certain must not think of thing besides idea that have one to suggest have know never entered head said without looking at emily in matter of fact tone if one have discovered anything other be aware of must still here at least feel perfectly safe sister of hers even to own husband must never speak be giles said gave various ludicrous particular repeated with sincere sigh ' must marry be dire necessity that giles laughed so did poor john said emily there certainly be not much in first marriage to tempt into second so suppose giles encouraged saying a often doe that have never known happiness worth mentioning till married dear said dorothea answered did not pitch into matrimony like man taking header into fathomless pool be in love old fellow be not why have not decided yet on lady can not mean therefore to marry forthwith emily besides must be literal truth that have not even half unconsciously real preference for one must not have talked so openly to giles doe not even foresee preference hope to help to preference very soon thought added aloud dear will stay dine with emily replied that must not be to dine with neighbour shortly departed in possession of most imprudent speech john have ever made for be usually most reticent must not guess of course that one of assertion time have already falsified have decided on lady while notion that must marry have slumbered thought that emily must be wife have slumbered also that morning driving towards wigfield have stopped at own house to give order then have gone up into parliament to fetch out small possession that twin daughter wanted there standing for moment to look about eye have fallen on throne instantly image of emily have recurred to attitude a held little child to give step mother to child have always be painful thought might be snubbed misrepresented to uncherished unloved emily there be tender grace of motherhood in action towards little child yearning sense of loss found best appeasement in pretty exaction artless dependence of small young creature emily might spoil step child if have must not be unkind cold opinion became moderately pleased conviction be so much right thing once contemplated became only thing recalled image again a looked at empty throne did not leave room till have fully decided to set on when john went back to dinner soon managed to introduce name found about very willing to talk of seemed so natural in house john recalled of anecdote of joyous girlhood for dorothea benefit laughed over together talked good deal that evening of emily made difference to john intention be fully formed already so next morning having quite recovered spirit almost forgotten what have said three day before to host remarked to just a finished dressing have be widow now rather more than year sooner do better sat down to cogitate be not yet breakfast time well said be sweet creature what must have wonder took little red morocco case from pocket book opened father be exceedingly fond of next said nothing must have pleased better father have inherited very fine diamond ring from old cousin have be in habit of wearing john who never decked in jewellery of sort have lately taken ring to london left with jeweller to be altered so a to fit lady finger intended for future wife have just be sent back to people say there be fool like old fool might be said with equal truth there be folly like folly of wise man can not possibly play part of lover said mr mortimer face actually changed hue slightly when spoke how will manage to give to looked at splendid gem glittering sparkling hate insincerity continued then having taken out ring inspected a if wished must help turning round on tip of middle finger trust must think so like of course do will settle on anything giles plea must act like gentleman not pretend to romantic feeling pause be rather odd thing further reflected that so many woman a have asked so many a have actually let other woman ask for so many a know might now have almost at week notice must have taken into head that must have one who doe care for straw will laugh at very likely will take though pause wo have one else be determined will agree to anything demand here sunbeam diamond darted forth to meet one flash made wink if will only undertake to reign rule bring up child for will do well love too be very domestic fellow will be fond of yes know will soon wind round little finger here remembering sweetness of liberty sighed will lay matter before morning will not forget respect due to to myself half laughed will soon know well enough what be come for if stick fast will probably help shut up ring never have have least touch of romance in nature know that know did love first husband bit then looked at rather at coat in long glass fitted to perfection if crash have not brought to point might have waited till somebody else won there go breakfast bell well think be decidedly glad on whole chapter xxix unheard of liberty if come not then play be marred go not forward doth midsummer night dream miss christie grant sitting with emily at ten o'clock in morning heard ring at bell thought knew pricked up head to listen a ceased tinkling bustled out of room first virtue of companion in miss christie grant view be to know how to be judiciously absent mr mortimer emily be writing when looked up on hearing word saw john mortimer advancing of course have be thinking of thinking with much more hope than heretofore also with much more pride when have stood remote object of such impassioned to hitherto such unknown love transformed everything about imparted to almost unbearable charm power to draw nearer nearer without knowing wanting at have felt that must die for have not hoped to live for spend happy life at side did not hope yet only felt that blissful possibility be thrown down before might take up if must knew that strange absorbing love like splendid flower have opened out in path be one supreme blossom of life that life be too short for unfolding of such last few hour have taught something more be now just possible that might pretend to gather flower have something to learn then before must wear must love felt that own love must break heart emily have not one of poverty stricken nature be never glad excepting for special reason drawing above be naturally joyous happy unless under pressure of active sorrow shaded sky quenched sunshine lived in elevated region full of love wonder taking kindly alike to reverence to hope be seldom excited feeling be not willow enough to be easily troubled with excitement made fitful with agitation there be in nature suave harmony sweet gracious calm love did not so much disturb a enrich change love have be born in sacred loneliness of sorrow complicated with tender longing towards little child nourished in silence with beautiful shame pride impassioned fear yet be necessary to even in withdrawal from object even though must be denied expression for ever necessary to life that troubled raised enriched with vision of withheld completeness be dimmed by tear of half divine despair rose held out hand when smiled with certain air of embarrassment did also observed that be sensitive about ridiculous affair have led to turning out household besides early call made feel not in way to discompose a if be taken into number of lady among whom meant to make selection yes be a have hoped warmed to heart to see not le be aware of ridiculous side of vision of long sustained conversation set call careful observation in various house rose up before be not in nature to be unamused at peculiar position that have confessed to have not decided on lady felt that knew more of than supposed embarrassment making quite at ease smile kept peeping out a with natural grace began to talk to emily be laughing at presently said too laughed felt at ease yielded to charm that few men must resist so far a to become at home pleased with hostess for making so of course be john answered must think of being occupied with one else just now then began to talk discursively a be at large john seemed to be fetching wide compass emily hardly knew what be about till suddenly observed that have ventured on dangerous ground managed to give little twist to conversation soon brought back again half turned looked up at surprised while occupied with favourite piece of embroidery be matching silk holding up to light have risen be leaning against side of bay window frequent attitude with for what be called occasional chair be often rather frail small for accommodating large tall man drawing room sofa be sometimes exceedingly low in one eye must have passed for fine man something more to who must see than merely handsome man for curve of mouth have mastery in eye be full of grave sweetness emily be always delighted with somewhat unusual meeting in of personal majesty with good humoured easy bonhomie have caused late discomfiture half turned looked up how charming be thought a looked down there will be grace beauty into bargain proceeded in pursuit of what considered sincere gentlemanlike to venture on dangerous ground again not being aware how quaked under casual mention of acquaintance who have lately married gave chance that thought wanted must be happy enough people might in general be happy enough hinted glancing from particular instance to lay down general proposition if did not expect too much if be le romantic for have not presumption to expect more than sincere liking cordial approval such a must entertain be only feeling have ever inspired did not say felt presently alluded to late wife then reverting to former speech said yet be happy with consider be fortunate moderate thought emily a much a be possible for to say continued have laid under obligation make impossible for ever to forget feel blessing of having child about also what owe to on account never spend day without thinking of poor janie thought emily very much touched did not deserve tribute how coldly have often heard talk of then not without certain grave sweetness of manner that made heart ache alike with tender shame to think how little dead husband have ever be accounted of compared with now possible future one with such jealousy a one may feel of dead wife who must have cared a little for long remembrance a have done for living affection emily listened while managed quite naturally by slightest hint to bring also in past lot opinion felt rather than heard intention must not presume to say went on be not sure whether man might hope for second marriage must have advantage of first yet thought that in suitable marriage there might be enough benefit on side to make almost equally equally what emily wondered john be trying to speak in very matter of fact way a merely laying down view equally advantageous said at last not without difficulty john said emily rallying little speaking with least little touch of audacity john be always fond of advancing abstract theory now must have thought that if man have felt want in first marriage must have tried for something more in second rather than have determined that there be more to be have unless reason assured in more sober hour that have have given must in reason be expected john answered did not confess to having felt want presently added call since plea abstract theory then emily felt that too must speak dead husband deserved of far more than dead wife have ever done do please answered can be only abstract theory to knew want of love in marriage only frequent self reproach to think be unworthy because must not enough return most needle self reproach answered venture to hope that people must never rebuke because happen to be incapable of romantic passion of folly of youthful love intended to restore self esteem will not soon be able to make feel differently thought emily still remember janie will never let be disparaged think none worse of for beloved hope be silent till glanced up at again with sweet wistfulness be rather frequent with turning half round for stood at side not quite enough at ease to look continually in face be much surprised to find so charming so naive in movement in flitting expression of face be pleased too though very much surprised to find that did not seem conscious of intention most lovely blush have spread over face when spoke of husband so far from expecting what be just about to say have thrown back in progress more than once did not seem to be expecting anything yet have said good deal reflected have let know expect to inspire romantic love pretend to be in love with come forward admiring trusting preferring to other woman though can not come a lover to foot began to talk again emily be little startled to find in few minute alluding to domestic discomfort intention of standing for borough have now little red box in hand when said john wish must not stand there came sat nearly opposite to showed what be in father diamond ring remembered doubt have just have diamond reset emily took out ring laid in palm look small said must not have thought must fit john will let try if will fit answered before have recovered from surprise have put on finger there be very awkward pause then drew off can hardly expect said hand trembled little to accept very costly present be not reason for returning knew not what to say must not ask replied unless must offer desire to make wife beg to accept hand accept hand what now directly today exclaimed almost piteously tear trembled on eye lash yes answered repeating word with something like ardour now directly to day be sorely in want of wife must fain take home a soon a ban must let emily why have be taking possible pain to let know that love in least a far a foresee mean to love answered two great tear falling on hand when tried to take hers john how dare be not naturally passionate startled now into passionate appeal snatched away hand rose in haste drew back from with flashing eye heaving bosom too soon short relief have found in anger be quenched in tear that did not try to check stood wept very pale very much discomfited sat before in place beg pardon presently said not in least aware of what really meant beg entreat pardon scarcely thought forgive saying scarcely thought considering past position a father of large family that must have consented to wooing in girl boy fashion make wish for once in life yes very heartily wish have be le direct le candid added rather bitterly thought here emily heard call fool thought must approve do answered with great sobbing sigh oh there be nothing more for to say must not entreat now to let teach to love felt with sinking heart that if took word for refusal by mean gentle one must not be wondered at presently said still looking amazed pale for be utterly unused to woman tear a much agitated now in man fashion a be in hers if have spoken earlier in widowhood than approve displeases hope will believe have always thought of a wife to be admired above ever knew husband loved answered drying eye now almost calmly must not say be displeased on account when looked up saw that john mortimer have hat in hand interview be nearly over can not lose a friend said voice faltered oh dear john child be so fond of love always will looked at for moment doubtful whether to hold out hand forget emily let thing be a have be heretofore between yes answered gave hand good bye said stooped to kiss be gone stood quite still listening yet listening till possible chance be over of catching longer sound of step no more tear only great aching emptiness unhoped for chance have be hers have lost knowingly what else must have done scarcely knew how long remained

dane valentine be at melcombe again have begun several improvement about place called for time must cost money be not without misgiving that have consented to enter on first of there be still in mind a believed reservation must give up property if ever saw fit cause now if began to tie by engaging in expensive enterprise by undertaking responsibility might be impossible to do therefore held off for little time fell into first enterprise almost unawares got out of reluctant shrinking from afterwards by curious sophistry while estate be virtually mine thought be undoubtedly duty to be good steward of if in course of providence be shown that be to give up doubt will also be shown how to proceed about minor matter have learnt from uncle doctrine of particular providence have not received with uncle habit of earnest waiting on providence straightforward desire to follow wherever believed to lead valentine came almost at once under influence of vicar mr craik man who have always seen something so more than commonly mysterious about way of god to men mr craik wanted valentine to restore old church by meant to pull almost to piece to raise roof to clear away quaint old oaken gallery to push out long chancel to put in painted window literally such picture of glass thing done at munich when valentine always facile have begun to consider matter drawing of building a be to look when restored be made in order to stir up zeal make long for parish church must do vicar credit beheld forthwith vowed with uncivil directness that must rather build vicar crack church to mind in middle of village than help in having that dear old place mauled tampered with mr craik sooner heard than began to talk about site be good man have learned to be meek so that when be after anything desirable might be able to take rebuff not mind in pleasant summer evening often came to see valentine while latter sauntered about with cigar must carve face on stick with knife walking beside have given up smoking because wanted poor also to give up a expensive luxury one led to drinking valentine respected be sure scent of cigar be still very pleasant to nostril knew must well have afforded to smoke be one reason why let be persuaded in matter of site people never be persuaded by reason worth mentioning reason be that mr craik have become teetotaller for know old fellow give such pull in persuading drunkard third reason be that there be bit of land in middle of village just thing for site worth nothing covered with stone thistle mr craik said must have much better congregation felt sure if church be not in such extremely inconvenient out of way place aged saint who be gone have often regretted inconvenience for people valentine at last gave site mr craik remarked on what comfort must have be to aged saint if must have known what good churchman heir must prove valentine be not at what mr craik meant by good churchman such religious opinion feeling a have influence over have come from evangelical school old father uncle have be very religious men of type almost a matter of course in early day evangelical religion have be a river of god one channel in higher thought fervent feeling ran valentine have respected religion have seen that be real that made contented happy able to face death with something more than hope able to acquiesce in wonderful reservation of god with men more able on account of to look on life a childhood of next to wait for knowledge patiently yet of form taken by religious feeling valentine considered most inconvenient of view of christianity most difficult to satisfy told vicar did not see why grandmother be to be called saint because have gone through great misfortune because have pleased to be trundled to church on sunday saint day besides attending to other ordinance of church sacrament when be mildly admonished that site seemed to presuppose church assented with one great plunge during distinctly felt that position a landlord be not to be defended that good use of money might make thing more secure gave promise to build one felt twinge of compunction glow of generosity blushed hotly when mr craik observed that old church being put in decent repair chiefly used for marriage for burial service might perhaps be pleasing testimony filial act to dedicate new one to st elizabeth simply in reverend recollection know melcombe of having be be grandmother name must like said valentine abruptly mr craik be not sure whether evident shrinking be due to low church scruple a to dedication at whether name of sainted elizabeth have startled by reminding of self renunciation self denial even to death of in world love long for elizabeth grandmother might have be saintly old woman in conversation patience piety for anything valentine knew to contrary have hold now of account knew from from investigation made among tenant that have held hard grip of possession have sometimes driven shrewd bargain even up to extreme old age have often shown rather more than match for of about thing to be done by others have seen to with vigilance thing to be done by have shown masterly power of leaving undone property have considerably increased during term of possession though in ordinary charity good deal have be given away be in order heir whom have never seen be reaping fruit of judgment saving whether ought to be called saint rather doubted have returned to melcombe not without shrewd suspicion that cousin be soon to be brother in law letter following closely on step have confirmed time in september expected summons to be present at wedding wished after to travel for several month so allowed mr craik to persuade that good intention ought not to be put off made arrangement for commencement of new church at once be to cost about three thousand pound large sum payment be to be spread over three four year valentine at present have few other claim have for instance poor relation at least thought not have scarcely given word for building of church when received letter from mr peter melcombe ugly name thought valentine mr valentine melcombe will sound much better oh suppose young woman will be mr

moped to death emily folded up letter with sensation of pain disappointment have hoped that prosperity must do so much for valentine wondered to find dissatisfied restless when life can yield be within reach next letter showed that meant to stay at melcombe winter complained more from time instead of stuffing letter with joke good bad made grave short emily be driven to conclusion that rumour must be right rumour declared that young mr melcombe be breaking heart for pretty foolish laura at last easter holiday arrived johnnie came home forthwith emily received letter from valentine with long promised invitation cherry orchard be in blossom pear tree be nearly out wanted sister john mortimer to come bring whole tribe of child make long stay with extraordinary thing be packed up a

yet nearer together for rest of evening pleased with thought next morning wanted to see beautiful house garden valentine be showman whole family accompanied wandering among great white pear tree dark yew then going into stable yard to see strange old out building with door of heavy ancient oak then on to glen valentine did not seem to care about beautiful house rather disparaged be not to say well enough ' when be beautiful observed anastasia then with what be considered by elder portion of party to be pretty specimen of childish sagacity hugh admonished little sister must praise own thing be not good manner talk in way to make think that be not conceited really know in heart that be very handsome be grander than father mamma dear asked anastasia think so sweet answered emily laughing see be not too grand val to use father old repeater said valentine who have be consulting rather shabby old watch who now excused for leaving party on ground of appointment that have made likeness of have in house be among thing most value did appointment matter to john noticed that walked a if weary reluctant perhaps to leave be only person who noticed anything for must understand that place be full of nest sort of bird built there even heron to stand at brink of glen actually see look down on to glossy back of brooding mother count nest wealth incalculable of egg of sort to do not to be sure yet whether will ever finger be sensation for boy that a mr weller said be more easier conceived than described so valentine went in there be two appointment for to keep one with doctor one with lawyer first told have unduly tired must lie down so lying down in grandmother favourite sitting room received second must decide on nothing because have not yet found opportunity to consult person principally concerned so after man of law have departed valentine continued to lie quietly on sofa for perhaps hour closed eye have almost air of man who be trying to gather strength for something that have to do child voice roused at last emily be moving up garden towards house leaning on john arm two younger child be with others having dispersed about place valentine sat up to gaze a face got nearer sudden anguish be not envy overcame be not so much splendour of manly prime strength struck with contrast to not so much even sight of love a of hope spring bloom be more than must bear how sufficient to seemed how charming emily be woman destined to inspire life long love seldom show much consciousness of never saw fellow so deeply in love with wife thought valentine surely know be saying to john have stopped under great fruit tree near garden door john bent down one of blossom laden bough fair almost pale stood in delicate white shadow looking at beautiful manhood womanhood beautiful childhood health peace valentine laid down again shut eye emily have betrayed little anxiety about that morning be very thin said must take care of oh yes have answered will do have be very unwell be better now then have noticed that john looked at uneasily seemed disturbed when coughed thought that a stood under fruit tree john have caught sight of knew must come up a soon a found opportunity here be thought valentine not moving from place simply lifting up head a john entered what have done with emily asked emily be gone up to dressing room mean to hear child read ah exclaimed valentine with sudden laugh of good humoured raillery of womankind john have evidently secured pearl 'one entire perfect chrysolite know think so yes answered john gravely put off dear fellow what do

almost with irritation a if longed to leave subject of health be urgent to talk of business matter john mortimer with a much indifference a must assume tried to meet wish have be in possession of estate almost year said so hope indeed assume that making of will be not what have neglected be rather awkward thing to be said to heir at law paused for moment then remarked met just now driving away from door very man who read to grandmother will have be telling that will make one for forthwith when consider that have many claim said john consider further that property be land wonder at neglect yes knew must say so when will be done then to morrow then valentine began to talk of other matter expressed with directness certainly not called for regret that john mortimer must have made sacrifice

valentine now have got partner be settled said john declining to argue question fully mean to retire from probable rich to moderate competence quite have a say made great sacrifice in order to do so rather wonder at valentine added there be great risk hardly in fact at repent choice said john with smile in eye showed valentine how useless be to say more john be amused surprised not moved at from determination thought proper to add father a know left two thousand pound to one of child gave same sum to valentine broke in said property be land be not so john will no longer be rich man will be

thing be too superstitious emily have nothing to say in reply have made involuntary betrayal of thought shrank from seeing husband in brother place because be anxious about afraid for same brother have even now then foreboding fear lest ere long must see john there for good to think so be to take good deal for granted now valentine chose to show that have understood feeling perfectly must fain
