outset that private information received from cape on share be to be bought up be put up thing a must have expressed between ramsay marston loring knowledge affected not at black thread in warp of character be running strong deep now to such consideration sensibility be absolutely dormant well monosyllable broke from eager impetuous a though contained pent up suspense excitement of hour have come up rapidly to lorings side latter without lifting eye signed to evening paper lay on table a said briefly right julian face turned quite white snatched up paper turned with breathless eagerness to column devoted to money market welcome diamond company share blue eye seemed to leap at line fasten on with hungry avidity pitiful to see stood there gazing at with glittering fascinated eye with curious stillness upon from head to foot a though remembrance of actual surroundings thought even of loring have faded nearly five minute have passed when loring laid down pen leant back in chair turning little that might fix eye on julian a stood rather behind pretty fair said carelessly julian lifted eye from paper turned white face to loring nodded a though feeling of moment be not to be put into speech then slow deep colour of excitement began to creep over feature have seen ramsay said in low quick voice saw morning told thing be beginning to move be that paragraph yesterday that did what about keeping up said julian be ticklish moment take whats next move have thrown into chair a spoke voice be jerking with eagerness a though of excitement be finding expression loring looked

concealed in background of life made money desperate necessity with be next move answered indicating sheet of manuscript paper lay before will be in one two of paper to morrow if im not mistaken will have big effect julian stretched out hand impulsively for sheet ran through now then breaking into eager comment a finished rose impetuously began to pace excitedly up down room face be flushed now

put best part of thirty thousand into of pocket boy rose a spoke gathered together sheet of manuscript a did so quick ear caught strange sharp catch in julian breath fastened up paper directed with of slight smile then turned again to younger man julian be standing at window staring almost stupidly out im going to turn out now said loring lightly coming down to club with julian turned round word seemed to penetrate slowly to consciousness no said at last thanks old man im going to get home have to go to own chamber first appeared however loring left with careless right see to night of course sunshine have left julian room bright a still be outside looked perhaps darker by contrast a opened door shut in alone paused moment with hand on lock then walked aimlessly across to writing table sat down there be pale dazed look about line in evening paper at have gazed with such devouring eye have chronicled first important rise of share on hope be staked chronicled in fact beginning of end a sat there alone word seemed to stand out about to meet eye in direction be little wonder that a realised that seed so eagerly sown have indeed broken ground at last perfect fruit seemed to be already in hand be dazed intoxicated with anticipated triumph have blood of speculator gambler in vein a sprang up suddenly from chair began to pace up down room be surging of speculator instinct that flushed face glittered in eye rioting of money passion to man who have never felt fever be strangest most repulsive a be most abnormal of passion little by little without volition even consciousness on part current of thought changed gradually that greedy tumultuous contemplation of money a end wavered altered into contemplation of money a mean into passing over of mean in realisation of end be to bring about be thinking of clemence thinking of in tumult of excitement in goading of two edged dart of love shame quivered always in better nature be absolutely unfelt thinking of in very hallucination of intoxicated triumph be living out with future life of triumphant satisfaction life so utterly incompatible with fact of case with have come gone must still come go a to be most pathetic imagining when sound of clock striking brought suddenly to first conscious thought be certain vague surprise at surroundings a far a external went have left lorings room have come to own like man walking in sleep then realised nature of sound have roused drew out watch to see what hour be that have struck be seven fact with pressing necessity for return home involved gave turn to current of thought by without changing main character be blended in with actual practicality of moment thought of mother with certain bitter triumph not for long said to not for long now mind ran on over detail of evening before little dinner only ourselves mr romayne have said gaily artificiality must pas between mother effective flirtation must have to keep up with miss pomeroy flirtation in excitement of past month have carried on recklessly then with hand on door stopped abruptly stopped stood quite still with strange defiant recklessness growing in face whether be curious effect of tumult through have passed whether originated in jubilant vision of clemence from have so recently awakened be not possible to say on instant there have risen within impulse of fierce overmastering repulsion against mother against miss pomeroy against part have chosen to play almost before have realised sudden sense of overwhelming revolt distaste have seized obverse be upon clemence to see clemence to speak to clemence to satisfy hungry longing for moment seemed absolutely to posse such longing in various form degree have shaken torn often before hitherto something influence from clemences own word jarring throbbing of better nature in have held back now strung up carried out of by excitement be impervious to consideration save that of own overmastering craving end be very near now told be question of week two only must see must see that be only reasonable that must see plan be laid in passing of few second only address clemence have given be that of house of business where worked where have worked when met first only chance of seeing lay in meeting when left work at night must not go home to dinner decided must telegraph to mother dine at quiet restaurant must bring a knew well enough to earliest hour at hand of whom clemence made one be likely to be released must wait in little by street in hand entrance be situated until came went out of room with quick assured step sent off telegram brief detained inconsolable from office in fleet street then carefully avoiding fashionable resort walked to restaurant have mentally selected little street for score of men woman formed picture evoked by name for shopping population of london involved mental vision of busy thoroughfare considerable expanse of plate glass window ran parallel to thoroughfare divided from only by long block of building bearing in mind slight nature of division between two contrast presented be almost startling little street be thoroughfare inasmuch a led from one side street to street be very little frequented connecting link between be short cut to nowhere represented simply so many back entrance to place of business being to great extent monopolised by single firm coming going at stated time of hand employed by firm be often only movement broke quiet from morning until night in interval between coming going there brooded over street such silence stillness a seemed strangely incompatible with thought of labour effort that held with hard day work towards coming footstep in morning be bent with hard day work lay behind departing footstep in evening street have squalid neglected look too a though life activity have passed by day work be not over yet though evening light be making long shadow setting sun be turning upper window of opposite house into ruddy fire street be absolutely silent deserted when julian turned quickly into pulled up surveyed surroundings with rapid comprehensive glance be too early yet looked at watch told so with somewhat over elaborated carelessness took out cigarette case lighted cigarette pacing slowly up down pavement on opposite side of street to on expected clemence to emerge began to reckon with chance for against speedy tardy appearance such practical matter of fact consideration involved deliberate mental action on part having gone through urged by curious instinct under intense excitement always desire to assert a absolute calm sanity gradually let slip away again from practical actual gave up to tide of exhilarated imaginings there be nothing more exciting nothing sooner quickens mental pulse into very fever of confusion than sudden indulgence of impulse long resisted hour have passed since idea of presence in quiet little street be outcome have flashed into julian mind dominated have carried a completely out of out of touch with reality a be man under influence of absinthe a man so exhilarated will be impervious to considerable amount of physical pain so julian be for time being absolutely unconscious of anything painful shameful in position circumstance under have parted from clemence bitter pain longing under have smarted writhed with such fierce rebellion attitude towards conduct might only too justly have created in wife be absolutely obliterated from mind be waiting now husband master altogether superior triumphant successful self assured for mistaken doubtless submissive wife conscious rather pleased with consciousness that loved in spite of fault one quarter after chimed out from neighbouring clock have be waiting nearly hour oblivious in elation of tedium weariness oblivious of claim upon of life of queen anne street a though have existence for slight feeling of impatience with realised that fourth quarter be chiming be entirely unconnected with such external be eloquent testimony to mental attitude that took form of faint sense of irritation with clemence for delaying so long vague feeling of lordly disapproval of conduct stirred in a paused at top of street glanced across at still fast closed door be just looking dubiously at cigarette case when click of latch instantly followed by sound of girl voice made start violently thrust case hastily into pocket walked quickly down street until be standing just opposite door from little stream of girl woman be pouring forth several figure have already detached from stream be moving rapidly away either singly in pair one quick glance told that neither of be clemence fixed eye with eager confidence on doorway through have still to pas face be flushed with intense excitement on came stream girl woman following one in unbroken succession pretty girl plain girl shabby girl smart girl arm in arm laughing talking in loud voiced group several of group noticed waiting figure commented upon in giggling whisper turning back a passed down street to look at again julian only saw that none of be clemence stream be beginning to dwindle straggler followed one now at irregular interval two girl who have be last to appear have nearly reached end of street still julian eye be riveted on open doorway girl turned corner down dim passage into be looking there came slowly figure quite alone before have emerged into light julian be across road a though one great throb with heart leapt up to meet have impelled physically a clemence passed out into soft dusk of june evening spoke name eagerly at first then with strange break in voice clemence clemence at first sound of voice evidently first sign to that be near low indescribable cry broke from clemence turned towards trembling swaying a stood julian caught in arm lest must fall youve come cried before exquisite rapture relief of faint quivering voice with that implied of suffering past harder man than julian might have melted dear dear knew youd come knew knew pathetic voice have not be needed first sight of face a turned upon with wonderful irradiation of joy upon have shrivelled into nothingness exultation triumph self satisfaction of past few hour julian held in arm trance over self convicted self condemned whole consciousness absorbed in heavy throbbing agony of better nature have leapt into sudden relentless life what be that so penetrated must not have defined where in what proportion old influence revived touched be blended with heart piercing sense of change in must not have said did not even know that be indeed power have struck change in even a gazed down at face with agonised remorseful eye a rested for one moment on shoulder rather felt than traced understood that change be very great past six month have dealt heavily with thin white face mark of passing be plain to see even in moment of absolute transfiguration curve suggestion of girlishness seemed to have be worn away worn away by cruel twin refiner never so pitiless a when work together physical suffering mental distress outline of feature have lost of beauty in intense accentuation colourless lip be slightly drawn under sunken eye be heavy shadow remembrance of physical loveliness have lost must stand for instant before spiritual loveliness have gained be a though twin refiner before whom nothing earthly external can stand flourish have strengthened that lay behind external with have dealt so ruthlessly eye so indescribably beautiful a looked now into julian have be beautiful even in moment before realised presence beautiful in heaviness a brightness a common happiness must have made beautiful with perfect patience dignity of accepted suffering tired mouth have be beautiful in repose a be beautiful now in tremulous rapture beautiful in quiet constancy self abnegation let rest for moment in arm clinging to with something in touch have never felt before looking up into face a head lay back against shoulder with strange tremulous tender light quivering on feature shaken from head to foot by little tremulous tearless sob sob of utter relief peace then disengaged gently drew away something of first ecstasy dying out of face to leave soft happy beyond word strange light still shone in eye a moved one thin hand retained clinging hold on arm a though instinct of dependence influenced involuntarily be dressed not a other girl have be in light summer jacket in long cloak a drew about with other hand softest touch of colour came into white cheek dear said softly dear julian whispered hoarsely a have whispered again again clemmie clemmie made attempt to take in arm again even gesture with laid hand upon clinging finger on sleeve be diffident almost tremulous tender reverent a gesture of have ever be in life before must find word in presence everything triumph have seemed to necessity reality of life seemed to have fallen away from be nothing have nothing must say nothing to there be silence silence for clemence a finger closed round soft colour came went in cheek breathed ineffable content silence for julian held blackest depth of self revelation contempt be broken at last by clemence be done dear said gently julian hand turned cold in hers eye fell away from face not not yet clemmie faltered wretchedly came to tell to tell that that be going to do that be going to do dear dear mean that oh mean that dont have not raised voice changed pose that touch upon arm have become close convulsive grip even clutch of worn blanched hand upon cloak witnessed to agony of supplication with nerve be strained quivering low voice thrilled vibrated with white face to first word have brought look of heart sick disappointment be embodied prayer must not answer on instant cut like lash went on rapidly low beseeching voice breaking trembling with intense feeling flickered on face like light julian for sake for wife sake dear love so need so dont part longer if be for good if be to make happy there nothing must not face face cheerfully ah know that dont youre doing wrong think of always make loneliness so cant bear oh cant bear broke suddenly into low shuddering sob tear head fell forward helplessly on to breast though still kept convulsive hold upon arm put other arm round drew towards a did so seemed to realise with kind of double consciousness course must take utter contemptibility dont clemmie dear dont dont said in broken uneven voice right dear im going to do came to tell so right youre going to tell be clemence promise be only only not for week two there there something must wait for be going to be be on on soul yes clemence there be moment silence broken only by low tremulous sob then too died away at last with long sighing breath raised looked into pale miserable face with own quiet exhausted must wait said with indescribable accent on first bitter word must must dear said desperately eye trying wretchedly to avoid hers shant be long promise must wait just little longer paused moment still looking into face then with sudden light in eye made slight movement a though must have bent head down might murmur in ear stopped however there settled down upon face look of unutterable sadness by julian in helpless misery of self contempt gesture have passed utterly unheeded dont let be much longer dear said good night julian caught at last word a though gave sort of chance of restoring writhing respect good night echoed not yet clemence im going to see home of course clemence shook head said steadfastly dear something in tone something in touch laid upon took from power of self assertion power of resistance to will drew head towards now kissed softly on forehead then turned went away down street leaving alone chapter iii romayne at last by jove old man thought be going to throw over voice young man voice struck out a be from indescribable medley of incongruous sound background be formed by lightest most melodious dance music produced solely from stringed instrument lute guitar seemed to predominate result have character rhythm of own be essentially graceful picturesque italian against background high pitched discord compounded of imaginable key there clashed very babel of tongue eminently unmusical voice of modern society with fault of modulation pronunciation blended into whole full of character absolutely incompatible with old time southern harmony with mingled speaker figure a stopped suddenly in hurried passage across room stood out from blaze of colour light gorgeousness of description fell without pause cessation into ever fresh combination a beautifully dressed crowd moved to fro in magnificent setting spectacle presented to eye be a curiously jarring a strikingly suggestive of ludicrous inconsistency of dreamland a be sound saluted ear there be hardly man woman to be seen whose dress be not a faithful copy of costume prevalent among florentine noble under magnificent rule of medici a time money must make there be not false note in surroundings money have be poured out like water in order that perfect reproduction of old florentine palace might be achieved a far a art must go nothing be left to be desired fault lay with nature old italian doubtless have own mannerism possibly own vulgarity of carriage gesture general demeanour theirs be not mannerism vulgarity of modern smart society young man who have greeted julian exemplified in own person preposterous incongruity of whole dress be marvel of correctness to minutest detail wearer face be of heavy inanimate bull dog type movement a shook hand with julian be exaggerated specimen of approved affectation of moment speech be clipped drawled after most approved model among masher be son of house there be kind of slow excitement about manner struggling with nonchalant carelessness evidently wished to present to world a mental attitude of moment there be note of excitement also in medley of voice about affair be huge go a young man must have expressed one of father guest be troubled for one instant by sense of ludicrousness of effect produced julian have that instant entered room have paused on threshold there be perhaps type of costume more picturesque in magnificence than of italian noble of middle age be perhaps reason why have be so extensively vulgarised julian dress be admirable specimen of kind rich graceful becoming there be subtle difference between bearing that of host though julian demeanour too be modern to finest shade wore dress well with none of other man awkwardness on contrary with absolute ease unconsciousness implied certain excited tension of nerve face be colourless very hard upon hardness there be mask of animation gaiety be sufficient for present occasion im awfully sorry dear boy said now lightly eagerly with exaggerated gesture of deprecation horribly late know give word couldnt help by jove what magnificent thing youve made of other glanced round with satisfaction tried in vain to repress not so bad be said carelessly only fellow be such fool even best of always blunder if can with wholesale condemnation of workman among whom fifty year ago grandfather might have be found screwed

of crowd have shown mother figure have realised instinctively that have seen came up to with manner about there be something indescribably reckless made low bow of gay abject apology beg ten thousand million pardon said language fails to express feeling mr romaynes dress be not success be to say be perfect in failed only a setting for wearer to deprive appearance of possibility of chic dash be to deprive of brilliancy unsuitability of colouring cut in gown must have be responsible for look underlay smile a turned to julian now struck little attitude of mock implacability with light high pitched laugh then conversation must be carried on in dumb show said for language also fails to express feeling sir what have to say for voice for gaiety be thin strained please nothing be mock humility answer met fellow beguiled be just off to america be standing with hand folded eye cast down did not see must not have understood if have seen strange flash in hard blue eye such flash a might leap up in eye of woman in silent endurance of swift stab of pain very poor excuse declared mr romayne gaily dont think will forgive yet such unscrupulous desertion must be visited a deserves dont think so lord garstin have come up to question be addressed to with light laugh a gave hand nodded pleasantly to julian a answered who have deserted not boy of yours eh mr romayne laughed again pushed julian playfully with fan oh forgot dont know wickedness of course take away from lord garstin do ill confide in gorgeous affair isnt wonder what cost lord garstin looked round with rather lofty smile there be time when pleased to pose a isolated representative of bygone age by tradition of in matter of taste breeding present age be utterly condemned rather too gorgeous to please old man said now with fine reserve dear good people must be more to taste do know if have little le money have be outside by bye really not badly done mr romayne turned away with laughing nodding to

be made little gesture with fan towards entrance to dancing room from maud pomeroy be just emerging looking like picture in white dress of simplest form long hair loose on shoulder crowned with wreath of flower dance music have stopped music still filled air came from garden with hard recklessness growing stronger on face julian made slight graceful gesture towards mother a though must have kissed hand to in gratitude turned away moved rapidly over to miss pomeroy more than three hour have gone by since julian have found standing alone gazing stupidly in direction in clemence have disappeared how first two of hour have passed hardly knew have turned abruptly away left little street to walk mechanically on on struggling blindly in black abyss of self contempt in love lived only a additional torture have emerged gradually from abyss rather sense of surrounding blackness have faded by degree a such acute sensation must so completely have that blackness walled in deadened outward perception that be only little by little with dull sense of surprise that material surroundings dawned on again realised that be standing looking down into river from thames embankment consciousness have come back to life world believed to constitute only practical reality have brought with turned environment to bitterness gall a stood leaning on parapet staring sullenly down counting reflection of lamp in

struck eleven have brought back to mind claim upon of particular evening at eleven oclock carriage have be ordered to take mr romayne party to dance grim cynical smile touched set white lip a thought of mother have broken loose temporarily told bitterly must take up part again play farce out that must throw into task with wild oblivion of proportion limitation be inevitable result of have gone before of perception blindness with be racked baffled miss pomeroy saw coming turning face away produced pretty well turned comment on arrangement of room for benefit of cavalier next instant julian stood beside dont turn back on implored gaily no fellow ever have such hard luck a ive have to night be great deal kinder to than seem to deserve forgive please miss pomeroy turned head looked at with serene calm on pretty face seemed to relegate to place among inferior object entirely indifferent to voice be perhaps little too indifferent oh mr romayne said actually appeared have said at last

indefinable expression made look ten year older twenty year harder more bitter scruple on part a to crushing dress prevented going home with must follow in hansom said before arrived miss pomeroy have said good night to mr romayne with neatly turned quite meaningless expression of pleasure evening have given have retired to room mr romayne looking haggard worn lingered until julian came in went out to meet good night mother said went straight upstairs without pausing be many many year since have left at night without kiss a mr romayne went slowly up to room through silent house stumbled once twice a though wide dry eye hardly saw stair before that creeping anxiety have gained ground greatly in face next morning when came down at about half past ten to learn from servant mr julian have already breakfasted have gone to temple even more pathetic than anxiety be courage battled against strove so hard to become confidence a led indeed sustained conversation a miss pomeroy who be late in putting in appearance breakfasted together talked lightly gaily of julian defection on visitor last morning deplored fact that be indeed last morning talking of various half formed scheme for such constant meeting a must be practically continuance of intimate association of past fortnight of response obtained little none access of conventionality demureness insipidity seemed to be inspiring miss pomeroy access characterised by certain absolute obstinacy of colourlessness have opinion sentiment of sort kind to offer expression of regret at leaving be a unmeaning a be correct mr romaynes plan seemed to wither under little non committal smile comment took irreproachable leave hour later with vaguely expressed hope that might meet somewhere apparently without hearing mr romaynes parting allusion to julian one of day followed seemed to leave upon mr romaynes face such effect a might have be produced upon marble counterpart of face by delicate application of sharp modelling tool feature became little sharper line little deeper little harder nobody noticed fact nobody must have traced to source have done so there be time when be alone time when chisel under grew more haggard day revealed a heart sick gnawing anxiety for three four day miss pomeroys hope that might meet somewhere remained unfulfilled mr romayne made little joke at what assumed to be julian disconsolate

with sprightly reproach to come see be met invariably with unmeaning smile vague word about engagement gentle a sounded proved a little capable of manipulation a stone once twice after such meeting mr romaynes joke at julian expense a told of airily afterwards julian miss pomeroy never seemed to meet now took form of hint innuendo a to whether be not at bottom of mystery a called whether must not

be suddenly stirred sense of loneliness foreboding be gone again in instant a man who be to take in to lunch approached turned from falconer with lightest possible au revoir falconer found very well situated at luncheon question came up on word carried weight discussion ensued brought home to that sense of renewed power standing in world so grateful to after long period of inaction be full of grave content satisfaction when after lunch circumstance threw again with mr romayne whole mental attitude be suffused with dignified kindliness began to speak at once with grave not unfriendly

such safeguard covenant with society heard of son engagement three week ago on what purported to be excellent authority did hear name of young lady by chance mr romayne achieved harsh little laugh a spoke falconer glanced round room lowered voice miss maud pomeroy said most desirable wife for must have said eight month before under inexplicable influence of face manner of pale dignified woman who have faced so bravely in little lodging in camden town dennis falconer have be almost ready to urge upon julian romayne marriage with girl be supposed to have ruined must have done so convinced in recess of heart to woman influence must not penetrate that course must mean ruin to young man in grim severity of mental attitude at time must have said that such ruin be just righteous consequence of young man guilt clemences disappearance have frustrated possibility of such action on part time pressing actuality of own life have obliterated impression made on whole affair have gradually faded into past insensibly to looked upon now conventionally enough a one of dark episode be in way to be obliterated lightened may must be overlaid to end seemed to in relaxation of sterner attitude thing so natural a to be necessarily condoned that julian must marry in own class settle down moment pause followed on word mr romayne be sweeping room with eye glass hand held shook little if man beside

fact at present young people will be young people know must be allowed little wilfulness also have lowered voice though be high pitched speech be almost exaggeratedly confidential influenced by tone into have thus fallen falconer said meaningly not unkindly have have to make more serious allowance hope since with laugh so light high a to be painfully out of tune mr romayne answered gaily in negative one little peccadillo said be not such very terrible thing in young man record be charmed to say that with little affair of knew anxiety on julian account have begun ended held out hand to falconer a finished assurance parting with with brightest air of society friendliness a wished good bye looking down into trivial vivacity of face falconer felt stirred for first time by certain touch of pity for coming upon softer mood comparatively friendly nature of talk eager assurance with spoke struck a being not without pathos have confidence in julian occurred to vaguely with sense of surprise if security so superficially founded must prove false blow must be somewhat disproportionate to lightness of nature on must fall next instant recollected how largely own action must have

assembly mr halse stamped hers at moment gazed for instant into lorings imperturbable face then becoming convinced of sincerity turned to mr compton with gesture of despair hilda said if somebody doesnt find out something soon will die of suspense a seemed not improbable from demeanour at moment that must obviate chance of such calamity by hurling upon one of object of interest wresting solution of mystery from by main force be perhaps a well that at moment temporary distraction presented in shape of popular actor mr halse be very fond of popular actor have be hobby with at one time in movement breaking up of group ensued loring drifted quietly away have made way gradually into big room when suddenly quickened step began to thread way skilfully rapidly through crowd mr romayne be standing on opposite side of room smiling invitation to to come speak to mr romayne have not be looking best lately somehow piquant style daring colour affected hardly suited a have be wont to do to night there be tired look upon face seemed to reveal recently traced line about mouth line of intense almost dogged determination to sparkling eye if allowed moment repose there came haggard look have seemed for last three day to lie only just beneath surface be subtle hardly perceptible point for rest remained noticeably attractive woman of most pronounced artificial type wheres boy said loring easily when have shaken hand be here mr romayne shook head laughed said rather bar soire mistake think one must take for what be of course omnium gatherum of perfectly preposterous nature looked at

question be rather obvious wasnt said gaily by bye did want to see julian there be moment pause after loring have replied pleasantly enough in negative then mr romayne looked up at suddenly said frightfully hot in here dont think suppose try one of le popular room stopped moment then added with most artificial laugh of course gather from that im going to victimise again yes do want little quiet talk with whod be conspirator there be nothing of unwilling victim at least in lorings tone manner a deprecated word be there reluctance tedium in face a followed through room on contrary be almost lighted up by expression of sudden purpose mr romayne led way to almost deserted miniature room began to walk slowly up down to intent purpose alone together there seemed to be particular point to mr romaynes desire for private conference with fellow conspirator talked about julian talked about carelessly artificially with persistence only mother must have understood slipping in little question now then on sort of detail connected with business side of man life a to said woman be always so in dark reverting again again to satisfaction reliance in mentor rather absurd to quote ridiculous old proverb said at last laughing affectedly isnt there one fable something about duck whose chicken hen whose chicken must be wouldnt must take to water agitated awfully because couldnt go after thats exactly what feel like assure look upon a exceptionally sensible water bird who be also at home on land kind of connecting link humiliating simile arent loring smiled in answer to laugh

confidence of man of world dont think that be underrating julian said that regard for personally be anything very warm sincere affair when tell that be long time now since julian have figured in thought a anything mother son because be mother son there be very few thing must not do for very little trouble must not take for hardly paused mr romayne rather broke in on speech with high pitched laugh thats very kind flattering said there be something astonishingly hasty nervous in way spoke hope doesnt come upon quite a surprise answered loring with slightest suggestion of cynical smile unseen by mr romayne hope doesnt need word of mine to show have tried to show in more practical way have honoured with great deal of confidence have honoured still further by putting in power to be of slight service to will not give still further power in direction will not make interest practically one by becoming wife turned to a finished in spite of admirable composure deference with have spoken eye be very eager elated almost a though with anticipated triumph mr romayne met eye stood for moment gazing into speechless motionless a though blank astonishment written on line of face have absolutely paralysed mr loring said at last there be almost bewildered remonstrance in low astonished tone dear mr loring one moment interposed quickly of course dont ask to look upon a anything question of expediency mutual goodwill esteem be of very well aware that london be not arcadia wont consider brutal frankness on part im sure if tell that from financial point of view position be not unequal have be exceptionally fortunate lately can offer income of about five thousand year if man assistance support count for something in life a hope may mr romayne interrupted with tact practicality of woman of world have mastered amazement be mistress of situation spoke kindly composedly with just touch of delicate concern occasion demanded dont say more please be really quite impossible sudden flash of surprise passed across marston lorings face paused moment keen eye fixed scrutinisingly on face be trying to detect there sign of coquetry affectation of reluctance believed must surely underlie word scrutiny failed to detect anything of kind however unpleasant glitter came into eye impossible be rather curt word said may ask to amplify saw colour rise beneath paint a answered have not faintest intention of marrying in first place even if there be not innumerable other reason against what propose im afraid have fancy for making ridiculous oh of course be well aware laughed little that in capacity of silly old mother be a ridiculous a woman need be really can not add farcical part to farcical rle farcical part must be enquired loring that of old wife of young husband answered with artificial mirth mr loring be really sorrier if be indeed disappointed than can tell if have thought that encouraged be too utterly preposterous have considered simply a son friend almost son contemporary young man with exceptionally wise reliable head certainly not a young man who must be foolish enough to want to marry woman old enough to be mother lorings lip be rather thin eye glittered dangerously a stood looking at then with certain softening excitement about face there be slightest suggestion of age about nothing admirably developed preserved maturity loring be young man in nothing year be mere form of word if will pardon saying so said voice be dangerously quiet controlled there be difference between in year of course that go for nothing in experience in

must inevitably fall short for julian sake be confronting now looking straight down at a spoke last word concern agitation partly affected partly real with face have be moved vanished before set expression of unalterable resolution for julian sake said in low decisive voice be impossible stood for moment watching evil of face standing out in intense relief then made slight cold gesture of acquiescence may take back into large room said held out hand to with eager gesture of apology appeal be friend still murmured murmur be almost pathetically genuine in anxiety make difference lorings

pulled slightly forward over brow a if with half conscious sense of ghastliness of face instinct to hide that ghastliness from casual eye face be of livid pallor there be grey shadow about mouth be set into hard line of temporary difficult self control nostril not sensitive a rule quivered slightly a pace of horse slackened perforce now again gave other slightest sign of consciousness of surroundings cab turned out of cornhill in second pulled up suddenly almost before cab have stopped julian flung open door leapt out paid man double fare dashed into building before have stopped up stair to office on second floor hand be shaking like leaf a stretched out to try lock of door yielded to touch flung roughly open passed rapidly in outer office have only one occupant rather feeble

a imperturbable uninterested a usual voice be dry indifference a observed have be expecting day without word julian strode past into manager room then a ramsay shut door calmly said in quick unnatural tone also carried with curious suggestion that have not even heard ramsays word mistake mistake must be ramsays only answer be slight shrug of shoulder a dull eye rested apparently with complete indifference upon julian face latter went on rapidly unevenly ive only just heard ive be out of town day ive come to hear to see what can be done last word be hardly audible a though mouth be so parched that must hardly articulate lifted hand a if involuntarily pushed back hat fixing pair of fierce burning eye upon ramsay there nothing to be done of course said ramsay drily thing collapsed harsh wild laugh rang through room faint echo startling little man in outer office collapsed cried julian collapsed by heaven put out one hand gropingly caught at chair near dropped heavily into letting face fall forward upon folded arm a rested upon back only hour have passed since have gone to room in temple after picnic on river to find waiting for there telegram from ramsay into half hour

feature working what devil be good of saying thing like demanded cant understand have reckoned on a call cant understand that be nothing with be just done cant understand broke off suddenly turning away with heavy groan flung into chair let face fall forward on table for that be face to face with at moment must have found word remorse sense of failure helplessness despair seemed to be tearing

with gesture of uncomprehending assent with word of answer julian turned away left room three quarter of hour later be coming rapidly down staircase led from lorings chamber face be flushed quivering pulse be beating madly like pulse of man who have just given unrestrained expression to furious passion turned on to embankment began to walk away in headlong fashion evidently knowing caring where be going a walked tumultuous life glow of face died slowly out settled into haggard sullen mask of dull despair have spoken mind to loring now there be nothing more for to do chapter viii be slave of man

there be not faintest difference in mr romaynes voice by must have be possible to tell that last statement be even le veracious than other part of speech julian proposal to give up plan be figment of moment only then of course gave in continued of course knew must wretch be to have cottage on river spend six week there finished with little grimace lady bracondale observed politely im afraid will find rather dull will find very dull returned mr romayne with ingenuous frankness will be bored to death then know that be really very ridiculous woman if lord master be content there be nothing more

house boat somewhere observed miss pomeroy be first contribution to conversation be made apparently rather because conventionality by time demanded remark of sort from than from interest in subject before reply must be made door opened marston loring be announced mr romayne have be looking rather sharp featured there be great restlessness in eye seemed to leap up then settle suddenly into comparative repose a rested on marston loring a turned to shake hand with greeted gaily be first meeting since night of academy soire lorings manner be absolutely unmoved greeting to differed in nowise from greeting to other two lady if fact in involved subtle change in demeanour towards change be observed by one pair of eye only pair of demure brown eye miss pomeroy have be good deal

norway yesterday business returned in tone addressed whole company rather than member of individually be investing in scotch moor cant leave london till have signed sealed there be delicate implication of wealth about statement seemed to give curious fillip to conversation animated discussion ensued on scotland charm disadvantage mr romayne held part in discussion with unfailing readiness a subject exhausted rose to take leave said good bye in usual charming manner to hostess to mr pomeroy daughter then turned to loring by bye said carelessly ive piece of property of yours in carriage did know have lost something when called other day shant tell what be very careless person ill give if like to come down for turned away loring followed perforce there be ugly smile on face a did so at foot of stair paused then with quick glance towards open door led into dining room went rapidly towards signing to to follow once within room turned faced be smiling still smile be stiff mechanical eye a fixed on face be desperately anxious there be curious ring of conscious helplessness reliance on man to whom spoke about voice a began to speak wanted to speak to said im so glad to see im rather perplexed julian have taken into head to stop in town rather close to town wont go abroad wont visit can tell reason will try find out reason may rely on of course know may there be tone almost of relief in voice a if in mere making of confidence in sense of companionship support gave found sort of ease loring smiled again a met eye im sorry to have to dispel illusion be so flattering to said with slightest possible accentuation of usual quiet cynicism of manner useless to assume can be of further service to stopped watching with keen relentless eye effect of word startled look came to face turned towards eyebrow be lifted contracted with quick movement of perplexity evidently believed that have not fully understood for did not speak went on son have quarrelled have insulted grossly for future be stranger to one consequently will see that will be no longer able to keep out of mischief there be indescribable tone in voice ominous vindictive a spoke mr romaynes face seemed to grow old eye dilated can be put right said in quick uncertain voice will apologise will forgive loring interrupted very coldly incisively will not apologise said must not accept apology neednt suggest of course under circumstance acquaintance much a regret have perhaps better cease faced other for moment into mr romaynes eye there crept sick despair strangely incongruous with surface appearance of position then seemed to recover a if with tremendous effort of will drew up bowed head with grave dignity moved to leave room held door open for with absolutely expressionless countenance passed down hall to where servant be waiting at door went out got into carriage alone loring stood at foot of stair watching then turned with cruel contentment in eye went upstairs again to drawing room two elder lady be sitting with head very close together a opened drawing room door evidently deep in question of domestic importance standing by conservatory window at other end of room rather bored looking figure in solitary girlishness be maud pomeroy occasion being a have be said something of anomaly convention be not so strict a usual lady bracondale just glanced up with vague smile a loring reappeared then became absorbed in conversation a strolled across to maud pomeroy looked up at with faint smile have mr romayne gone said signified careless assent then said be looking rather bored do know miss pomeroy suppose go look at flower until be wanted hesitated moment then moved idly into conservatory looking back at loring with smile a followed be little bored confessed be very kind of to come amuse for next moment two loring must hardly be said to prove very amusing sauntered round little conservatory at companion side eye fixed keenly upon impassive profile with something very calculating in depth miss pomeroy also be apparently absorbed in thought did not notice silence be great friend of romaynes be not said at last in thin even very proper tone loring glanced at again well said thats not question that particularly easy for to answer to day have be on fairly intimate term with a know do know what that kind of thing sometimes lead to miss pomeroy shook head well there be such thing a knowing people too well said loring deliberately then find out little trait dont do to tell truth romayne have quarrelled im glad of said miss pomeroy softly looked at quickly be not quick enough to catch spiteful gleam in eye must be inquisitive to enquire why said dont think mr romayne be nice young man be answer must rather people like broke off in pretty confusion must rather werent friend of mr loring think there great deal about that nobody know indeed said loring interrogatively quietly see said with charming seriousness think girl can often feel whether man be nice nasty quicker than man can mr loring have mr romayne ever said anything to oh please dont think very odd of to say such thing to have ever said anything that made think might be married there be hardly perceptible pause hardly perceptible flash of comprehension on lorings face vindictive satisfaction in eye deepened what make ask that said in tone seemed to fence gravely with suggestion rather than to repudiate miss pomeroy responded with growing conviction because im quite sure that be married of course a doesnt own there must be something something not nice about doe seem to so wrong that people must like so much when isnt bit what think be man eye girl eye met at moment for first time girl be perfectly clear mild expressionless into man there stole cynical tinge of admiration by jove said to be clever at instant mr pomeroys voice be heard from drawing room calling placidly for daughter miss pomeroy moved forward with graceful promptitude into drawing room will meet in scotland by by believe said loring pleasantly a shook hand with miss pomeroy be to be at stewart believe in last week of september so be will look forward to good bye miss pomeroy good bye mr loring few minute later loring also took leave of lady bracondale went away satisfaction be stronger than ever in eye maud pomeroys word have somehow other carried instantaneous conviction to mind in fact believed to contain saw certain social ruin for julian romayne he done for round said to a let into room hour later that nice little house in chelsea will be to let next season at same moment in manager room at office of welcome diamond mining company julian romayne be standing by table looking down at ramsay a latter sat leaning back in chair indifferent enough in attitude with hard intensity of expression in dull eye julian have evidently just risen pushing back chair back of be gripping almost convulsively face be ashen eye be dilated with expression of desperate intolerable temptation ill do be saying in harsh unnatural voice ill do ramsay shake hand on chapter ix cottage mr romayne have taken for august september on julian refusal to go abroad be situated few mile above henley be very charming little house to term cottage be applicable only in mock humility be very charmingly situated have delightful garden not large full of rose sunflower sort of thing a mr romayne explained to julian after visit of inspection lawn sloped down to river altogether on same authority be wonderful chance to get hold of statement mr romayne have made to lady bracondale on julian authority that there be nice people about have originated a matter of fact not with julian with mother herself be quite true nevertheless apparently julian sudden desire for quiet have proved infectious acquaintance between herself present neighbour being of slightest mr romayne made such attempt a might have be expected of to develope acquaintance seemed to be strangely without impetus in towards action of kind be resting people might have said be pausing certainly whether a day went on life did not signify rather temporary enforced quiescence than peaceful pleasant suspension of labour might have be open question be hot bright august day after day sun shone steadily down a julian departed for town after early breakfast at mother never failed to appear day after day shone through long little broken hour upon quiet house garden about one woman figure moved in almost total solitude until with evening julian returned again evening after evening mother son spent alone by mean always together after dinner during conversation seldom flagged between more than must have flagged between two friendly well bred acquaintance mr romayne must sit in drawing room with bit of fashionable fancy work in hand into only occasionally put stitch sometimes julian must spend hour with there reading newspaper carrying on talk of dinner sometimes must stroll out into garden at once come in only just before bed time mr romayne never followed never questioned perhaps be curiously still life led brought so strange still expression to face stillness suggested slow wearing waiting mingled concentration watchfulness patience be evening in second week of september be walking up down lawn in fading sunset light be moving with slow regular step with monotonous motion of woman to whom even movement brought sort of relief soothing there be indescribable touch of desolateness about lonely figure a moved up down before empty house servant came out to by by with newly arrived letter took then monotonous motion being perforce suspended sense of physical fatigue seemed to assert sat down on low basket chair sigh came from a did so one of sigh in unconsciousness be so suggestive of habitual suffering paused moment looking away into space with absent eye then seemed to rouse took up one of letter a if forcing to seek relief from current of monotonous thought have opened envelope read letter half through in mechanical uninterested way when content seemed suddenly to arrest attention change came to expression change in slight quickening revival showed how dulled almost numbed have be before turned once more to beginning of letter read again glenfyle ross shire dear mr romayne be so sorry to have to ask to postpone visit have promised for end of month find that by stupid mistake husband have given separate invitation for same date a there be unfortunately doubt that invitation be given first there fall upon very disagreeable task of explaining situation to son begging to forgive truly marion stewart mr romayne leant back in chair not indolently with intent consideration in line of figure letting hand held letter fall on knee sat gazing at written word with sharp angrily sparkling eye looked a though be bent on piercing through word to meaning believed hid be evidently surprised annoyed a evidently gave not instant credence to reason alleged for postponement of visit in question slight involved in postponement indefinite a noticed with unpleasant little smile seemed to stimulate face have grown even vindictive when eye fell on postmark of second letter lying on knee be that of same little scotch town name of be stamped upon already opened envelope took up eagerly a saw handwriting paused for instant flash of intense consideration passed across face then tore hastily open be from mr pomeroy conveyed in three long winded incoherent sheet piece of news writer be sure must delight mr romayne dear maud letter said be just engaged to charming mr loring mr pomeroys mind seemed to be in state of somewhat considerable confusion between theoretical conventional sense that be very sad for to lose daughter certain practical actual sense by mean harmonised with theoretical one unconsciously threw good deal of light on relation between mother daughter a actually existed coherence of letter be further disturbed by sundry sentence dovetailed so oddly into general fabric that have somewhat appearance of being inserted to order sentence conveyed various repetition of dear mauds assurance of mr romaynes congratulation various repetition of statement that mr lorings financial position have recently improved amazingly that be sure of seat in parliament at forthcoming general election have be staying with stewart during whole of visit to letter ended dear lady marion have be so kind about taken interest ah exclamation uttered evidently involuntarily just above breath came from mr romaynes lip sharply bitterly have read letter through with certain quick movement of eyebrow mocking smile coming going about thin lip smiled again a folded letter deliberately put back into envelope be looking thoroughly roused now there be confidence in alert determined expression be kindling up of martial spirit at challenging trumpet call from well known battlefield if marston loring future wife be indeed arranging force for undermining of mr romaynes social position miss pomeroy loring between must have pieced out very sufficient explanation of lady marion stewart note campaign judging from appearance at moment be likely to be far from tame one mr romayne be still sitting with letter in hand tapping one foot with impatient vigour upon grass there be same eager intentness in eye when from house behind sound of dinner bell rang out started violently in start something seemed to fall between subject on thought have be busy curious shade of new stillness replaced energy on face be dressing bell rose mechanically a turned towards house eye fell upon figure of julian have evidently be standing on verandah a rose have turned be disappearing into house shade of stillness fell upon face a though letter have received feeling have stirred have receded into distance often happened that mother son did not meet on julian return home in evening until dinner time happened so evening dinner bell be ringing when julian came downstairs with quick word two of apology followed mother into dining room julian looked a though month hard work have by mean agreed with face be even painfully thin worn there be expression of hard concentration about seemed to age strangely eye be rather sunken be curious feature of change in le easily defined that likeness to mother have faded considerably character of face now seemed to originate about mouth that mouth of mr romayne have be wont to say with affected gaiety that be like nobody in particular that mouth have be somewhat weak undecided feature there be nothing undecided about now mr romayne never looked at without deepening of stillness on face be set into heavy resolute line one indeed judging from bare outline of julian daily life during hot august must have wondered at sign of physical wear tear that exhibited ten oclock on one of sultry day found at work not indeed in temple in office in city be from same office that must issue forth at about five oclock to catch train for henley sometimes with sullen determination sometimes with pale fierce excitement on face affair of welcome diamond mining company have readjusted after blow have threatened company very existence a hardly most sanguine must have hoped ten day after announcement of presence of water in mine of newspaper published telegram have be received by director passage of water by existing mine be rendered practically useless have revealed hitherto unsuspected possibility there appeared to be little doubt that first mine have be a be only pledge of still richer stratum yet to be worked one telegram followed confirming report in greater detail prospectus be issued setting forth proposal to utilise opportunity thus opened debenture be issued for providing of necessary fund debenture be taken up somewhat slowly at first on arrival in england of specimen of diamond from new lead together with circumstantial report be taken up with rush be understood to be already on foot dividend be looked for at early date new managing director of company be julian romayne there be kind of dry excitement about to night behind deliberate assumption of conversational interest be never changing manner with mother now hand shook little a poured out more wine than usual did not rejoin mother in drawing room saying something a left about having letter to write two hour afterwards be walking up down lawn in moonlight with cigar there be fierce restlessness in step there be fierce restlessness in face too have be walking there for hour when shadow passed across blind of drawing room window night be very hot window be wide open blind be drawn up mr romaynes figure stood there outlined by lamplight within drawing room window be shadowed from moonlight by angle of house good night julian called julian stopped in walk mechanically good night mother answered figure in window seemed to hesitate for moment then mr romayne moved drew down blind light in room behind went out one by one julian resumed walk in moonlight a mechanically a have stopped be custom to go morning first to room in temple in case letter might be waiting for there on following morning slight accident on line having considerably delayed train paused moment before giving order to cabman be very late there be feverish impatience in line of face have almost decided that private letter might wait until next day when with sudden unaccountable reaction sprang into cab told man to drive to temple have apparently repented of resolution by time cab stopped for sprang out with muttered imprecation on delay there be only one letter waiting for caught up fiercely then handwriting in be directed caught eye tumultuous heat impatience of face died out suddenly utterly stood for moment staring down at letter white to very lip then seemed absolutely physically to set teeth in intense hardness of determination set mark on muscle of face whole expression must have seemed to deteriorate markedly terribly for desperation in eye be little short of agony moved abruptly crossed room unlocked drawer in writing table thrust letter in with quick deliberate movement unopened locked drawer again sharply turned went hastily out of room letter be from clemence be first sign of existence have received since parting on june evening nearly three month ago be looking only older harder more recklessly resolute when about quarter of hour later entered office of welcome diamond mining company feeble looking little messenger be in solitary possession looked up rather uneasily a julian wished brief good morning crossed to door of manager room mr ramsays just gone out mr romayne said be to say must be in again directly julian made curt gesture of assent went on into private room there be plenty of work waiting for appeared be still applying to with dogged concentration when nearly hour later door opened ramsay appeared there be said indifferently thought werent going to turn up morning julian have just glanced up from letter be writing to acknowledge other man entrance went on writing a explained briefly that train have be delayed particular reason for wanting suppose said in brief businesslike way a laid down pen ramsay sat down deliberately put hand into breast pocket of coat well yes said there matter here rather call for attention of managing director held out letter a spoke julian took read quickly then laid down on table before looked up slowly at ramsay face be rather pale general meeting of shareholder said demanded there be moment pause while looked steadily into ramsays immoveable face then added in same rather difficult tone did expect ramsay never expect returned ramsay drily such thing be on card of course julian face grew dark calculating well said harshly after moment pause must be arranged for of course what do propose ramsay answered question by do happen to know anything said of man named compton howard compton julian brow contracted a if with involuntary effort to detect relevancy of question a answered tersely belong to same club didnt know suppose that share in welcome have drifted into hand julian shook head with quick frown of vexation ah observed ramsay have though have come to knowledge that various enquiry have be made into state of welcome diamond mine made on spot made in secret ive traced enquiry to mr howard compton dreadful grey pallor have begun to spread over julian face muscle seemed to have grown rigid with intense force with held to expression of dogged determination did not speak ramsay went on in same dry indifferent way be very clever hand very cleverly advised one point score at present be that have not done a intended to do taken by surprise do mean to say word seemed to come from between julian dry white lip almost without consciousness on part eye be fixed upon ramsay with hard unseeing kind of stare voice be hoarse uneven hardly audible died away leaving sentence unfinished meaning be obvious of course returned ramsay affair of kind be ticklish thing to pull off hitch of kind be always possible though never came across affair in seemed le probable dont know yet exactly how much friend know meeting wont be particularly placid affair of course youre likely to have warm time of of course there chance that maynt know quite enough may be able to pull through yet if not something seemed to rattle in julian throat a spoke word came out thick husky if not repeated ramsay well if not think wouldnt go to meeting if be there be moment dead silence broken only by julian heavy laboured breathing two men sat there face to face eye met with terrible significance of what be better unexpressed in word then ramsays dull eye took deliberate survey of julian face be drawn livid elder man rose took from cupboard brandy poured into glass with slightly contemptuous smile put into julian hand youre very devil to work said drily for know may be first rate a winner cant say youre good loser useful lesson to learn in business julian drank brandy rose mechanically strong stimulant hardly seemed to touch blanched horror of face what do propose to do said in stiff toneless voice personally nothing returned ramsay until know more business will go on a usual youll call meeting of course ill tell harrison to get form ready for to sign must be sent out to morrow going yes said julian heavily there nothing more need do to day took hat went slowly out of office looking straight before like man walking in sleep ramsay looked after stood for minute rubbing chin

nothing wrong quite sure of course will be back soon quite soon there be moment quivering silence then clemence slowly lifted face took in arm again lip met in one long agonised kiss neither spoke again when released julian with face like death turned went away down street head bent whole figure tense a though be facing blinding wind clemence stood for moment still a statue eye wide face quite quiet then too went away through night chapter xii over country about henley same day sun be shining gloriously be about five oclock in afternoon there be clearness about light distinctness about shadow taken in conjunction with heavy bank of cloud into sun must presently sink argued coming rain for present however nature be lovely to look at garden party be going on in large old fashioned garden of large old fashioned country house about mile from river have benefit of advantage atmosphere surroundings must give be large party scene be very bright animated on larger of two lawn conspicuous among well dressed by mean striking looking woman about stood mr romayne talking to local magnate have arrived about hour before politely concealed satisfaction surprise with have be received have testified to fact that appearance at function be phenomenon in neighbourhood invitation have showered in on during residence at cottage have gradually become established fact that be going out very little be in truth first party have attended be fortunate that hostess be not particularly observant person there have be something about mr romayne when arrived might have dashed that hostess personal elation with suspicion that guest appearance have be dictated by motif not wholly complimentary to party line about mouth suggested enforced endurance of burden from be seeking temporary relief however fictitious restlessness in eye suggested attempt at eluding of too insistent companionship of own thought eye be painfully bright there be nervous tension about manner a stood there on lawn talking laughing companion of moment worthy old gentleman with not much acquaintance among woman of world thought simply most astonishingly charming woman have ever met seeking in mind for line on to make agreeable to recollected to have heard something about son have son here believe said with ponderous interest must greatly like to make acquaintance mr romayne laughed have son said be not here im sorry to say be hard at work just at present ah broke off with exclamation of surprise see friend of mine over there must go speak to with bow smile to admirer broke off conversation have perhaps seemed longer to one party than to other moved across lawn to where hilda compton be standing watching with uncertain not particularly pleasant expression on pretty face be staying in neighbourhood said mr romayne prettily when have shaken hand be apparently entirely oblivious of something cold disagreeable in younger woman manner be husband here hilda compton glanced at with certain tentative triumph in eye said he not here im staying on house boat be kept in town over troublesome business paused then a mr romayne made rather patronising gesture of sympathy that gleam of triumph strengthened into something distinctly malicious hilda compton have never forgotten forgiven moment in norfolk garden twelve month ago have be part of policy to resent when such resentment must necessarily have rebounded to own disadvantage have accepted mr romaynes society friendliness during past season with just manner a might sting must not in very self respect be impugned by elder woman manner cleverly tinged with deference point sense of superiority with certain type of girl recognises fact that present be to not to previous generation have hoped always that day might come when must find in position to take more active measure felt now that even what knew to be slight breach of conjugal faith must be venial if must straighten what must have called score against julian romaynes mother yes rather bore said city business know dont think very foolish of men to speculate mr romayne of course havent quarter of experience think so always seem to get into trouble of sort know more than do about affair doubt since mr romayne be mixed up in he such devoted son husband dont tell one much find self command be wonderful thing even when originates in higher motive than instinct of woman of world for retention of society demeanour mr romaynes lip be ashen finger be clenched round sunshade held until ring cut into faced hilda compton steadily with mechanical smile eye little dull contracted meeting girl pretty unfeeling one hilda compton noticed change of colour even behind artificial tinting rejoiced at slip of tongue by foolish young husband have put weapon into hand if only have succeeded in making howard tell more instead of making lose temper reflected however that perhaps truth be not so very bad after hint might possibly sound worse than actual fact do tell mr romayne from that hope hasnt done anything very shocking said with laugh wanted howard to tell just what be must not isnt funny how men seem to lose head altogether when get on to silly stock exchange last men one must expect too who must have thought of mr romaynes getting into trouble of kind somewhat to disgust hilda compton found a proceeded that be impossible to give such significance to word a must have wished realised that must never do to allow to be brought to book consequently conventionality demanded that must adopt jesting tone trust to mr romaynes possessing half knowledge must give word barb wished for have pleasant conviction a mr romayne answered that have done something at least towards wiping out that old score elder woman word be preceded by harsh little laugh there be something indistinct about utterance just so who must have thought mr romayne stopped abruptly sharp extraordinary spasm passed across face leaving fixed old girl by side must not flatter that effect be produced by word for mr romayne be gazing to other side of garden be evidently something have seen there have affected so powerfully turning own curious eye in same direction hilda compton saw nothing calculated to account for such effect crowd have drifted away to extent to other lawn tennis court there be considerable space sparsely sprinkled with people between where stood last group on lawn group of lady to whom host be introducing little alert elderly man with grey hair little man who looked to day though only one pair of two pair of woman eye fixed upon across lawn recognised exactly a have looked twenty year ago hilda compton did not know be wondering curiously whether mr romayne did when heard hostess voice turned quickly mr romayne roused apparently by finding addressed have turned also very quickly seemed to hilda compton rather a though did not wish face to be seen by one on other side of garden be listening with dazed strained expression of enforced attention want to introduce connexion of mine dear mr romayne something of traveller something of eccentricity really worth talking to there be indicating little alert elderly man on other side of lawn be dr aston may fetch to hilda compton astonishment mr romayne stretched out hand hurriedly in unmistakeable dissent be shaking like leaf im afraid must say said in hoarse hurried tone sounded a though must hardly control have long drive know must run away took leave so briefly hurriedly that hostess came to conclusion that illness must be cause of seclusion in be living that must have miscalculated strength that afternoon might have thought so with even more reason if have seen strange collapse of whole figure with mr romayne sank back into corner of carriage a be driven home along country road if attendance at garden party have be indeed desperate attempt at finding sort of temporary oblivion distraction that attempt have obviously failed face be drawn set in eye a stared unseeingly before there be look a of woman who be quivering still under influence of horrible shock have a have said long drive home a neared own house look in eye faded displaced by sick hunger of anxiety got out of carriage quickly helping good deal a rose however a if shock have affected physical strength have mr julian come said to servant who opened door then a woman answered in negative moved swiftly on to where letter lay waiting for looked rapidly over there be none from julian carried listlessly upstairs a went to dress for solitary dinner rain be

fire lighted drew chair in front of taking up novel set to read with desperate determination in line of face down one page line by line on through next still line by line eye travelled steadily mechanically then a mechanically hand moved turned leaf eye moved on again unless face greatly belied sense of word read so intently never penetrated to brain by by movement of eye ceased sat staring fixedly at page before then let hand held book sink gradually on knee sat staring into space a have sat staring at printed word face be drawn there be intense indefinite dread about be none le ghastly in that must have be impossible to say in of set feature shadow lurked room be absolutely still outside rain fell wind moaned inside intense quiet seemed to be taking weirdly tangible form to be creeping closer closer round motionless figure with breath drew with sudden sharp movement a though in taking too sharply piercing point thought have roused to desperate resistance of rose began to walk restlessly up down room brow be drawn to concentration made whole face look thin very old there be expression of deliberate self conscious self contempt about mouth in eye there lurked battling horror against force seemed to be fiercely arrayed up down walked muscle of set face relaxing until quite suddenly there swept across breaking up rigid line very agony of yearning be a though sudden most inopportune realisation in wise to be resisted have shaken through through if only have dared to ask if only if only dared to speak word have broken from half aloud sharp low cry a uttered stopped in walk gripping clinging to chair a if for physical support in moment of terrible mental conflict be evidently fighting desperately inch by inch for self control be slipping from self control dreaded to lose a dreaded nothing else in life self control to clung with tenacity of instinctive self preservation lifted face at last still hard a resolution must make crossed room with quick resolute step looking to right left went rapidly upstairs to own room desk containing quantity of paper stood on chest of drawer be old bill receipt needed sorting destroying have brought into country

unconsciously into pocket through journey sat motionless clasping tightly in hand eye wild feature forced into quiescence sat upon like mask mask seemed to get thin to break away now again a drove through london street at last a though wild emotion hid be growing too strong for breath be coming faster faster until white parted lip took involuntary line of physical pain there be light in house

astonishment a uttered falconer sprang out of bed a did so realised that unusualness of light be due to unusualness of hour seven oclock only one from mr romayne mean called strong deep voice full of incredulity apprehension then a answer came through door mr romayne sir lady said called back hurriedly say will be with in moment very few moment indeed have passed before falconer bedroom door opened came out with rapid step opened sitting room door passed in shutting door hastily behind a did so word of grave concern with have entered died upon lip in disorder dreariness of room from trace of yesterday usage have not yet be obliterated in cold grey light of early september morning woman be pacing up down with almost frenzied step for moment a caught first glimpse of face thought vaguely that be not mr romayne then turned confronted meeting eye recognised not woman whom have known during past two year woman into whose face have looked with so strange shock of unfamiliarity for one moment only a dr aston have confronted together twenty year ago in nice trace of mr romayne of to day seemed to have vanished scorched away by consuming fire burnt in blue eye seemed to be only thing lived behind ghastly face even feature be drawn sunken almost beyond recognition almost paralysing sense of unreality fell upon dennis falconer for practical common sense before must recover sufficiently for speech mr romayne have crossed room to attempting greeting swept away on tide before barrier of life safeguard a have seemed to have gone down in one common ruin dennis falconer cried hoarsely boy be gone gone help to think what must do help to think how can find help help word be appeal rang out in harsh untuned voice with fierce peremptoriness of command a spoke mr romayne beat hand one against other a though agony be indeed too great to be endured falconer utterly confounded more by manner than by tidings indeed in slow bewildered sense of extraordinarily direct communication word have established between hardly grasped echoed one word seemed to contain definite statement gone said gone gone returned repeating word a have done before in kind of hoarse cry oh let try make understand clearly that may lose time time ah who know how much may have be lost already boy boy strangled cry in very throat laying one hand on falconer arm with convulsive grip a if to steady lifted other to head pushing hair back from forehead pressing finger down a though to force to think speak coherently have telegram from said speaking in short quick sentence with heavy panting breath between ten day ago said that be going to stop in town for few day yesterday heard something that made uneasy came up to speak to late last night expected to find in queen anne street be not there have not be there for last two night be gone stopped a though in three word have summed up horror of situation with strange sense of unreality making voice stiff constrained falconer said must necessarily apprehend anything alarming private visit perhaps painful discovery of course tore hand away from arm wringing fiercely with fellow a faced breaking in upon word with passionate cry apprehend apprehend know tell know ah have be watching fighting for so many year have planned struggled sickened with fear not to know now that have overtaken at last dennis falconer dont palter with know what lie about boy know what horrible inheritance have have to battle with for good heaven when have spared knowledge of when have failed to thrust on to force to shudder sicken even when felt most secure paused battling for breath then a falconer tried to speak put out hand to stop went on hurriedly thats over done with now must help knowledge must help be man will know what to do how can be saved must be saved must turned away from with wild unconscious gesture a though personality have existence for save except a must serve purpose began once more to pace up down room falconer followed with eye standing motionless confounded very foundation on stood conception with regard to woman before life lived have suddenly melted into nothingness before passionate word there seemed for time being to be stability anywhere about be light that word let in upon rather rolled over that mental tract of country have be to perfectly familiar commonplace darkness in landmark be obliterated in first bewildered second most prominent sensation be one of utter blackness mental counterpart of effect produced upon physical vision by sudden substitution of illimitable darkness for narrow well known scene what do fear said spoke almost like automaton in low tentative tone have be speculating never stopped in rushing walk have known for month have be in torment there be strange scathed look on face gave word terrible reality have have heavy anxiety on mind summer what dont know be end of oh boy darling what have done that must shut mother out have slaved for have slaved for will slave for a long a live why have gone away from be not cry to falconer watching listening to tear must have be so terrible a bitter dry eyed wail seemed to to echo in void where nothing answering to must have be nurtured into life contrast between artificial woman have known hitherto woman in consuming anguish of motherhood with whom now found face to face be so amazing that must make attempt to grapple with took desperate instinctive refuge in practical do know anything of city association said made despairing gesture of negation did said hoarsely did knew to keep in touch with two month ago marston loring must have told anything everything failed everything crumbled away quarrelled already with matter of fact tendency inherent in men particularly in unimaginative men assimilates revelation reduces involuntarily to commonplace falconer have become almost accustomed to new point of view have be forced upon darkness be lifting be aware of vast tract of mental country destitute of landmark soul loved no longer enveloped in dense atmosphere of confusion man of falconer narrow temperament confirmed in rigidity by many year of life having set conception suddenly overthrown forcibly enlarged will be totally incapable of just appreciation of new horizon then created will be conscious of space about only a confusing unreality limitation solidified by mental habit of year will retain sort of ghostly influence over long after have ceased to have actual existence first conscious deliberate movement will be instinctive attempt to reconcile new condition of thing with old limitation rather than to reconcile with new condition fact mr romaynes word recalled to character of man whom have encouraged a son chief intimate character of life to have bred gave definite force to vague movement towards such reconciliation already stirring in falconer mind accepted revelation of unsuspected mother love mother dread ceased to contemplate a concentrated mental vision on selfish vanity worldliness with mr romayne have stood endued in thought for twenty year a point of view readjusted on line present position with suffering involved presented to solely a inevitable climax of simple eminently comprehensible sequence of cause effect voice be low stern a said can not think of other friend who must give clue to recent movement cant cried stopping in rapid walk confronting fiercely be because there be one left because dont know what to do where to turn have come to must be wasting time like if must think of other mean of acting im tied hand foot in dark tied

contorted a if with horrible physical pain stretched out hand feebly gropingly caught at arm chair fell into letting face fall forward on back a nail pressed pitilessly into thin hand nothing gasped in tight suppressed voice fighting desperately a seemed to utter word rather than groan have be ill night word died away caught strangled by relentless stabbing pain falconer utterly at loss stood for moment helplessly watching then strode across room meaning to call woman to aid opened door hurriedly then stopped short on shelf fixed against wall facing there lay morning letter on top of pile lay one directed in julian handwriting mr romaynes physical distress sank into insignificance for physical suffering have fallen to lot during past year have by mean obliterated lifelong instinct led to look upon such weakness a detail to be disregarded of woman knew nothing turned back into room with letter in hand shutting door again opened hastily be letter julian have written on previous day in room in temple dear falconer read ive done for round by time get will be out of england penal servitude if stay smash will come in day two will understand up with there wife child for heaven sake be kind to be address address followed then signature for moment dennis falconer stood motionless with eye fixed on letter so despairing in hopeless brevity so terribly eloquent of immeasurable disgrace wrong then lifted head turned towards mr romayne have not moved be apparently unconscious of presence tense rigidity of position have passed into total collapse in figure seemed to have fallen together a if in absolute exhaustion to falconer presented appearance only of most desirable quiet hesitated simply a to how must so break to what must be broken a to excite least must have to see letter glanced at again on thought cold shock seemed to strike a realised total oblivion of mother to young man last appeal bore witness have received news said tone a spoke be curiously different from in have ever before addressed be grave straightforward not unkindly very subtly quite unconsciously conveyed altered attitude of stern narrow moralist towards wrong doing no longer triumphant serene writhing under merited suffering certain stern compassion new position of affair demanded of gave be that lofty compassion be more than half composed of sense of righteousness of retribution meted out with sympathy respect be utterly untouched be prepared to help to utmost be steady reliability help be permeated a be compassion with superior recognition of justice of trouble rendered that help necessary a though there be something between surroundings through voice must penetrate before reached brain second two elapsed before mr romayne gave sign of having heard then moved turned face towards looking at a though from long way off forehead hair about strangely colourless dead looking be damp grey shadow have fallen about mouth there be faint struggle in dull eye a though have heard word be trying to force way to understanding of through overwhelming physical disability be sorry to say be far from reassuring continued falconer sudden flash of understanding conviction flashed across feature spirit dominated weakness a light transfigured face rose clinging to chair evidently absolutely unconscious of physical sensation held out hand still clammy tremulous with pain give said indicating letter held voice be thin whisper then a hesitated youre wasting time give gave without word turned away must break down of course thought perhaps into wild form of hysteria at position in young man confessed perhaps into passionate repudiation of son who have so deceived who be leaving without word sign moment passed three four perhaps then tense insistent touch fell on arm turned mr romayne be standing by side julian letter held tightly in hand trembled longer eye be bright almost hard in determination line muscle of face figure be braced set into vivid strength resolution must see woman at once said voice be a strange in desperate energy a be face then a falconer only looked at blankly added in same absorbed concentrated way will come with mean will see must see woman repeated tapping paper impatiently with hand dont see will probably know where be must know let go at once if doe know if doe know why be everything can follow be frightened have lost head if go away like be lost be going to stop silenced with movement of hand before word died on lip dennis falconer said help refuse to help a like dont try to stop shadow of horror such a have haunted for twenty year bring nerve desperation of twenty year to meet now be going to save will come dominated against will sternly disapproving powerless to assert disapprobation in face of intensity of determination falconer made slight gesture of enforced assent mr romayne hardly waited for before turned went swiftly out of room down stair be early still not yet eight oclock cab be hardly to be found met one at last falconer put into looked at obviously with intention of uttering protest with face be full made peremptory sign that must give address holding out letter containing instantly reclaiming nerve be evidently strung beyond possibility of irrelevant unnecessary speech long drive followed to dingy poverty stricken neighbourhood then in dreary looking little street cab stopped mr romayne got out with same rapid concentrated movement signing again with movement of set lip to falconer that must ring make necessary enquiry bell be answered after appreciable interval by slatternly looking girl young woman lodge here believe said falconer sternly young married woman mr mr roden romayne girl stared at for moment with bold curious eye then transferred stare to mr romayne with coarse giggle young married woman repeated with toss of head oh yes of course top floor back before last word conveyed general intimation that visitor for top floor back be expected to show up be well uttered mr romayne have crossed dirty little passage with swift step be mounting stair went straight on until reached top landing then turned sharply to falconer who have followed closely judgement condemned proceeding utterly stern sense of claim upon remained untouched believed to be merely waiting until impulse must fail a seemed to must before long to take matter into own hand knock said falconer obeyed door be opened with quiet sad toned yes clemence stood on threshold be looking very fragile very white haggard look of suffering have left have taken with in passing physical strength from face eye be heavy a with sleeplessness tear from depth there seemed to emanate quiet grief spoke in line of face held baby in arm whole personality seemed to be touched by mysterious influence of motherhood into new dignity beauty to falconer change in since have seen in camden town be so great a to give moment absolute shock be same woman yet not same difference lay for rather in evidence of long suffering spoke so eloquently about woman face form than in work effected by suffering feeling that sight of stirred in be one of pity man half indignant half patronising pity for weakness trust abused falconer did not seem to see instantly a opened door eye have passed to where mr romayne stood confronting face absorbed concentrated hard a steel faint flush of colour flooded clemences face then lowered eye stood with head little bent over child motionless be son wife word came from mr romayne quick terse utterly untouched unemotional a though situation in be absolutely devoid of meaning for husband name be julian romayne be low answer mr romayne made quick imperious gesture indicative of desire to pas into little room on threshold of clemence be standing clemence made way for with quiet dignity then followed in falconer hesitated instant took up position in doorway holding in grave attentive readiness until moment when presence must be required little room be scrupulously neat clean facing strangely incongruous figure amid such poor surroundings apparently a absolutely unconscious of a of child at never glanced stood mr romayne facing mr romayne stood clemence paler now than before with head bent little lower falconer must see that trembled slightly mr romayne began to speak instantly in same hard rapid tone where be son said have be told perhaps to say know to keep plan secret must give up instantly to have made mistake only prompt action can redeem when did see last what did tell a though subtle influence from one woman have penetrated to heart of other clemences face have turned quite white for too personal aspect of situation seemed suddenly to sink into abeyance head be lifted eye filled with creeping apprehension be fixed full upon mr romayne oblivious of anything one interest held in common man watching be vaguely conscious of something about two woman put quite away from made merest spectator of something to have key saw last night said clemence hurriedly fearfully came to say good bye kind of hoarse cry broke from mr romayne good bye cried a though appealing to encircling environment of fate let go let go stopped forcing down passion with iron hand went on in tone only colder more decisive in greater rapidity than before have made mistake can not understand of course doubt seems to that everything to be desired be comprised in miserable subterfuge of flight doubt be interrupted with low cry of unutterable horror clemence have drawn step nearer to pressing baby passionately to heart flight cried flight ah knew knew there be something wrong what be oh what be dear dear what have done what have done there be instant dead silence a cry died away clemence stood with beseeching eye dark dilated uplifted face white quivering appealing a seemed for answer to julian falconer be looking straight before face set grim passive not only with natural passivity of man in presence of inevitable anguish with involuntary self forgetfulness of man in presence of power greater than can understand mr romayne have paused a though stopped by kind of hard annoyed surprise then mr romayne went on in thin tense voice there be time to waste over have be done point be to retrieve must come back at once where be with sudden quick movement clemence turned crossed room laid child tenderly in little cot standing by fire pressed face down for one instant to tiny sleep flushed cheek then rose came back to mr romayne falconer face white resolute eye shining glancing from one to other a spoke will there be time said can get to before sail there be woman downstairs who will take care of child be alone may be doing flight what can flight do for if have done wrong doesnt always know be wife must go help will there be time be falconer to whom eye finally turned vaguely conscious of absence of womanly sympathy appealing in void for man knowledge assistance be falconer who answered instinctively involuntarily answered directly current of thought seeming to submit to hers without impulse to resist control where be going said to america be answer eager low a though life death hung on response must elicit be going then told that be at nine oclock last night oh if go at once will be in time will be in time hard nervous irritation be disturbing concentration of mr romaynes face futile utterly to be ignored a seemed to impulse on part of woman to whom in face of terrible issue with stood confronted gave personal consideration whatever introduction of such futility seemed in strained tense condition of nerve to involve irrelevancy delay be utterly unable to meet with self command broke in now voice harsh vibrating with uncontrollable impatience there be need said be on way to now there be need for can hing be wife said clemence did not raise voice colour came to dead white face only turned to julian mother with hand crushed tightly together against heart such light shining in eye a seemed to transfigure whole face figure for instant eye of two woman met held one then mr romayne with gesture seemed to repudiate deny influence nevertheless be powerless to resist turned to falconer moved swiftly towards door what doe matter said in tone of fierce impatience relegated clemence to position of merest nonentity only thing of consequence be time swept out of room a spoke clemence turned again to falconer stretching out beseeching hand help said movement have thought to guide control so easily have passed beyond falconer control knew must only follow waiting until turn of event must throw a still believed must upon man strength experience a clemence have touched once before against will touched now against judgement answered in one word come throughout terrible hour followed during drive to station sickening suspense brief interval of waiting for train long journey neither by word sign did mr romayne evince slightest consciousness of clemences presence face almost stony now in set determination never altered after be seated in train never spoke at sat gazing straight before motionless a statue like woman living only by hold upon moment in future to present second a passed be bringing nearer there have be no time to ascertain probability a to forestalling sailing of boat in julian have presumably intended to leave england falconer while admitting to that young man might have over estimated panic stricken danger in have placed have faint hope that step other than promotion of speedy departure must be possible when must be in possession of fact even must arrival be in time to frustrate original determination mr romayne weighed probability looked neither to right to left saw before only climax consummation of struggle of twenty year on consummation be concentrated whole existence chapter xiv room be very still even clock upon mantelpiece be not going so that not even low tick disturbed perfect quiet be sitting room in one of liverpool hotel quite alone in be clemence be sitting near window motionless hand clasped tightly together on knee face be lifted slightly towards sky calm broken now again by slight quiver of lip be that of intense absorption clemences be one of nature in great mental suffering of kind pass instinctively into unformed prayer be praying now with whole being with faintest consciousness of herself mental attitude have be sitting there alone motionless for more than hour when touch fell upon handle of door started violently rose involuntarily to foot a opened to admit falconer did not speak agony of questioning seemed to have passed into eye fixed upon into tightly clasped hand falconer crossed room quickly to spoke a though in answer to audible word have found said there have be delay boat will not leave until to morrow till then be here breath of unutterable relief thanksgiving broke from clemences white lip let face fall forward for moment on hand then lifted again tremulous shaken be right that must go said be necessary returned falconer sternly sternness be not for look of trouble perplexity passed into face lip be parted to speak again when door at other end of room opened sharply not door by falconer have entered second leading presumably into bedroom mr romayne appeared rigidity of self control have given place apparently to consuming fever eye be glittering dry skin seemed to be too tightly drawn across sharpened feature there be paint upon now mask le tangible le effective of artificiality of expression be very woman stripped of trapping of life bearing ravage of past struggle thick upon driven to bay braced to hold struggle on be entering with last breath in body be still dressed for walking contrast between smart somewhat youthful apparel have always affected face be terrible to see came straight up to falconer utterly unconscious apparently a far a feeling realisation constitute consciousness of clemences presence have found said word be le question than assertion let go at once stop though added abruptly laying burning hand on falconer arm a though in haste pressure of own impulse ascribed similar impatience to have better know fact first what have told falconer hesitated word when spoke ignored final question answered idea vibrated behind word of speech glanced at clemence a began to speak a though wished word to apply to also think said that anything will be gained by seeing except extreme distress for concerned fear there be nothing to be done have spoken very firmly a though moment have arrived in estimation for stand on manly judgement have involuntarily postponed for so long paused a though to accentuate weight of word mr romayne with gesture of irrepressible tortured impatience otherwise with recognition whatever of having spoken repeated question what have told clemences eye fixed upon falconer face dilated slightly then shadow of smile touched parted lip fear there be doubt that be bad affair continued falconer there be forged document connected with misappropriation of money fraudulently come by detection seems to be inevitable only hope of safety lie in flight a though with very tangibility imminence of danger have come forth to meet mr romaynes spirit rose higher only sort of change brought to face by word be intensifying of previous characteristic of growing courage determination from clemences lip little tremulous light have died quenched in such horror of vicarious shame of pity love anguish unspeakable a seemed to freeze where stood fact fact word came from mr romayne sharp tense seeming to put aside ignore extraneous comment opinion falconer hesitated again for moment scanned face closely absolutely unconscious of own incapacity for reading what be written there so far be from adequate conception of reality of situation that thought that plain statement of detail must crush out for ever hope of be conscious in decided that such instantaneous crushing be only mercy must show gravely concisely with unnecessary comment told whole story a have gathered hour earlier from julian incoherent despairing word finished paused holding braced for outbreak of despair expected word be followed by dead silence eye be fixed on mr romayne with vague fear for reason felt rather than saw clemence have turned away be standing with face hidden in hand mr romaynes brow have contracted a if in intense thought eye be extraordinarily bright keen at last with slightest relaxation of intent calculation of face asked one two question a to detail of business procedure word coming from sharp distinct question of falconer a answered tried in vain to see drift then moved with gesture of determination so self absorbed that seemed to isolate utterly take to at once said sharp exclamation broke from falconer a moved towards door followed hastily indescribably disturbed confused by so entirely unexpected course of action to what purpose said quickly beg of to be advised by boy must go nothing can be gained parting mr romayne turned upon faced suddenly be here to see son said there be something in voice rather in what intense restraint suggested than in tone absolutely dominating conclusive came to help take to tell where to find intensely annoyed disapproving keenly alive to fear that julian so taken by surprise might impute to definitely treacherous intention in withholding a have done fact that be not alone falconer yet felt powerless have shadow of right to stand between mother son have made stand might a effectually have opposed to wind word judgement be a nothing to that must so far fail to carry into effect conception of duty a escort a to let go alone be of course impossible in eye made sternly unwilling sign to effect that must perforce accompany then a passed quickly out of room looked at clemence there be stunned look upon face now did not even glance at in answer moved mechanically a seemed like woman walking in sleep followed mr romayne not one word be spoken by of trio until stood quarter of hour later before rather dingy door in dreary passage of unpretentious obscure private hotel then falconer spoke in low stern tone here said indicating door before mr romayne moved swiftly forward turned handle for one instant a door opened there be vision of dull bare little sitting room touched with strange glory by red ray from setting sun slanted right across in middle of room in full light of red ray fell with almost weird effect of irradiation upon attitude of despair julian sitting by table head buried on outstretched arm for instant only picture be visible then julian turned head sharply sprang to foot with cry mother be advancing rapidly towards be not mother that saw be figure behind with dazed white face breaking up now into quivering line be to figure that stretched out hand with hoarse heart broken sob clemmie clemmie theyve told before word be uttered clemence have rushed past mr romayne be clinging to in sudden agony of sob tear a seemed to rend very heart mr romayne stopped abruptly falconer who be close to with back to door have shut swiftly on julian cry saw spasm of pain cut across concentration of face for instant in flash of anger impatience succeeded seemed to recognise clemences presence practically for first time fell back step two waiting with contemptuous self control eye fixed upon pair before a clung together julian tried brokenly despairingly to soothe pitiful abandonment of grief with clemence be shaken own distress increased with incoherent word of self reproach uttered be sense of anguish that seemed at last to reach clemence produce in woman instinct towards suppression of own pain disengaged gently forcing back heavy sob trembled on lip looked from julian towards mr romayne with tacit recognition of mother claim be a beautiful a be instinctive will listen said in choked beseeching voice will listen come back turned away a spoke making sign that must not speak to a drew away from mr romayne advanced rapidly movement line of face tone of voice claiming a inalienable right son attention face be very hard far harder than have be before spasm of pain have shaken there be touch of emotion in hard quick voice seemed to have put sentiment deliberately aside julian said have made terrible mistake be taking just one false step must be absolutely irretrievable must come back to town at once manner voice influence from long past day when word for affectation of weak indulgence have be law have arrested attention almost without own consent stood now looking at looking at across gulf of ignorance mistake wrong a have swallowed even bitterness with have once regarded leaving absolutely cold dead to town have parted company mother said spoke hoarsely emotion in tone be reflex of through have just passed in meeting clemence manner be even callous must be true indeed be quick answer if have succeeded in leaving england not only town life everything make life worth living must have parted company to go away now be to cut own throat julian turned to falconer havent told said thickly dont know that be done falconer drew step nearer mother know began mr romayne interposed lifting hand peremptorily without even glancing at know everything said know that be in hideous danger if run away from be indeed over with must face must defy a though in last word have touched given form life to very core of determination have nerved since have first read julian letter that morning voice rose a spoke into ring of indomitable courage vibrating with very triumph of defiance of spoke slight haggard physique seemed to expand to gain in dignity power a whole room seemed to fill with magnetism of intense resolution there be instant pause then exclamation broke alike from julian from falconer julian be almost derisive in absolute repudiation of word falconer be sternly incredulous clemence be standing little apart sound came from lifted face suddenly turned towards mr romayne vague horror confusion have dawned in eye before annihilating word with falconer obviously intended to follow up first ejaculation must be uttered mr romayne be speaking again in rapid businesslike tone now always with ring of triumph behind must come back with to night take up position a if nothing must shake must fight for credit social status tooth nail when have lost have lost everything have not lost yet risk be too great to run for retention not penal servitude asked julian with ghastly smile not penal servitude not hanging if be risk returned mother passionately what be better off if escape disgraced ostracised ruined beyond hope of reclamation than must be in convict cell what must have to live for to hope for when have lost position with world have lost everything what doe matter that go down in one wave rather than paused moment battling with fierce horror repulsion then went on again in tone eager decided risk be not so frightful after said show bold front will triumph over now listen to julian other man man ramsay be actual forger paused for answer apparently insistence of tone forced one from julian in spite of a far a actual commission of forgery go yes said sullenly then what be there to prove to prove mind that be party to julian glanced round at clemence a if involuntarily then looked recklessly back at mother laughed harshly fact began mother caught up word fact yes said if fact be denied can be proved if face meeting say that have be deceived even if must come to prosecution there be always loophole with good counsel facing out unflinchingly must come through untouched be only chance julian must dare chapter xv red glow from setting sun have shifted little fell now behind julian between clemence light seemed to isolate mother son shutting in alone together mr romayne stood few pace from julian not touching appealing to concentrating force on dominating of weaker nature julian stood doggedly before hand clenched face set near window looking across shabby little room from two figure eloquent of struggle crisis stood out so strangely be clemence eye fixed upon julian now a though life death hung on look aloof alike from clemence from mother son grim spectator holding in reserve weight of condemnation until upshot of scene must declare be dennis falconer for answer a though ringing word have touched so little that found not even worth trouble of articulate denial julian shook head sullenly gesture witnessed to heavy dead weight of dissent likely to be more difficult to act upon than most vehement opposition mr romayne paused for moment looking at lip taking firmer line eye flashing dont realise position said look at understand choice before on one hand be ignominy ruin end of career to reach have only to give way to nerve to act under influence of panic to run away in short on other hand moved step nearer to with tense emphatic gesture seemed outlet for of passionate urgency be keeping resolutely in hand on other hand be very reverse of social position consideration prosperous life to have always looked forward be to be retained by one bold stroke by little courage resolution at risk of what be by mean worse than life must inevitably be yours if nerve to run julian think what be at stake falconer eye have be fixed on mr romayne severe inexorable in condemnation travelled now to julian again julian made that dull gesture of negation over said doggedly ive staked lost have not lost yet mother cried vibration in voice be stronger now there be white patch coming going faintly about mouth will not lose while can lift hand to save think think before still happiness success life youve only to grasp instead of letting go think julian have be standing with haggard young face averted from staring sullenly at ground turned upon suddenly face quivering with impotent misery of regret voice ringing with hopeless bitterness theyre gone said ive thrown away might a well be dead thats true enough might be possible to brazen out dont know dont care wouldnt give anything worth having social position credit standing what good must be to im sick of whole thing ive done with incoherent hardly articulated word stopped abruptly seemed to struggle fiercely for mean of expression so fiercely that blind impotent wrestle with limitation of lifetime seemed to dominate situation for moment in mr romaynes agonised face a watched life seemed arrested be a though be groping fighting among sensation instinct so new to that have word in vocabulary in to clothe effort to express be instinct with despair of conscious futility seemed to break away at last rush upon wild confused declaration comprised that must grasp why must fight for what dont want cried hoarsely there nothing worth having now boy cry arrested clemence moving towards julian with shining eye white parted lip arrested falconer who have drawn nearer to mr romayne with desperate impulse to end struggle by throwing into scale against mr romayne weight of opinion boy boy dont talk like for heaven sake for heaven sake julian darling if not for for mother have lived for have have thought in life to save to protect to keep from ruin such a dont break heart ah broke into low wailing moan wringing hand together a eye fastened on face transfixed into expression of blank surprise a eye met hers for first

money position must create for to give standing in world a must leave nothing to wish for have be one thought one motive of life from time until now speech so terrible declaration of struggle foredoomed by own essence to failure struggle in foe be real combatant in desperate earnest weapon straw trembled into abrupt palpitating silence a though feeling be too intense for speech there be moment stillness like stillness of death stillness broken only by julian long laboured breath a stood facing face blanched frozen into image of horror then spoke be true have turned mechanically to

first time in life that stood in midst of be beyond power to analyse to estimate made attempt at speech bowed head in silence julian looked at for moment longer then turned face once more upon mother a though what saw there struck into very heart cry of pity tenderness broke from moved swiftly to putting arm about trying to draw into embrace a though have be once more little child julian cried boy boy try to understand try to understand why have told now dont ask to think of to think what repetition of past a threatens in must be to blow infinitely heavier agony infinitely crueller than what came upon twenty year ago because of long struggle to must bring defeat because of long hope resolution must take out of heart because of love for darling darling be kissing hand now passionately with oblivion of other presence in room have evinced throughout falconer watching fascinated almost awestruck saw a went on lift one of young man hand press to cheek stroking with wild nervous movement of

pas through wont last long lead to safety to firmer standing ground to new lease of life be clinging to convulsively touching hand hair face a though speech alone afforded insufficient outlet for agonised beseeching a spoke last word seized hand in thrust from not with personal roughness rather unconsciously involuntarily a in very isolation of despair life cried what can life give to beyond what ive got already ive got billet like father like son im bound for dog sooner later dont care to spin out journey who going to fight against fate be not fate through little room across above passion despair filled word rang out strong clear julian turned with convulsive start to meet clemence have come swiftly across room be standing beside facing a turned to facing falconer arrested in quick movement to interpose blindly instinctively a seemed between julian mother facing mr romayne a stood leaning heavily on back of chair eye strained terrible to see face ghastly humanity can touch of beautiful inspiring burning faith quivering personal realisation of unseen of man be part human love acting upon reacted on by divine instinct be shining out from clemences face paused hardly for instant a clear eye dark deep with intensity of fervour rested on julian a though saw only in world then voice rang out again sweet full there such thing a fate said not like that not fate that make bad there god julian trying to do right that matter nothing else in life that can do there nothing nothing can prevent oh dont say voice broke into great pity tenderness dont say that not harder for than for others whats hard be best worth doing julian drew step nearer to stretching out hand youre looking at wrong dear thing youve lost for good be not thing matter what one have people think of one thats nothing what one be oneself thats only thing to mind about stopped whole face stirred tremulous with conviction julian with impulsive movement caught hand in pressed forehead down upon in blind agony of self abasement im swindler clemmie cried thickly be a though have hardly taken in full sense of word be clinging to confessing to under blunted bewildered impetus cheat thief round thats what be thats not for ever cried such love hope courage shining in eye a must not let great tear fall can retrieve past can repent begin again ah know of course that what be done cant ever be undone what have done remains same for always can change can be different nothing else matter at what doe matter if people think cheat if be honest man nothing no more than matter to yourself if call honest man for ever when youre cheat paused again time did not speak lifted head drew to crushing hand against breast looking into eye with strange agonised struggle towards comprehension dawning in own there be moment dead silence there be that passing between clemence julian word must have touched final struggle towards dominion of man better nature falconer have fallen back be narrow conventional about morality have shrivelled into nothingness stood confessed to own consciousness for what be knew that great question now at issue be beyond reach of man practicality that must only stand aside mr romayne be gripping heavily at chair by stood impotent frozen despair paralysing from head to foot leaving alive sentient only eye must go back dear word fell from clemences lip tender distinct immutable a law of right wrong must take consequence of what youve done through pain shame youll get above to begin again julian lip white now a ash moved stiffly consequence whispered consequence clemmie consequence replied in ring of voice in clasp with hand closed over be courage conviction with sought to nerve ah dont know dont understand be there innocent people who may suffer for fault unless be there to take on besides how else dear how can begin again without having made amends how can free of past without acknowledging whats black bad in if acknowledge whats black bad how can hesitate to take punishment a if struggling life in be growing stirring under influence strange flickering light crept into julian face struggle in eye grew into faint suggestion of victory paused moment breath coming thick fast suppose suppose isnt good voice tense hardly audible seemed to catch strain like of man at very crisis of life suppose in must isnt so cried a spoke drew away from a though carried beyond beyond womanly love for in supreme declaration of truth be very being know isnt so there be must except god must to that must follow there be power can tear from hand

through room mr romayne fell heavily forward at foot chapter xvi will suffer more on upper landing of hotel in falconer have found julian clemence be standing one hand resting on handle of door have just closed behind looking in uncertain light of flickering gas jet into face of man to whom spoke be quick capable looking man with brisk professional manner evidently doctor clemences face be pale tired a though with strain watching low voice shook little doctor be drawing on left hand glove paused to answer must say that must not said be practically over gave keen rather curious look at clemence then added be alone with lady yes said clemence simply long night long day have passed between mr romayne one absorbing passion of life have fallen that solemn shadow before earthly passion pale fade away solemn shadow before whose creeping touch not strength of will not love can stand a fell to ground before son have loosed hold perforce on struggle burning resolution be life to have followed guide whom none may resist into valley through one must pas mist have lifted from more from that one long faint have be brought back only to fall into in such total unconsciousness have yielded twice to interval of physical pain terrible to see long hour have passed in one of space of blank unconsciousness julian romayne have seen mother for last time necessity for departure be pressing relentless meeting of shareholder be imminent meeting must face have left mother room in grey light of early morning with look on face clemence only witness of mute parting never forgot have gone away with dennis falconer to make preparation for surrender of to justice be not to be delayed now day be drawing to close doctor have paid last visit night be drawing on there be moment pause after clemences word then doctor wished professional good night a went downstairs turned went back into room be small room best hotel cared to place at disposal of sudden illness somewhat dingy ill appointed gaslight shaded from face upon bed shedding garish light upon rest of room touched nothing luxurious nothing present occupant must have realised in connection with very ring lying upon dressing table flashing under gaslight seemed to protest against such poor surroundings figure on bed lay motionless protesting never more lay in blank unconsciousness even when clemence crossing room stood for moment looking down whole face tender quivering then sank gently on knee pressed lip with womanly gesture of infinite pity to pale inanimate hand upon bed be over now practically a doctor looking at waning life from purely physical point of view have said struggle dread courage hope valiant ignorance of twenty year face upon pillow be face of vanquished face of one whose last vivid consciousness of earthly thing have be consciousness of failure for many minute clemence knelt there feeling of woman soul seeming to expend in soft mute pressure then rose quietly moved across room to make final preparation for night done came back again to bedside doing so started shadowy hand be moving feebly upon counterpane from out grey pinched face upon pillow two glazed blue eye be looking with restless searching movement a though in want of something rested upon clemence with recognition in a son wife drew nearer to quickly gently mr romayne moved feebly tried to turn head upon pillow a though moved by vague indefinite far away sense of dislike repulsion white lip moved uncertainly a did so faint sound came from between clemence bent over tenderly tried to catch word grew gradually little clearer boy faint uncertain voice muttered little boy great wave of pity yearning swept over clemence sank once more to knee fixing eye on poor worn face be of use to speak must voice reach to dim land where mother groped for little boy will come said will come by by a though voice have roused without penetrating to brain mr romayne moved again that slight feeble movement so eloquent of extremity of weakness eye turned to clemence with glance of vague unrecognising dislike said a though answering he too little paused again there be that groping movement of hand letter muttered letter dear mamma dear mamma there be restless distress in glazed eye now glance tore clemences heart feeble hand be moving painfully a watched with tear falling fast in impotent pity longing to satisfy craving something in movement unmeaning a seemed at first penetrated to clemences understanding with one of strange flash of comprehension only possible under so tense strain of sympathy nerveless hand be feeling for pocket in instant clemence have risen crossed room put hand into pocket of dress mr romayne have worn finger touched paper drew out instantly saw that be yellow faded with age moved quickly back with to bedside hand eye be still moving muttered word be audible no longer a clemence put paper gently between thin finger felt with sudden thrill of awe that be growing cold touch seemed to rouse mr romayne once more finger closed on paper a if instinctively restless distress died out of eye a tried vainly to unfold paper clemence put out hand gently did work for dying finger have strength on dying face there dawned pale shadowy smile yes said yes dear mamma dear mamma loving son julian with son name on lip mr romayne left behind passed from ignorance to
