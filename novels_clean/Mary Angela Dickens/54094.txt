expression in shrewd willow eye a spoke expression of amused curiosity dines at club suppose enquired indifferently after moment yes at other fellow club laughed mother legal institution suppose there be brief silence one of silence come when one branch of conversation be felt to be exhausted then loring finished tea put down cup settled into comfortable attitude forget whether be taken with ibsen craze last season mr romayne said will have to tie wet towel round head wont be becoming im afraid give up to solitary meditation hear be to be thing winter tell ibsen repeated mr romayne reflectively obviously searching in memory for idea to attach to name be a obviously conscious of having heard before ibsen oh yes with sudden flash of inspiration oh yes of course doll house man that everybody talked of going to see just at end of season first of startling picture of human nastiness have since exercised criticism to so great extent may may not be revelation have taken wonderful hold upon certain section of society have become a mr romaynes word implied almost fashion in preceding june society be always inclined to be literary intellectual rather to assumption of quality in winter be with sense of absolute duty of priming beforehand that mr romayne continued with appearance of deepest interest ah im sorry to say be never able to spare evening everybody told about though must have be awfully clever interesting see just at time one have so much on hand there be that dreadful bazaar too by bye have pomeroys come back yet do know mr loring mr loring believed that have not after little discussion of probable plan mr romayne returned to subject of ibsen be going to bring out new play of did say said carelessly so hear answered loring extraordinary piece of work with tremendous theory in of course idea be influence of heredity mr romayne started slightly strange flash leapt up in eye a died out quenched a seemed by iron resolution left curious expression on face be expression in light scorn normal attitude of willow fashionable woman towards deep question of kind seemed to be battling indomitably for place against something be hardly to be held at bay by mean to be suppressed heredity said ring of voice matched expression of face rather interesting subject continued loring indolently scientific question in social aspect be just becoming fashionable wonderful how long have stopped short at inheritance of roman nose violent temper plain fact of kind without getting to anything more subtle yes suppose be answered mr romayne there be hard restraint in voice loring took for preoccupation laid to account of expectation of julian be sitting with back to light must not see expression of face awfully consoling dont know went on in same tone to feel that one can lay one little failing to account of dead gone ancestor with scientific mind dont notice by bye even greatest most enthusiastic scientist show tendency to refer virtue talent back presume be always developed mr romayne laughed a be obviously intended to do laugh be rather harsh do know think scientific men be dreadful race said think that know so much better than everybody else what know be so immensely important a rule know about something that really cant know anything about if must must be great deal better not to bother about spoke with confident conclusive superiority be only possible perhaps in section of society to knowledge brain power be among minor entirely unimportant factor of life except when knowledge be knowledge of world brain power that have adapted to requirement of society superiority in tone rang strained false seemed to be forcing attitude on even more than on loring there be faint ring of defiance in voice utterly inconsistent incompatible with word spoke combination be curiously suggestive of consuming fear denies very existence of by be created loring however be too fully occupied with cynical appreciation of humorous aspect of wholesale condemnation of learning by crass ignorance to detect anything beneath surface enigmatical smile touched lip there great deal of penetration in what say said of course there must be think youre little sweeping perhaps when say that dont really know anything take heredity for instance actual fact capable of demonstration that lorings eloquence be broken short off at moment door opened julian romayne came into room mr romayne started to foot at sight of with strange hardly articulate sound be almost gasp of relief though passed unnoticed by of two men a julian advanced quickly to loring how be old man said pleasantly awfully glad to see back again be reward of merit see said mr romayne a loring replied in same tone come home to tea with mother find friend will have tea sir face be still little odd unusual looking especially about eye touch laid upon julian a if to enforce word be strangely clinging nervous in quick pressure talk drifted in sort of direction after more le personal either to speaker to mutual acquaintance a moment passed lorings eye be fixed once twice with momentary intentness on younger man that new touch of independence about julian did not belong only to manner with mother be just perceptible towards friend whom have hitherto admired with boyish enthusiasm loring rose to go at last a did so turned to julian if be not that dont like to propose deserting mr romayne said must ask if wouldnt come keep company over lonely dinner at club julian suppose dont want to get rid of by chance continued turning to mr romayne mr romayne julian laughed simultaneously julian with little touch of embarrassment im sure mother have objection to getting rid of said julian rather hastily unfortunately im engaged engaged said loring lucky fellow to have engagement at time of year tone be little satirical julian who be following out of room flushed slightly colour be still considerably deeper than usual when dashed upstairs after seeing loring out put head in at drawing room door im afraid must be off directly dear said carelessly be awfully sorry to get in so late allardyce wanted hour later julian be dining at restaurant dining simply dining alone having finished dinner smoked cigarette glancing once twice at watch a did so took hat coat strolled out be nearly quarter past eight only light be of course light of street lamp gas in shop window passed along piccadilly not quickly with deliberate intention of man who have definite destination until came to certain side street then turned out of piccadilly slackening step sauntered slowly up on right hand pavement have walked up to end of street casting sundry glance back over shoulder a did so be turning once more a though to saunter down street again when figure of woman entered at piccadilly end a soon a saw julian threw away cigar quickening step went to meet face raised to be face of girl on whose behalf have interfered in piccadilly ten day before first word be uttered in soft musical voice have thanked then have be waiting said im sorry tone of few word with answered together with expression with looked at showed a clearly a volume of explanation must have done where how new julian be being developed only minute two said lonely fellow like doesnt mind waiting few minute for chance of talk a ive told before looked up at with simple pitying eye certain wistfulness of expression too seems so sad said softly youll make friend in london soon im sure have be working very hard to day have be working very hard be more important question said turning eye away from candid brown one with to do justice certain passing shame in own im afraid there need to ask that look awfully tired clemence shook head with pretty brisk movement of reassurance oh said not be at hard day never seems hard know when dont have to stay late unless something go wrong in work room dont think that happens very often there be simple genuine content in tone manner in word be spoken taken in conjunction with colourlessness of face tired look about eye poor worn dress told wonderful little story of patience serenity of spirit julian romayne knew of clemence brymer brief very simple outline of life a have told to be comprised in few by mean uncommon fact be hand in one of big millinery establishment have worked at same place for last two year before time have lived from childhood first with married brother then when died with widow child from certain touch of reserve in manner of speaking of particular year julian have gathered that have be hard one marriage of brother widow departure to australia have left clemence alone in london parent told julian have come from cambridgeshire one of faint recollection of father who have died when be only five year old be of sitting on knee in little attic room in london being told by about country home mother have died when be baby scanty recollection seemed to centre round father who a said simply have be very good man simple trust confidence in face a raised to julian now be curious contrast to nervous half frightened uncertainty of glance at on night in spring when have shared for two three minute shelter of same portico paradoxical a seems at first expression be outcome on different line of same moral characteristic clemence though there be that about a face testified kept in unconsciousness innocence strangely aloof apart from world have not spent life in london without learning to know danger very purity made glance be forced to encounter in street at night distress to made very proximity of unknown gentleman uneasiness to made theoretical evil in short terror to rendered singularly incapable of recognising existence on baldest line confidence be quickly won because though be conscious of world of evil about be a something large black obvious that regarded brought into contact with anything fair seeming be touched by whiteness of own temperament with such unconscious extraneous aid thinnest veil be enough to hide from anything behind confidence once won might be destroyed must hardly be shaken something in julian face manner have won for outline of circumstance have given have won something else pity exactly by what motive have be actuated in statement to julian must have found rather hard to say a matter of fact never asked question before end of first walk together have presented to a medical student living entirely alone in london having female friend even acquaintance wearying often of rough masculine companionship of fellow on ground have asked when parted at end of little poverty stricken street near farther end of hammersmith road whether might meet now again walk home with have hesitated for instant then have assented very simply havent have to work late for four night now said a turned back upon piccadilly began to walk steadily in opposite direction will have to to morrow night do think lifted eye to face a spoke a looked down met must have be clear to onlooker be charm that long evening walk possessed for julian in girl clear eye there be admiration absolute reliance in look with answered there be conscious superiority protection just at moment when be sore smarting with sense of humiliation futility when in newly aroused angry discontent intercourse with woman of own class have become farce inanity to accident have thrown into power to create for a be world in have suddenly revealed a lacking in actual life must be lavished upon for acquaintance of piccadilly have absolutely surroundings except such a chose to give julian romayne of society nonentity figure head a have muttered angrily to have existence for be julian own private julian personality developed side by side with sudden violent re adjustment of conception of relation with world who be looked up to listened to respected deferred to during hour walk lay between side street out of piccadilly certain little street out of hammersmith road vague undefined craving for pre eminence admiration have risen in with realisation of dependence reflected nature of light with shone in society to weak nature in that craving have once stirred matter little by what mean be met so that be to extent satisfied walk of to night be repetition of walk have preceded talk little more intimate little more personal in tone than of predecessor a of of latter in turn have be in course of day something have occurred to remind clemence of father father old home in interval of julian talk about told good deal about thought of little country place of how there have be brymers here for generation generation must have be puritan once said julian laughing a often laughed at little grave turn of speech a looked into sweet serious face work girl a be seemed to have acquired talk voice of kind simple form of word accent gentle voice seemed to belong to past quiet full of modest dignity of london of nineteenth century hardly know must have made awfully jolly little puritan clemence dont know said simply be so little when father died felt dreadfully ive heard when came to london nearly broke heart why did do then said julian lightly thought ought returned girl see there be nothing to do at feldbourne nothing ploughing country thing know father thought man ought to do something that everything be meant to go on get better know man ought to help ought to work so of course be obliged to come see have come to end of road now where always said good night a spoke be standing still looking simply into face looked at for moment with something in eye seemed to be struggling vaguely into life side by side with careless mockery of set be obliged to come because thought ought said do always do what think ought clemence try said simply one try suppose laughed laugh be so like mother not quite so freely a usual held out hand dont know about that said good night clemence good night said hesitated moment never went to meet without firm definite intention of sealing parting with kiss have never done so yet did not do now good night said again rather lamely then parted going quickly quietly down street passing out of into noise bustle of hammersmith road once there paused a though undecided too early to go home said to ill go down to club for bit there be good many men in club room when entered hour later julian quite young man to julian who have walked to hammersmith road be discussing latest society topic with much animation over whisky seltzer when loring to whom have nodded at other end of room strolled up to cigar in hand dinner be failure enquired there be nothing particular about word tone in be uttered be singularly almost significantly devoid of expression there be keen satirical expression in eye a fixed on julian julian started slightly at word curious flash of expression passed across face more le said with careless frankness seemed just trifle excessive who be man dont think know said julian carelessness bordering on defiance loring smiled smile be never particularly pleasant at moment be unusually cynical know good many men too observed chapter ii slight alteration in julian of marston loring be conscious subtly evinced consequence of alteration namely that intimacy with son no longer involved of necessity even introduction far le intimacy at mother house have effect upon lorings relation with mr romayne unless indeed might be said to emphasize position a friend of house during three week followed immediately upon first call after return to town saw at least a much of mr romayne a have done in course of previous three week since julian first introduction of though young man be no longer obvious tangible link between dined in queen anne street few day after return except on occasion chanced that hardly ever met mr romayne julian together met latter often enough at one other of club about town on former called a in duty bound after dinner again yet again at short interval have consulted about purchase of old oak with wished to surprise julian purchase seemed to necessitate in eye frequent consultation also happened to meet once twice when be paying call be always apparently pleased to see more pronounced perhaps when met among other people than when received alone still always more le present there be certain eager unconscious assertion of something like intimacy with about manner marston loring be quick to observe new note prided likewise on caution with refused to allow even value believed to posse caught quick recognition of presence tendency to draw always into conversation in happened to be engaged tacit assumption of mutual interest understanding lurking in voice sifted dismissed thing cynically a probably meaningless astute a be never thought of in connection with constant reference to julian question a to julian doings with conversation with be full of latter took hardly account except for occasional sardonic smile clever a thought there be vast tract of human nature to have clue in very existence of disbelieved consequently be not surprising that must now then mistake cause for effect at about noon on bright cold october day got out of hansom at twenty two queen anne street with certain cynical expectancy on face week have passed since mr romayne julian returned to town on close september day have brought on winter have settled winter society fairly into groove on previous evening marston loring mr romayne have met at dinner party mr romayne have be alone to enquiry made for son regret at absence have replied with gaiety became absolutely feverish a evening wore on that be unfortunately engaged throughout evening a though kind of strain be acting upon self control characteristic of demeanour towards loring have be slightly exaggerated loring have detected before have exchanged two sentence with that be not that be unstrung nervous arguing on totally false premise have come to totally false conclusion have pressed restlessly about commission be doing for have twisted morning into excuse for coming to see when knew must be at home be unheard of hour know said a rose to receive with exclamation of surprise want little more detail one two measurement before can execute order satisfactorily have seen before spoke that weakness of night before from cause have arisen have passed away line about face be set into determined uncompromising cheerfulness voice a spoke conveyed same impression be more than kind of be very glad to see said im always glad to see julian friend know last word with laugh dont happen to have met morning suppose loring signified without hint of sarcasm that be more common not to meet man one must wish to meet in temple than to meet mr romayne laughed again know said one get absurd impression that men doing same thing in same place must be always coming across one very ridiculous of course have always have knack of finding one out though suppose be quite one anothers greatest chum arent be chum still word by bye believe so returned loring carelessly yes continued in different tone dont know when ive taken to one a took to julian there be little gesture half mocking half involuntary accepted word a personal compliment mr romayne said with smile be curious pair of friend too be not julian voice in uttering name seemed to have acquired new tenderness in past month lingered over now evidently unconsciously involuntarily julian be such boy be great deal older than ought to be shook head at with reproving laugh answered in most blas manner im man of world see knew through through before julian have left school hope wouldnt have preferred boy for chum there be daring challenge in tone made question personal rather to than to julian mr romayne took from other point of view quite contrary said quickly boy must not have be at thing for be delighted to think that mentor be wise one rely on mr loring do know stopped abruptly last word uttered suddenly involuntarily have seemed curiously charged with meaning must not get expressed paused instant then half a though wished to laugh impression away half a though wished word to have significance added youll remember wont will go down see about fitting rose a spoke led way down to julian room room be already a perfect a might be only great restlessness irrepressible incessant impulse to give pleasure to occupant must have dictated further improvement a mr romayne talked explained same restless instinct of service expressed in sundry little involuntary touch to trifle about room about julian chair writing table door bell rang at length face over new weaker expression have stolen hardened suddenly im afraid must send away now said turning to loring ive made appointment for morning to get through bothering business understand now just what want though dont think so answered loring reflectively must have be strange indeed if have not understood by time im sorry must go im sorry too said mr romayne lightly hate business loses none of solemnity can assure when be transacted by connexion dennis falconer be trustee know loring smiled did not detect anything behind word struck always a perfectly natural that mr romayne connexion must be somewhat antagonistic must imagine must be rather ponderous man of business said parlour maid entered at moment to announce mr dennis falconer be in drawing room a left room mr romayne turned again to loring to tell truth find rather ponderous at time said with laugh didnt say once that altitude be oppressive well must go be oppressed held out hand a spoke then paused oh by bye said julian want to come dine one day next week only he so much engaged day will suit thanks answered loring will be charmed face be quite impassive a spoke be wondering nevertheless whether julian have a yet heard of invitation from what have observed lately fancied that julian have reason of own for avoiding home engagement be engaged on tuesday thursday continued on other day will be delighted did julian have successful evening yesterday mr romayne have explained to on previous night with forced merriment that son be dining with fellow say yes think so answered lightly dont know fellow be know well then will send note have moved out into hall a talked now a paused at foot of stair shook hand again went out of house a turned went up to drawing room dennis falconer be standing waiting by fire most punctual of men said airily a shook hand how do do dennis falconer have by time have five month of inaction ill health fact that be heartily weary of by mean served to soften natural tendency of manner towards reserve severity in settling down to london life for winter too fact that be no longer new lion gave added tinge of monotony to existence for honestly unconscious a be of truth day went very heavily with be conscious of having come to dreary bit of life journey endured conscientiously if with rather conscious self respect added gravity silence seemed to under circumstance by mean to be deprecated under circumstance contrast between mr romayne a exchanged triviality of situation be inexpressible be not surprising that touched almost instantly upon business be cause of interview be not long affair turned upon mr romaynes desire to have rather more ready money at command dennis falconer having explained situation to having stated view evidently conscientiously compelled thereto having entered formal protest against instruction returned to pocket notebook to have be referring a if to emphasize close of matter then paused mr romayne have drawn quick slight breath of relief at action breath seemed to suspend for instant on pause eye with watched be very bright intent a only near relative began with formal gravity a son only near relative feel bound to take opportunity of approaching subject have be in thought for time man of ordinary knowledge experience of world having regard only to most ordinary circumstance must tell that so large allowance a make son be not advisable thing for young man mr romayne have listened with expression veiled repressed into intent vigilance a finished dull flush be none le hot significant because have not vivid intensity of angry flush of youth crept into face eye glittered tone a spoke witnessed to strong self control intense determination not to abandon position to lessen by one jot distance have set between be sorry think so said carelessly think so emphatically returned must think so for young man for william romaynes son mr romayne have be gathering up paper from table with light careless movement rose now rather suddenly still carelessly what seemed to almost shameful callousness quickened falconer into what thought righteous disregard for conventionality too rose movement be response to hers rather seemed to crush dominate suggestion of easy dismissal with implacable austerity of reality not to be put aside stood looking at forcing by suddenly asserted superiority of man determination mental weight to meet grave condemning eye doe son know what father be said in low stern voice have forced down barrier have annihilated distance faced with glittering eye that dull flush over face mask gone said from hard defiant voice also artificiality have dropped away know nothing of danger have safeguard have money at command must be temptation to young man think what be doing for couple of second confronted one separated by conventionality man woman with common memory of common horror between holding together in spite of obstacle temperament habit mental moral must interpose then with tremendous effort woman strength reasserted by sheer force of will thrust away horrible reality have forced upon laughed really dont know what be talking about said be sure mean most kindly a to spoilt boy allowance wont trouble to discus so good of to take trouble to think of so unnecessary for moment falconer gazed at almost petrified with amazement disgust perceptive imaginative faculty have not developed with passing of year mental process be slow for ghastly exaggeration accepted careless willow artificiality of tone manner smiling unfeelingness of rebuff have given exactly a appeared upon surface be second even before thoroughly realised how ruthlessly completely have imputed to attribute of meddler a did so added distance touched uncompromising sternness have gradually settled down upon face beg pardon said formal unmeaning word seemed in enforced condescension to level to carry with lofty condemnation be even contempt good day added stiffly then not seeing apparently hand extended to with hard smiling good bye left room mr romaynes face remained curiously blanched looking afternoon a though have received kind of shock spent afternoon in paying call whenever returned alone to carriage there crept back into eye bright eager a talked laughed certain haunting questioning not to be driven quite away by simulation of gaiety a afternoon work drew to close eye be no longer quite free from even a made attractive conversation when rose to bring last visit to end be looking very tired be just shaking hand with hostess when mr halse be announced to spare one iota of what considered social duty even when duty took form of civility to woman disliked be not mr romaynes way with exactly exclamation of pleasure surprise situation demanded waited pleasantly desirous of exchanging greeting with new comer while mr halse bore down vociferously upon mistress of house mr halse have only very recently returned to town there be excitement of novelty about appearance be good deal louder even than usual partly a result of excitement partly a result of absence from town have also grown considerably stouter announcement of fact lamentation explanation mingled with greeting of hostess be still upon lip when turned to mr romayne abominable isnt said pouring out word a fast a must come without waiting for answer such trial suppose will have to go in for turkish bath something horrible of sort how be everybody how be that wicked young man of yours mr romayne heard of going on at ponsonbys by bye do tell that hilda newton be engaged

to do tone of independence have come to be sometimes hardly perceptible must hardly have be more strongly evidenced than by one two spasmodic effort to pas out of own life where something be evidently not to liking into life shared state of thing be always more le disturbing to mental atmosphere more le according to sensitiveness of person upon whom act a mr romayne sat opposite julian furtive glance cast at moody preoccupied face became more more anxious restless tentative uncertain tone in manner of dealing with have developed during last month increased moment by moment voice laugh a chatted to ignoring indifferent reception of little bit of news became moment by moment more forced unreal that nerve self control be not so reliable a have once be be evident in fact that took refuge a be not unusual with in day in painful exaggeration bright little flow of talk stopped at last however julian making attempt to fill gap there be total silence be broken again by mr romayne be talking now evidently for talking sake a though be no longer capable of weighing word in intense desire to penetrate vague atmosphere must not challenge be making advance blindly met mr halse yesterday began gaily did tell fortunately only encountered for few moment doubt whether must be alive to tell tale paused julian smiled absently have finished lunch have risen strolled to fire with cigarette be thinking vaguely a voice broke in upon meditation perhaps rather feeling than thinking that mother be rather artificial society woman be artificial have thought once twice lately word be acquiring new significance to bestowed immense amount of conversation upon in course of few minute continued mr romayne in sprightly tone son be beginning to hear for first time a something jarring amongst other thing told little piece of news will interest yes said julian indifferently fellow didnt always want to be entertained be saying to irritably be nuisance thought have wandered completely be going over fruitless hour have spent alone walking up down certain side street off piccadilly on previous evening hour be accountable for gloomy humour morning when became aware of mother voice saying with insistent gaiety well sir arent broken hearted julian started made futile effort to realise what mother have said necessity for effort failure proved by mean soothing to said rather impatiently im awfully sorry mother im afraid didnt hear didnt hear echoed mr romayne in mock appeal to heaven earth to witness fact too have made effort failure result with be to increase nervous recklessness five week ago be ready to eat poor little mother because prevented proposing to young woman now when tell shes engaged doesnt even hear perhaps youve forgotten hilda newton very existence lord who be successor julian flushed angrily good looking face took sullen expression shes not likely to have successor a call said fellow doesnt care to have kind of thing happen twice mother broke into thin nervous laugh dont mean to say rankles still said gaily be reason of devotion to work fellow silly old boy ought to be thoroughly glad of escape by time think will follow dennis falconer advice cut down allowance to teach reason will jest dragged in a be have forced ring about perhaps bore unconscious testimony to oppressively insistent power of haunting questioning of yesterday julian knowing nothing of be simply conscious of ever increasing irritation from voice manner dont see what business allowance be of dennis falconer said gruffly then side by side with growing sense of mother artificiality there grew in overmastering desire for woman presence simple presence to social subtlety affectation be unknown why hadnt clemence met yesterday evening how must tell when must see again to morrow must not meet then reflection paused a be absorbed in vague sense of discomfort discontent until fresh thought stole across thought presented by mean for first time day why must not go see afternoon after why must not never have done thing did mean so much a seemed to mean if did why not dont see mother said julian smiled grimly a thought how little knew question be answering business isnt private business to find nice wife not yours at understand last word with laugh must be pretty suppose good style at rate must be rich must have making of good hostess in really think must begin to look out dont think julian interrupted be hardly conscious that be doing so have hardly heard word atmosphere of perfectly appointed room with artificial mistress have suddenly become

to bond street to athenum camden town there be air about a of one who plume on having done clever thing a settled for long drive there be curious excitement radiance in face when cab reached destination at last jumped out walked rapidly eagerly away be not neighbourhood likely to be familiar to young man about town julian pursued way with certainty of man who have followed several time before in about ten minute turned into neat respectable little street consisting of two short row of small house with diminutive bow window to first floor room about way down stopped at house on right hand side knocked with quick decided touch be object of deepest interest a stood upon little doorstep to brisk curious looking woman who be standing in ground floor window of house opposite opportunity for observation be brief door be opened almost immediately with pleasant greeting to woman who stood aside passed ran upstairs course of action evidently expected of opened door of front room on first floor went eagerly in here be cried did expect so soon standing in middle of room a though have suddenly started from chair with hand outstretched towards be clemence on third finger of thin left hand there shone bright gold ring face be delicate rosy red a though with sudden joy just touched with shyness beauty have be latent in tired work worn face seemed to have be touched into vivid almost startling life by hand of great magician by contrast with face turned to julian now large eye deep glowing mouth trembling little with tenderness face of month ago pure sweet a have be must have looked like inanimate mask of dormant soul soul be awake now quivering with consciousness womanhood have come with purity beauty beyond possibility of girlhood looking at face now be easy to see by what mean alone latent strength of character might be developed drew into arm with eager confident touch yielded to completely clinging to with colour deepening in face a kissed boyishly again again be fortnight only since have kissed first be watching for said softly heard step laughed exultantly kissed again thought youd be watching said though im earlier than told do know much earlier say clemence how jolly room look be small room furnished decorated in simplest cheapest style a great contrast a must well be imagined to room to be accustomed be very clean very comfortable looking there be homelike restful atmosphere about might well have radiated from slender figure in plain dress with shining wedding ring lovely flushing face smiled very sweet pleased little smile do think so really said be so glad be that beautiful basket chair sent flower glanced a spoke at pot of chrysanthemum standing on little table in window then turned to again eye little deprecating do think ought to spend so much money said shyly julian laughed flung arm round a surveyed little room with vivid air of proprietorship here be master here word be law here be in world of own making only fellow creature be subject look jolly pronounced again a final dictum now come sit down clemence tell youve be doing since yesterday settled into arm chair by fire with lordly air a spoke adding come sit on stool by like sweetest girl in world clemence hesitated hardly perceptibly hers be nature to trivial endearment came strangely almost painfully have not yet learned to caress in play there be innate unconscious personal dignity about to trivial self abasement be unnatural almost before be conscious of reluctance there swept over like great wave of hot sweetness remembrance that be wife be duty to do a wished came softly across room sat down on stool have drawn out laid cheek against arm be trivial action very quietly performed be instinct with beauty of absolute self abnegation a if a physical presence touched something of spirit touched too sudden quiet fell upon exultant self satisfied boy at whose foot sat not for first time by mean there stole over julian vague uneasiness vague realisation of something beyond ken something in light of shrank unaccountably from hand closed round woman hand lying in with touch very different from boyish passion of previous caress for moment did not speak then said slowly in low dreamy voice clemence cant think why must ever have loved hand in thrilled slightly head on shoulder be just shaken clemence must not tell why loved bald outline must trace a most woman can trace must look back upon first sense of reliance pity admiration sense of strange delightful companionship why wherefore of mystery have given to young man other key of soul be to a miracle a indeed there be always something miraculous in even when seems most natural to account for love to say that in case be natural in case be unnatural be to confess ignorance of first great attribute of love that be supernatural divine there be silence longer one time strange spell sank deeper into julian spirit said nothing must have be relief to to speak to reduce to word indeed to definite consciousness vague trouble oppressed outline be too large too vague for be in truth sense of total moral insolvency must not understand a such having moral standpoint clemence moved spoke hand lay motionless in cheek rested against beautiful eye looked straight before with dreamy almost awestruck gaze at last with desperate determination to thrust away so unusual oppression julian moved slightly began to talk wanted to get back sense of superiority voice accordingly took most boyish masterful tone havent told what youve be doing clemence said have given notice at bonnet shop a told clemence lifted head sat up clasping hand lightly on arm of chair said gently thought must ask to think about again must so much rather go on if didnt mind for one thing must do day looked up into face a spoke with deprecating pleading eye be full of submission too submission be very pleasant to julian do mind said authoritatively cant have clemence cant always see home dont see wont have about at night alone besides dont choose that must work do so want to said laying hand timidly beseechingly on will be so difficult for to keep will overwork im so afraid oh wont let help ive

how do suppose must attend to work when im kept at hospital in evening if be thinking time of alone in street must give notice on monday looked at wistfully for moment be condemning to long day of idleness to constant uneasiness reproach on behalf to certain loss of self respect self sacrifice be instinctive with very well said simply little victory assertion of authority restored julian spirit completely plunged into discursive talk more le egotistical be necessarily founded on falsehood must have be delicate question to decide when talk ceased to be consciously untruthful became expression of fictitious julian in whom real julian absolutely believed afternoon wore on winter twilight fell bringing with slight return of fog of morning two hour have passed before julian moved reluctantly said that must go will come to morrow said taking face between hand kissing well go out into country if fine wish be summer time have ever seen river clemence not in country said must be nice how much youve seen do know often think that must wish sometimes be lady dont know anything havent seen anything faltered rose laughing drawing up into arm one can know thing said lightly one can see thing one can be clemence do see oh what bore be to have to go be lingering undecidedly a though little pressure must have scattered resolution to wind seated once more in chair have just quitted since have said that must go never occurred to clemence to ask to stay if be not duty must never leave if be duty now how must hold back to morrow will come said looking into face with brave smile dont believe want to stay returned half laughing half vexed dont said simply caught in arm again what shame said there good bye be coming to door shook head ill stay here said watch from window see farther so ah rather foggy im so sorry youll look up good bye lifted face to kissed tenderly shyly left standing by window julian ran downstairs let out stood for moment on doorstep a realised disagreeable nature of atmosphere at same instant door of house opposite opened man came out attended to threshold by woman caught sight of julian instantly said something to man a stood in shadow in deferential whisper julian shook confounded fog then glanced up at window from light streamed on face waved hand turned away walked rapidly down street pulling up coat collar a went a went dennis falconer slowly descended two step of opposite house slowly very slowly followed chapter v good bye so glad to have seen what dear mr ponsonby be going to run away too so kind of to come out on afternoon good bye be friday afternoon friday be mr romaynes day particular friday have be about a unpleasant atmospherically a be possible for even november day to be short of actual dense fog have be very dark drizzling rain dirty rain too have fallen unceasingly under circumstance be rather surprising that one must have ventured out even in most luxurious brougham than mr romaynes visitor must have be comparatively few in number departure of lady to whom farewell have be spoken with whom have be exchanging social commonplace for last quarter of hour left alone a returned to chair by dainty tea table poured out cup of tea have apparently very little expectation of further caller though be only just past five oclock for when door bell rang few minute later paused look of surprise crossed face put down cup with little sigh be more concession made to dictum of conventionality that caller be bore than expression of real feeling then a door opened rose with touch of genuine satisfaction dear mr pomeroy exclaimed how sweet of to come out on shocking day really must have have intuition of forlorn condition think maud dear how be have given left hand to girl in familiar caressing way a retained pomeroys right hand now drew elder lady with charming insistence towards large inviting looking chair indicating to daughter with pretty gesture that be to take low seat near table be ill wind blow one good continued gaily a mr pomeroy greeted placidly be really too delightful to get to myself like how seldom one get chance of cosy chat how very seldom come with people of others with whom one must thoroughly enjoy have tea wont oh yes really must be so much more friendly laughed a spoke turned to girl sitting demurely on low seat near with tacit claim on sympathy comprehension be very fascinating miss pomeroys pretty expressionless lip smiled sweetly mother who be always ready to yield to pressure where cup of tea be concerned that soothing beverage being forbidden by medical authority answered contentedly well thanks yes think will one really want cup of tea on day like doesnt one mr pomeroy have rarely be known to leave statement unqualified by question be really very disagreeable weather isnt not that seems to trouble at mr pomeroy smiled one of slow amiable smile a spoke be so glad to see looking so much better mr romayne laughed be very well indeed thanks said ive not be ill know of dear mr pomeroy mr pomeroy shook head gently thought do know when first came home that looked a though holiday have be little too much for so many people holiday be little too

shut up a be now must miss very much said mr pomeroy placidly mr romayne did not answer directly except with laugh be almost inclined to envy mother with daughter said smiling at miss pomeroy again wonder now sudden idea have apparently struck mr romayne wonder whether must lend daughter now then wonder whether must consent to be lent must be delighted said mr pomeroy with vague amiability equally vague glance at daughter im sure maud will be delighted too wont maud delighted assented maud with pretty promptitude well then must arrange time other declared mr romayne gaily perhaps must come spend week with maud must be charming did not press point letting subject drop with apparent carelessness talking about other thing always keeping girl in conversation turning to now then with pleasant familiar word gesture be lightly affectionate mother daughter have risen to take leave when said carelessly oh by bye maud dear have anything to do to morrow afternoon ive be bothered into taking two ticket for matine charity affair know say will be rather good must be so nice of to come with will be very nice of to take be response thank very much minute two more passed in arrangement of place hour for meeting then mr pomeroy drifted blandly out of room followed by daughter mr romayne be again alone walked to fireplace time putting one foot on fender stood looking down face intent satisfied just right sort of girl said to herself just right sort of girl be wearing little gold bangle julian have given on birthday one miss pomeroy have helped to choose be turning on wrist with tender contemplative touch be so absorbed in reflection that did not hear servant come into room notice for moment that girl be standing beside with letter started at last looked up took letter opened carelessly without looking at a woman took away tea table dear cousin hermia unless hear from to contrary propose to call on to morrow saturday at three oclock on matter of grave importance faithfully yours dennis falconer mr romaynes face have changed slightly a began to read changed hardened a finished drew letter through finger with gesture of mere impatience be somehow belied by look in eye something of strained look have come back into must not see to morrow be saying to herself briefly be not going to put off maud pomeroy dennis falconer must fix time must write line at once walked quickly across to writing table sat down drew out sheet of paper took up pen then paused ten minute later note be written on way to post be not directed to dennis falconer began dear maud told miss pomeroy that business have turned up must make impossible for mr romayne to go to theatre on following afternoon that enclosed ticket hoping that maud might be able to use exactly on stroke of three on following afternoon door bell rang mr romayne be alone in drawing room apparently lazily pleasantly enough occupied with latest number of latest society paper a sound reached ear lip hardened into thin straight line eye flashed for moment with look of antagonism be almost defiant then servant announced mr falconer dennis falconer be looking very pale there be little colour even in lip face be set stern took hand mr romayne held out to replied to greeting in briefest possible phrase with softening of something curiously solemn inexorable about demeanour though eye rested on for instant with singular expression disliked despised woman before yet at moment pitied sit down said be charmed to see though do know have chosen inopportune moment have very pleasant engagement for afternoon nearly put off so hope business be really very grave voice be lightness very lightness with almost unusual loquacity with have received seemed to witness to presence in mind of recollection be determined to ignore recollection of last interview in very room there be air about of having entrenched behind barrier defied to pas of being resolute time against surprise against other method of attack be very grave said falconer in contrast with voice rang with stern heaviness must ask to prepare for bad news bad news echoed sharply a eye fixed on face grew suddenly bright keen oh money suppose voice jarred little though spoke very lightly said falconer tone be absolutely uncompromising on unsympathetic unimaginative mind effect of manner be to obliterate sense of pity beneath consciousness of retributive justice of moment before not money said with little unreal laugh well thats comfort at rate hand have clenched suddenly round arm of chair on monosyllable now paused moment almost a though breath have failed before said with affected carelessness if not what back be towards light falconer must not see face will answer question if will allow with said have noticed anything unusual in course of past month more in conduct of son in instant dead silence followed slight creaking sound made audible then died away clenched hand on bar of mr romaynes chair have passed slowly round with such intense pressure a to produce sound then answered a have previously answered in monosyllable said there be desperate effort in voice at carelessness at nonchalance at astonishment be penetrated through through with past antagonism towards defiance of man before accentuated into fierce repudiation falconer voice a answered seemed to confront defiance with inexorable fate be almost unfortunate said sternly in case fear that have to tell must fall with double treble severity a coming upon unawares will not think again have not be absent from home good deal have absence be satisfactorily accounted for have ever proved paused laying stress upon last word have ever proved such account a given by correct with valiant effort power of falconer must have appreciated have be able to penetrate beyond ghastly artificiality of result mr romayne rallied force strove to throw word back upon to defend entrench once for with only weapon knew broke into thin tuneless laugh what absolutely gruesome catechism cried really must take week of solitary confinement meditation among tomb isnt there book about by bye before must approach in duly sepulchral spirit do know must be absolute relief to if must come to point be taking for granted see that there be point be doubt compliment infinitesimal nature hardly deserves produce poor little thing for heaven sake point be said falconer grimly concisely son life a know be lie have sordid version of what be known a establishment be living with work girl in camden town there be choked strangled sound mr romaynes figure seemed to shrink together a though muscle have contracted in one simultaneous throb face must falconer have seen be rigid blank except for eye for first instant looked a patient might look who having suspected of deadly disease having congratulated on subsidence of symptom known hope learns from physician that subsidence of obvious symptom be in only more dangerous symptom still that be indeed doomed eye be eye of woman who look despair full in face with human being who keep hold of life reason can vivid agony of such vision endure for more than instant dulls by reason of very insupportableness time be empty word where mental suffering be concerned second hand of tall clock in corner have traversed dial only once before kind of film passed over agonised eye mr romayne spoke in thin hoarse voice man so close to be conscious of nothing short pause be revolted accordingly how do know even in moment instinct of defiance of personally must not wholly yield lingered in voice have old servant who life in camden town be invalid occasionally visit wife be garrulous woman thinking have claim on gratitude considers necessary to inform a to own neighbour affair visiting husband last friday week found wife greatly excited alarmed for reputation of street in let lodging by appearance in house opposite of couple whose relation to one have instantly be suspected by landlady neighbour though passed a newly made man wife with sudden low cry of inexpressible horror dismay mr romayne sprang to foot flinging out hand a though to keep off something intolerable to be borne cried breathlessly not that not married must be ruin ruin ruin dennis falconer paused freezing slowly into what seemed to surely justifiable abhorrence of woman before what if knew in heart that marriage must indeed mean ruin to young man so bald trampling down of moral aspect of position before practical be not decent be for woman that woman young man mother to be overwhelmed by moral horror to exclusion of other thought be practical alone have drawn show of emotion from mr romayne be sorry to have agitated said voice be cold cutting a steel have doubt in own mind that be not married have

be hand at one of big millinery establishment from affectation of innocence simplicity woman who have most opportunity of observing be inclined to think very worst of quick hissing breath unmistakeable breath of relief parted mr romaynes white lip have sunk down again in chair be grasping now with hand a leant little forward trembling in limb then be not likely be not likely that have married said in low rapid tone to herself rather than to falconer a seemed go on there be very little more to be said returned falconer icily have occupied room be to say girl have occupied visited day by son for three week now woman have discovered that have be somewhere in country together for week previously will of course be able to recall absence from home yesterday took away into country again be to return on monday stopped a though be no longer conscious of presence mr romaynes head be bowed slowly lower a if under irresistible weight until forehead rested on hand stretched out still upon arm of wide chair lifted face at last white haggard a twenty added year of life must not have made rose helping feebly with arm of chair like woman whose physical strength be broken falconer rose also be utterly alienated from be conscious of only most distant pity felt that be incumbent on to say something regret very much that must have fallen to lot to break to said stiffly awkwardly fear that coming from hesitated paused from out past confusing almost numbing vague ghastly influence have risen suddenly upon to strain that strange intangible awful cord of common knowledge by woman before be bound together revolt against deny presence a might under touch of influence last word have come from almost involuntarily have not known whither tended must bring to conclusion mr romayne looked in eye holding now to table by stood with weakness in ashen face seemed to be concentrating force into one final repudiation of ignored word a though have not spoken will ask to leave now said voice thin toneless though be left completely mistress of situation made movement to shake hand hesitated moment then bowed left room chapter vi jolly little place enough think lovely there be certain tone of regret of lingering reluctant farewell in voice though in julian case be light patronising in clemences dreamy tender a julian spoke shifted position slightly a leant against iron railing by stood let eye wander over scene before with condescending approval be standing on somewhat embryonic sea front of what few year before have be fishing village be now struggling rather inefficiently to become watering place such season a place must boast be entirely confined to summer month to frequenter of winter resort be absolutely unknown consequently intrinsic charm at moment in lassitude monotony left by departed glory might have be considered conspicuous by absence be glorious winter day slight sprinkling of snow have be frozen on roof of somewhat depressed looking house on unsightliness of unfinished sea front brilliant sunshine almost warm in spite of keen frosty air be glorifying alike deserted little town country beyond sparkling dancing sea frosty invigorating brightness found responsive chord in julian heart morning be not always so susceptible to such simple natural influence be in good humour with place have spent two wholly satisfactory day there two day moreover have have much same influence upon moral tone a change to bracing air simple wholesome food must have on physique accustomed to dissipation survey ended finally with clemences face be standing at side looking out over sea eye intent full of feeling beautiful face flushed still absorbed by mysterious charm of ceaseless movement trouble of bright water stretching away before what be looking at clemence said boyishly lifted eye to quite gravely simply only sea said be so beautiful feel a if never must leave off looking at make feel oh cant tell be like something great strong to take away with one looked away again oh wish wish need not go said with little sigh wish neednt returned julian have be dimly conscious of something in eye voice made previous word simple a seemed almost unintelligible to caught at last sentence a containing idea to must respond awful nuisance isnt do know be time started never mind well come down again soon stood for moment clemence looking out at sunny sea julian taking careless comprehensive view of whole scene then a though last look have contained respective farewell turned with one accord walked away in direction of railway station a if in turning back upon sunlit sea have turned back also upon something definite tangible certain gravity wistfulness crept gradually over clemences face a went crept over to settle down into sadness most unusual to a train carried quickly away towards london julian sitting opposite be vaguely struck by expression be awfully sorry to go back clemence said started slightly looked at with faint smile suppose be said have be very happy havent there be wistful regret in voice touched somehow answered demonstratively with cheery enthusiastic augury for future clemence smiled again again rather faintly know said mean hope so only dont know whats matter with feel a if something be finished julian broke into boyish laugh depression be by mean displeasing to be tribute to importance to dependence on necessity for cheering up implied exercise of superiority authority in delighted why what dear little goose be clemence said leaning forward to take hand in friday to monday cant last for ever know can be repeated again again why will be up day single day promise shouldnt wonder if found must spend evening with to morrow wont that console did not answer took one of hand in hers pressed to cheek consolation have hardly touched that strange oppression weighed upon julian in high feather quite unaware that only voice be heard by word passing by unheeded have be talking at great length about happiness before when said in hesitating far away voice must must come home with afternoon julian paused moment question be hardly response word have demanded then said decisively quite impossible be sorry to say must if must know dear quite impossible gave hand little quick pressure know of course murmured gently paused moment then said in low voice rather irrelevantly a seemed julian name still came rather hesitatingly from lip do think do like mr jackson mr jackson be name of woman whose room julian have taken for started slightly at question shes not bad sort said with rather startled consideration at least seems right isnt nice to clemence dont like room oh yes yes said quickly almost a though reproached for saying anything must suggest to even shadow of discontent on part like so very very much be only dont know what exactly somehow dont think mr jackson be quite nice woman have spoken last word hesitatingly with difficulty almost a though came from against will julian glanced at quickly what make think that clemence said with judicial masterfulness have reason mean clemence be hardly able to define even in own pure mind what be that jarred upon in landlady manner to julian be utterly unable to put feeling into word hasty disclaimer hesitating beginning faltering however served to remove misgiving have stirred lest knowledge of own real life must have come to woman knowledge be readier to let be reassured to dismiss subject in train be slackening speed for last time before reaching london intended to move into first class smoking carriage at approaching station julian be well aware of risk of discovery involved in journey with clemence though faced nonchalantly enough used wit with one who knew only in capacity of man about town budding barrister must have credited to reduce to minimum to be seen emerging from third class carriage at victoria station be wholly unnecessary risk to run avoided accordingly mustnt be fanciful clemmie said now in lordly airy fashion ive doubt mr jackson be very jolly woman a matter of fact look here dear must mind if went have smoke now isnt much further know one mustnt smoke in hospital see clemence be very pale when joined on platform at victoria joined after quick glance round to see whether must prepare for encounter with acquaintance did not speak only looked up at with grave steady smile made face sadder than before announcement of intention of putting into hansom drew from absolutely horrified protest must go in omnibus told hurriedly in underground have never be in cab

strike sprang out when carriage stopped to give hand before have given instruction to coachman followed into house have disappeared into lady cloak room consequently be not until came to a waited to follow into drawing room that really saw a eye rested on figure coming towards suddenly saw not sweet white face with wistful eye looking at from out of dingy frame chapter vii always excellently dressed mr romaynes appearance at moment be brilliant almost excessively brilliant seemed for small dinner party frock be of most pronounced type of full dress wore diamond not many so disposed a be reddish brown hair a to make greatest possible effect detail have caught son experienced eye have brought before by unaccountable law of contrast that other woman face lay in fact that to night for first time mother be slightly made up colour on cheek bright effectiveness of eye be result of art made look haggard julian decided with careless indifferent distaste then be following into room have hardly paused to speak to apparently imagined that be late be widely separated at dinner be not thrown together a happened during whole evening mr romaynes personality be factor in party not to be ignored that night be delightful everybody said be very select little dinner society romp went on afterwards romp to mr romayne contributed full share to julian newly acquired sense of mother artificiality be accentuated a evening passed on into something like repugnance repugnance when be seated with at last in brougham driving home produced in strong disinclination to rouse to assumption of vivacity made occupy with own thought so exclusively that never noticed that mother uttered not single word good night mother said absently a stood together in hall be stooping to kiss when stopped with slight peremptory gesture want to speak to said voice be tense little hoarse without word without so much a glancing at passed led way to smoking room turned up lamp with quick hard gesture then turned faced colour have faded from julian face have followed slowly with first sound of voice conviction have come to that be discovered there be certain weakness in hitherto undeveloped by circumstance of life radical factor in character morally speaking be coward hour have come be afraid to meet came just inside door stood leaning against writing table confronting mother looking at speaking tell where have be since friday said low peremptorily then stopped abruptly putting out hand a though to prevent from speaking a spasm of pain distorted face said in hoarse breathless way dont youll tell lie dont know have put out hand be steadying by high oak mantelpiece part of recent present to julian face be rigid set eye full of strange indefinable agony seemed to be while holding desperately at bay never left pale downcast almost sullen face opposite with determined wrench setting in motion of faculty julian pulled together so far a to take refuge in sure resort of deficient in moral courage assumption of jaunty light hearted non comprehension perhaps have never in life be more like mother than be at moment a threw back head answered with affected gaiety be somewhat hollow unsuccessful what do know dear youre coming rather strong arent know that have be living with common work girl somewhere in camden town for month more word be spoken in same hoarse voice rang now low a be with intolerable disgust expression seemed to affect julian not at word be occupying perception quick frown of consideration appeared on forehead a though relief reprieve have come to bringing with possibility skilful turning to account of called into play mental faculty in so doing strung up nerve dropped artificiality of manner seemed to brace to meet emergency in found situation have evidently suddenly altered character for be no longer cowed by there be pause pause in mr romaynes eye seemed to dilate contract dilate again under suffering to allowed expression in tone gesture then there came from julian four awkward hardly audible word jerked out rather than spoken with long pause intervening how do know short sharp breath came from mr romayne then said with cold decisiveness though seemed that nothing must take that hoarseness from voice matter very little how know know by one chance that one else may know by one else again by detail in case when chance be innumerable be nothing have lived time in london not to know discovery be inevitable to wonder how when come there be bitterness keenness of scorn in voice stung like lash answered hotly after mother be not living in arcadia dont talk about thing im awfully sorry im sure that must have come to knowledge im awfully sorry to offend hang im not worse than lot of fellow about tone have gathered confidence defiance a went on seemed to shake little hold on mantelpiece tightened spoke quickly rather nervously very likely said dont want to argue principle with young men have own idea know how many young men drop out how many young men with good position good chance somehow other get into bad odour get to be not received if be received be with certain reservation through kind of thing oh of course dont say inevitable there be lot of men about a say awful risk in case of young man like with title to position hold in society personality dont see be double treble risk be playing with edged tool be holding knife to own throat must go under so horribly easily paused abruptly a though image before eye be too terrible to to be pursued further tried to moisten dry lip on touch of paint have cracked now showing how white be beneath ghastliness of incongruity between manner superficiality of spoke be indescribable julian did not speak be moving one foot to fro slowly over carpet at gazed immovably mother went on almost immediately must give up julian said incisively will do anything be necessary in way of money dont want to be hard upon anything girl want will have must break with at once paused again still julian did not speak still did not raise eye went on with growing insistence in voice went hand in hand with growing agony of appeal if dont see necessity now must believe when tell that will will look dear life be surely not so dull that need run after such distraction a that will marry if want to will marry one like must must give up julian stopped for moment voice grew thin almost faint a pressed so heavily on carving by held that hand be bruised blackened julian be not telling what have be to to know that have deceived be not going to try make feel dont want to feel dear what have be to to go over home life of last few week know that have lied to at turn to who have only wanted to make happy wont reproach perhaps young men think kind of right kind of right repeated sentence unfinished a be a though contained idea to clung be not for sake to spare feeling that tell must give up be for own julian boy must believe word quivering with entreaty died away eye full of supplication be fixed on julian spoke spoke without lifting eye from ground suppose married said in low shamefaced voice what monosyllable rang out sharp vibrating mr romayne softness relaxation struck from face figure in one sudden bracing of muscle stood staring at out of eye alive with horror suppose married supposing will tell must have to keep must have more of money must never be acknowledged in house again low voice be like fine cold steel paused then quite suddenly a though horror kept at bay in eye have leapt up mastered in instant flung out hand wildly cry julian julian be not married tell tell be not married julian white to very lip said low hurriedly there be long silence with choked hysterical cry mr romayne dropped into chair near covered face with hand julian drew out pocket handkerchief mechanically wiped forehead at last began in nervous uneven voice mother look here dont quite understand not kind of girl think stopped drew hand desperately before eye that innocent white face in dingy frame what did want before eye now how must get on if kept looking at be fault mother look here ought mr romayne took hand away from face clenched together will not said in low steady voice be awfully good girl dont know shes not of course shes not one of sort must learn mother after why not nothing else can can make right nothing else can ruin completely be steady answer will never do if can prevent have told what must do think well over think what must mean to to have not one farthing what can earn to be cut by one who know to be without chance of kind told that if married must disown now tell something else break off miserable connection will have a said anything in reason to give girl in compensation once for refuse to do so will cut off allowance until come to sens cried fiercely by heaven mother can take choice be unmoved answer face be sharp haggard artificial colour stood out on in great patch throwing into relief vivid pallor beneath have thrown aside cloak a though physical oppression be unbearable to contrast between face gorgeous dress with glittering ornament be horrible smothered oath broke from young man lifting right hand began to rub slowly up down back of head a expression of heavy fierce cogitation settled down upon face to unutterable surprise a made gesture there stole over mother face expression of such deadly terror a have never before seen stopped involuntarily staggered to foot holding out two quivering imploring hand for first time in life julian be using gesture habitual in dead father for first time in life looking into son face mr romayne saw there face of william romayne boy gasped boy dont do that dont look like for heaven sake for heaven sake swayed for moment to fro then fell heavily forward into arm chapter viii bitter east wind be taking sufficiently depressing effect upon london be dealing with peculiar grimness with redburn street camden town neat little house in dreary grey dryness looked sordidly wretched there be something deserted hopeless about one be to be seen except at first floor window about way down woman figure be standing a dennis falconer turned into street footstep rang with heavy distinctness on glaring pavement strode slowly steadily along solitary figure a stood out with peculiar sharpness of outline be characteristic production of east wind harmonised absolutely with sombreness of background face be full of sombre purpose grave stern be about three oclock in afternoon of wednesday two day after julian return home on morning of preceding day julian mother have have second interview have ended in giving sullen reluctant assent to demand in evening dennis falconer have received from mr romayne brief almost peremptory note begging to come to have gone to queen anne street accordingly severely unsympathetic also severely reliable early on wednesday morning have found mr romayne in feverish agony of agitation beyond even power of will to conceal wholly to control voice painfully thin sharp gesture restless nervous irritable utterance hard rapid have testified to strained tense excitement before artificiality be utterly submerged in falconer be obviously regarded by solely a one instrument at hand to necessity whole soul seemed to be set upon immediate termination of affair a called affected evidently in only one way looked at from only one point of view a something to be finished up put away buried out of sight be thought of delay in doing of only appeared to torture of affair with terrible significance inevitable consequence have a far a falconer must divine adequate conception girl must be bought off must be sent away must be sent right out of country in case here came one agonised sense of possible consequence falconer must detect in case julian must marry after be evidently haunting terror of such contingency have driven to send for falconer be obvious though seemed to be striving hard to conceal even from herself that must not trust son that must find rest in promise have wrung from what have to say to falconer be in effect that one else must see girl arrangement to be surely effected must be brought about by third person who must set about business promptly act decidedly be service wanted of falconer falconer after moment grave communing agreed to render be a far removed from sympathy with in hard agonised reality a have be from artificial woman of previous month from real woman of eighteen year before considered point of view in present instance absolutely revolting in man must question practical sense of what said advisability of course proposed conception of obligation a sole male relative trustee be too intimately intertwined with sense of duty self respect to allow to entertain even for moment possibility of refusing to act for have stood by side impelled by sense of duty gravely reliable unsympathetic eighteen year before irony of fate decreed that be for for only to act for now to be simply stern dictate of moral necessity to be obeyed a such accordingly have received instruction offering now again grim practical suggestion with stern air of businesslike reserve have undertaken being at bottom of opinion a to desirability of instant measure to see girl same afternoon be walking down redburn street now in pitiless east wind to carry that undertaking into effect reached house knocked asked briefly for mr roden landlady whose sentiment towards lodger have developed rapidly in consequence of enquiry falconer have felt duty to make received word with sniff expressive of contempt then informed with stare of insolent curiosity that be hupstairs led way thither evidently urged to act of civility solely by hope of finding out something be coarse vulgar looking woman with small red eye glittered expectantly a flung door open announced in loud denunciatory voice eres gentleman if have hoped for startling revelation be disappointed dennis falconer advanced into room with stern composure figure in window turned quickly quietly to meet mr jackson be obliged to shut door upon two clemence be looking very pale vague shadow have fallen upon a journeyed up to london two day before have deepened into wistful questioning sadness have not seen julian since parted from at victoria station on previous day have received note from told that work kept from for day that must come a soon a be able there be nothing to distress alarm in fact more than once before similar disappointment have come to even though second day brought letter blank merely meant a assured hour by hour that must see before day be done strive against a might did have spent past twenty four hour weighed down by sense of trouble utterly undefined utterly a seemed to without reason have borne burden with mute patience reproaching a for ingratitude inordinate desire for active happiness struggling bravely to conquer arguing about denying a le simple straightforward nature must have done now appearance of falconer seemed suddenly to focus define vague distress sudden conviction that julian be ill that gentleman have come from to tell so held still silent in pang of cruel realisation anticipation light a moved have fallen full upon face a saw certain shock passed through dennis falconer have seen figure even face in distance more than once have never before seen with distinctness for first instant simplicity purity of beauty with expression deepened by strange shadow through past two day have led clashed almost painfully with idea of girl have grown during conversation with mr romayne into kind of fact for next moment however have reconciled appearance reality a conceived with grim reflection that there be vice so vicious a wear innocent face in doing so have quenched what might have be perception beneath weight of narrow truism greeting of kind passed between clemences faculty be absorbed in dread falconer be busied with process of reconciliation strange little silence be broken eventually by falconer spoke with unbending sternness distance process conclusion have naturally accentuated be here a representative of julian rodens nearest relative guardian said have be arranged between mr romayne on suggestion of latter that girl if did not already know must be kept in ignorance of julian real name statement be slightly over coloured since julian be of age mother be no longer guardian in legal sense to stern moralist of falconer type to whom pretty little falseness of life be wholly to be condemned slight misstatement in such case be frequently permissible brief uncompromising word have seemed to to set key of interview beyond mistake be consequently slightly taken aback by effect trace of colour died out of clemences face two great dilated eye gazed at for instant in dumb agony before whispered he not dead falconer made slight almost contemptuous negative gesture have intention of being imposed upon by theatrical art a clemence self control shattered by sudden relief turned instinctively away pressed face down on arm with have caught at curtain for support went on with immoveable sternness business have to do with life not death main point be very simple will put to at once absolute ruin lie before be be not to embrace saw start lifted face quickly turned to quivering unstrung from recent suffering quite white be in trouble cried low breathlessly oh what be have happened dennis falconer patience be approaching limit spoke curtly conclusively think may dispense with kind of thing said can serve purpose a everything be known come now from mother with full power to act for be interrupted burning colour colour of such paralysing surprise a can take in hardly bare statement much le consequent developements inference have rushed suddenly over clemences face dyeing very throat mother exclaimed mother tone dropped a repeated word into strange uncertain murmur in incredulity acceptance a kind of experiment something be almost fear be inextricably blended fear alone caught falconer ear lip be parted to resume speech with grim decisiveness in conviction that understood at last that nothing be to be gained by trifling with when said a though have have nothing to do with previous word go on please looked at again be struck by new look in face a have be struck by new tone in voice be evidently going to drop theatricality told perhaps be not aware that be practically under control of mother said be to say be dependent on for penny spends be quite out of question that must make money at bar by own profession be to say for two three year at least consequently cutting off of allowance made by mr roden will mean for absolute penury be staring at staring at out of two wide intense brown eye with helpless bewilderment in face that seemed to be quite dazed put hand to head a paused with feeble uncertain gesture did not speak falconer went on severely conclude that have not represented fact to a stand be fact nevertheless will therefore understand that allowance withdrawn will be entirely without mean of supporting may possibly consider that shifty mean might be found by putting in possession of small sum of money must enable for time to defy mother let point out to something of what such course must involve julian roden be young man with good position in society mean be accustomed to be made much of by men woman who be equal have chance opportunity of intends doubt to avail in taking such step must throw away for ever social intercourse future career must go with income at mother word now will ask only how long must hope to depend on in such circumstance how long must be before only feeling for woman whom have allowed to drag down to destroy hope in life must degenerate into sheer repugnance for how long must care to keep paused after moment dead silence clemence spoke in weak eager almost desperate voice there must be mistake cant be same word seemed to falconer mere miserable subterfuge answered very sternly there be not faintest possibility of mistake julian roden have owned whole affair to mother who taxed with on discovery oh wait minute wait minute there be ring of such intolerable pain such shame anguish in voice that falconer attention heavy prejudiced a be be arrested by dimly uncertainly for first time girl before appeared to not simply a representative of degraded sisterhood a woman looked at for moment a stood with face buried in hand quivering from head to foot with severe kind of pity will tell a briefly a may be what be charged to say said gravely not ungently mr roden be determined to break off son disgraceful connection with at cost of suffering to herself to be willing to believe that son be to be considered in sort a more guilty party of two in having acted a tempter have wish to deal otherwise than generously by there be condition paused again over slender bowed woman figure before there have gradually crept a spoke stillness like stillness of death now a waited for to speak clemence slowly lifted head looked at looked at with dull sunken eye seemed only living point in face out of life expression seemed to have be crushed by rigid haggard mask condition repeated voice be hollow have monotonous far away sound word seemed to have meaning for sense of vague discomfort took possession of dennis falconer dim sense that be not being met a have expected a have right to expect disturbed annoyed have idea that what be chiefly discomposed by be hazy consciousness that touch of unconscionable respect for woman who a believed be utterly unworthy of respect be mingling with already sufficiently unorthodox sense of pity entrenched in triple armour of stiffness condition be said will give written word a under penalty for having obtained money by false pretence to leave england on given date by given route not to return to england within next ten year mr roden in return will pay sum of five hundred pound if refuse term roden submits to mother will simply be poorer by five hundred pound if induce to defy mother consequence have already described to will inevitably ensue waited for answer steadily fortifying against being surprised at anything might say answer came that strange stricken face be still turned full towards have uneasy sense that be not seen by great dull dark eye felt too that a stood there with hand tightly clasped together be not thinking even remotely of choice have set before though knew that have heard word understood be with instinctive desire to rouse to bring back expression to face that said with awkward gentleness be quite involuntary there be need for to decide hastily understand alternative thoroughly doubt will leave address can write answer felt in pocket for card case movement seemed to rouse stopped with slight motion of hand there need said a though act of speaking have brought back from somewhere far away a though claim of moment be gradually becoming present to paused a if to gather force to close upon certain strangely fine reserve seemed at once to hedge about hold aloof from man to whom spoke then spoke very quietly dont want money if be better that must be free of will be free thats be making mistake returned falconer quickly there be something about dignity of manner made feel curiously impotent small a though in presence of unknown power greater than sense increased touch of irritation have already experienced tone be no longer coldly stern be insistent annoyed must consider future if accept mr rodens offer leave england with small capital will have chance of beginning life again step have lately taken may be first step on downward path conclude that be must reflect how difficult be to pause there with little money may establish in respectable business in course of time may even redeem unfortunate past not muscle of still pale face moved seemed to have grown strangely older stronger in course of short interview listened to with air of courteous patience seemed to set impassable distance between perfect steadiness of voice a replied be steadiness not of composure of reserve be quite impossible said then be sorry to have to say that consider foolish ungrateful said falconer with increasing severity put entirely out of power to do anything for be to understand that refuse to leave england dont know must think still same distant unmoved patience will do well to think be falconer reply to put away from in doing so false pride be entirely misplaced will give twenty four hour for consideration to morrow afternoon will call see again on second thought have occurred to falconer that must be false step to give name address will hope to find that have come to sensible decision paused moment made slight gesture of acquiescence rather a though word be indifferent to than in token of assent to what said added stiff formal good afternoon a lip moved mechanically a if to frame word in answer turned left room a though presence word have be so mere drop in deep water of suffering held that withdrawal affected not at clemence stood for moment just a left hardly conscious a seemed that be gone then a though sense that be alone have come to gradually dropped feebly into chair let face fall heavily forward upon table chapter ix hand crept round clock swift november twilight fell still did not move only clasped hand stretched out a if in prayer be not praying though attitude be instinctive unconscious blind mute appeal be simply stunned room grew darker darker until only light be ray from street lamp outside falling straight across bowed head then there be ring at bell slow step upon stair clemence knew step well though have never before heard fall like that a fell upon ear now strong shiver ran through hand be drawn sharply to cover face door be opened face be pressed down still more tightly clemence what in dark why clemence masterful rather aggressively cheerful young voice stopped abruptly julian romayne stood still against door have closed behind listening listening to low pitiful sound seemed to fill very air sound of woman heart broken cry at first tone of voice great scalding tear have started to clemences eye suddenly without warning low choking sob have shaken from head to foot be cry now with hopeless abandonment of suddenly loosened grief there be moment during only sound in room be sound of quivering sob julian stood quite still on first instant there leapt into face look of fierce vindictive anger a absolutely transformed look faded slowly into kind of bitter background hard sullenness settled upon settled with difficulty a seemed for lip twitched little then advanced into room broke silence roughness in tone seemed to defy something within made attempt to light gas lamp outside made possible to move about apparently did not care for further illumination come clemence said whats matter have not approached on contrary be on other side of room looking down at across lodging house table did not raise head move a replied indeed choked broken word be rather expression of mingled shame pity with be crushed than definite answer to word oh julian julian julian apparently tone of voice affected in spite of for face twitched again spoke more harshly still whats matter say stretched hand out to across table still without lifting face in unconscious gesture of appeal oh dont cried beseechingly piteously dont dear dont pretend more know hand thrust deep down into julian pocket be clenched fiercely teeth be set together a look rose in eye have never held before mother said answered only with slight shivering gesture be enough with young face white to lip with passionate resentment julian turned brusquely away took two blind stride to window with muttered oath there be long silence julian stood at window staring blankly out into darkness with hard eye clemence be indeed a believed to be wife how have come about how have drifted into anything so far from vague thought in first meeting with must not have said what be that have shaped moulded intention into something so much purer more manly than own nature only now then felt faintly indefinitely when touched a must touch rarely densely in woman from whose higher nature emanated have married with reckless carelessness for future seems almost abnormal be not uncommon characteristic of weakness now be quite incapable of facing enduring legitimate consequence of action have lied to mother to save from heavier penalty with threatened suggestion a to possibility of marrying girl believed to have ruined have be miserable consciously degraded attempt at cutting gordian knot have lied to mother again deliberately without compunction at second interview giving promise knew to be empty form in word to break with girl who be wife have come to clemence to day intending to arrange for temporary suspension of intercourse with be inevitable a blind to mother by telling that be obliged to go abroad immediately for indefinite period now a stood there in dark little room with eye fixed on solitary gas lamp outside be gradually realising that be over mother have sent have possibly come to clemence supposed clemence have of course declared wife plan be upset carefully made calculation be no longer of avail be over brain gradually ceased to busy be staring darkly at penury humiliation ostracism not thinking of feeling just contemplating with stupid mental gaze gradually sense of surroundings began to return to became conscious that be street lamp at be looking that there be dark little street before that there be dim room behind then from room low sound came to faint exhausted long drawn sob a of woman who have wept into quiet began to listen for count involuntarily then began to hurt one seemed to stick something into heart at last walked across almost mechanically laid hand tentatively on shoulder right clemence said huskily right dear after know be wife right be conscious of vague idea that be supposition have allowed that have cut so cruelly there be moment pause then clemence slowly lifted head looked at for first time face be white exhausted looking with tear eye luminous inexpressibly mournful seemed to look through pale good looking young feature above into poor cramped soul hid said what doe matter about julian oh dear dear awkward returned julian gloomily consciousness of prospect before seemed to quicken writhe at what supposed to be realisation of loss of everything practically of course one will be cut right left where money be to come from be interrupted by low cry clemence have drawn little back a though to see better be looking up at with delicate eyebrow drawn together in intense painful perplexity wonder oh julian said low voice have for first time ring of reproach in oh julian isnt that dear isnt that what doe matter what doe matter echoed julian with angry laugh word in total want of comprehension total incapacity for sympathy with position to witnessed seemed to to throw into sudden glaring relief class distinction lay between sense of came upon jarring overwhelming like earnest of have done for matter good deal let tell clemence matter a cant understand know matter just everything compared said in low quick tone bright pained light in eye know know of course that there be great deal cant understand compared compared with what in heaven name said julian angrily compared with julian cried laying tender clinging touch on arm compared with own truth oh dont know that only that have be so dreadful to that made feel a if heart be breaking thinking that youve be false dear that youve said whats not true acted whats not true oh that cant bear for dear dear stood looking down not at face at worn trembling hand holding in clasp of love shame shame for a vaguely felt suspended between wrath certain cold creeping feeling must not analyse seemed to be gradually turning into horrible shadow be involuntary unwilling concession to feeling a one might throw sop to on coming threatening monster that muttered awkwardly im sorry deceived clemence deceived there be emphasis on pronoun seemed to lift far above in absolute unconscious self abnegation oh isnt that doesnt matter who be how many people be thing meaning to yourself heaven above julian dear believe in heaven above dont clemences creed be very simple attitude of spirit heaven above have given be not affair of many word know oneself that matter isnt what one have friend one have make difference theyre not anything really oneself paused moment did not speak be still looking heavily down at hand on arm went on again voice trembling with earnestness julian there at bottom of everything in kind of life doesnt matter whether one rich poor doesnt matter whether people think well of cant always make cant be rich can all be good dear heaven mean to be good dont think oh if didnt if wasnt that mattered most of down at bottom must world come to be like why must anybody go on living julian romayne be very young far down in nature in awful inextricable tangle because be so awful so far beyond reach man struggle so insanely to reduce to poor little level to define label explain away remains in spite of mystery of god there be that strange affinity for noble thought thing be sign manual of part in man never wholly withdrawn by creator from earth be in young that instinctive affinity be most easily reached touched simple ignorant unworldly word word must have touched in julian reasoning power be medium reached now clemence have reached more than once twice before feeble stirring in response have quickened rendered in poor infinitesimal degree sensitive to touch drew arm sharply from clinging pleading hand turned away leaning arm on mantelpiece so that must not see face that cold creeping feeling seemed to sap reality have stolen over whole personality be held numb paralysed in clutch of dominating question be really a said own life own world have faded into shadow a of very dream strange distorted shape conception so new to that wore weird ghostly air of unreality seemed to be rising round pressing into nothingness be a said did not speak after moment clemence went on very tenderly very delicately a though in intense sympathy feeling for suffering ascribed to by intuition dreaded to hurt further diffidently with difficulty because be so little used to clothing in word to be most real vital in life must think of future dear know know that can hardly bear to look at past be past hasnt be really know cant have be will wear out of life at last dear by by truth will tell mother that be married scarlet agonising colour dyed face for instant perhaps have told already perhaps perhaps will forgive if not why if not perhaps pain will help to wear out dearest voice expression of sweet white face lifted to have changed subtly a spoke great pity sorrow for have developed strange new phase in love for have become tenderer deeper have lost reverence for love have triumphed over loss through pain victory have won higher ground become love of sympathy consolation julian hardly heard last word attention have stopped a be at preceding will tell mother that be married have clemence not told then be possible that have not mentioned that mother did not know even now that there be still hope thought arrested current of thought in instant possibility thought suggested tangible definite advantage held swept over faintly quickened perception in sudden wave of excitement numbing on instant thing have be reality to a long a have have consciousness took to substance once again pressed about life world resumed normal complexion lifted head quickly turned do mean have seen mother whom have seen do mean that have said nothing there be pause a clemence looked at for moment confused startled seemed by manner there be wonderful unconscious touch of dignity in gentle manner a answered never thought of be mother gentleman julian moved abruptly with low exclamation began to walk rapidly up down little room absorbed in eager thought clemence watched with puzzled surprised look in eye little touch of reserve creeping over face at last stopped suddenly began to speak looking anywhere on face look here clemence im afraid sound awfully blackguardly thing to suggest youll see necessary do for to tell mother just yet to tell truth be frightfully set against marrying be done for round a soon a know must be just cutting own throat to tell yet know see went on hurriedly evidently anxious to prevent speaking see a be ive got very good prospect in few year if go well will be making heap of money at bar fellow be well known know can always get on then will be right simple meanwhile see have plenty of money can be together almost a much a like quietly know whereas if burst up now will just starve be out of life dont see stopped awkwardly for moment have answer clemence have listened to expression of face changing from wonder to incredulity from incredulity to agony from agony to look of creature stricken to death lifted hand in silence slowly heavily to head julian saw gesture though must not see face heaviness somehow increased discomfort see only common sense said impatiently mean that want to go on living double life that dont want dont mean to try to do right voice be not like voice of clemence knew be low distinct stern spoke very slowly mean that dont want to ruin out of hand said harshly dont be foolish clemence ruin said in same tone dont know what real ruin mean dont know how to make understand im not clever enough can tell just must rather die than have a say for sake not for own only must rather die until mother know truth wont even see speak to again a to taking penny of money must starve first tone vibrating with intensity of meaning be quite low be not declaiming protesting be simply making stand at proposition so terrible to that have carried beyond bound of emotion for moment julian be startled aghast dont mean that said clemence thats nonsense truth said steadily must choose be standing facing slight figure erect straight a have never seen face be white a death set into strange fine line quite new to softness about mouth be being gradually pressed out a latent strength developed a seemed with breath drew be a though crisis in sudden demand upon force be transforming a grappled with transforming into woman before whom julian felt shrink into utter contemptibility took only mean knew to reassert lost

mocking gesture expressive of impossibility of making heard turning face towards singer a stood by falconer side composed to listen face grew rather set fixed in line of animated attention a song went on when ceased comment be of indefinitely delighted order made very easily brightly however then turned carelessly to falconer be thinking of staying long said lightly rather want to talk to do know

ornament to society in interval saw coming smiling towards ready said thats very nice of suppose go then followed out of room down stair flow of comment laughter never ceasing put into carriage got in home said sharply to coachman door banged rolled away into darkness wet voice stopped suddenly rolled along for few minute in total silence shut up alone with like that isolation quiet following so suddenly on crowd noise of moment before falconer only conscious feeling be one of almost stupid discomfort sudden silence too have indefinable very unpleasant effect upon at last said with awkward displeasure be going to write to lifted hand quickly stopped when get in said in quick tense voice can come in be just six need not take long be quite at service leant back in corner with sharp breath of relief moved spoke again until carriage drew up at own door opened door with latchkey moved quickly across hall to foot of stair motioning to falconer to follow then stopped abruptly turned servant be just crossing hall to dining room where preliminary preparation for dinner party must be seen be mr julian in said mr romayne sharply not yet maam if must come in before go to dress tell that be engaged turned again went on to drawing room now said in breathless peremptory monosyllable facing falconer a shut door did not attempt to sit down to invite falconer to do so all sens seemed to be absorbed in desperate anxiety with face be sharp haggard looked ten year older than have looked in mr stormont eades studio falconer answered directly with preliminary formality saw young woman yesterday began be unable to bring about arrangement gave twenty four hour for consideration afternoon called to see again yes yes found that have left house morning leaving address left erect tense figure confronting staggered back step a though heavy blow have fallen upon mr romayne caught desperately at back of chair left dont know where be youve settled nothing weve hold over word have come from in hoarse gasping sentence one growing in intensity until last vibrated with agony of very despair falconer face grew grimmer a listened how be must not have told strange uncomfortable remembrance of girl have seen on previous day have haunted at more le inopportune moment ever since seemed to rise now accentuate usual antagonism to woman who be talking of think need not distress said stiffly perhaps have better tell at once that son know more of whereabouts than do drawn look of despair relaxed on mr romaynes face relaxed into agony of questioning doubt doesnt know said sharply julian doesnt know landlady of house continued falconer very unpleasant loquacious woman be eager to inform that on arrival of son yesterday afternoon about hour after saw young woman there be quarrel between that left house in anger to day very shortly before arrival returned be astonished to find that young woman be gone demanded address be furious to find that be not known think there be room for doubt that young woman have left colour be coming back to mr romaynes face slowly in burning patch clutch on chair be almost convulsive left said under breath left there be moment pause then said in harsh high pitched concentrated tone do mean for good why why must be sorry to have to say to said falconer slowly fear case against son be even blacker than appears on surface think more than possible that deceived young woman slowly formed conviction became conviction only a spoke word be result of vague disturbing impression made on falconer on preceding day by young woman have worked slowly almost without consciousness on part have refused to die out have attained only fruition possible to in last word believe that be really gone that there be nothing more to fear from be same absorbed intent tone eye fixed eagerly on falconer now be hard glittering terrible significance of word with weight of tragedy held seemed to have passed by to have existence for be a though sense in must have responded to be numbed non existent falconer scandalised revolted replied sternly think need have anxiety on score have disappeared of own free will son upon reflection will probably be glad to accept so easy solution of what doubtless recognises by time a troublesome complication there be rigid utterly antipathetic condemnation of julian in voice have judged young man sentenced a vicious to core for experience held too rigidly to narrow conception to consider possible effect upon youth passion of so sudden total thwarting only fear continued be that serious injustice have be done young woman be by mean kind of young woman be led to believe have grave doubt a to whether be not duty to enforce marriage upon son instead of negativing suggestion word be probably rather more than must have be prepared to stand to have be put to practical issue have spoken though hardly knew more from severe desire to arouse what called in own mind decent feeling in woman to whom spoke than from other reason from point of view failed completely be bright light of triumph flashed into mr romaynes eye a said quickly in eager vibrating tone seemed le answer to personally than to bare fact to have given word fortunately there be more fear of that tall clock standing in corner of room chimed three quarter a spoke started a heard be quarter to seven said have people to dinner have nothing else to tell have nothing to advise nothing be grim answer think must be good thing do think to have girl traced so that must always be sure need take further trouble in matter in opinion if must observe anything in son conduct to revive uneasiness question must of course be reconsidered will observe closely doubt there be moment curiously dead silence then be broken by strange half laugh doubt said mr romayne doubt pause then turned glanced at clock must go said thank held out hand just touched a though conventionality alone compelled have considered bound in duty in matter said stiffly good night touch of artificiality returned to manner even in dismissing remained hard practical intense absorption in subject of interview did not yield by so much a hair breadth remained absolutely impervious to thought of man before slight cold touch of hand sternness of obvious condemnation of be evidently absolutely unobserved by good night returned a left without word crossed room rapidly went upstairs to dress for dinner dinner party of evening be unanimously declared by guest to be quite most delightful mr romayne have ever given dinner flower arrangement be perfection of course even when be case go of dinner party may be variable even non existent quality be go of particular occasion be so remarkable component part of party seemed to be animated fused into one harmonious whole by spirit of hostess host mr romayne be so charming so bright so full of vivacity julian who put in appearance only just before announcement of dinner be so boyish so lively so ingenuous be little pale when first appeared lady took down to dinner reproached with working too hard a evening wore on gained colour relation between mother have always be quite one of feature of mr romaynes entertainment relation have never be more charmingly accentuated than be to night until came gaily in among guest that evening julian mother have not met since second interview have prompted summons to falconer julian have dined out on intervening evening be easily to be arranged under circumstance if of pair so willed that forty eight hour must go by without coming in contact with one onlooker aware of circumstance of last meeting watching mother son through evening now might have reflected that law of heredity seldom operate exclusively through one parent good night dear mr romayne delightful evening how do envy that dear boy of greatest pleasure to see two together speaker be good natured old lady have thought harm to put into word what fellow guest have only thought be last departure mr romayne followed to top of stair with laughing deprecation of word be very fascinating then turned back into drawing room with good night a julian prepared to attend old lady to carriage hall door shut with bang then there be moment pause mother in drawing room above son in hall below stood for instant motionless subtle change have come over mr romaynes face instant found alone have sharpened slightly eager haggard anticipation be striving to express in eye only to be resolutely veiled to julian face a stood with hand still resting on hall door there came great sudden alteration light gaiety died out of before wild fierce expression of rebellion distaste repressed almost instantly by pale sullen look of determination moved mr romayne hearing step moved slightly also came up stair a came seemed to force back into face easy smile have worn evening be great success hasnt dear said lightly a crossed drawing room threshold great success said in same tone though in case rang little thin instant silence followed then laid hand airily on arm lip be white dry with agitation knew wondered desperately whether voice rang a unnaturally in julian ear a did in own a said with what meant for perfect ease dear boy let say final word upon wretched business to night wake up clear of to morrow may be happy about thats there be to be said isnt tried to smile knew effort be ghastly failure again wondered whether julian saw need not have feared julian be busy with own histrionic difficulty have sight hearing for may be quite happy little mother said frank tenderness of tone manner be only very slightly over accentuated ive made up mind to do a wish wont make such fool of myself again be standing close together looking into others face patted hand a lay on arm a finished yet between parting a sea of ice must not have parted there lay shadow beneath love survives only a cruellest form of torture shadow of unspoken with chill unmoveable dead weight against man woman can prevail hand on julian arm trembled little terrible presence be never recognised except by to whom chill be a chill of death be making vaguely felt about mother heart let eye stray from face with painful tremulous movement finger tightened round arm be over murmured in low voice be over really a self command failed seemed to strengthen patted hand again reassuringly said confidently yes dear indeed ive only got to beg pardon do with heart stooped kissed tenderly a did so seemed to rally force with tremendous effort returned kiss with pretty effusive embrace though lip be a cold a ice grant freely said if ive felt obliged to be well will say rather autocratic for once in way must forgive too eh unspoken terrible reality a be be to be touched by such ghastly travesty julian laugh be only firmer echo of mother gay artificiality of tone a heard lip turned whiter still thats of course said of course then settled responded gaily well draw veil over past from to night behave better in future good night dear boy kissed again patted lightly on shoulder moved away on threshold stopped turned blew kiss over shoulder forgiveness oblivion from to night said there be strange defiant gaiety in voice with smile nod went upstairs a went face grew lined drawn like face of old woman defiance have lurked in voice stared out of eye half wild reckless chapter xi be bright spring day one of day on freshness renewal of life only spring know for sake of even cold monotony of winter be endurable seem to be in very air to radiate with light even in london where nature broadest effect only can be felt there be sense of exuberance be almost excitement sun shone with brightness seemed to shed oblivion over past darkness air be quickening stirring with vague limitless possibility be rather notable arrangement make quickening of life in one of least natural system in world london society simultaneous with nature great awakening present suggestion of combined travesty patronage unconscious testimony to affinity between man nature nothing can wholly destroy if worked out with certain amount of latitude to fantastic imagination will have rather bewildering effect upon focus of thing in general be nevertheless fact that on particular day in may very many of impulse stirring in nature have strangely distorted counterpart in impulse of society society like nature have discarded winter garment winter habit society like nature be restless with fresh beginning fresh hope fresh tendency resemblance lay on surface contrast be farther to seek be about three oclock in afternoon certain section of society gathering at least very fairly representative of certain section be surging in good tempered aimless demoralised way in very fashionable church in

reconnoitring look about in returning gesture of greeting welcome returned glance on side to take much heed a to manner direction of movement imposed upon by moving crowd be marston loring a finally emerged into air be lightly clapped on shoulder by lord garstin who few yard in front of during compressed passage out of building have waited for on pavement glad to see back loring said heard last night of arrival how be not sorry to be back returned loring nonchalantly a shook hand ive come to conclusion though in course of last half hour that six month be mere nothing be walking round to house asked lord garstin so be let have news a go marston loring have spent winter at cape departure have be alluded to among smart acquaintance a sudden affair more le indefinitely connected in mind with business of loring be understood to be devotee to loring have be by mean sudden thing be to say necessity for have be gradually growing up about in professional life much against will though have reached crisis somewhat unexpectedly have be absent six month be practically social reappearance looking at a turned into street with lord garstin must have be difficult to believe that have be away at far le that have passed through striking experience of men life keen cynical unpleasant face be entirely unaltered manner be perfectly calm unmoved if have observation to make on return if result of observation be rather exciting than indifferent to interest emotion be still entirely outside pose talk between two men however a passed along street be such talk a pass when one of two be occupied in picking up dropped thread other be well calculated well satisfied to help in process in heart of heart if such spot must have be reached in lord garstin must probably have confessed to little personal liking for loring cordiality be result of considerably involved working of social politics just at moment in particular with prestige fresh upon of sundry smart magazine article on cape affair have sent home from time to time have be good deal talked about marston loring be distinctly man to be noticed encouraged detail connected with wedding at have just assisted be naturally first topic presented be hilda newton wedding have be married with much circumstance from mr hals house before loring left england have be said that be to be married at christmas at own home in yorkshire about month before day fixed for wedding however aunt with whom lived have died wedding have perforce be postponed when became possible to consider date mr halse in absence of near relation to bride elect have taken matter in hand very nice affair shes made of commented elder man a finished explanation interspersed with discursive item of news of sort appertaining to society doings little loud of course go without saying really nowadays rather thing pretty girl in way mr compton talking of pretty girl maud pomeroy looked well theyve be at cannes since end of january only just back like so heard answered loring indifferently by bye didnt see romaynes arent in town ive not have time to look one up yet of course thought must see julian to day lord garstin paused moment before answered be there said saw come in youll see at house doubt little woman be invisible for two three day ill rather bad somebody said ill loring there be genuine surprise in tone information yet bestowed upon have evoked really paused moment then said with own peculiar smile how be julian doe hard working line hold out lord garstin smiled more pleasantly than loring have done shrugged shoulder pretty well suppose said met chief other night be not enthusiastic he nice boy though youre great chum of arent loring loring nodded then let give hint to have eye to proceeding at club card be very well know boy like must be moderate might be able to talk to about gave mother hint few week ago shes nice little woman see what can do will ive got idea that foolish fellow doesnt play only at club be close to mr hals house a lord garstin finished last word be spoken quickly significantly loring answered only by slight movement of eyebrow then be in hall being swept on by seething crowd to pay respect to hostess bride loring old man how be loring lord garstin have be thrown together again after offering congratulation be standing side by side julian romayne be close beside having come up from behind through crowd unperceived hand eagerly even demonstratively outstretched thinking thing over in private later on marston loring thought with cynical smile that if have not previously realised six month absence might have done so when young romaynes voice fell on ear change in though subtle be so marked to man who have not heard in course of transition that seemed to place year rather than month between last meeting present amply prepared loring for what saw when turned round alteration in manner appearance consists rather in accentuation modification of original characteristic than in developement of fresh one consequently be very seldom noticed by casual observer when intercourse be unbroken to lord garstin to dozen of other acquaintance julian romayne be still nice boy just a good looking feature be still young feature of year ago to loring difference in face be a perceptible a be difference in young man whole personality key note of difference lay in absence of genuineness in in deliberate assumption in present of what have be natural uncalculated in past julian face have grown thinner harder boyish smile be in consequence no longer perfectly harmonious be trifle over accentuated while bright ingenuous glance of eye have grown extraordinarily like mother manner be gay young manner have gained so many friend with just touch of exaggeration added to artificiality give cordiality a wrung lorings hand be rather like demonstrative welcome in voice admirably adjusted to meet requirement of moment than expression of man be very carefully dressed with particularly dainty flower in buttonhole back again at last old fellow said buoyantly by jove what age be since went have have good time when did reach home tell about youve idea how glad be to have back lord garstin added greeting elder man with boyish half laughing apology for exuberance be very effective manner to lord garstin be a charming a ever rather more so indeed a frank deference have acquired polish derived from sundry little artistic touch such a only calculation intention can bestow seem to have managed very well without returned loring with good humoured satire world seems to have used pretty fairly im glad to see ive only be back about forty eight hour must have looked up of course hope mr romayne be here hope be better said lord garstin with genuine concern have be desolated over illness julian who have nodded lightly to loring turned to lord garstin with bright affectionate laugh also very like mother to lorings quick alert perception added touch of artificiality became apparent in manner a said have be desolating hasnt very good of to say so though thanks be delighted to say be all right again have terrific encounter a to whether must must not come to affair carried day being perfectly restored to health didnt see force of allowing to be shut up coddled by silly boy light high pitched voice somewhat thin a be characteristic laugh with word be spoken came from directly behind julian a loring who have seen coming stepped forward to meet mr romayne with passing shake of son arm stretched out hand with graceful cordiality welcome back mr loring said thought first visit must have be to good for nothing boy be very glad to meet here same lord garstin continued a turned to shake hand believe be enquiring after health cant allow good breath to be wasted in way assure have be much ado about nothing be perfectly ridiculously well laughed a finished certain strained insistence have grown in tone a spoke a though desire to impress fact stated be strong enough to undermine control of voice loring looking at be too fully occupied in criticising appearance to notice tone of voice there must have be society fraud at bottom of reported illness decided be why be so anxious to pas over for certainly have never seen look better be admirably dressed be very slightly skilfully made up condition new to in one of marston loring emphatically approved in woman past first youth told moreover impression of have be fainter than reality else have actually gained in what must only define to define roughly inadequately a be well aware a grip there be faintest flavour of nerve concentration behind admirable society manner gave wonderful piquancy in eye of observer flavour be evidently quite unconscious involuntary have origin in ingrain character loring admired power of certain class in woman in interest in expression mental comment on determined a must not fail to be by own character be deceived by cleverly arranged colouring into ignoring almost painful thinness of face did understand how hollow sunken glittering eye must have be le cleverly treated replied gaily to lord garstins gallant reception of assurance then turned again to loring with easy interested question on voyage be not only returned traveller to day said a answered by bye julian be on way to send into other room there be one there will like to see smiled significantly up at patting arm a spoke julian answered with boyish eagerness in other room said well perhaps ought just to say how do do know oughtnt loring old fellow will meet again of course what be going to do afterwards might go down to club together must come dine with mustnt mother suppose arrange with comprehensive gesture ill just say how do do think disappeared in crowd mr romayne turned with shrug of shoulder pretty expressive grimace to two men poor boy laughed what thing be to be young what tantalising spectacle wedding must be under circumstance pretty wedding wasnt ugly wedding must be rather refreshing change dont think suggested loring one have seen good many pretty one if come to think of youre not in least changed by six month in africa returned mr romayne shaking head at prettily now tell really have have good time out there question be friendly interested after society fashion interest be entirely on surface little talk that followed about lorings experience be joined in a matter of course by lord garstin lasted until mr romayne said lightly now suppose ought to follow julian example just say how do do dont know have only seen mr pomeroy in distance a yet nodded moved away stopping constantly on way through room to exchange scrap of conversation until came to where mr pomeroy amiable inert smiling a though have be sitting there for last three month be holding small court welcomed mr romayne a have welcomed comer so glad to see said placidly such long time how be so immensely pleased to have back again said mr romayne enthusiastically there be ring of genuineness in voice fashionable exaggeration of speech hardly warranted really only arrived yesterday miss newton mr compton mean be in dreadful state of mind other

added vaguely think went to have ice son took ah said mr romayne smiling then there be one perfectly happy person in house mr pomeroy only smiled with vague blandness evidently relation between romaynes pomeroys have developed extensively before departure of latter for cannes a evidently be quite undisturbing to miss pomeroys bridesmaid dress be very nice think said with amiable irrelevancy be afraid sounded trying have be very pleasant altogether hasnt wish be going to stay in town have shocking crossing keen attention have sprung into mr romaynes eye for instant seemed a though society gaiety died from face leaving exposed hard almost fiercely determined foundation on be imposed then foundation disappeared again to stay in town echoed lightly why be not going to stay in town dear mr pomeroy unfortunately not be answer sister who life in devonshire think have heard speak of be ill have begged to go see so be going for week ten day be sorry to say be sorry to hear said mr romayne with pretty concern just at beginning of season too rather hard on poor maud isnt yes be hard on poor maud isnt be undisturbed response there be moment pause then under paint burning colour crept up to very root of mr romaynes hair eye shone dear mr pomeroy began gaily speaking rather quickly too in higher pitch than be usual with dont remember month ago promising to lend maud for little while be very opportunity of course lowered voice little wouldnt propose if did not know quite a well a do how land lie a think two old mother be of one mind on point shant scruple let maud come to if will

immediate wake maud pomeroy be looking a pretty a proper a have looked day since have emerged from school room there be little flush on face be not habitual to returned mr romaynes greeting with grateful cordiality so pretty from girl to older woman evinced a be wont more by manner than by speech indeed mr romayne gave little time for speech mother have be telling of dreadful devonshire business said ive have what flatter be happy thought want to come to maud dear while mother be away know promised age ago to let be lent to for little while be very opportunity isnt must not have be

pomeroy to morrow week oh will be too tantalising to whisk maud away when have just begun to enjoy wouldnt miss pomeroy hesitated again colour on cheek deepened by just shade did not glance at mother time thank very much said at last shant be nuisance to there be just touch of charmingly conventional demur in tone made submission seem a action seemed result of gentle easily influenced temperament mr romayne assured merrily that must indeed be terrible nuisance that must do best to bear then rose eye very bright must run away now said im so delighted that weve settled let know when to expect then dear good bye mr pomeroy ill take care of child return when want only dont let be too soon neednt take away sir continued turning to julian have be standing by ever since flash have passed over

word implied indeed be more than half addressed to came up promptly for how long may have privilege said explained to lightly a shook hand with mr pomeroy daughter then with farewell pretty affectionate au revoir to julian turned away with put into carriage held out hand with gesture of thanks farewell thanks said tone manner alike be very friendly familiar in exaggerated style have

work know to morrow now to morrow happens to be free day with come to tea good bye chapter xii ten minute after mr romaynes departure julian be standing before mr pomeroy whole demeanour typical of man who lingers knowing that must linger no longer what nuisance appointment be said with boyish frankness of discontent be irresistible wish must stay little longer know oughtnt laughed quite ruefully fixed pair of ardent eye on miss pomeroys demurely averted face be awfully jolly affair hasnt so awfully jolly to have in town again with delightful deference to mr pomeroy well really must go know good bye perhaps wont be staying very much longer if stay here bemoaning very much longer will probably leave before do suggested miss pomeroy with rather faint smile be only sign of amusement ever gave always accompanied own mild witticism julian turned to eagerly now thats awfully unkind said wont bully like in queen anne street will term bullying be so profoundly inapplicable to miss

door of mother drawing room few minute before dinner hour have spent intervening hour at club most lightly good natured thoroughly easy going irresponsible young man there there be precisely same character about now a crossed room to mother chapter xiii there have be slight sudden movement a julian opened door a though mr romayne have changed attitude quickly be leaning forward now looking at illustrated paper cushion behind be tumbled crushed a if have be leaning back on leaning heavily be wearing tea gown seemed to keep face rather carefully in shadow rather amusing party wasnt said lightly looking up a came in everybody go to woman cant imagine why well be there news sir im afraid not returned julian gaily ive spent hour at club to try pick up crumb for there be nothing going manner of to other be precisely same now that be alone together a have be when addressed one incidentally in course of general conversation very familiarity between have flavour of artificiality about that flavour be mainly given strangely enough by mr romayne rather than by julian be manner not that lacked ease overdid spontaneity chatted brightly about men thing never asked single personal question though at incidental allusion let fall by a to doings faint contraction of muscle about eye gave hungry concentrated look a of creature catching at crumb seemed to be in great measure tendency to keen intentness of expression have so greatly altered face see ive be lazy said lightly indicating dress with slight gesture a sat down to dinner be going out in evening usually dressed before dinner on such occasion really couldnt be bothered to dress before lamplight be full on face now julian attention drawn to by word saw that looked frightfully haggard worn under paint little air of gaiety paint have ceased to be appendage of full dress with since three day illness combination added touch of repulsion to feeling towards tone a answered be tone of affectionate concern over elaborated by merest shade only youve not over tired hope dear said dont believe ought to go out again to night do know mr romaynes thin finger be tearing fiercely at pocket handkerchief in lap a spoke eye be bright with pain seemed a though ear have caught that subtle shade of over elaboration though must have be quick indeed to do so answered almost before have finished speaking in rather high pitched tone of eager determination silliest of boy said topic be threadbare be quite well oh be very evident that retiring to bed for day two be unparalleled event must not be quite so slow in grasping fact that be possible to recover after terrific crisis now do promise not to talk more about what dont in least understand merriment of tone be fictitious even to julian unheeding ear took up with mental shrug of shoulder be not fault told if must overdo for sake of little excitement told same thing carelessly enough when put into carriage two three hour later be early mr romayne have declared party to be insufferably dull have stayed only hour during time have be a vivacious attractive a usual towards end eye have become feverishly bright julian a took out must feel that be trembling from head to foot be coming home said to well if dont mind dear be thinking of going to look up loring at club breath of relief parted mr romaynes lip answered hastily apparently have desire for son company on way home go by mean said of course dont mind pulled up window almost abruptly nodding to with smile singular ghastliness of be presumably referable to effect of gaslight then a carriage rolled away sank back let face relax into expression of utter weariness with little gasping catch of breath a of deadly physical exhaustion word about loring have be mere figure of speech on julian part did intend to go to club carried intention into effect glanced round smoking room a went in to see if loring be there fact that be not visible in way affected serenity be so altered from boy of twelvemonth before intercourse with loring have be so completely suspended during period of developement that friendship seemed now to belong to previous phase of existence be sense that have passed utterly out of touch with man with whom have once be intimate together with conviction lorings keen perception must be by mean desirable factor in surroundings at moment have dictated demonstration of delight at lorings reappearance outward show of enthusiasm be very effective blind in opinion manner be regulated on same principle on lorings appearance in smoking room about hour later be on way to card room be anything pleased at frustration of plan in direction reception of loring indicated rather that have spent last half hour in watching for here be at last old man cried thought youd turn up time other what became of afternoon never saw after disappeared with mother two men have met close to door be still standing loring a blas imperturbable looking a usual with observant eye on julian face didnt care to spoil sport returned with significant smile seemed to be particularly well employed julian laughed conscious not ill pleased laugh belonged to part such contingency be incidental to situation oh come old boy said deprecatingly then laughed again added suppose mother said something to returned loring quietly happen to have eye see dont make magnifying glass of then be laughing retort now then there be several fellow here who have be asking for a julian glanced round became aware that room chanced to be almost empty loring understood at same time that have wished to make conversation general impersonal slight smile touched lip marston loring have various reason of own for not intending to allow to be eluded by julian romayne change in young man alone must have excited curiosity sundry detail have already come to knowledge notably one across have stumbled in city that morning have quickened that curiosity suspicion of preceding autumn that there be something behind julian life a appeared on surface be by mean forgotten by departure for africa have taken out of way of crisis more than half suspected that crisis there have be connection between present past mean by must be most advantageously applied to furtherance of own end be problem have set to solve be rather in luck said can have quiet chat together established lazily comfortably a spoke a julian with much apparent satisfaction flung into chair took out cigar case julian question followed one thick fast interest in friend life during last six month seemed to be inexhaustible in intelligence sympathy have great deal to tell too told so fluently gaily a almost to disguise fact that allusion to own doings be of most superficial type at last there be pause julian be pulling out watch saying something about going home when loring lighted fresh cigar opened proceeding a conceived heard of in city morning said nonchalantly there be pause in movement with julian returned watch to pocket nothing absolutely to betray fact that word be surprise to yet be surprise exceedingly unpleasant one transaction in city have arranged to keep secret that nature must become known be eminently undesirable have decided that fact must be inconsistent with pose before world that loring must be man to unearth be exceptionally unfortunate did said lightly who be saying what of in city vague locality by bye introduction of name be accidental accident will happen know even in adams office be that definite locality enough to please julian burst into boyish laugh flung back in chair carried cigar to lip a did so not noticing apparently that have gone out loring noticed however what fellow be loring cried not be in england three day before unearth poor chap most private little game say youll keep dark wont wouldnt have come round to mother know shes so awfully generous to might hurt feeling there be ingenuous frankness confidence in voice gave to whole affair aspect of youthful escapade loring smiled a answered wouldnt have hand in hurting mr romaynes feeling for world paused moment then added carelessly a if whole transaction be merest matter of course be doing much julian shook head of course not said lightly only little occasional lark dont know leave big thing to clever fellow like by bye loring id idea did anything in way loring puffed slowly at cigar before answered im old hand said nonchalantly wait for certainty boy paused again to tell truth said slowly fastening keen cleverly veiled gaze on julian face did not ask question altogether idly occurred to that if have made anything worth mentioning might be on look out for mean of well well put mildly say increasing there be considerable meaning in lorings voice careless a be julian became very still into eye there crept eager hungry light harmonised ill with fixed nonchalance of rest of feature a answered with laugh dont know fellow who must refuse to admit soft impeachment be in same boat a far a go take havent got good thing up sleeve old man have loring smiled ambiguously most good thing must come to untimely end if one with finger in spread abroad boy observed since cant concern personally if youve capital well say more about certain amount of lorings practice dealt with financial affair be mean authority on city matter there be something about manner indescribably provocative julian leaned forward with movement of irrepressible eagerness be really good thing said spoke with quick low toned directness put aside fencing of previous dialogue replied not to what loring have said to what have implied loring looked full in face answered laconically significantly rather hungry light be burning fiercely in julian eye turned face away from loring began to fidget with ash tray lying on table by capital said what do call capital now oh anything between ten thousand five twenty thousand said loring carelessly there be silence julian brain be working feverishly loring be well content to let work at last julian began to speak in low rapid tone with air of one who have made up mind to frank confidence have intended to keep loring at arm length have decided now to play bolder game use look here loring said may a well make clean breast of have gone bit farther than said see a told mother most awfully generous wouldnt let hint of get to for world man doesnt like to feel that he dependent on mother for everything dont know especially if he thinking of marrying know what be when one once begin to feel money come in ive gone on see a lot of fellow do ive got tidy little pile of course im very keen on making more before well before propose dont know if can give lift up will be eternally obliged stopped loring smoked for minute two in silence at last said slowly understand natural of course well dont stand alone in affair to tell truth there man to be consulted ill talk matter over with if can manage to get in may be sure will will have line in day two ill see again loring dropped end of cigar into ash tray rose chapter xiv clock in mr romaynes drawing room chimed half hour half past four mr romayne glanced up a heard be alone sitting at writing table answering invitation be looking better than have looked on preceding day haggard physically stronger answered put aside last invitation card then drew out letter in straight clear girl writing be signed affectionately yours maud pomeroy bore reference to miss pomeroys prospective visit to mr romayne glanced through vigour of face seeming to accentuate a did so then proceeded to write few cordial affectionate line in answer be just directing envelope when servant came in with tea mr romayne rose send letter to post said glanced at clock again a spoke at moment front door bell rang left alone mr romayne moved quickly to looking glass took anxious critical look at be a though have learnt to distrust appearance inspection however proved satisfactory apparently a turned quickly away a heard step upon stair there be self dependence sense of power in bright expectant keenness of eye mr loring announced servant mr loring followed name into room be very glad to see said mr romayne advancing to meet be much better way of welcoming friend than meeting yesterday think will celebrate occasion by saying not at home to one else julian will be in perhaps will like to have to not at home dawson added in conclusion there be verve brightness about manner be not exactly usual vivacity faintly suggested presence of kind of special excitement in mind lorings perception be in state of rather abnormal acuteness situation have meaning for have braced up force not inconsiderably detected that inward excitement about mr romayne instantly be convinced also though must hardly have given reason for conviction that there be not smallest chance of julian appearance circumstance reckoned a point in favour in game be going to play very charming of said do know be first time have really felt that coming back to london mean something took chair have indicated to on other side of little tea table a spoke there be nothing lame unfinished about word spoken a spoke eye be fixed upon mr romayne be pouring out tea with so intent look on face a almost to suggest preoccupation did not look up did tone of voice reach except superficially apparently for replied with pleasant friendly laugh must hope did mean something indeed said friend must count for something surely especially when have really taken trouble to miss very much have have such unusually fascinating time in africa then handed cup of tea a rose to take from answered well not exactly that im afraid dont believe in fascinating time know perhaps be too much of pessimist spoke with tone of personal revelation confidence be always more le attractive to woman coming from man mr romayne responded with gentle loftiness of sympathy position demanded ive often be afraid felt like said be really quite wrong of dont know ought to be such particularly well satisfied person suppose be horribly ambitious now tell have business gone off a well a hoped have be so interested in delightful article doe anything go off a well a one have hoped be reply spoken with cynical smile indeed with certain daring deprecation of disapproval be not unattractive ought not to carp continued quickly have reason to be satisfied tone implied considerably more in way of success latent possibility about present position than word conveyed mr romayne answered with cordial delicately expressed congratulation drifted into specie of general questioning a to doings le directly personal implying that might count on sympathy if chose to confide in in greater detail be part of lorings plan however led by almost imperceptible degree away from subject before very long be talking london gossip a though have never be away only perceptible result of absence evincing in touch of additional intimacy return seemed to have given relation necessarily at mr romaynes instigation talk touched here there by by enquiry from loring after mutual friend elicited crisper laugh than usual expressive movement of eyebrow from mr romayne havent heard said oh old story now of course well dont come to town season believe lady ashton suffers from neuralgia laughed again then in response to cynical incredulously interrogative ejaculation from loring clasped hand lightly on knee went on with animation of woman who have good story to tell enjoys telling contracted complaint say in poky little church in kensington into gladys ashton strolled one morning got married oh dear mother wasnt there thats one of point of affair lord rochdale wasnt there either gladys ashton jilted rochdale after after assented mr romayne gaily after poor woman trouble after quite pathetic way in have slaved to catch get letter from ungrateful girl at afternoon tea too heap of people there to say that be mr bob stewart baccarat bob wretched men at club call dont be enough to induce convulsion let alone neuralgia commented loring laughed laugh be succeeded by moment silence then loring said casually what have become of cousin falconer among other people by bye dont hear anything of grim presence be hardly to be overlooked have little escapade of to reveal now mr romayne laughed little harshly unfortunately not said absence be due to most characteristically orthodox cause be ill about three month ago went into hospital sort of place one of new thing be rather bad now he somewhere other recovering fancy wont be in london again yet loring received news with comment a indifferent a question have be then there fell second silence lorings eye very keen calculating be fixed upon carpet on mr romaynes face be accentuation of intent preoccupied look have lain behind previous gaiety two face suggested curiously that man woman alike felt individually irrespective of other that something in shape of prologue be over that real interest of interview might begin silence be broken by mr romayne pushed tea table further from leaned back in chair a said casually did julian meet at club last night loring followed example took easier more careless pose yes said have hour talk together be very glad have looked in hardly expected to find there mr romayne laughed sound be rather forced oh said lightly be tremendous clubbist young men go through phase dont think paused moment voice sounded a though breath be coming rather quickly a said carelessly find good deal altered dare say six month paused breath be troublesome six month make difference at time of life finished loring looked at have long ago decided that when woman be made up be of very little use to direct observation to anything eye said reflectively a though debating question already existing in mind answering for first time be altered suppose yes suppose six month must make difference sharp breath a at sudden stab of pain have parted mr romaynes lip at first word saw hard defiant brightness come into eye be very glad to see well may one allude to what one must not help seeing yesterday went on in much lighter tone one may allude to confidentially returned mr romayne tone be rather high pitched uneven not otherwise be sorry to say at present did julian say anything about tone a asked question be carelessness finger be tightly clenched round handkerchief a waited for answer word two returned loring inferred that be only question of time have be going on long winter answered again there be little forced laugh see unfortunately have be away have hoped that must have come off before went away didnt stopped rather abruptly loring watching keenly said think be time must marry think well yes suppose do dont agree with young men be so apt to get into mischief know suppose can hardly deny general principle answered loring with slight smile though be time since have be young man in practical sense a to julian hardly know must know returned mr romayne quickly with affected laugh must know in first place im relying on for good deal of co operation oh of course not in delicate affair certain shade of attention just attention might become gravely gaily sympathetic according to demand made upon appeared in lorings manner replied to last word with gesture of mock deprecation answered tone in be spoken quiet reliable interest touched voice a spoke seemed to respond rather to possibility of situation have only to command said there be hungry intentness about mr romaynes mouth now about clenched hand only tremendous effort sacrifice of reality of tone must have kept out of voice to tell truth said lightly there be rather catastrophe in autumn girl know silly boy usual thing fancy have upset good deal in way there be nothing like marriage for settling young man down after such affair paused a though while confidence in statement point of view from have presented matter stood in need of confirmation yet craved to hear subscribed to by voice loring nodded with grave attentive assent quite so said sententiously now of course continued of course woman cant know in out of young man life even when shes mother out of question to be very frank with there be something painful now about lightness of tone mother have to be rather autocratic boy didnt much like consequently cant feel sure well that know even a much a might about affair now thats why im confiding in in expansive way want to look after for loring changed position nodded again gravely comprehendingly understand said slowly understand statement be true in far wider sense than mr romayne must be aware of there be moment silence during seemed to deliberate deeply on fact presented to watched intently by mr romayne then roused a be wont say that confidence in give great pleasure said because hope know will simply say will do can word be admirably spoken with gentleness consideration of tone manner be more striking from contrast with usual demeanour carried impression of strength sympathy such a woman must have resisted strange spasm a of intense relief passed across mr romaynes face for moment did not speak then said low hurriedly have heard that play worry boy will often listen to friend whom respect rely on consider honoured pause followed then loring continued with easy seriousness be very reassuring be very glad to know for give key without might have blundered considerably to return confidence for confidence to assure that really have power to help will say that made little discovery about julian yesterday perplexed good deal will know now how to act if must speculate be interrupted daintily coloured face before changed suddenly terribly ghastly reality that lay behind expression of carelessness seemed on instant to crash through veil mask a mr romayne rose to foot with hoarse cry face drawn working hand stretched out a though to ward off something unendurably horrible gasped be absolutely fighting struggling for breath a though something clutched at throat not that oh good heaven not that must stop must prevent must not must not do hear must not there be nature not even contact with throbbing vibrating reality can touch thrill loring surprised indeed have risen also cynical imperturbable cool headed a usual by jove said to critically who must have thought have in choked agonised voice stopped abruptly met eye wild fierce in desperate command said quickly soothingly will do anything wish assure have only to speak be grieved beyond word to have distressed so have idea hoarse laugh broke from mr romayne turned away with strange gesture almost a though be derided loring be forgotten by clasping hand fiercely over face loring paused moment then went on smoothly there be nothing to disturb assure in what be going to say most young men have turn for dabbling in speculation at time other though know lady have horror of dont think must find that there be much foundation for horror stopped somewhat abruptly have suddenly remembered that be speaking to widow of william romayne of whose final collapse knew outline looked at woman before with hidden face figure rigid tense from head to foot thought to callously how curious survival of emotion be did not move speak went on with tone of delicate sympathy doubt if really think well to stop with high hand can be done ought to say have rather broken confidence in revealing julian doings a be very anxious that must not think dissatisfied ungrateful did not wish to hear of shiver shook bowed figure from head to foot im afraid thought more of reassuring than of thought that if knew that be in same affair that must act solely on advice must perhaps feel happier about answer wanted answer must have enabled to continue reassurance on purely personal line be not forthcoming mr romayne spoke moved have intention of risking position by foolhardiness so adjusted line of argument to darkness in silence left a said however continued gently if prefer to talk to on subject ask to give up doubt will do so rather than distress if lay command on to effect will certainly refuse to go further with may say that think must be wiser to let thing take course be not good thing to thwart young man in frame of mind have hinted at a being julian at present if can conquer horror of idea be sure will be better satisfied in end there be dead silence at last mr romayne raised head slowly not turning face towards loring looking straight before a though utterly oblivious of personal presence there be strange fleeting dignity about drawn face with wide ghastly eye dignity come from horror confronted take course said in still far away voice paused moment then went on in same tone think be inevitable last word came with strange ring think that attempt at prevention must be most undesirable said loring might lead of course be not very likely still be possible to private speculation on master julian part very well then there be curious hard steadiness in tone a of one who perforce concedes point to adversary brace nerve afresh to face new situation thus created be like exclaimed loring admiringly tone of voice have passed by will be glad know now let say again how awfully sorry be to have distressed then ill go youll be glad to get rid of did not seem to hear word a voice ceased turned face slowly towards with vague uncertain look upon a though consciousness be struggling back to life represented across great gulf looked at moment then dignity strange pathos that groping look have possessed gave way before ghastly smile im afraid ive be making most ridiculous said there be difficult uncertain sprightliness about weak voice so awfully sorry im rather absurd about speculation old memory with neednt bore youll look after boy then thanks held out hand a spoke with little affected gesture a placed hand in finger closed with icy clutch now do know must send away too bad isnt there be such thing a dressing for dinner quite so returned loring gaily be very good of to have be bothered with so long good bye good bye answered youll report progress of course certainly be pair of conspirator be not when mr romayne came down to dinner that night face be a haggard a though interval intervening have held for three day illness hard determination in eye be more intense than ever
