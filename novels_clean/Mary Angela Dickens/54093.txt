little boy quite well so glad in two hour then au revoir there be flutter of departure chorus of bright meaningless last word mr romayne stood at head of great staircase waving hand in farewell a visitor with last backward glance parting smile gesture disappeared from view stood moment watching people in hall below whose appearance have struck at dinner on previous evening a looked idly at saw man come in englishman evidently just off journey not gentleman a decided absently go up to waiter who be standing in dining room doorway englishman evidently asked question then finally waiter glanced up stair to where mr romayne stood carelessly watching obviously pointed out to interlocutor asking question in turn englishman after looking quickly in mr romaynes direction shook head in answer walked into dining room with vague feeling of surprise curiosity mr romayne turned moved away retraced step evidently intending to go upstairs a passed open door of drawing room hesitated eye caught by bright prospect visible through open window looked out over public garden blue mediterranean ear caught by sound from band still playing outside re entered room crossed to window stood there looking out with inattentive pleasure dialogue have witnessed in hall quite forgotten a thought of own affair thought of immediate prospect of next few week wholly satisfactory prospect be to judge from expression thought of letter have received that morning mentally answering invitation have received thought of acquaintance who have just left of engagement have made for afternoon then a if necessity for seeing husband on subject have by mean become freshly present to turned away from window went out of room up staircase on way chanced to glance down into hall noticed englishman to whom waiter have pointed out leaning in reposeful eminently stationary attitude against entrance must ask who be resolved idly went on until came to door at end of long corridor outside stood dainty little pair of walking shoe pair of man boot glanced at lifted eyebrow slightly characteristic gesture then opened door led into little dressing room from doorway on left led evidently into larger room beyond glimpse of latter afforded by partly open door showed dim dark by contrast with light outside apparently blind be slightly raised there be sunshine in dressing room though be light enough a mr romayne went in shut door seemed to pas into silence be almost oppressive band strain of have reached at very threshold be not audible in room in shutting door seemed to shut out external sound within room be absolute stillness contrast however made impression upon mr romayne be by mean sensitive evidently to such subtle influence glanced carelessly through doorway into dim vista of bedroom beyond going to other end of dressing room knelt down by portmanteau began to search in with uncertainty of woman whose packing be done for by maid found what wanted sundry dainty adjunct to out of door attire one of large lace sunshade required little attention took up elaborate little case for work implement lay on table selected needle thread thimble perhaps dead silence about oppressed little unconsciously to herself for hummed a did so bar two of waltz have shut out a shut door then with needle moving deftly to fro in white well shaped hand moved down dressing room standing in light for sake of work spoke through doorway into still dark bedroom cloughtons have be here william said people met in rome winter think told didnt wanted to go to la turbie with afternoon said must be to say only answered conditionally for of course will go there be answer sound of kind not so much a stir rustle to indicate that sleep of man hidden in dimness beyond only sleep surely must account for silence be even broken by word addressed to yet voice proceeded from serene well appointed little figure standing in sombre light of dressing room with attention more le given to trivial work in hand be penetrating in quality though not loud mr romayne paused moment listening then with expressive movement of eyebrow went back again to dressing table have left took up little pair of scissors be necessary to give finishing touch to work gave that finishing touch with careless deliberation studied effect with satisfaction then laid down sunshade returned to doorway into bedroom stood on threshold time darkness before sombre light behind seemed to meet upon figure silence stillness about seemed to claim even space occupied william said crisply william again there be answer sound stir of sort kind for first time silence seemed to strike moved quickly forward into dimness william be asleep eye have fallen on bed stopped suddenly for be empty paused instant in instant silence seemed to rise dominate atmosphere a with grim mighty presence before everything willow superficial sank into insignificance be typical conventional about woman standing in midst of stillness arrested by knew not what suddenly seemed to stand out jarring incongruous a though unreality have be met touched into self revelation by great reality then subsided altogether only simplest element of womanhood be left womanhood common to peasant princess a wife took two three quick step forward turned corner of bed hid greater part of room from then staggered back with sharp cry at foot partly dressed there lay figure of man to whom have be talking right hand dropped straight by side clenched revolver face handsome face probably hour ago be white fixed eye be glassy on floor beside lay open letter letter written on blue paper william romayne be asleep indeed wife might tear at bell rope hotel servant might hurry rush to fro even recently arrived englishman might render assistance be in vain william romayne be beyond reach chapter ii long railway journey from paris to be nearly over passenger jaded tired out for most part after night in train be beginning to rouse to languid interest in landscape to become aware that dawn uncomfortable unfamiliar early day have time since given place to fuller maturer light to consult watch reminding one a case might be that be due at nice at twelve fifteen alone in one of first class carriage be passenger who have accepted situation with most matter of fact indifference from first to last have made arrangement for night with skill deliberation of experienced traveller a morning advanced have composed a comfortably a circumstance permitted in corner of carriage now then casting keen comprehensive glance at country through be being carried glance however be evidently instinctive almost unconscious for most part gazed straight before with preoccupied frown grave anxious expression in marked contrast with physical imperturbability be man of apparently three four thirty tall rather lean than thin very muscular looking face right hand from have pulled off glove be bronzed deep red brown wore long brown beard be not otherwise remarkable looking eye indeed be very keen steady rest of face conveyed impression that owed characteristic rather to trained habit of material observation than to general intellectual depth mouth be firm strong sensitive sympathetic straight well cut nose be a distinctly too thin a rather high forehead be too narrow on much worn travelling bag on seat beside be name dennis falconer train steamed slowly into station at nice at last traveller stepped out on to platform shade of grave preoccupation have touched seemed to descend on more heavily all absorbingly a did so be walking down platform looking to right left when be stopped by quick exclamation from little wiry man with shrewd clever face who have just come into station falconer a im alive cried well met boy gravity of younger man face relaxed for moment into smile of well pleased astonishment dr aston exclaimed why be thinking of looking up in london id idea be abroad other man laughed very pleasant jovial laugh im taking holiday said dont know that ive particular right to dont know place took into head must like to have look at carnival in nice boy just back from africa be know come for carnival by way of change eh falconer face altered said gravely with good deal of restraint ive not come for pleasure very much reverse im sorry to say paused apparently intending to say no more on subject keen kindly interest in hearer face something magnetic about man influenced in spite of dont know whether fact about bank business be known here yet said if be youll understand aston when tell that old uncle be only male relation of william romaynes wife quick flash of grave intelligence passed across dr astons face hesitated glanced dubiously at younger man when did leave said abruptly yesterday morning be somewhat surprised reply youve come in good time boy said dr aston very gravely mr romayne want relation with if ever did in life be husband ever friend of yours dennis have never met know very little even of wife what be doctor william romayne shot yesterday morning short sharp exclamation broke from falconer then there be moment total silence between two men a sudden unspeakable horror in falconer face resolved into shocked almost awestruck gravity be thankful to have met said at last in low stern voice be more than thankful came held out hand a spoke a though what have heard impelled to go on way dr aston wrung with warm sympathy will meet again said let know if can be of use be staying at franais grave stern not apparently shaken rendered nervous by news have heard by prospect of meeting before a sympathetic emotional man must have be dennis falconer strode out of station grave stern reached destination enquired for mr romayne question be answered by proprietor supplemented by half audible ejaculation from attendant waiter in tone in sympathetic interest familiarity even certain amount of resentment be inextricably blended monsieur must see madame romayne cette pauvre madame of demeanour so beautiful yes even in frightful circumstance so beautiful so distinguished monsieur have just arrived from england monsieur have then perhaps not heard monsieur be aware be kinsman of madame monsieur must then doubtless appreciate so great inconvenience occasioned hardly to be reckoned damage sustained by one of first hotel in nice by event monsieur must see madame at once yes madame be visible there be in fact monsieur with even now english monsieur from english scotland yard madame have sent monsieur be indeed in haste monsieur left possibility of doubt on score waiter told off by wave of proprietor hand on vigorous demonstration to effect evoked by mention of monsieur from scotland yard have to hasten usual pace considerably to keep ahead of quick firm footstep be almost breathlessly that at last threw open door at end of long corridor mr romaynes name be public property in connection with affair then in london since yesterday morning word spoken in hard thin woman voice came to falconer ear a door opened waiter announcement kinsman of madame passed unheeded a moved hastily forward into room be small private sitting room evidently by mean best in hotel with back to door stood young man in attitude of professional calm rather belied by certain nervous fingering of hat held seemed to say that found position somewhat embarrassing one facing indirectly facing door stood mr romayne be dressed in black from head to foot gown wore be one that have have in wardrobe very fashionably made with trace of mourning about other than hue emphasized perhaps by incongruity of conventional smartness result of past twenty four hour independent of such emphasis more salient point of demeanour of day before seemed to be accentuated into hardness perfect self possession a faced young man before be man have noticed on previous morning questioning waiter be hard perfect freedom from touch of emotion agitation be hard face little sharpened haggard reddened slightly about eyelid apparently rather from want of sleep than from tear be very hard eye brighter than usual rather thin mouth be eloquent of bitterness rather than desolation of spirit turned quickly towards door a falconer entered looked at for instant with unrecognising stare then a advanced to without speaking with outstretched hand something be almost spasm of comprehension passed across face settling into stiff little society smile be dennis falconer isnt said holding out hand to ought to have known at once be very glad to see uncle thought decided yesterday morning dennis falconer hesitated stopped be thrown out of reckoning taken hopelessly aback a be by something so entirely unlike what have expected a be whole bearing though indeed have be quite unconscious of expecting anything mr romayne remained completely mistress of situation be very kind of said with same hard composure be very kind of uncle hesitated hardly perceptibly then said line about mouth growing more bitter have heard falconer bowed head in assent turned toward young man who have drawn little apart during colloquy gentleman come from scotland yard said perhaps will be so kind a to go into matter with understand business legal detail mr falconer will represent added to young man who bowed with alacrity suggested a did glance at falconer that prospect of conferring with man rather than woman be distinct relief to then before falconer not very rapid mind have adjusted to situation have bowed slightly to young man left room chapter iii three day before name of william romayne have be widely known respected throughout europe a name of successful distinguished financier now be centre of nine day wonder a name of master swindler detected bank established in london within last twelve month in connection with company offering exceptionally high rate of interest have suddenly suspended payment circumstance be so ordinary explanation offered so plausible that at first suspicion of underhand dealing presented be in connection with first whisper ran like wildfire through financial london of something beneath surface that first became known that william romayne have connection a yet undefined by rumour with bank in question fact hitherto quite unknown whisper grew with rapidity be almost incredible even to whisperer into definite authentic shout of accusation with exposure of outline of such daring ingenious fraud a have not be perpetrated for many day fact have become public property exposure have be brought about by incredibly short sighted blunder on part of master mind by whole affair have be conceived william romaynes be master mind william romayne in trying to overreach alike dupe confederate have overreached own hand have created clue have led eventually to ruin of scheme have originated death with news of london stock exchange be ringing only few hour after be known in nice be forfeit paid by strong nature to success in undertaking be very salt of life mr romayne on leaving sitting room passed along passage to own room not that have entered twenty four hour before to consult with husband a to pleasure expedition of afternoon face manner altering not at composure be evidently neither forced unreal emotion created in by tragic circumstance through be living be obviously not heartbroken shame despair naturally to be attributed to wife so situated bitter burning resentment have william romayne passed away in ordinary course of nature by violent accident widow must have mourned with conventional lamentation with certain amount of genuine regret have committed suicide a letter lying by side revealed to wife even while hardly realised that be indeed dead a only way of escape from consequence of fraud on brink of detection widow attitude to memory under circumstance be natural outcome of character of married life hermia stirling at nineteen have be pretty practical matter of fact girl with rather willow nature somewhat prematurely matured have be orphan from babyhood having near relation in england nineteen year of life have be lived under varied auspex resulting in more desultory education moral a well a mental than be good for most impressionable of year however from fourteen to nineteen have be passed with connection of mother young wealthy society woman with idea beyond society life with little perceptible principle that of social expediency hermia be just nineteen just out taking to life before with ease zest of born woman of world when one of lady died other married went away to america with husband at juncture girl guardian father only brother returned from india to settle in london with only child girl two year older than hermia be obvious that home must be also hermias old mr falconer daughter have slightest taste capacity for fashionable life before have spent six month with world have become to hermia insufferably dull tiresome place have known william romayne in society be rich be handsome be very popular there be that indefinable something about manner magnetism tact constitutes kind of dominating charm be not le somebody in be vaguely understood to be business man of sort with dealing in share stock over world locality lent picturesque haziness to affair consequently when followed hermia into new life asked to marry passed over fact that be five twenty year senior consented with practical promptitude of nature for romance sentiment be not for eighteen month husband have lived in large house in eaton square entertaining being entertained through two brilliant season took away girlishness hermia have ever possessed gave quality admired infinitely more found husband very pleasant very easy to live with after first six month quite unexacting business took into city day at time though a wife said complacently be not least like ordinary city man at end of season followed on birth of child announced that must have to spend certainly six month possibly more in america showed ardent desire to take wife with wife have desire whatever to go wanted to spend rest of summer at one of fashionable health resort to winter in rome such arrangement be accordingly made between in simplest most matter of fact way arguing shadow of ill will on side during four year have elapsed since then husband wife have gone own way meeting when occasion served for month two at time now in london now in paris now in rome presumably finding arrangement mutually satisfactory little boy have be left for most part to care of mr romaynes cousin france falconer mr romayne regarded with careless half dormant affection of woman to whom child owes nothing bare life to whom arrival in world have be rather tiresome interlude merely in round of pleasure pursuit who have have time since have seen occasion to make time to give care other people a seemed to must give quite a well a who be waiting vaguely until will be grown up to find interesting that husband business have taken in course of four year into corner of globe where passing of money from hand to hand be elevated into science mr romayne knew with fact knowledge of affair began ended made ample allowance whenever met found same handsome rather callous withal fascinating man clever with cleverness must appreciate cleverness made money held position in society have asked nothing more of regard for if regard must be called be more truly indifference have be founded on appreciation of success before failure before social disgrace must be lot of detected swindler suicide disappeared totally instantaneously to be replaced by burning sense of personal outrage insult be late in afternoon before left room again dennis falconer received message to effect that mr romayne be sure that must be tired begged that must not think of until have lunched rested when did reappear be in widow weed contrast between dress with tragic significance of desolation face untouched with feeling be inexpressible dennis falconer be in sitting room when entered sense of duty be largely developed be also keenly sensible of moral aspect of affair with be brought into such close contact first of sens kept in waiting in anticipation of appearance of woman for whose assistance be there second weighed so heavily upon that publicity of hotel smoking room must have be intolerable to under circumstance rose quickly a mr romayne came in look of slight constraint on face dennis falconer have near relation perhaps absence of close tie to england have have something to do with adoption of life of traveller explorer in connection with royal geographical society old mr falconer mr romaynes uncle be second cousin only though younger man have be brought up to address a uncle in so small clan distant relationship count for more than in family where first cousin brother sister abound there be nothing strange to dennis falconer to mr romayne in fact of coming to support even though hardly knew one falconer have be chilled even repelled by manner of morning be very conscious now of having cousin acquaintance to make of approaching process with vague prejudice against in mind prejudice be not dissipated by first word spoken with suavity somewhat low in pitch truly with tacit ignoring of significance of meeting seemed to man addressed to whom society life with obligation conventionality be practically unknown quantity simply jarring unsuitable hope be rested said suppose though to traveller a be journey from london to be nothing hear from france constantly about exploit tell that be to expect great thing of what long time be since met sat down a spoke with hard little smile falconer murmured something almost unintelligible thinking that manner arose from mere embarrassment instinct dictated to to set at ease with faintest comprehension of attitude of mind proceeded to chat to about own affair asking question elicited coherent answer indeed answer grew terser sterner until thought indifferently that cousin be rather heavy person at last there came pause pause during falconer gazed grimly uncomfortably at floor when mr romayne broke be with different tone manner hard matter of fact detective told more than told possibly said if there be anything more for to hear must like to hear have better think read letter mr romayne received yesterday morning handed that letter written on blue paper have lain by dead man side falconer took in silence letter be from one of william romaynes confederate be desperate letter of desperate man who knew to be addressing man to whom be to owe ruin disgrace crisis have evidently be so wholly unexpected that detection be actually imminent before criminal recognised a even possible gist of letter be contained in statement that before met eye of man for whom be intended whole scheme must be exploded falconer read through face very stern finished refolded still in silence mr romayne said in dry thin voice bear out a see what detective doubt told that there be so little ground for suspicion three day ago that be sent out merely to watch without even warrant found telegram waiting for here from authority yesterday morning told so answered falconer distantly constrainedly handing back letter a spoke without comment there be not faintest possibility of hushing up conclude asked in same hard voice falconer looked at for moment indefinite disapprobation of have be growing in almost with word said taking form in face in distinct expression of reprobation not faintest said emphatically do see that possibility be in way to be desired glanced at with quick movement of eyebrow did not speak however silence ensued between one of uncomfortable silence eloquent of conscious want of sympathy be broken time by falconer who spoke with formal politeness restraint will wish to get away from place a soon a possible doubt said there may be slight delay before be put into possession of paper other effect at present in hand of authority here will of course do can to hasten matter thanks said paper oh mean mr romaynes paper be there do think will suppose will if there be one will be so much waste paper fear said falconer with uncompromising sternness there be chance of property being saved even if be possible to wish for such thing there may be paper nevertheless in fact doubt there must be will of course wish to have yes said mr romayne thoughtfully yes of course paused moment then added in dry constrained voice do mean to understand be absolutely penniless be own money in own hand in mr romaynes in mr romaynes then fear there can be doubt that such be case falconer spoke very stiffly distantly mr romayne rose from chair little abruptly walked to window when turned to again be to speak of formality necessary with nice authority few moment later interview be ended by appearance of dinner during few day followed distance between that first interview established so imperceptibly so certainly never lessened grew indeed with contact with one to falconer mr romaynes whole attitude of mind whole personality be simply entirely antipathetic that woman under such circumstance must speak act think a mr romayne spoke acted a far a must tell thought with so little sense of social aspect of husband crime with so little realisation of ruin that crime have brought to hundred of innocent people with so little moral feeling of kind be in highest degree reprehensible to having assumed mental attitude of reprehension stopped short perception be not sufficiently keen to allow of understanding that pity might be due also suffering be not always to be estimated by worth of object through be inflicted not often indeed in world where sum of man suffering be out of proportion greater than sum of man spirituality mr romaynes conception of life might be in last degree narrow selfish a such might be in highest degree to be deprecated such a be be have within limit life be now in ruin aim end in life might be of poorest deserving of unsparing condemnation have nothing beyond pain of overthrow be to dormant sensibility not so very disproportionate to suffering inflicted on more sensitive organisation by shattering of higher hope mr romayne for part found cousin with reserve formality of demeanour situation developed in simply tiresome uncongenial companion be very attentive to manner a acknowledged to herself more than once with heavy sigh be excellent managed difficult painful affair with admirable strength tact learnt in course of few day to respect depend on in spite of herself even against will be not surprising that end of enforced dual solitude must be looked for more le eagerly by party be almost entirely dependent on one for companionship falconer be true saw dr aston once twice of mr romaynes acquaintance not one have even left card of condolence upon cloughtons other of pleasure seeker who have previously be so anxious for society showed sign of being aware of existence under present circumstance form taken by falconer first allusion to probable limit of detention in nice have created in of by one of vague chain of idea be so unaccountable so often experienced tendency to think speak of termination of detention when did speak together on subject a when paper be given up there be question at one time a to whether even private paper of william romayne must be returned to widow same paper thus surrounded by element of painful uncertainty at same time elevated into kind of order of release obtained in mind of fictitious importance on own account mr romayne found thinking about conjecturing about even dreaming about until at last when be actually placed in hand possessed curious fascination for be about midday when falconer returned from final appearance before authority stood in middle of room holding large shabby despatch box lately handed to with grave private paper madame noise of carnival floated in at window in striking contrast with two sombre figure think will go look over said in low rather surprised voice must like to go out perhaps please dont think about will spend day quietly indoors answered courteously left room slowly with eye fixed curiously on despatch box in hand chapter iv mr romayne carried despatch box to bedroom set down on small table falconer be leaving nice on following morning maid be just finishing packing mr romayne inspected woman arrangement gave sundry order then dismissed left alone made one two trifling preparation for journey on own account when be completed to satisfaction drew table on have placed despatch box to open window seated drew box towards unlocked there be nothing in face a did so hard resentment have grown upon during last few day just touched by indefinite equally hard curiosity interest paper possessed for have be created by purely artificial mean intrinsically be nothing to position possession of have occupied in thought lately be sole source of impulse under be acting now under other circumstance might hardly have cared to look at raised lid paused moment looking down at compact mass of paper within with sudden vague touch of more personal interest box be nearly full various set of paper be carefully methodically fastened together endorsed evidently upon system mr romayne hesitated moment then took out packet at random consisted of bill bearing date within last six month sent in by leading london tradesman for large amount mr romayne glanced at figure eyebrow moved with expression of slight surprise be almost immediately dominated by bitter acceptance comprehension opened none however until came to one bearing name of well known london jeweller read name amount of bill paused then new curiosity came into eye unfolded paper quickly account be very long one a eye travelled quickly down taking in item after item dull red colour crept into face eye sparkled with contemptuous resentment be evidently surprised yet half annoyed with for being surprised two third of item in bill in hand be for article of jewellery not worn by men not one of have ever be seen by william romaynes wife stuffed paper back into fastening tossed bundle away took packet from box with quickened interest consisted of miscellaneous document likewise connected with husband life in london during past winter of particular interest next packet opened be of same nature with top layer of box came to end paper below be evidently older of varying age indeed to judge from varying tint of yellow disarranging lower layer in taking out packet nearest to hand mr romayne saw that there be older paper still beneath realised that box before contained private paper of many year probably private paper william romayne have preserved throughout life opened packet have drawn out hastily with angry glitter in eye consisted of businesslike looking document not likely a seemed to be of interest to glanced through first unheedingly enough then a reached end something seemed suddenly to touch attention paused moment with startled incredulous expression on face began to re read slowly carefully read to end again face a finished be little pale chilled looking freed paper from packet almost mechanically with absorbed preoccupied look in eye opened read with strained hardly comprehending attention grew gradually imperceptibly a went on from paper to paper into kind of stupefied horror finished thick packet in hand then paused lifting pale face for moment gazing straight before with indescribable expression on willow hardness a though be realising something almost incredibly bitter repugnant to be stunned by realisation then instinct habit of life thought seemed to assert a be to dominate situation expression changed stupefied look gave place to what be little deeper than bitter excitement patch of angry colour succeeded pallor of moment earlier eye glittered turning to despatch box again proceeded to ransack with hasty eagerness of touch differed markedly from careless composure of earlier proceeding paper after paper be torn open glanced through sometimes even re read with feverish attention tossed aside sometimes with sudden deepening of angry flush sometimes with movement of lip a though interjection formed upon always with heightening of excitement until one packet only remained at bottom of box mr romayne snatched out then started slightly a saw that did not consist a majority of others have done of business paper of letter in woman handwriting be so old a many of paper have looked at of have borne date twenty five year back opened with sudden hardening of excitement seemed to mark change from almost impersonal to intensely personal interest saw that date be that of second year after marriage that letter be annotated in husband writing then began deliberately to read lip very thin set eye cold hard read letter through with comment inscribed on by time laid last upon table very lip be white with vindictive feeling strangely incongruous on little conventional face sat quite still for moment then rose abruptly stood by window with back to table looking out upon evening sky strength of feeling died out of face however in course of very few minute leaving only very white rather strange looking a though have received series of shock have made mark even on material so difficult to impress a artificial personality turned by by contemplated table littered now with document of sort a though saw not actual heap of paper something beyond contemptible disgusting to beyond expression then suddenly moved forward crammed paper indiscriminately into despatch box forced down lid carried box out of room down stair towards sitting room where have left dennis falconer be impulse not wholly consistent with self reliance of ordinary manner that manner have be acquired in world where shock difficulty be more le disbelieved in face to face with so unconventional condition of affair mr romaynes conventional instinct be necessarily at fault there being strong motive power in to supply place be only natural that must relieve by turning to man on whom past few day have taught to rely dennis falconer be not in sitting room when opened door a stood in doorway contemplating empty room came down corridor behind be looking for said with distant courtesy a reached made movement to relieve her of box carried a did so be struck by expression be there anything here wish to see said quickly gravely yes said spoke in dry hard voice about there be ring of excitement made look at again realise vaguely that something be wrong followed into room motioned to to put box on table have be looking over said indicating paper with gesture have brought to be very interesting laughed bitter crackling little laugh disapproval in ambush in dennis falconer expression developed little do wish to go over now with enquired stiffly not with think thank answered novel excitement about manner finding expression once more in harsh laugh one reading be enough now if dont mind there be business point on may possibly be mistaken did not look a though spoke from conviction must like to read will go out into garden be quite empty always at time want air tone glance cast at despatch box a spoke made evident that be not closeness of material atmosphere alone have created necessity will read now certainly if wish returned then a took up book lay on table with mechanical gesture of acknowledgement opened door for went out of room came back to table drew up chair opened despatch box two hour later dennis falconer be still sitting in same chair right hand rested on table clenched until knuckle be white face pale to very lip beneath tan in eye fixed in kind of dreadful fascination on innocent looking pile of paper before there be look of shocked almost incredulous horror seemed to touch be narrow dogmatic about ordinary expression into something deep almost solemn door opened started painfully be only waiter with preliminary preparation for dinner recovering with effort falconer rose slowly almost a though very touch be repugnant to began to replace paper in box locked then left room carrying with dinner be served mr romayne have be waiting two three minute before reappeared be still pale horror have rather settled down on to face than left have changed character somewhat breadth be gone from be a though have passed through moment of expansion insight to contract again to ordinary limit mr romayne be standing near window excitement have almost entirely subsided from manner leaving only harder more bitter in expression than have be three hour before glanced sharply at falconer a came towards with constrained conventional word two of apology answered with word speech demanded sat down to dinner be silent meal mr romayne made two three remark on general topic asked one two question a to journey of following day falconer responded a briefly a courtesy allowed on own account originated observation whatever until dinner be over final disappearance of waiter have be succeeded by total silence mr romayne be still sitting opposite one elbow resting on table head leaning on hand a absently played with grape on eye be fixed falconer glanced across at once twice evidently with growing conviction that be incumbent on to speak with growing uncertainty a to what must say latter condition of thing helped to make tone even unusually formal dogmatic a said at last sympathy fear must seem almost farce glanced up quickly eye very bright hard sympathy said drily dont know that there be new call for sympathy be there after thing be very much where be kind of shock passed across falconer face materialisation of mental process what know now began stiffly what knew before be quite enough interrupted mr romayne when one have arrived violently at foot of precipice be of particular moment how long one have be living on precipice edge while nothing be known mr romayne be only on precipice edge a one knew of precipice be practically a though none existed directly one thing came out be over be over edge nothing must make better worse spoke almost carelessly though very bitterly a though felt word to be almost truism falconer stared at for moment in silence then said with stern formality a though be making deliberate effort to realise point of view imply that mr romaynes fall going over edge of precipice if may adopt figure consisted in discovery of misdeed do mean that think must have be better if nothing have ever be known mr romayne raised eyebrow of course said amazedly then catching sight of cousin face shrugged shoulder with little gesture of deprecating concession oh of course dont mean that mr romayne must have be better if nothing have ever come out said impatiently right wrong kind of thing must have be same suppose dont see how ruin suicide improve position rose a spoke falconer made answer mr romayne have touched on great reality of life everlasting mystery of spirit of man with unfathomable obligation disability have touched on carelessly patronisingly a that kind of thing be a absolutely blind to depth of significance a be man without eyesight to illimitable space of sky above to falconer tone be simply scandalising did not understand ignorance must not touch pathos of limitation possibility by be surrounded grim irony of such tone a used by ephemeral of immutable be beyond ken have several thing to see to upstairs mr romayne went on after moment pause will go up now think if will excuse will not come down again start so early good night good night returned stiffly with little superior contemptuous smile on face went away chapter v dennis falconer have be alone for nearly hour when solitude be broken up by appearance of waiter who presented with card information that gentleman whose name bore be in smoking room name be dr astons after moment reflection falconer told waiter to ask gentleman to come upstairs falconer have spent that last hour in meditation have grown steadily deeper graver seemed to have carried beyond formal dogmatic attitude of mind with have met mr romayne back to border of larger region have touched when sat looking at william romaynes paper there be warmth gratitude in reception of dr aston when gentleman appeared that suggested that be not so completely sufficient for a usual smoking room be very full imagine said a welcomed little doctor cousin have gone to bed thought if didnt mind coming up doctor must be better off here dr astons answer be characteristically hearty alert knowing to be falconer last night at nice have come round said just for farewell word to arrange if possible for meeting later on under happier circumstance quiet chat over cigar be what have not hoped for thing of others must like settled with genial instinct for comfort in arm chair falconer pulled round to window for accepted cigar prepared to light glancing now again at younger man face with shrewd kindly eye have already noticed something unusual in expression dr aston dennis falconer have met six year before in africa under circumstance have brought out be best in young man character dr aston have be warmly attracted by being particularly shrewd student of human nature have taken measure accurately enough subsequently knew a certainly a one man may of where weak point lay how time be dealing with kindness for interest in dennis falconer have never abated perhaps because insight did not a so much human insight doe stop at weak point dennis falconer for part regarded dr aston with affectionate respect gave to hardly other man on earth there be short silence a two men lit cigar then dr aston with glance at falconer face broke with kindly delicate enquiry after mr romayne falconer answered almost absently with instinctive stiffening so to speak of face voice there be pause doctor be trying experiment of waiting for lead be just deciding that must make attempt on own account when falconer took cigar from between lip said with eye fixed on evening sky im always glad to see doctor never be more glad than to night sound proceeded from doctor might have be described a grunt if have be le delicately sympathetic falconer continued ive be trying to think out problem be one too many for origin of evil be thoroughly in earnest nothing be further from than thought of lightness flippancy there be calm familiarity matter of course acquaintanceship with subject about tone produced slight quiver about corner of little doctor mouth did not speak however movement with took cigar from between lip turned to falconer be merely sympathetic interested of course know unprofitable subject enough continued falconer almost apologetically will never be much wiser on subject struggle a may still now then seems to be forced on one have be forced on to day apropos of william romayne suggested dr aston so delicately that word seemed rather sympathetic comment than question yes returned falconer have be looking through private paper paused moment then continued a if drawn on almost in spite of knew by repute dare say doctor have one of strong personality get conveyed even by hearsay clever man striking dominating universally liked deferred to yet must have be a absolutely without principle a table be without feeling struck little table between with open hand a spoke then a though expression of feeling have begotten a be often case irresistible desire to relieve further answered dr astons interested ejaculation a if have be question doctor be at once too well bred too full of tact to put there be paper connected with last disgraceful affair of course a know dare say be seized in man past life that private paper throw light on light did say be life of systematic cold blooded villainy for colour must be dark enough have uttered last sentence involuntarily a seemed now laid down cigar turning to dr aston began to speak low quickly be paper of kind said letter business document memoranda of description two third of at least have reference to fraud wrong of one kind not one penny man possessed can have be honestly come by business be swindling one of business transaction be founded on fraud can have have faith honesty of sort kind be living with woman before have be married year woman letter deceived abominably fortunate that died be annotated endorsed like business memoranda evidently kept deliberately a so much stored experience for future use dr aston have listened with keen alert expression of intent interest cigar be forgotten laid down now a if impatient of distraction leant forward over table with shrewd kindly little eye fixed eagerly on falconer human nature be hobby of falconer confidence more truly perhaps manner of have swept away conventional barrier elder man asked two three quick penetrating question how far back do record go asked finally cover five twenty year must say returned falconer first note on successful fraud must have be made when be about four twenty why even then when be mere boy must have be entirely without moral sense yes said doctor with certain dry briskness of manner be apt to come to in moment of excitement be exactly what be boy be that in conjunction with powerful brain made what called just now dominating gave vantage ground over fellow men be a literally without moral sense a colour blind man be without sense of colour homicidal maniac without sense of sanctity of human life expression of rather horrified entirely uncomprehending protest spread over falconer face romayne be not mad objected with incapacity for penetrating surface be characteristic of never even heard that there be madness in family must find if looked far enough without doubt answered doctor decidedly be most interesting subject dennis one that very difficult to look into without upsetting whole theory of moral responsibility doing more harm than enough dont say romayne be mad a word be usually understood tell confirms notion have have about ever since affair came out be what call morally insane ill tell what first put idea into head be extraordinary obtuseness extraordinary want of perception of blunder of burst up whole thing look at for be flaw in comprehension of moral sense only possible in man who knew of quality by hearsay alone must have be very remarkable man wish have known have heard term moral insanity of course said falconer slowly distastefully ignoring doctor last purely sthetic sentence have always seemed to doctor if youll pardon saying so very dangerous tampering with thing must be sacred even from science can not believe that man be actually incapable of knowing right from wrong difficulty be said doctor drily that word right wrong sometimes convey nothing to a word red blue convey nothing to colour blind man endearment of wife convey nothing to lunatic who be convinced that be trying to poison paused moment then said abruptly be there child falconer glanced at changed colour slightly yes said slowly one boy keen shrewd face of elder man softened suddenly indescribably under one of quick sympathetic impulse be dr astons great charm heaven help mother said gently falconer moved quickly protestingly there be touch of something like rebuke in voice a said doctor dont mean to say that think believe in heredity suppose interrupted doctor quickly well at least believe in heredity cant deny that child may rather must inherit not only physical trait infirmity mental tendency like dislike aptitude incapacity what not be consistent man acknowledge sequel though pleasanter to shut one eye to admit put theory of moral insanity out of question for moment if like say that romayne be pronounced specimen of common criminal why must not child inherit father tendency to crime father aptitude for lying thieving a might inherit father eye father liking for music if have have turn way youre religious man falconer know believe take that sin of father will be visited on child how can be visited more heavily than in reproduction mark word boy little child of romaynes unless inherits strong counter influence from mother far away ancestor will go way father have gone may end a father have ended there be slight sound by door behind two men a dr aston finished finished with force solemnity carried painful thrill of conviction even through not very penetrable outer crust of dogma enwrapped dennis falconer latter turned head involuntarily next instant men have sprung to foot be standing dumb aghast face to face with mr romayne be standing with hand still on lock of door a if attention have be arrested just a be entering room have apparently recoiled for be pressed now tightly against door face be white to very lip vague thought passed through falconer that have never seen before be a though look in eye a gazed at dr aston have changed beyond recognition there be moment dead silence moment during dr aston turned from red to white from white to red again struggled vainly to find word moment during falconer must only stare blankly at unfamiliar woman face then while two men be still utterly at loss mr romayne seemed gradually to command a if with tremendous effort gradually a looked at falconer saw face with be familiar shape so to speak upon other face did not know saw eye change harden a if with effort necessitated by conventional instinct against scene saw quivering horror of mouth alter subside in hard society smile knew well only rather stiffer than usual a face be whiter then heard speak with little movement of head in civil recognition of dr astons presence said to falconer book be on table will give to please voice be quite steady though thin almost mechanically falconer handed book asked for with slight inclination of head before dr aston have recovered balance sufficiently to speak be gone door closed behind low ejaculation broke from doctor then drew long breath said slowly thats remarkable woman falconer drew hand across forehead a though be little dazed think not said stupidly not when know ah returned doctor with shrewd glance at do know if falconer must have seen mr romayne hour later must have be more than ever convinced of correctness of judgement preparation for departure be nearly concluded have dismissed maid be finishing with usual quiet deliberation though face be very pale set might have perplexed somewhat if have seen when everything be done stop short in middle of room lift hand to head a though something oppressed almost more heavily than must bear end a father ended said below breath ruin disgrace turned crossed room to where travelling bag stood drew from letter thrust into pocket with several others be blotted little letter began dear mamma when returned to bag at last face be once again face dennis falconer did not know chapter vi there be two diametrically opposed point of view from london life be regarded by who know of only by hearsay that from life in metropolis be contemplated with somewhat awestruck dubious eye a necessarily involving continuous vortex of society dissipation that recognises so called society life except during eight ten week of high pressure known a season point of view be essentially false in place be possible to lead more completely hermit like life than in london in place be possible to lead simpler more hard working life on other hand that feverish access of stir movement make month of may june stand out focus so to speak attention of onlooker be only acceleration accentuation of life be lived in certain stratum of london world for eight nine month in year large proportion of intellectual work of world be done in london to be in society be great assistance to intellectual worker of to day on road to material prosperity consequently large section of society be of necessity in london from october to july since people must have occupation even out of season social life in somewhat lower key indeed than pitch of season on same artificial foundation go on undisturbed gathering about a institution will do crowd of unattached host of idler male female whose movement be dictated solely by own pleasure own weariness be march of one of last of eighty wild march wind be taking most radical liberty with aristocratic neighbourhood of grosvenor place racing tearing shrieking down chimney with total absence of respect due to wealth if must have got in at one in particular of many drawing room window at rushed so vigorously might have swept round room out again with whoop of amusement for room contained twelve lady of varying age demeanour with perhaps one two exception lady be talking at top of speed in case be very considerable of voice a rule be penetrating speaker be apparently addressing same elderly placid lady who sat comfortably back in arm chair made attempt to listen to one perhaps recognised futility of such course elderly placid lady be mistress of very handsomely fashionably furnished drawing room of house to belonged dress bore trace so near to vanishing point that actual presence have something little ludicrous about of last lingering stage of widow mourning name be pomeroy mr robert pomeroy be presiding over lady committee for charity bazaar fashionable charity frequent concomitant fashionable bazaar have superseded fashionable private theatrical of year ago be generally perhaps uncharitably supposed by certain class of cynical unfashionables to have motive power in feminine love of excitement desire for conspicuousness perhaps there be aspect under may present namely a proof that not even long course of society life can destroy heaven sent instinct for work even though circumstance under struggle may render so mere travesty of real thing from point of view when promoter of charitable folly be middle aged woman who put into business almost painfully earnest enthusiasm might have be so useful if have only known more of life outside own narrow round situation be not without pathos when a in present instance long established self reliant venerable philanthropic institution be suddenly discovered taken up patronised by such woman a secretary treasurer of present committee woman who must have be empty headed vociferous in sphere who have be moulded by circumstance into pronounced specimen of certain type of fashionable woman dashing loud essentially unsympathetic position in incongruity discrepancy involved becomes wholly humorous mr ralph halse in virtue of office a secretary treasurer be sitting at mr pomeroys right hand conception a to duty of office seemed to be limited to sense that behoved never for single instant to leave off addressing chair duty fulfilled with conscientious energy worthy of highest praise have discovered well known well to do institution before alluded to about month earlier capital time of year know when one have nothing to do can attend to thing thoroughly have explained to friend have determined that something must be done a have rather vaguely phrased have applied exuberantly forthwith to organisation of bazaar season be lent philanthropy be fashion mr hals scheme became pet hobby of moment lady committee be selected exclusively from among woman well known in society committee be tremendously in earnest nobody must listen to doubt fact for moment at same time listener must have found difficulty in determining what be particular point have evoked such enthusiasm because a have be said member be talking at once eloquence be checked at last not a might have be case with cold blooded male committee by few short pithy word from gently smiling president by appearance of five oclock tea torrent of declamatory enthusiasm thereupon subsided quenched in individual consciousness took possession of lady that be dying for tea have really be working like slave committee broke up with charming informality into low toned duet trio even mr ralph halse ceased to address chair though must not cease to express view on vital point have roused committee to state bordering on frenzy turned to nearest neighbour mr halse be tall woman good looking in well developed highly coloured style appearing younger than thirty eight year be dressed from head to foot in grey delicate sobriety of attire be oddly out of keeping with florid personality a matter of fact hobby have preceded present absorbing idea of bazaar in mind mr halse be woman of hobby have be ritualism of advanced type perhaps of fervour with latest interest have be embraced be due to certain sense of flatness in predecessor be that a may present very fashionable attire represented idea of lenten mourning dont see how there can be two opinion on subject said mr ralph halse very seldom did see how there must be two opinion on subject on own view be decided fancy dress be distinct feature of course there must be more effect more variety when woman be dressed a suit best than when there be attempt at uniform agree with lady bracondale im sure woman addressed be of pronounced elderly aristocratic type tall thin aquiline nosed sallow of complexion seemed to be altogether superior to enthusiasm of kind manner be of unreal kind of dignity chilling suavity in nothing be genuine slight touch of condescension fancy dress be pretty sight said be perhaps drawback that of course stall holder can not be expected to wear word be spoken with emphasis plainly conveyed speaker sense that such abrogation of dignity must by possibility be expected of what be opinion mr pomeroy lady bracondale added turning to chairwoman of committee mr pomeroys attention be not claimed for moment otherwise than by serene enjoyment of cup of tea be sipping with air of woman who have done be conscious of having done hard afternoon work perhaps be somewhat fatiguing to be talked to by twelve lady at once lady bracondales question be one mr pomeroy rarely answered however even in secret heart so only smiled now shook head thoughtfully miscellaneous fancy dress give so much scope for individual taste dont think said mr halse of course doe dear mr halse one can wear what like be very nice answered mr pomeroy comfortably on other hand quiet uniform can be worn by one said lady bracondale with explanatory condescension by one of course so important assented chairwoman with bland cheerfulness then a mr hals lip parted to give vent to flood of eloquence continued placidly in gentle contented voice mr romayne be not here yet wonder what will say met at french embassy last night said mr halse with slightly aggressive inflection in voice told meant to come if must make time apparently have not be able to mr romayne repeated lady bracondale interrogatively dont think ive met really one feel quite out of world there be fine affectation of sincerity about word must however hardly have deceived most unsophisticated hearer a to speaker position in society own appreciation of lady bracondale be distinctly person to be known by anybody wishing to make good claim to be considered in society be loftily conscious of fact have only just returned to town from bracondale where have be spending last two month romayne repeated mr romayne ah yes to be sure name be familiar to thought be there be little woman year ago whom met on continent husband dear now what be ah yes husband failed of course recollect be swindler of sort of course one never met again mr romayne be same ralph say said mr halse sipping tea at least husband be william romayne who be moving spirit in big bank swindle lot of other thing believe year ago turned up about two month ago took house in chelsea lot of money apparently have grown up son must be grown up of course who be going to bar dear said lady bracondale with freezing stateliness doe propose to go into society be most scandalous affair dear mr pomeroy a far a remember connection of lord bracondales lost money recollect think man romayne mean of course poisoned something be at nice when happened committed suicide there be most unpleasant cant expect one to know eighteen year have passed since same woman have expressed a eager to make acquaintance of man haze have wrapped in mind about tragedy have frustrated desire in direction be not only outcome for of passing of year lady bracondale have be lady cloughton eighteen year ago wife of eldest son of earl of bracondale poor with somewhat perfunctorily yielded position husband have be moreover cheery easy tempered pair living chiefly on continent getting good deal of pleasure out of life father death have given to lord cloughton family title family land with accession to wealth importance responsibility wife whole personality have gradually seemed to become transformed satisfaction in new dignity took form of living rigidly up to what considered obligation laxity frivolity of kind seemed to to abrogate from importance of position ranged on side of strict decorum respectability became more precise than precisians husband at same time developed talent latent in obscurity became prominent politician ultra correct exclusive lady bracondale be now in truth power in society consequently tone in disposed of intruder who have ventured unauthorised to obtain recognition during absence be crushing conclusive mr pomeroys individuality be of too soft consistency to allow of being crushed replied placidly with unconscious practicality people do know dear lady bracondale said have friend among really nice people to begin with one have called on really dont know how have happened be year year ago know really be delightful little woman quite wrapped up in boy almost before word be well uttered before lady bracondale must translate into speech aristocratic disapproval written stiffly on face door be flung open footman announced mr romayne chapter vii eighteen year lay between event lady bracondale recalled so hazily mr romayne who crossed threshold of mr pomeroys drawing room a footman spoke name eighteen year have changed at once curiously more curiously le than year between six twenty four forty usually change woman looked at first glance very little older than have done eighteen year ago younger indeed than have looked during early day of widowhood such change a time have made in appearance seemed mainly due to immense difference in style of dress now obtaining dainty colouring cut of frock pose of bonnet arrangement of hair with fluffy curl seemed to accentuate prettiness to bring out youthfulness little woman without strongly marked feature may keep for so long fluffy hair be red brown now instead of pale yellow change be becoming although helped greatly though very subtly to alter character of face outline of feature be perhaps trifle sharper than have be there be sundry line about mouth eye when be in repose be obliterated a rule by characteristic to minor change in seemed to have more le direct reference characteristic seemed to make very similarity between woman of to day woman of eighteen year before seem unreal singular brightness vivacity of expression feature be animated eager almost restless gesture movement be alert quick voice a spoke to acquaintance here there a moved up mr pomeroys drawing room be brisk laughing dress demeanour be dress demeanour of day to subtlest shade have be typical woman of world eighteen year before be typical woman of world now in old day personality of woman have be dominated by merged in type now type seemed to be penetrated by something from within be not to be wholly suppressed came quickly down long drawing room smiling nodding a came greeted mr pomeroy with little exaggerated gesture of despair apology have really finished cried be everything settled how shocking of then a shook hand with mr halse added with sweetness of tone seemed to cover underlying tendency be not sweet however have such host in secretary really one voice more le make very little difference well really dont know that have settled anything said mr pomeroy have talked thing over know be such mistake to be in hurry dont think so ive not doubt of be answer given with laugh dear mr pomeroy have be in hurry for last six week frightful state of thing youve have capital meeting though why believe be actually only defaulter hard blue eye be moving rapidly over room a mr romayne spoke there be eager comprehensive glance in a though survey taken be in sense survey of material at one instant of battle ground gave certain unreality to carelessness only defaulter yes agreed mr pomeroy comfortably now mr romayne must let introduce to new member of committee quite acquisition why where oh serenely oblivious of stony stare with lady bracondale few pace off be regarding opposite wall of room just over newcomer bonnet mr pomeroy with kind fat hand on mr romaynes arm approached exclusive acquisition let introduce mr romayne dear lady bracondale said with unimpaired placidity stony stare be lowered inch two until be about on level with mr romaynes eyebrow lady bracondale bowed icily at same moment mr romayne held out hand with graceful little exclamation of surprise be not genuine though sounded so keen quick blue eye have seen lady bracondale recognised in course of owner progress up room have observed withdrawal of two three pace from mr pomeroys vicinity be a rested for instant only on in subsequent survey of room that subtle change suggestive of sense of coming battle have come to looked full into lady bracondales face now with smiling ease be just touched with suggestion of pleasure in meeting hardly know whether require introduction said mr romayne spoke with cordiality be just sufficiently careless to be thoroughly good form be so many year since met though perhaps former acquaintanceship must be considered to have died natural death be very pleased that must have resurrection finished with little light laugh lady bracondale found almost to own surprise that be shaking hand if have be able to analyse cause effect be not must have known that be that carelessness in mr romaynes manner that influenced powerful prompter to freezing demeanour be withdrawn when other party be obviously insensible to cold be really too bad of to be so late continued mr romayne proceeding to pas over past acquaintance a half forgotten recollection to be indifferent taking up matter a stood with easy unconcern casual conversationalism of society woman at least must be if time be own just now a matter of fact sole raison dtre for moment be getting ready of little place for boy ought to have shut up with carpenter upholsterer until be done assure cant even dine out without guilty feeling ought to be seeing after something other connected with chair table finished with laugh about there be touch of artificiality a there have be about tone a alluded to boy perhaps only thoroughly genuine point about at moment be certain intent watchfulness strongly repressed in eye with met lady bracondales gorgon like stare something about spirited pose of head line of face always recalling vaguely indefinitely that idea of single combat lady bracondale however be not judge of artificiality mr romaynes manner with perfect assurance careless assumption of position footing in society affected in spite of stony stare relaxed perceptibly a said stiffly enough with condescending interest be expecting son in town be expecting day be delighted to say answered mr romayne with little conventional gush of superficial enthusiasm really have idea how forlorn be without be quite absurdly devoted to one a often tell stupid fellow always think dont that man be much better out of way during agony of furnishing so insisted on making little tour while plunged into fray be very anxious to help of course dear fellow told frankly that must be more hindrance than help packed off made great baby of myself when be gone of course have have to console by making little place a perfect a possible a surprise for know how thing grow one little surprise after come into one head one excuse for one extravagance when for one boy be thinking of settling in london enquired lady bracondale be unbending moment by moment in direct contradiction of preconceived determination mr romayne be so bright so unconscious ran off pretty maternal platitude with such careless confidence iciness on lady bracondales part must have assumed futile even ridiculous appearance yes be answer be going to settle down regular cosy couple have be castle in air time education have be going on be to read for bar tell that will value holiday more in year two poor fellow im afraid bore about frightfully added with laugh be rather hard on poor boy for really be not bore think will like lady bracondale remember young men always adored lady bracondale smiled absolutely smiled said graciously graciously for be to say must bring to see must like to call upon if will give card mr romayne be in act of complying complying with smiling indifference be very perfection of society manner when mr pomeroy evidently moved solely by impetus of excited group of lady of be serenely smiling centre bore cheerfully down upon perhaps ought to vote about fancy dress before separate afternoon suggested will talk over little more at next meeting perhaps must be wiser mr romayne looked invitingly at mr romayne a if for opinion on subject invitation be responded to with ever ready little laugh oh let put off until next meeting said be ashamed to say that really must run away now at next meeting promise faithfully to be here at beginning stay until very end whereupon became evident that greater part of committee be anxious to postpone decision on knotty point in question be conscious of more le pressing engagement general exodus ensued mr halse alone remaining to expound view to mr pomeroy by in higher more conclusive tone than before neat little coup be waiting for mr romayne gave coachman order home at first then paused told to go to famous cigar merchant got into carriage with smiling gesture of farewell to lady bracondale whose brougham passed at moment a leant back against cushion smile died from lip with singular suddenness left face very intent eye very bright hard lip set little compressed line about about eye showed out faintly under new aspect of face in spite of eager satisfaction be dominant expression battle have evidently be fought won victor be ready braced for next got out at cigar merchant when returned to carriage there be expression of elation about often attends perpetration of piece of extravagance a be driven through fading sunlight of march afternoon towards chelsea face settled once more into intent reflection satisfaction be narrow slip of house at coup eventually stopped wedged in among much more imposing looking mansion in most fashionable part of chelsea what lacked in size made up in brightness general smartness have evidently be recently done up with latest improvement in paint window box

strong upon face a have not be yet yes said at last there be unusual ring about voice be quite ready for something more than furnishing of house have gone to preparation of place in society for widow son of william romayne only woman who have effected that preparation knew how how completely have be achieved moment later mr romaynes face have changed again be laughing lightly at julian comment a

why what delightful surprise now dont say that have come to tell that anything have gone wrong about bazaar continued agitatedly dont tell that miss pomeroy be shaking hand with younger visitor a spoke girl of apparently about twenty very correctly dressed a pretty a girl can be with colour expression startlingly correct feature whose eye be for most part fastened on ground be mr pomeroys only child did not deal mr romayne blow latter appeared to anticipate reassured in neatly constructed sentence uttered in rather demure perfectly possessed voice mr halse have be prevented for moment from monopolising conversation by reason of keen interest in good looking young man standing by fireplace miss pomeroys word be hardly uttered before turned excitedly to mr romayne if be going to make mistake disagreeables of position must be with hostess have decided son mr romayne cried must be surely such wonderful likeness only really can hardly believe that son be ridiculous enough to expect

continued lightly first london introduction julian mr ralph halse miss pomeroy have only just arrived a guessed added in aside to mr halse doubt be furiously angry with for allowing to be caught with dust of journey on julian anger be not perceptible in face in manner be very pleasant ready even after have handed tea cake subsided into conversation with miss pomeroy mr halse found difficult to concentrate on business have brought to chelsea speech to mr romayne a to brilliant idea have struck just after committee broke up be a voluble a usual certainly le connected than might have be thats

be stopped by tone mr romayne turned towards also miss pomeroy be sitting together on other side of room a eye fell upon pair curious little flash a of idea revelation leaped for instant into mr romaynes eye julian moved transferred attention to mr halse with easy courtesy be curiously natural reproduction of mother more artificial manner be at same time very young unassuming laughed lightly will be delighted to be steward said to be useful in way idea of lady committee be awe inspiring must make great fun of at horrid club doubt retorted mr halse oh know what young men be can be rather useful in case sometimes though of course doesnt do to tell so laughed loudly then rose with sudden access of haste must really go said maud mr halse have innumerable girl friend of whom be wont to address by christian name maud be behaving abominably mustnt stay moment not second did stay great many other second while mr halse pressed julian into service of bazaar in sort kind of capacity

carried off in very tornado of protestation attended to front door a in courtesy bound by julian mr romayne left alone in drawing room let face relax suddenly from responsive brightness into unmistakeable expression of feminine irritation dislike horrid woman said to herself patronises well will talk about nothing julian evening wherever may be go everywhere so perhaps have be worth while to endure then a julian appeared again said gaily dear boy theyve be here hour will be late for dinner be off with dress be very cosy little dinner followed mr romayne a carefully dressed for son a must have be for most critical stranger be also at brightest most responsive talked for most part of people doings society gossip mr romayne told julian about mr hals bazaar deriding whole affair a

playfully through hers took over house let see that approve said with laughing assumption of burlesque suspense last room into took be little room at back of dining room a previous tone of appreciation pleasure developed into genuine boyish exclamation of delight at sight of instant intense satisfaction in face struck oddly on manner like lord said disgraceful extravagance be rewarded by gracious approval then ridiculous mother be silly enough to be pleased gave little careless touch half shake half caress julian threw arm round rapturously must think did like said boyishly say shant have to work hard here mother what awfully jolly smoking table suppose smoke here now suggested mr romayne by way of taking possession oh yes ill stay with sat down a spoke in one of low basket chair by fire taking little hand screen from mantelpiece a did so julian with exclamation of supreme satisfaction threw into long lounging chair with air of general proprietorship sat oddly on youthful figure proceeded to select light cigar silence followed rather long silence julian lay back in chair smoked in luxurious contentment mr romayne sat with dainty head with elaborate arrangement of red brown hair resting against cushion face half hidden by shade thrown by fire screen a held up in one slender ringed hand seemed to be looking straight into fire a matter of fact eye be fixed on boyish face beside be first to break silence be two nearly three month since be together said word might have be merest comment in there be something in bright tone in be spoken something half suggestion half invitation implied desire to make opening of conversation julian romaynes perception however be by mean of acutest detected undertone so be assented with dreamy cheerfulness how long did spend in cairo question came after pause be evidently attempt on new line again failed didnt tell ten day said julian lazily mr romayne changed position leant forward elbow on knee cheek resting on hand screen still shading face catechism be going to begin said gaily julian cigar be finished roused dropped end into ash tray by side a said with smile what catechism catechism sir returned

lamp be almost startling in suggestion of luxury refinement fashion of moment be peculiarly becoming to mr romayne evening dress with artificiality conventionality always enhanced good point strictly conventional a be with light of excitement on face certain suggestion about of verve vivacity looked almost charming enough to justify boyish exclamation of exaggerated admiration into julian have broken on entering room there be eager restless happiness in eye leapt up into almost triumphant life a gave little touch to julian buttonhole then pushed step two further back that might look at again repeated commendatory word with laugh then on little gesture from picked up cloak lay on chair near put carefully about opening door for followed downstairs nearly three week have elapsed since julian arrival in london in time short a be expression have changed somewhat there be quickened interest alertness about detracted from boyishness inasmuch a made look a though life have actually

conclusion of arrangement preliminary have be far outstripped have be conducted in triumph to bench in building of castle in air there be factor in foundation of fortune never allowed by mother to drop out of sight main factor became when be architect relegating to subordinate position even hard work on julian be wont to expatiate with enthusiasm energy sometimes a mean sometimes a end

up suddenly face in shadow for moment changed strangely for instant happiness excitement superficiality died out of quenched in kind of revelation of heartsick anxiety so utterly out of proportion with occasion a to be absolutely ghastly ghastly a only momentary revelation of cruel cross purpose incongruity of life can be next moment a julian sprang out of carriage turned to help out expression changed again took time to get up to drawing room for though party be by mean crush have arrived at most fashionable moment staircase be crowded salutation conveyed by graceful movement of head passed across intervening barrier of gay dress black coat between mr romayne number of acquaintance above below on stair a smiled bowed murmured comment to julian name data criticism of dress appearance

dancing men be so inconveniently useful time have worn away have repeated substance of speech in sundry form to sundry person before julian rejoined have cast several rather preoccupied glance in direction when became aware of on opposite side of room threading way through intervening group in direction just a be accosted by rather distinguished looking elderly man how do do mr romayne tell that have grown up son here decline to believe spoke in pleasant refined voice marred however by affectation of day with tone about a of man absolutely secure of position used to amount of homage be certain lord garstin distinguished figure in london society rich well bred idle be troubled with ideal fashionable woman with weakness knew quite well be quite a high type of woman a thought possible

weakness of liked to have young men about to be admired imitated by manner to julian be characteristic of taste free from condescension a superiority can only be when be absolute unassailable full of easy familiarity mr romayne standing fanning between listened for julian reply with certain intent suspense beneath smile lord garstins approval be so important to simple unaffected frankness of answer satisfied ear lord garstins expression a listened to satisfied eye with laughing comment on julian word allowed attention to be drawn away for moment by acquaintance who claimed in passing there be slight flush of elation on face when few moment later chat between lord garstin julian being broken off former moved away with friendly nod to young man little gesture smile to herself significant of congratulation come walk round room said gaily slipping hand through julian arm there be hundred of people must be introduced to during half hour followed julian be introduced to large proportion of people in room who be best worth knowing mr romayne seemed to have wasted time on acquaintance of mediocrity presentation to lady bracondale have just be accomplished when mr halse appeared upon scene greeted mr romayne with stereotyped enthusiasm success said in loud whisper a julian talked to lady bracondale everybody be quite taken by surprise dont know why im sure dont think

sentiment about relation between hostess pleasant young host be by mean without charm for guest mr hals bazaar too be affording far more entertainment to promoter than seemed at likely to afford to supporter served to bring julian into special prominence be not clever there be great deal to be done in connection with bazaar on intellect must be thrown away julian proved what mr halse described effusively a most useful dear expression by probably meant to convey fact that be always ready to toil for lady committee without too close investigation into end to be attained by said toiling be quite important person at meeting connected with bazaar fact gave standing with innumerable smart people concerned must otherwise hardly have attained so soon introduction to lord garstin resulted about fortnight after took place in invitation to bachelor dinner invitation to one of lord garstins dinner be in way about a desirable thing a young man in society must receive pleased repressed

live stock for miss pomeroys stall puppy kitten canary bird rum idea isnt be doing morning dear turned out that mr romayne have nothing particular on hand beyond visit to jeweller in bond street accepting very easily substitution of miss pomeroys commission for legal study to be supposed to devote in morning took up reference to weather suggested that must drive together to execute first business then own will be rather nice driving morning said can take turn in park certainly there be certain amount of excuse for people who have already begun to say that mr romayne be never happy without son by side spared pain however to make happy with a drove along there be probably brighter brisker talk than theirs in progress in london drove through west end street penetrated in search of miss pomeroys requirement into region into mr romayne have hardly ever penetrated before region rather amused to day in squalor when julian have done commission in plenty of time to undo do again before bazaar came off a remarked with laugh turned back again went to bond street have little private matter to attend to here said julian a followed mother into jeweller shop just have kindness to stop at end of shop will please leave to mine mr romayne laughed shook head at be within few day of birthday be always demonstratively honoured by son now be not to be extravagant said holding up slender threatening finger with mock severity mind will not have will descend upon unawares keep in order let leave with laugh disappeared to other end of shop while followed shopman to counter near door just turning away from met mr pomeroy daughter now be really most delightful exclaimed mr pomeroy if speech so comfortable so entirely unexcited may be described a exclamation be always charming to see dear mr romayne of course really be particularly charming morning isnt maud thats very nice said mr romayne brightly turning to maud pomeroy with smile pressing girl hand with affectionate familiarity developed in with regard to miss pomeroy by last few week hardly perceptible touch of additional satisfaction have come to face a saw mother daughter please tell why yes of course said mr pomeroy placidly sat down a spoke with instinct for personal ease under circumstance be ruling characteristic be just what want to do dear mr romayne be bazaar of course really be most awkward thing isnt maud seems that have asked twenty one lady most important to become stall holder cant possibly make room for more than eighteen stall now what must ah mr romayne how do do mr pomeroy have broken off tale of woe a placidly a have begun have greeted julian with comfortable cordiality have come up hastily not becoming aware of mother companion until be close to be awfully lucky for exclaimed want lady desperately for minute mother wont do miss pomeroy turning eagerly to demure correct looking figure standing by mr pomeroys side will come to other end of shop with for minute must be awfully good of word be spoken in tone of fashionable good fellowship pseudo good fellowship pass for real thing in society a addressed by julian romayne to miss pomeroy mother be one of result of work in connection with bazaar before miss pomeroy must answer mr romayne interposed somebody very frequently did interpose when miss pomeroy be addressed one ever seemed to expect opinion decision from perhaps because be mother daughter perhaps because of curiously characterless exterior while fact that have never be known to controvert statement in word doubtless accentuated tendency of acquaintance to make statement for will be awfully good of mr romayne said to now laughing if be kind enough to help silly fellow to insist on remembering that mother will be very angry indeed if be extravagant will have to give up having birthday think then a julian with gay gesture of repression to mother waited for miss pomeroys answer with pleading must be ever so good of girl with glance at mother said with conventional smile with pleasure walked away by side mr pomeroy looked after julian with approving smile be favourite of hers such nice fellow murmured amiably mr romayne laughed pretty self conscious laugh so glad find so said oh by bye dear mr pomeroy can tell anything about mr marston loring go everywhere doesnt think have seen at house oh yes returned mr pomeroy a placidly a ever with decision indicated that be giving expression to popular verdict not merely to opinion of own be quite young man to know very clever rising dont know what people be have be so successful

mr pomeroy lowered voice confided to interlocutor two three detail in connection with marston lorings private life life in world one be supposed to recognise might have be considered by mean to credit be not detail affected society character in way however mr romayne only laughed with such slight affectation of reprobation a woman of world must show men be alike suppose said with fashionable indulgence have probably done a much a anything else towards making men alike by bye be lord dunstans best man wasnt mr pomeroy be just confirming to mr marston loring what be evidently certificate of social merit when julian miss pomeroy reappeared mr romayne with exclamation at a frightful gossip turned to shopman who have be waiting pleasure at discreet distance transacted business havent settled anything about trying business of twenty one stall holder said mr pomeroy plaintively a finished now wonder be thinking of taking turn in park werent maud mr pomeroy have curious little habit of constantly referring to daughter must be so kind of dear mr romayne if must send carriage home take turn with mr romayne must take home of course really be anxious to know what advise for there seems to be idea be in way responsible for awkwardness so absurd know be quite sure have only done a be told apparently have not occurred to mr pomeroy that to do a be told by four five different people with totally different end in view be apt to lead to confusion mr romayne fell in with plan proposed after instant demur with smiling alacrity turn in park followed be very gay one miss pomeroy julian laughed talked together be to say julian laughed talked in best of good spirit miss pomeroy put in just correct word pretty smile be wanted to keep conversation in full swing mr romayne mr pomeroy facing disposed of difficulty in connection with bazaar after good deal of irrelevant discussion by saying very often in great many word three more stall must be got in somewhere decision seemed to mr pomeroy to make everything perfectly right although have have elaborately demonstrated to that course be absolutely impossible be half past one when mr romayne julian be put down at own door barouche drove off amid chorus of light laughter last word sunshine fresh air movement something le simple le physical seemed to have have most exhilarating effect on mr romayne face be almost a radiant in curiously different fashion a julian be radiant with unreasoning good spirit of youth such nice people said lightly wonder whether lunch be ready im quite starving oh letter taking up three four lay on hall table let trust be interesting turned into dining room a spoke sorting envelope in hand one for friend von mhler isnt said tossing to julian carelessly one for invitation obviously one from mr ponsonby about stall suppose one from stopped suddenly last letter of pile be contained in small square envelope addressed in what be obviously man handwriting good handwriting clear strong somewhat cramped precise mr william romayne queen anne street chelsea curious stillness seemed to come over little alert figure a pale blue eye caught sight of writing then mr romayne moved walked slowly away to window still with eye fixed on envelope paused moment then opened drew out sheet of note paper bearing few line only in same small clear hand well mother what have correspondent got to say have have end of screed from von mhler nearly ten minute have passed mr romayne started violently thrust letter still open in hand though be looking fixedly out of window back into envelope turned face have altered curiously completely colour genuine animation have pervaded a came into room have disappeared be pale hard looking line about mouth eye be very visible dinner invitation from lady ashton said long rigmarole from mr ponsonby to tell that be resigning stall why be doing poor mr pomeroy must be grateful to tone be exaggeration of bright carelessness of ten minute before forced unnatural back be towards window even julian boyish eye might have noticed stiff unreality of smile with spoke sat down to lunch together strange change have come to did not pas away julian did most of talking though readiness of comment smile left lip always hard set never seemed to touch eye prevented being in least aware of fact afternoon be spent apart when met again there be that about face made julian say with surprise be tired mother be going to large dinner party before very smart at home to julian mr loring have referred on previous evening a opportunity for meeting mr romayne be magnificently dressed there be diamond round throat in hair a flashed sparkled seeming to lend glow animation to face a laughed at for ridiculous boy julian thought carelessly that must have imagined drawn look have struck though have only recognised a tired looking on mother face a though word have startled even annoyed gave julian one else further excuse for taxing with fatigue throughout long rather dull dinner be vivacity face always smiling laugh always ready a evening went on flush made appearance on cheek a though mental stimulus under gaiety be produced involved veritable quickening of pulse son when met in hall after have uncloaked for second party thought that have never seen mother look jollier a expressed must look out for loring said eagerly oh there be mother just inside doorway that clever looking fellow do see with yellow buttonhole be easier to recognise acquaintance than to approach within speaking distance of time elapsed during mr romayne julian exchanged greeting on side be received by lady bracondale before found also just inside doorway mr romayne have given one quick keen glance in direction indicated by julian then have become apparently oblivious of mr marston lorings existence until julian finally exclaimed well met loring awfully pleased to see mother may introduce mr marston loring turned head then bent very graciously holding out hand with most charming smile have known by sight for long time mr loring said be delighted to make acquaintance delight be mine be response spoken with just touch of well bred deference be never so attractive to woman a when be exhibited in conjunction with personality a lorings be one for have wished for long time seen paper to night interposed julian eagerly weve lost nottingham see be alluding to bye election have led to political discussion of evening before loring nodded see said loring romayne have told doubt went on turning to mr romayne that foregathered to considerable extent last night over politics other thing last word be spoken with glance at younger man seemed to ascribe to acquaintance altogether more personal friendly footing than political discussion alone must have afforded mr romayne laughed very graciously yes have told said be rather thinking of getting little jealous of mr loring few minute more talk followed talk in loring bore with usual cynical manner just tempered into even unusual effectiveness then mr romayne prepared to move on must come see said to loring julian will give address be at home on friday hope will dine with before long gave pretty nod au revoir turned away he awfully jolly isnt mother exclaimed julian a soon a be out of earshot very good style returned mr romayne approvingly be just kind of man to get on have good deal of discrimination sir added mother son be separated after about hour later mr romayne caught sight of julian disappearing with very pretty girl whose face did not know in direction of supper room just a be greeted by lord garstin pressed to repair thither thanks said lightly there be such crowd really dont want anything paused that accentuated vivacity be still about a looked up at lord garstin with little smile gesture thought unusually charming want little chat with though very much said with pretty confidence im going to ask to give advice do know will bore frightfully on contrary will delight be ready by mean insincere response mr romayne made gracious grateful movement of head must rather take opinion than of other man know said confidentially stopped laughed slightly about boy of course said want to know what think of club for young man in position do think now that be good thing emphatically yes returned lord garstin consider good club of first importance to young man young man ought to be member of prince paused moment looking at a nodded head softly waiting a though for further word of wisdom from thought what delightful little woman be suppose talk to about said pleasantly will see to with pleasure if must like nothing certainly must have be more delightful than mr romaynes manner a spoke just right word of graceful acknowledgement acceptance then made gaily disparaging comment on club life lord garstins advocacy of few minute bantering laughing repartee followed that society repartee of mr romayne be mistress from thence drifted into talk about party complaint of heat of room be time be going think remarked with gay little laugh mother be miserable slave see be left until called for suppose if be not absolutely obliged to go returned lord garstin shouldnt encourage suggestion on part a be case unfortunately will find boy first send to mr romayne shook head with laugh saw retire to supper room little while ago with very pretty girl said make point never to hurry under such circumstance if must meet might tell be quite ready when be good night room be not by mean crowded now be getting late great many people be in supper room corner of room in mr romayne be standing happened to be nearly deserted there be one near after lord garstin left stood still fanning looking straight before with bright smile animated expression rather stereotyped on face suddenly a if involuntarily turned head looked across to other side of room met eye of man standing against wall who have be looking fixedly at ever since lord garstin joined for instant not slightest perceptible change of expression touched face only very absoluteness of immobility suggested that immobility be result of sudden tremendous effort of self control then colour faded slowly from cheek from lip smile did not disappear gradually assumed ghastly appearance of being carved in marble eye widened slightly became strangely fixed man be dennis falconer be looking at one across gulf of eighteen year be only for moment then mr romayne still quite colourless lifted eyebrow prettily made gesture of amazed recognition falconer moved came slowly towards what surprising thing exclaimed holding out hand have idea be here to night how do do welcome home tone be perfectly easy gracious so ultra easy indeed that deprived word of personal emotional significance whatever relegated meeting place with subtle skill to most conventional of society ground rather distinguished looking man with good reserved manner who stood before accepted position with grave readiness thank said spoke with distant courtesy about there be not even suggestion of matter of course friendliness a of distant kinship have made reception of nearly perfect a work of art be great pleasure to to be in england again have be away let see two year said mr romayne with vivacious assumption of intelligent interest social situation demanded five be really have done wonderful thing hear funnily enough have be hearing about only to night must congratulate bent head with courteous gesture of thanks have have note hope said be settled in london now thomson tell thomson be family lawyer dennis falconer be mr romaynes trustee under old mr falconer will oh yes answered suavely have to day just before lunch so nice of to write to yes be settled have be fanning carelessly throughout short colloquy glancing at falconer about room with appearance of perfect ease now a eye wandered to other end of room something seemed to catch attention hesitated appeared to forget what have intended to say tried to recover failed julian have come into room be just parting gaily from one in doorway dennis falconer did not take up unfinished sentence followed direction of eye across room until own rested upon julian then started slightly glanced down at woman by side mr romayne laughed rather high unnatural laugh faced with eye very hard bright lip smiling through artificiality of face manner there be something lurking in hard bright eye a did something not to be caught defined made movement almost heroic recognise said lightly ridiculously like isnt at moment julian started across room evidently to come to mother came on stopping incessantly to exchange good night laughing bowing smiling a though there be fascination for about gay young figure man woman standing together at other end of room watched draw nearer nearer word continued to come from mr romayne pretty inconsequent flow of society chatter no more tempered strange gaze with eye followed son than did unheeding silence with falconer received a grave eye rested also on young man whole thing be so incongruous expression of two pair of eye be so utterly out of harmony with surroundings with laughing unconscious boy on whom be fixed that seemed to draw out from brightly dressed smiling group through passed isolate strangely in weird atmosphere of own here be sir cried mother gaily looking no longer at julian a stood close to at last beyond lord garstin told be ready to go dear said julian pleasantly hope havent kept there be hurry answered smiling voice be little thin strained will go now think want to introduce first to one whose name know be cousin dennis falconer chapter xi be rather close afternoon in third week of may fine weather have lasted without break for more than fortnight for last two three day there have be little breeze inevitable effect have be produced upon street be combination of dust defied water cart glare seemed to radiate alike from heavy smoky blue sky house pavement be only half past three piccadilly be a yet far from being crowded pavement be mainly occupied by working population hurry to fro along london street from morning to night regardless of fashionable hour few representative of non working class smartly dressed woman carefully got up sauntering men stood out with peculiar distinctness figure of dennis falconer a walked westward along north side of piccadilly be conspicuous not only on rather unenviable term at first glance must have seemed that past eighteen year have altered considerably altered always for better analysed carefully alteration resolved into very noticeable increase of maturity of certain kind of strength improvement into fact that weak point be of kind to be far le perceptible a such on mature than on immature face face be thin very brown there be worn line about told of physical endurance in sharper chiselling of whole thinness of nose narrowness of forehead be no longer striking somewhat self conscious superiority of younger day have disappeared under hand of time certain sternness have replaced seemed to give dignity to expression keen steadiness of eye have strengthened indeed be expression helped in very great degree to make face so noticeable no longer wore beard firm square outline of chin jaw be visible while mouth be hidden by moustache iron grey like hair be very well dressed there be that about simple conventionality of attire suggested that correctness be rather concession to exterior demand than expression of personal weakness more than one of people who turned head to look at a walked down piccadilly be familiar with grave stern face have be reproduced lately in page of illustrated paper people glanced at with interest created by appearance in flesh of something of celebrity falconer have done great deal of good work for geographical society in course of past eighteen year work characterised by brilliancy originality of intellectual resource eminently persevering conscientious patient during last year however chapter of accident have conspired to invest expedition of be leader with touch of romance excitement with personality must never have endued achievement in expedition have resulted have be hailed in england a national triumph dennis falconer found one of lion of moment position especially for man who believed to attach value to have be somewhat dearly bought falconer a walked london street on may afternoon be trying to realise a at home in settled among perhaps for indefinite period effort brought added shade of gravity to face terrible physical strain of last six month strain severity of have hardly realised at time a endured from day to day with simple unimaginative perseverance of man for whom nerve have existence have told even upon iron constitution couple of great london doctor have condemned to year inactivity at least under penalty too grave to be provoked turned down sloane street quarter of hour brought to number twenty two queen anne street rang be admitted ushered upstairs into drawing room room be empty falconer walked across glancing about with keen habitually observant eye of on face there be something of stiffness reserve have characterised voice minute earlier a asked for mr romayne until night now nearly fortnight ago when have met in lady bracondales drawing room dennis falconer have seen mr romayne only once since journey from nice have ended in old mr falconer house that one occasion have be visit to uncle so called in swiss home in second year of mr romaynes widowhood have be in europe several time since then have always made point of visiting old mr falconer on subsequent occasion have happened rather strangely a have thought to once twice that mr romayne be away from home after old mr falconer death communication between occurred only at rarest interval dennis falconer be mr romaynes only remaining relation in capacity have be left by uncle one of trustee necessary business be transacted by fellow trustee old mr falconer lawyer clan instinct be very strong in falconer brought in wake whole set of duty obligation for most men be non existent sense of duty have be characteristic of in early manhood have only be more deeply narrowly engraved by succeeding year arrived in london knowing mr romayne to be settled there have considered incumbent on to call on have written note have received nearly fortnight ago have written with much same expression on face only little le pronounced perhaps a rested on now that be waiting for mr romayne in own drawing room through change brought about by passing of eighteen year mental attitude produced in towards mr romayne during week of dual solitude at nice have remained almost untouched except inasmuch a disapproval have be accentuated by everything have heard of since have be vivified rendered a be tangible definite by short interview at lady bracondales party have made reality instead of remembrance to be standing before large very admirable photograph of julian julian at very best most attractive contemplating with heavy frown when door behind opened under light quick touch mr romayne came into room be too shocking to have kept waiting said so glad to see gave too much shopping to do have have quite fearful rush voice manner be very easy very conventionally cordial a seemed to falconer there be not natural tone movement about be at home afternoon be charmingly dressed in something soft pale coloured eye be very bright play of expression on face be even more vivacious effective than usual exaggeratedly so even shook hand pointed to seat sinking into chair with affectation of hard won victory over fearful rush subtle assumption of most superficial society relation a alone existing between be a insidious a indefinable a have be on previous meeting seemed to set key note of situation even before spoke again be frightful season said really horribly busy say be to be short one be sure trust be true if be of to be left alive at end everything seems to be crammed into few week dont think so be very lucky to have arrived way through london just now doe not seem to be particularly desirable place certainly answered falconer manner be very formal reserved great contrast to apparent ease said lifting eyebrow with smile now that sound rather ungrateful in do know for london find very desirable visitor one hears of everywhere be afraid must confess that take very little pleasure in going everywhere returned falconer stiffly social life in london seems to to have altered for worse in direction since last took part in yet go out great deal with laugh sound trifle inconsistent be not sufficiently egotistical to imagine that individual refusal to countenance must have effect upon society answered falconer still more stiffly to tolerate be by mean to approve falconer reason for toleration in question real reason of be wholly unconscious must have astonished not little if must have brought to realise in narrow conventionality fortunately did not occur to mr romayne to ask for with ready tact of woman of world turned conversation with gracefully worded question a to recent expedition answered with courteous generality only rather more gravely spoken with have answered great many similar question put to during past week by lady to whom have be introduced in capacity of momentary celebrity passed on from one point to with superficial interest evoked by one of topic of hour exaggerated comment question more le wide of mark be exhausted at length moment pause followed fact that indicated though falconer did not know that preceding conversation have involved kind of strain on bright little woman who have kept up so vivaciously pause be broken by falconer have heard said of poor thomson illness must hardly be true to say that mr romayne started even slightly curious kind of flush seemed to pas across face a answered voice manner seemed instinctively to increase emphasize distance have tacitly set between be a though introduction into conversation of name mutual familiarity with represented mutual interest connection have created instinct in yes poor man said carelessly there have be good deal of illness about season somehow be afraid be bad business went on falconer with comprehension of turn have given to conversation with mental condemnation of what seemed to simple heartlessness on part not wholly absent from voice there be to be consultation to day will call evening to hear result be afraid there be very slender hope how very sad said mr romayne with polite interest falconer bent head in grave assent then with view to arousing in willow nature a seemed to remembrance at least of usefulness to of man whose probable death contemplated so carelessly said with formal courtesy thomson have done work connected with joint trusteeship so admirably hitherto that there have be need for service if while be ill must find in want of aid in capacity need not say that be entirely at command again that curious flush passed across mr romaynes face leaving rather pale time thanks so much said quickly really must not think of troubling ive doubt will be able to hold on until mr thomson be well again thanks immensely will not be within reach for very long suppose will be in london for year certainly answered falconer acknowledging tacit refusal to recognise claim on in formal directness of reply then a uttered sharp little exclamation of surprise added briefly be in doctor hand unfortunately there be something wrong with say be very sorry began prettily though eye be rather hard preoccupied at moment door opened to admit influx of visitor falconer rose to go so glad to have seen said a turned to after welcoming new comer wont have cup of tea be always rather crushing when man refuse one tea isnt mr anson turning a spoke to lady sitting close by then a gave hand speaking in tone still included other lady in conversation alluded for first time to julian whole call have gone by without one of reference to boy with mr romaynes acquaintance be so familiar that omission under circumstance must have be hardly credible to one of im so sorry have missed boy said now with apologetic laugh im afraid be absurdly proud of isnt that so dear mr anson really be dear fellow be going to bar believe said falconer face voice alike be uncompromisingly stern unbending yes answered julian be not clever dear boy hope may do fairly well good bye will be at gordons to night be going first to see american actor rave about so funny little domestic party son son new particular chum good bye mr romaynes face did not regain normal colour a turned attention to other caller did faint line about mouth eye disappear be particularly charming that afternoon always a welcomed one set of visitor parted from laughing talking listening so gaily there be faint hardly definable air of preoccupation about have great many visitor afternoon grew hotter a wore on when dressed for dinner night finding strangely nervous irritable with maid on edge altogether a expressed be very definite distinct in self assurance unusual state of thing be owing solely to heat tiresome people rather unnecessarily distinct explicit must have seemed since there be apparently chance of contradiction acquaintanceship between julian marston loring have developed during past fortnight with surprising rapidity have dined together at club have smoked together in lorings chamber have met incessantly at dance at home dinner on of occasion mr romayne have be uniformly gracious to son friend at garden party few mile out of london admittedly greatest failure of season when loring romaynes have walked about together afternoon with carelessness of social obligation dull party be apt to engender scheme for present evening have be arranged loring adding preliminary dinner at restaurant with in capacity of host to mr romayne son to original suggestion that must go together to theatre julian be in high spirit a drove off to keep engagement mother response to chatter be neither so ready so bright a usual glanced at once twice then said boyishly look awfully done up mother mr romayne turned to quickly eye sparkling angrily whole face looking irritable annoyed dear julian said sharply very bad habit to be constantly commenting on people appearance especially when remark be uncomplimentary told looked tired other day please dont do again such ebullition of temper be almost unheard of thing with mr romayne julian must only stare at in helpless astonishment not hurt simply surprised inclined to be resentful must not realise a woman might have done jarred quivering state of nerve implied in such outbreak simply thought mother be rather odd when moment later stretched out hand hastily laid on with quick tight squeeze be abominably cross dear said in voice shook dont mind be right now be not all right though made valiant effort to collect force appear so gaiety throughout dinner be strained forced lorings quick perception realised instantly that something be wrong with demeanour under circumstance be significant at once of work of past fortnight of individual capacity for turning everything to own end with tacit assumption of certain right to consider evinced just such delicate appreciation of mood a gave sense of rest soothing without letting feel for moment that found anything wanting in pose be always that of man to whom youth even early manhood with folly inexperience be thing of dim past used that pose now to utmost advantage combining mental equality with mother with actual equality with son a contemporary in manner made seem in very subtle way equally friend of talked of course almost exclusively to mr romayne never however failing to include julian in conversation so managed conversation a to take trouble on own shoulder give mr romayne little to do listen be entertained succeeded so well that dinner hour by time be over have done work of many day in advancing dawning intimacy with mr romayne felt better told a entered theatre told with rather excessive eagerness satisfaction perhaps because of something within of quick nervous movement of hand a unfastened cloak be outward visible sign curtain be just going up a seated during first quarter of hour two seat to left remained empty then mr romayne whose attention be by mean chained to stage became aware of slow difficult approach of flow of loudly whispered apologetic conversation combined with large person of lady moment two later be being fallen over by mr halse who be followed by girl who continued to explain situation fluently audibly until distinct expression of opinion of pit caused to subside temporarily began to talk again before applause on fall of curtain have died away voice reached mr romayne to whom remark be addressed across girl who be with julian who be sitting on mother left hand with gradually increasing distinctness so curious that seat must be together be first word mr romayne heard have just be meeting connection of yours explorer know dennis falconer so fascinating oh by bye cousin dont think have have pleasure of being introduced to though have met son miss hilda newton mr romayne miss hilda newton be very pretty dark girl of somewhat pronounced type have large perceptive black eye singularly unabashed charming little turned up nose rather large mouth with good deal of shrewd character about be understood to be country cousin of mr hals with whom have be staying for last three week only very critical rather unkind eye must have traced country cousin in dress have great deal of style dash about acknowledged mr hals introduction of with rather excessive self possession after casual word two to mr romayne addressed to julian be with whom have disappeared to supper at lady bracondales at home have evidently seen good deal of one in interval mr romayne have noticed together more than once have taken dislike to miss newton pretty independent face manner in present mood be absolute relief to to find in girl legitimate excuse for irritation reason for fact that mr hals speech have somehow undone work of early part of evening set nerve on edge afresh detestably bad style said to herself angrily giving unheeding ear to mr halse a watched miss newton reply with little twirl of fan to eager question of julian just what one must expect in cousin of woman then became aware that woman be vociferously insisting on changing place with julian julian be acceding to proposition with considerable alacrity before have well realised exactly what change involved mr halse with much paraphernalia of smelling bottle fan opera glass programme be established at side julian miss newton be seated together at end of row practically isolated by stream of mr hals conversation so horrid to talk across people isnt said that lady airily though crowd ever collected must have interfered with flow of language be much more comfortable dear mr romayne be simply dying to rave to somebody about cousin be cousin isnt mr falconer know what splendid man of course account of work have be most fascinating man make seem so much more real dont know now do tell be first cousin do remember when be quite little boy sort of thing mr romayne took up fan unfurled be looking past mr halse at julian miss newton who be looking over same programme with head rather close together eyebrow be slightly contracted eye very bright restless movement of slender hand held fan seemed to be expression of intense inward irritation oh dear dennis falconer be not first cousin by mean said carelessly though voice be trifle sharp third fourth something of kind be quite hero isnt said mr halse gushingly addressing loring have met loring though glance have appearance of perfect carelessness be watching mr romayne intently have noticed access of nervous irritability be curious a to cause be son flirtation with miss newton be dislike to mr halse have connection with dennis falconer have reason for study of mr romaynes idiosyncrasy yes said met other night good sort of fellow seemed he magnificent said mr halse enthusiastically must have at bazaar dear mr romayne be quite determined if must sell african trophy for know native poppy head oh arrow head be well anything of sort must be fortune to have seen great deal of cousin be so often just like brother sister be not low laugh toss of head from miss newton at moment closed perusal of programme julian turned attention to perusing pretty black eye instead mr romaynes lip seemed to tighten whiten finger held fan be tightly clenched a answered in voice rang hard in spite of effort sometimes be of course depends so much on circumstance dennis falconer have not met for year until other day at moment curtain went up leaving mr halse literally with mouth open instant fell mr romayne leant across to miss newton with comment on performance spoken in rather thin tense voice with eye glittered a though nervous strain under speaker be labouring be becoming almost insupportable apparently something in face repelled girl for answer be of briefest julian throwing into breach miss newton be instantly absorbed in animated discussion be long wait loring noting one of restless movement of woman by side a talked laughed so sharply understood that to mr romayne moment meant nervous torture instant green curtain fell on third act rose loring followed example wrapped quickly deftly in cloak cant say think much of american prodigy said to with forced laugh must confess that have bored to extent really cant stand more boredom will go straight home julian glanced round for a spoke be escorting mr halse cousin be waiting for in brougham before joined suppose come to club with suggested loring carelessly a julian received mother announcement of intention rather blankly what do say to game of billiards right responded julian thanks old fellow be only that told miss newton be coming on isnt jolly girl mother mr romayne smiled very pretty indeed said lightly sad pity youre ineligible fellow isnt loring a carriage drove off said to admiringly what wonderfully clever woman reaction from heavy strain even apparently if be only strain of combating exhaustion engendered by heat be terrible thing when mr romayne got out of carriage after long drive face be haggard drawn passed into house gathered up mechanically without glance two letter waiting for on hall table told maid who be waiting for might go to bed went up into drawing room there be low chair by little table covered with dainty useless paraphernalia particularly affected sat down in now almost unconsciously a seemed without even loosening cloak with long low moment passed still sat there curious grey pallor about face eye gazing straight before a though be looking into future past at last a if by sudden fierce effort of will roused began to tear open letter still in hand a if with desperate instinct towards occupying thought eye fell on letter by time open in hand read almost unconsciously taking in sense gradually a read dear cousin hermia

that stock in trade be quite untouched however when about quarter of hour later returned to stall little hot discomfited havent made success said loring with rather sardonic smile miss pomeroy say im good now there that fellow julian doing roaring trade julian miss newton in point of fact be at moment visible returning to mr hals stall evidently in high feather stock sold out mr romayne watched julian counting gain into mr hals hand saying laughingly to loring a did so be not boy enough for kind of thing im afraid then julian with final laughing nod turned away from mr halse came hastily

felt muscle stiffening knew that must not take line must there be deadly pallor about mouth at instant loring came up to with witty satirical comment on scene at be apparently gazing for next few minute stood there exchanging gay little observation with pallor never altering eye never moving then quite suddenly turned towards want tea said take to refreshment place mr loring julian be

high pitched gaiety did not go back to stall tea being over moved about bazaar always with little party in attendance laughing talking julian be dining with large party of stall holder at mr pomeroys be to repair thither direct from bazaar mr romayne took detachment in carriage only one instant of solitude came to before luxurious hilarious meal only one instant when stream of descending lady left behind on upper landing in instant a if involuntarily unconsciously to herself gaiety fell from face like mask leaving haggard ghastly put hand be icy cold up to head told lie said to herself lie oh boy be very bright witty a julian drove home together greyish whiteness be stealing over face be unnoticed by son careless eye even when stood in well lighted hall be going straight up mother said if so ill say good night want cigar paused moment looked at with indescribable tenderness haunted eye at time a rested on intensified thousandfold ill come sit with for little while if will have said tried evidently for usual manner succeeded inasmuch a julian noticed nothing beyond beneath surface there be something not wholly to be suppressed something looked out of eye trembled in voice lingered in touch a laid hand on arm something taken in conjunction with shred of affectation with strove to cover with boy profound unconsciousness be a pathetic a be beautiful strange drew into own little room then with forced laugh at pushed gently into chair insisted on waiting upon bringing cigar match ash tray anything must think of to add to comfort laughing time at at hugging shred of affectation close there be that about if there have be one to see understand made one with many mother since world began who with heart aching bleeding with impotent pity love have tried to find outlet for yearning in strange instinct for service go always hand in hand with mother love a with other love on earth lit match at last then knelt down beside chair dearest said dearest will have two hundred to morrow if like did not think vexed about did know only want to be happy julian dont julian laid down cigar with merry laugh must be fool if didnt answered patting hand with boyish affection awfully good of dear im frightfully grateful wont make fool of myself again mr romayne put up hand quickly dont promise julian said in strange breathless way might might forget know then perhaps wouldnt like to tell want to know always want to know stopped abruptly almost agonised appeal in eye be still kneeling at side with eye fixed on face suddenly abruptly almost a though word forced from against will said with slight catch in voice julian met frulein schmitz to day met eye for moment own questioning uncomprehending then gradually there stole over face recollection vague at first became a grew definite rather shamefaced rather annoyed rather amused oh said tone be light daring enough though touch of genuine shame embarrassment lurked in oh call hard line be smiling daringly into face with acceptance of situation be perfectly frank mother hand a rested on arm of chair be tightly wrung together eye never stirred from face why said rather hoarsely why did laughed shrugging

whole truth conveyed a such mr romayne knelt there for moment more looking into eye own wide strained then rose heavily slowly to foot there be pause silence be broken by julian evidently with view to changing subject on must hardly be said to show to conspicuous advantage youre going to write to falconer suppose wouldnt like to do to night dear must must get letter in better time if be posted first thing must do at table there mr romayne did not speak julian must not see face yes said at last voice sounded rather hollow far away will do to night if like bent down kissed good night said wont write here said julian in surprise ill go upstairs answered went out of room went upstairs moving slowly heavily straight to dainty little writing table sat down drawing out sheet of paper wrote conventional word of address to dennis falconer then stopped suddenly lifted face be ghastly eye sunken dim seemed to be confronting very irony of fate chapter xiv jolliest week ive ever have in life wonder how often youve said that before august have come gone greater part of september have followed in wake ruddy september sun be making end of summer glorious in large garden of large country house in norfolk everything seen in wonderful radiance seemed to be even overcharged with colour if such thing be possible with nature be a though beauty of summer have be intensified arrested in maturity into one final glow rich green of smooth lawn colour of autumnal flower tint of foliage very atmosphere seemed alike to be pausing for moment at most perfect point of radiance nature never pause that be indeed final glow end of summer beauty be revealed here there by little significant touch written across earth sky in broader letter bird be gone going even a julian romayne spoke flight of swallow overhead be wheeling darting hither thither in preparation for imminent departure very glory of tree meant decay in spite of effort of indefatigable gardener dead leaf strewed trim lawn gravel path sign token of approach of inevitable end be particularly conspicuous about narrow grass path shut in by high yew hedge up down julian romayne hilda newton be sauntering together fallen leaf be thick upon in flower bed by be bordered summer flower whose day be long since done have not be replaced by autumn successor apparently walk be secluded little frequented one on be not worth while to spend much pain judging from coquettish toss of head tempered by certain softness of tone with miss newton replied to insinuated regret of julian word seemed not improbable that characteristic have something to do with selection of particular spot for stroll have be staying in pleasant country house together for last week hostess having taken fancy to mr hals cousin in town now in hour julian mother must be on way home a half mocking half inviting word fell from companion lip julian turned impetuously towards pretty piquant face be shaded by bewitching garden hat never meant so much before on honour said impulsively adding with boyish suggestion of tender reproach in voice must have thought might have known that awfully hard line to think over miss newton have large crimson dahlia in hand be plucking petal slowly away scattering at foot be said know be returned ardently trying to catch glimpse of dark face bent over crimson flower wont tell that youre little sorry too miss newton hilda vigorous young hand be just closing over pretty little finger held dahlia dainty little figure be yielding to nothing loath seemed when from further end of grass walk third voice broke in upon tte tte a started instinctively apart mr romayne accompanied by hostess came sauntering towards taking farewell look at quaint old walk julian said with suave carelessness a drew near garden be looking too beautiful morning isnt miss what lovely dahlia be be showing julian looked smilingly at miss newton a spoke apparently quite unconscious that girl face be white not with embarrassment disappointment emotion with sheer angry resentment moved on a spoke tacitly compelling miss newton to move on at side while julian other lady followed perforce together have only about ten minute more im afraid said be just taking last stroll round place with mr ponsonby im afraid will find london rather unbearable to night call of duty be always so very inconvenient be leading way toward house little high pitched laugh eliciting only monosyllabic response from girl at side resumed what be practically monologue carried on with suavity ease be perhaps over elaborated by just touch farewell followed almost immediately on arrival at house when little bustle of departure ensued in miss newton took part that young lady having promptly disappeared be characterised by same manner about there be also little touch of suppressed excitement be not until julian be alone together in first class carriage of london express that gay word laugh ceased let sink back in corner unfolding newspaper with short hardly audible sigh of relief very slight indefinable change have come to mr romaynes face in course of last two month have be perceptible in animation be still more perceptible in repose line about face have needed special influence to bring into prominence during winter be always plainly perceptible now gave face very slightly careworn look be emphasized by expression of eye mouth eye have always slightly restless look in in day even now a read paper appeared to read there be concentration in now then be lifted hastily almost furtively over paper edge mouth be at once weaker more determined weaker inasmuch a have grown more sensitive more nervously responsive to movement of restless eye more determined a though with expression of constant mental attitude there be good deal of indecision in face expression varied slightly incessantly a fixed eye anew on printed word before after fleeting glance at boyish face outlined by cushion opposite laid down paper at last with little deliberate rustle apparently intended to attract attention a did so face assumed ordinary superficial vivacity expression harmonised le well with rather sharpened feature than have done three month before good novel julian said airily smothering yawn a spoke indicating with little gesture of head book in julian hand julian have be holding book in hand ever since left little norfolk station from have started have scarcely turned page feature be composed into expression of boyish resentment about there be that distinct suggestion of sullenness be usual outward expression of hauteur of youth a mother spoke flushed hotly with angry self consciousness not particularly said without lifting eye there be moment pause during mr romaynes eye be fixed upon with concentration enough in now then broke into light laugh leaning suddenly forward laid one of hand on poor old boy said in tone half mocking half sympathising be very hard on wasnt cruel fate make young men so ineligible girl so pretty throw two perversely together if youve thought to spare from sir though think must bestow little gratitude upon for very timely arrival laughed again in laugh a in voice there be faintest possible touch of reality reality be anxiety then a julian twisted hand from under hers with gruff almost inaudible dont see that leant back in seat again with smile dear boy said gaily very sad position for admit for present youre dependent on mother not very stingy mother eh sir think find will be right for when right young woman turn up a doubt will day perhaps youll find mother wont abdicate so very ungracefully see must be right young woman in spite of laugh in there be ring in tone in word be spoken be full of significance significance laughter seemed to be doing battle together a mr romayne went on ignoring julian interjection dont think must have found very pleasant situation to be engaged to miss newton with prospect before of keeping waiting until have made fortune at bar im sorry to say dont share conviction of moment that be right young woman be very pretty allow very nice girl doubt mr romaynes voice grew little hard a said last word shes not at sort of girl must like to marry have money in first place have enough for said julian impetuously then stopped short coloured crimson mother broke into merry laugh poor boy said have enough for thats just what want to remember in intercourse with pretty girl after know position have advantage may flirt a much a like while youre known to be dependent on mother one will take too seriously julian did not echo laugh did make comment on word sat with face turned away from rather strange expression in eye expression be at once unformed mutinous mother must not see outline of profile apparently disturbed anxiety in face deepened again mixed time with expression of doubt self distrust a though to emphasize lightness of preceding tone turned conversation into comment on landscape took up paper again remainder of journey passed in total silence drive home from station be silent too arrival in london at end of september be not very pleasant proceeding unless be approached with considerable industry determination large stock of energy butterfly of society indeed large proportion of bee have not yet returned who have returned have done so under stern compulsion to begin winter work there be general pervading sentiment a of end of holiday beginning of term time day have be so radiantly lovely in norfolk have evidently be oppressively hot airless in town general air of exhaustion squalor such circumstance be apt to produce in london did not help to render appearance more attractive number twenty two queen anne street chelsea seemed to be touched by general depression summer flower in window box have be taken away successor be apparently waiting for order from mistress of house a mr romayne julian entered hall there be that indefinable atmosphere about house two month abandonment to even best of servant be apt to produce atmosphere be reverse of cheerful there be letter lying on hall table one of mr romayne handed to julian with comment from mr allardyce isnt julian will be ready for to morrow julian legal study be in fact to begin in earnest on following day when next morning said good bye to mother set out for temple followed to door with laughing good speed at least be ostensible motive there be something in face a laid hand on arm a turned away on doorstep suggested that last word said to be that have really followed to say what time will be back julian a answered carelessly cant tell not till dinner time expect there came into eye curious shadow of yearning anxiety take care of sir said lightly went back into house that shadow lived in eye day a went about giving order putting thing to right a said striving in fact with concealed earnestness seemed somewhat disproportionate to object to give house that peculiar air of brightness have be so characteristic of somehow did not seem so easily to be obtained a formerly face be gaiety however when stood in drawing room a dinner bell rang very daintily dressed in tea gown julian have admired waiting for son moment elapsed julian dashed downstairs breathless apologetic rather sparing of word first day work hardly seemed to have dissipated cloud have hung about that morning at breakfast a mother slipped hand playfully into arm with laughing word two of forgiveness turned led out of room without response must have be natural to have have pleasant day said mr romayne lightly a sat down to dinner pretty well returned julian indifferently said more mr romayne with one of quick half furtive glance at began to talk of own day have paid call in afternoon have great deal of news for a to who have who have not returned to town great deal of gossip be amusing in rendered more amusing by piquant animation with retailed failed to rouse much interest in julian apparently however after time mother returned to original topic again with quick anxious glance at face did find mr allardyce easy to work with enquired interestedly time yes suppose so be unresponsive response how long did keep got away at four oclock something seemed to leap in mr romaynes eye to be instantly suppressed a said with indifference ear keener than julian might have detected to be forced four oclock what have be doing since then may ask did not come in till quarter past seven perhaps julian felt inquisition in question though be conscious of nothing unusual in mother voice for answered rather briefly went to garrick with fellow what fellow demanded mother in same tone julian moved impatiently there fellow reading with allardyce answered griffith took in a though suppressed impatience of tone have not escaped mr romayne found reminded at point of something have heard that afternoon during one of visit proceeded to place little piece of news before julian with advantage that narration must give though face looked rather thin sharp a talked dinner be over by time a finished with laugh rose from seat put hand on julian arm face be somewhat bored dissatisfied a though mother effort for entertainment entirely failed to compensate for merry house party of last month think will have to come keep company while smoke cigar said lightly adding with assumption of sudden thought on subject be not wholly successful by bye garrick club must be most attractive spot if stayed there from four oclock till seven julian took quick step forward movement might have be due to desire to open door for might have be expression of irritation of face be full didnt get there at four said really dont know what time be must have be nearly five walked home so left somewhere about half past six irritation be in voice a well a in face mother patted gaily on shoulder with most artificially self deriding laugh he quite annoyed at being asked so many question exclaimed dreadful nuisance to have such silly old mother isnt havent told what mr griffith be like yet julian have tried to laugh in answer to first word sound produced have be almost a greatly wanting in reality a have be ease of mother tone answered now with undisguised impatience like oh he like other fellow mother nothing particular one way other paused moment then added hastily be rather thinking of running down to club evening dear if wouldnt mind being alone want to hear whether loring have come back there just chance might be there know have said that morning that there be likelihood of lorings returning for two three day mr romayne forbore to remind of fact did allude to conviction have turned suddenly rather pale namely that thought of going down to club have arisen within last few minute very well dear said smiling up at go by mean oh will be quite happy with book did not look back at a left room after word two expression on face might have arrested even youthfully self centred preoccupied attention loring be not at club be there information to be obtained there a to movement julian played game of billiards lost through sheer carelessness then determined to go home again must walk part of way said to though have have one walk that day wanted to think thing over phrase be serious by comparison with process to be attached grandiloquent julian mental apparatus be at present a undeveloped a of fashionable young man of four twenty may usually be taken to be process of thinking thing over a conducted within good looking head involved stern process of reasoning exhaustive system of logical deduction from cause to effect carefully balanced opinion of past decision for future when proposed to to think thing over in short simply meant that must ring strictly limited number of change on fact that a expressed vaguely to be awfully hard line have taken time to come to conclusion have flirted with miss hilda newton very happily for last ten

secret breach between mother son have be focussed rendered definite tangible a be by mother laughing speech in train be a have sat gazing blankly out of window during last half hour of journey that have come to conclusion before mentioned that be awfully hard line make fellow feel fool said to a morosely a undeveloped nature of temperament permitted a issued moodily from club started in
