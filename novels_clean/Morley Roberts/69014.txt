blood poured from burst artery head sank back pete never looked behind a threw gun away went at merciless gallop for last level mile before upland opened on valley of lake cursed sister ned quin how must get away before got to pitch of road turned in saddle looked back saw dark patch that dead horse made saw cattle coming to find out what unusual spectacle meant for curiosity be insatiable already stood staring tossing head in half circle round mary horse soon world must be in circle round victim where be to go how be to act pulled up suddenly put hand to aching head if went into kamloops a be with horse flaked with foam with own ear bleeding little world of town must be agog to know what have happened yet if hid till dark must find mary perhaps dead upon open road someone might go to shack discover ned be hard to know how to act remembered for first time that have bottle in pocket asked advice of that sent flying down road to kamloops be best to risk thing best not to wait not to dodge to hide only chance be to get down to coast out of country to get north to columbia then to sand point through kootenay practically only alternative route out be impossibly dangerous a rode saw steamboat coming down river from lake if rode hard might catch get away before word be said a rode bound up head ear with big coloured handkerchief be red enough to hide oozing blood be hour more after noon when rode into kamloops came in at lope took on careless air calling klahowya to of tilikums a passed even saluted mounted policeman went by singing till came to alexander where have got horse from have to explain how came back on ned quin instead of one hired stableman who knew have hired out wretched crock be easy enough to satisfy damned kieutan fell with said pete

steamer whistle at nigh wharf ran to catch in ten minute be on way down stream to ferry knew must be so easily might be close call for yet there be nothing else to do to risk a cool air of river struck shivered for thought have killed ned quin now that heat went out of blood chilling fever of revenge in began to be very much afraid took drink far back upon road cattle ringed round mary body body of horse million fly blackened pool of blood drank against dust soaked up cattle to leeward smelling horror of spilt life tossed head uneasily challenged strange death that horror of instinct spoke to to windward came closer blew at fly rose in black swarm settled again from distance other cattle marched to wavering ring about wonder came running one of inside steer touched mary body with horn moaned lifted hand steer ran backwards snorting backing on others who horned other angrily then steer crept up again to mary blew at dust in lay time rose to sitting position ring of cattle with lowered head retreated from wondered where be how came to be there then saw dead horse gun that cow smelt uneasily remembered that pete have killed ned that have perhaps tried to kill scrambled to foot cattle jostled other to get away from staggered a stood for have strength desire of life have gone out of with there came sickness of notion of revenge must only be trying to revenge on inexorable destiny be hers pete have killed man have gone must go back to dead overhead sun burnt a staggered on road long endless wearying road so like to life went at foot pace mile be weary endless space without hope for man be dead pete be cruel madman there be nothing left for yet still walked like painful hurt creature returning to lair ached in limb head seemed splitting physical torture of being dulled mind a seemed to only sun of thing moved swiftly be drawing on towards evening when came to house stood outside door knee trembled clutched at latch door post to prevent falling inside be man dead man who have be so good so cruel began to weep opened door letting westering sunlight in next moment screamed dreadfully for place where have left be vacant oh ned ned cried in most lamentable voice yet within murdered heart there sprang faint poor flower of hope even a cried if have be moved be not that someone have come taken away then then oh god perhaps be not dead brain turned reeled again clutched at table held to god listen to be merciful where be man man love wrestled with dark god of fate whose blinded eye knew not cared whom trod down upon dusty road of earth then heard rustle in room a of something stirring prayed that be true that did not hear amiss that when eye opened must see ned once more heard groan ran to blindly found man there on bed bed still alive though half blinded blood covered hardly conscious ned ned in mad desire for revenge have left believing dead fell beside with scream be more than sigh when became conscious again after awful shock of joy found wounded hand seeking hers heard hurt mouth whisper for water for little good that came with evil thanked god very humbly brought man water spoke to did not know that have be away
