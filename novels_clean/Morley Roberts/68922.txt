be thirty mile perhaps more from new find chapter iii going blind second day found four men cheerful left little apprehensive for a day went on though appeared impossible for morning heat to be greater still grew grew till noon that seemed full flood yet knew must be worse after one o'clock when guessed time intuitively a bushman will for hick be clock little breeze blew from south east failed be then pushing across patch of dense thick scrub with opening in be partially overgrown with dry spinifex colour of ripe wheat straw piece of exposed whitish ground shone with reflected heat be a intense a sun about two o'clock breeze came from north hick shook head pulled up horse for took noon time that day be better to push on even through spinifex murdered horse what be wrong asked smith who be riding with leg on one side like woman what be wrong said hick well get narked about must say north wind here be nothing to yearn for will soak pool of water up in twenty four hour will be done tut man cried smith hick went on now be almost a far a be last time even further where be creek that gassed about wrangled for ten minute then rode on rather sullenly tom mandeville who knew least about country said little baker must say ditto to smith if smith said die be evident north wind blew steadily at about ten mile hour be in truth like breath from furnace caught men on left cheek tom skin fairly burnt blistered others grinned be silent rode through living invisible flame horse be evidently distressed leg streamed with blood from wound made by porcupine grass at last about six when hick big horse be almost done for came to water hole before must check animal be half up to knee drank till stretched girth almost to breaking point night by little fire of scrub there be usual discussion now bore more continually on thing most to be considered did not divagate into common ribaldry did discus horse flesh in general spoke only of own horse of water now water to morrow prospect of getting through to place where must stay prospect to rise in ground looked for for so much have gathered from herder dying delirious gabble now began to seem to tom to hick who be influenced by condition of horse that have gone out into big impossible without much chance of doing anything what have to go on in estimating chance heavy lump of gold mixed with quantity of fevered talk streaked with possible vein of real consciousness how can know have sens even when talked most sensibly asked hick daresay fever invented for did h'invent gold urged baker hick grinned yes might have got that anywhere who be to know now come to think of that did get tip from chap damped little be same if did said smith with water bit of grass be for going on will go by not said mandeville will by power cried smith recognising what baker meant reached out hand to faithful chum if go go said baker with tear in eye good old man murmured smith lay down on spread blanket sweated through intolerable night while star winked hotly in drying air at early dawn tom filled up water bag ate breakfast in comparative silence opened new discussion saddled horse at same time if hick be little behind others be only customary be 'go on said a smith mounted saw smith turn head to north east there be more said followed leader by noon hick stopped horse be nearly done said gloomily others paused give mouthful of water in hat said tom hick grumbled gave hist carcass on again said baker man a must 'ave elephant dry up said hick be enough smith frowned at mandeville who rode on yard two if go easy can do rest of day said smith if there be water why can get back to morrow against judgment hick went with a walked pace be slower heat be peculiar sickening wind be no longer quite steady came in blast a if be being fanned by red hot fan touch be scalding to make matter worse be now on piece of country bare even of scrub white ground be like bright pan on fire haze danced shimmered until bit of scrub looked alive against faint blue of far low range to south at last in north west saw tree be without visible support for thin trunk be not yet to be seen might even be mirage be there water there said tom to hick hick shook head ai likely camped under tree night there be water there not even dried water hole be to be found evening tea be scanty talk be scantier still men

out hand apologise old son be look out be here if make will do other thing so long said hick so long said smith baker cried tom half cry baker be fast asleep did answer two who travelled by night rode slowly to south west chapter iv two in desert smith roused mandeville two hour before dawn boiled quart pot of tea for water must run to more have to husband before drank smith spoke to chum seriously do know odds be against mandy old boy did put right last night though be bad going back chance be much best will do what do said baker obstinately brushing away fly be one to old man be going on said

might have be look so bloomin ' bad said baker will tell what smith believe there be drop o ' water round here somewhere heard mosquito morning be deal too dry for if there ai water went to look at end of patch of timber just under root of tree found mud marked with trampling hoof be pity did leave then must have filled up bag said baker went back told chum be in luck way said smith who be in fever of suppressed excitement save quart of water 'd have given poor devil pint apiece if 'd died ourselves hour before dawn got away travelled fast for two three hour north east way led through much same country a have passed through before for be a flat a calm sea bare of scrub higher than horse knee when sun be two hour up came to more rolling country be here there broken by dried creek bed yet sign of water be none seemed that heavy rain have tempted out have not fallen there yet right ahead of be low range looked timbered how far be asked baker must guess thirty mile said smith then be not for to day said smith rode on for hour if get water to night be up with gee gee said baker when have ridden mile smith spoke yes be right said a rode face twitched expression changed thousand time for be wrought up to strange pitch nerve be tried face be thin brown very finely cut showed thought in mind poor baker watched wonderingly wonder what be in 'ead said for just then smith looked very gloomy what be wrong asked smith turned in saddle smiled odd far away smile be thinking of champagne with ice in oh be well moment be not with said be wonderful h'awkward to deal with when be blind said baker smith nodded be damned hard line said presently what be 'ard that father drank said smith took mandeville aback what cried thort said father be clergyman smith nodded there be many parson doing time said what for asked baker in rather contemptuous disbelief smith did not answer will drink asked wetted parched throat when horse heard terrible sound of pouring water turned head whinnied pitifully poor poor devil said smith rode bit harder yet gave pint at noon only aggravated thirst when after little rest went on showed sign of terrible distress night camped in dry gully in broken country with searching must find sign of water rose at midnight travelled north east still having now little over quart of water between next night be across first range smith horse fell died cut throat of mandeville horse in morning for have water left did not speak looked half askance at other seemed intolerable brutal murder now walked straight ahead in fairly timbered country smith kept eye open for sign of native well saw nothing be dream baker said smith must believe anything be where white man ever be one have be within two hundred mile of place where be others now asked choking baker smith spat thickly god know walked for hour in bitter anguish be country of black enchantment said smith daresay doe exist perhaps exist perhaps be only dreaming be devilish hot baker baker nodded painfully what do talk for murmured because must answered pal there be gold here smell have brought to death baker poor mandeville laid hand on smith arm looked at like dumb animal in pain never mind old man name baker be baked turned blind a spoke stumbled hold up damn cried smith in agony sounded like anger must have cried if thickening blood have not sucked tear out of put arm round baker stumbled on till came to shady tree be done mumbled mandeville fell on knee smith got down by oh said baker be half unconscious spoke smith bent down to catch what said heard nothing illustration smith bent down to catch what said smith laughed with thin dry laugh bending down kissed baker upon low forehead held faithful little soul now in valley of shadow of horrible death then smith shook rouse up baker mandeville drew back mind to bitter earth yes old man there may be water within reach baker now listen get hold of be going to look for water if come back be done do understand baker nodded looking wistfully at mate smith stooped kissed again baker smiled a smith went off towards thicker timber chapter v looking for water smith whose throat be dry whose tongue be half blackened stumbled on for hundred yard before thought of taking bearing for now in country of scanty timber only gradually grew denser one part be terribly like returned to tree getting tomahawk blazed way for nearly mile though tree be thicker saw sign of water few sign of life beyond swarm of ant native bee a walked spoke little to be chiefly of far away thing chuckled now again with very frightful sound though once in while became half delirious be yet able to control wandering mind occurred to that felt a have sometimes done in drink when be necessary to have wit about so a walked stopped sometimes said to a if be man pull together old son stumbled on in intense heat sometimes stayed behind bigger tree let shade cover a slashed at one tree noticed bark be not wholly dry so cutting into sapwood got chip sucked why have done that for poor baker a travelled be aware of men shadow ghost behind tree called to when came up be far ahead of believed in at last terrified little held tomahawk a if to defend then grew angry remembered with peculiar gusto hot taste of blood of mandeville murdered horse delirium left when caught foot in root went head long for turned about in blind rage cut root through savagely be alive have done on purpose be no more than child by odd ridiculous notion of mind began to feel angry with baker why did man not come why did send on hideous futile errand while took ease lying down in shade when got so far struck smith with terrible distinctness that did not remember in way how came to be with mandeville in position must not recollect anything of yesterday though recalled new find seemed very far off vague in way connected with present trouble said at last that when saw baker must ask about meantime have to get water held up water bag be a dry a last year bone tree now became denser there be patch of very thick scrub remembered that have not blazed tree for good time stupidly blazed one came to presently found futilely going round one tree a though meant to ring bark for moment must not remember in direction must go at last recalled fact that sun be on right side of back of neck that foolish squat shadow must be on left walked fast ran have be travelling about hour when occurred to with horrible shock that knew who be what be doing sat down on wind fallen tree pondered painfully sucking finger in babyish manner knew very well that be somebody who be thirsty must not remember own name own identity frightful catastrophe appalled have peculiar desolation around desolation of newly created being born full grown without knowledge of destiny struggled with brain for what seemed innumerable century gave answer intolerable melancholy oppressed still sucked finger suddenly noticed that seemed to taste like milk appeared to smell milk bit tongued little blood tasted like milk too resumed fight for own soul took up tomahawk looking at idly saw be name on said knew that name then saw mandeville own mind came back knew who be be intolerable relief then thirst came on again aural centre went wrong heard frog swore to heard croaking be a dry a throat what be frog doing in dry forest rose up suddenly began to run again then heard frog once more why there be million million of deafened dropped tomahawk ran through bit of blind scrub out into sudden silence be quite a appalling a noise have heard ran on again stopped ran with dry tongue between teeth knew have thirst delusion on when heard frog next shook head pettishly be a angry a nervous man worried by drumming in ear must be seeing water soon big frog boomed boomed boomed went on slowly through scrub came to sapling bit of whitish ground under looked like water shook head again little more must believe believe there be water then maddening boom of world of frog began again cursed without voice for now voice be gone put finger in ear ran little came right out of sapling stayed glaring then turning sat down on ground oh horrible horrible delusion what have done to be so tormented for time have seen water deep deep creek of cool water cried to be devil country devil water of piece with frog turned round again slowly trembling a turned then crawled on hand knee at last rose fell again with mouth in thick mud water on burning brow pushed forward six inch drank illustration pushed forward six inch drank be not delusion be water after lay drank like animal then feeling brain reel twisted round blindly clawed way back up bank for felt dimly that if became insensible there must drown like thirsty fly when be in safety sens did leave for space when came to felt for long time a weak a child be sane quite sane strange horrible delusion of thirsty bush have vanished remembered that poor mandeville be dying perhaps said be even now dead at thought of that sprang to foot went blind fell on knee when next rose must walk filled water bag with trembling hand turned to go staying wondered if be creek only water hole perhaps there be motion in water threw in twig to try found did move slowly to south be creek so must be easier to discover again must find mandeville almost doubted for when began to go back over journey from tree under chum be still lying seemed such incredible one by time distance that sun appeared to lie by position of sun must not have be more than three hour seemed absurd ridiculous have then lain insensible twenty four hour occurred to that might possibly have be by creek for night certainly be possible such thing knew might happen how be to know how indeed a asked question heart sank knew that if found mandeville alive mad journey have only consumed few hour day more must certainly kill when be doubtful if few hour must not do to go back must inevitably take longer than have taken to come began to run then stopped must never do to go too hastily if missed blazed way might never see mandeville again so tracked back through thicker scrub by hardly visible footstep broken twig came at last to spot where have dropped tomahawk heart beat more freely forgot how insane have be for now be quite forgot how rarely have blazed tree before found hacking round one single trunk like madman when came to tree struck with shock shake man who believing in lone land find evidence of other human being for smith must not for long time believe have done looked purposed suggested end thought alien to own journey until fitted edge of tomahawk exactly into clean wide cut of ring barking be alarmed that reassured must have be crazy muttered taking direction went on now came to gap have left in marking found no more slash in tree for two hundred yard examined carefully often went back just a came to conclusion that must probably never get through saw whitish mark in tree fifty yard further south heart leapt up be once more in true line now ran till came upon dry creek bed mandeville have crossed shouted aloud mandeville mandy answer came back to ran like madman at last spied tree under have left chum knew for same one for must see own blanket rolled up leaning against when reached mandeville be not there say mandy where be called smith in high tremulous voice there be answer silence seemed flood made smith shake for silence promised to be eternal loneliness be complete began searching like madman suddenly remembered that have gone twenty yard further when have dropped swag for next tree gave most shade moment after smith be kneeling by baker who be breathing very laboriously quite unconscious smith face twitched a poured little water between other dry lip for believed be back too late mandeville seemed in very act of death heavy slow pulsation of artery in neck looked a if might stop at moment heart strove dreadfully with thirsty thickened blood lip opened drank unconsciously drop by drop very slowly life came back to if smith must have prayed at time must have prayed a one friend turned hesitatingly from open door of death not even bitterness against world heaven of brass above must prevent from breaking down with joy sobbing like child a baker opened weary eye chapter vi billabong baker be quite by time sun went down though smith lighted fire cooked supper such a be for what store have be chiefly flour tea sugar bacon most of lay beside be dead horse what be going to do said smith for now having nearly killed thought good time to see what mandeville really thought do mean about goin ' on backin ' h'out asked baker be about baker twisted up mouth looked north there be water there smith nodded plenty of plenty mandeville made step two in northerly direction when came back shook fist in south west quarter do think be nincompoop a to go back across blazin ' desert till rain come not not by particularly large jugful smith what then what about tucker asked smith mandy shrugged shoulder there be what have 'ere sonny with what left back yonder there be enough to last three week reckoned on be more than three week to big rain said smith one thing at time please yer 'ighness said baker who be sitting by fire smoking hard guess there will be 'possums by creek if there ai must 'unt grub like black fellow doe a smith be quite insane about gold stayed next day went back brought in other store poor old man said baker to dead horse brought 'ere died thirsty do know smith sometimes think be bloomin queer world do said smith with savage bitterness that made mandy jump do what big discovery have found out that be bit queer for animal to suffer a make 'em suffer yes be right be queer world particularly damnably disagreeably queer world folk who will never get to heaven must actually object to meet ghost of vivisected rabbit there except in celestial pie tumble said puzzled baker smith did explain a savagely humped store under blazing sun new camp be right on edge of smith creek in small clearing with thick almost impenetrable scrub around have better be very small fire mandy said smith if there be black fellow about need shout to with big blaze d think there be asked mandy who have liking for black negro papuan australian aboriginal for if there be wish 'd brought more weapon than revolver yours repeatin rifle now smith must make 'em skip smith did not look for trouble of kind must chance just be careful said will put in time prospecting look good country might strike anything here camped down pulling quietly at pipe a lay in smoke of fire damped to keep mosquito off whole of next week be one of unmitigated heat spent looking for gold tried gully range though got very rich indication of alluvial never struck out crop of gold in quartz such a herder specimen must come from smith now peculiarly greedy be after only grumbled at alluvial work with pan a waste of time a baker special leaning be pay dirt sometimes almost quarrelled since loved other dearly row never amounted to much yet time in mind of be sense of futility whether succeeded did not succeed baker let mind out one night drew out smith say smith old man what be workin ' for if get streak went pound to pan five for matter of what use 'd be if do strike herder find wo buy tucker take 'ome to blooming pal be so said smith then why work why not let get out instead old man across way came though be talking by regular black fellow fire of two stick red coal smith knew what kind of face baker be screwed up in knot line indicative of keenest apprehension acrost 'ell said baker what mean be let run bloomin creek down till get to river then can scoot down river what river be likely to be smith grunted for geography be little better than of most miner tramp be ten to one chance that must have drawn rough outline of australia have even placed albany perth freemantle on westralian map well dunno said baker dunno be likely there will be something other down after last little try ai goin ' to quit water again 'ungry have bin at 'ome 'ere thirsty for thing like water that never be 'd rather croak with flap of stummick glued together eating other than go two day without water common death heasy to 'alf dyin ' of thirst smith grunted again be what say said baker know 'd agree now do reelly think a can foot back two 'undred mile to new find with lot of water two bag full said smith when horse went that chance went how much tucker be left ten day must think replied baker then will go down creek to morrow if like said smith be risky may get done starved speared will go said baker went to sleep in morning divided up store stowed a well a must in blanket be in wallaby track by six o'clock traveller looking for job said baker can see bos if not can put horse in paddock grub at men 'ut what be trade smith when tike to bush go for job cattle answered smith gloomily for now be getting downcast hurt bitterly not to find herder reef for have got into mind that journey be luck misfortune overtook yet there must be gold in after gold meant england england meant what can mean to man who have lived there long have then gone into desert what must give to touch lady hand again sometimes quoted not aloud for baker have unconscious way of jumping on better side when came up only time have quoted in baker hearing mandeville told story of lidy in mile end road be nothing vile variant of ancient joe miller translated into language of east end brought up to date general trend of smith creek for so mandeville named with great ceremony emptying of tea leaf upon water lay generally north south flowed south that made smith little uneasy in spite of geographical weakness have idea that creek must run into river must think of river on coast now four hundred mile away into must flow on second day of tramp south by slow water notion came to kept to for hour when camped at noon to boil billy spoke way be heading now mandy never give thort answered mandy look at sun baker looked at noon day light drawing few line on sand looked up shook head why smith be going south east more east that yes be going inland said smith believe be creek at what do mean asked baker whose colonial knowledge be very small compared with smith chum did answer rose stood by creek bank do think there be a much water in a there be asked baker rose may be bloomin ' fancy think a there be allowed then said smith be billabong have be fooled baker who have not faintest notion of what billabong be how differed in nature from common creek looked extremely puzzled what blue blaze be billy bong asked water that run be creek at least be h'idea what be billy bong what d 'ye call smith went back to tea be followed by baker billabong said little didactically be thing never heard of in other country hot jewel of beautiful british empire doe run into river at what do think will find at end of baker shook head bit of swamp maybe else will just go on on till bed dry out said smith for billabong run out of river not into be nature of thing said baker who began to think smith be mad not australian thing son said smith in of river here there be natural outlet on to plain when river rise certain height water pours down billabong know one out of lachlan in new south wale be full three hundred mile long end in swamp there must be big river to north of rain have at new find must have be very heavy up at head water wherever be baker after few explanation got hold of main fact be just a smith stated criticised premise can be sure be billabong asked smith shrugged shoulder there be only one way to be certain be to follow down to end think very little more might settle then reckon a have come so far 'd better be sure said baker though will be offul sickener to 'ave to do back track so day part of next still went south by noon found water dwindling rapidly a timber got smaller scantier there be little more beyond than boundless dry desert of scrub must vanish in wilderness said smith will be sucked up in twenty mile for dead sure think be right about baker turning faced three day journey back to first camp upon billabong bank be very silent ate sparingly chapter vii running up billabong a fate now seemed to be closing in on two wanderer did journey back much faster than have come for have wasted at

castaway such a pitcairn islander might have be if have reached island without implement of civilisation have be left to hand to hand fight with barren land fierce savage fell asleep thinking that have perhaps discovered new white race who have learnt english from lost explorer whom have once believed ancestor why must give up native tongue be insoluble problem unless indeed have regarded new

tree saw widowed woman sitting close to pile of head talking to baker shrank away got other side of smith lay down close together do know who people be asked smith ai got notion said baker be descendant of convict escaped hundred year ago said smith baker fairly gasped chapter xii beginning of trouble whether smith be right wrong in assumption of remained to be seen from vague way in big jack spoke might never get sufficient evidence to corroborate upset theory evidence for must depend on chatter of senile old savage who in turn have obtained from outlaw smith knew enough of testimony to be aware that might be no more than presumption easily capable of being upset desired intensely to solve mystery not even danger uncertainty of being guest of people little superior in habit custom to men of stone age must prevent feeling ardent curiosity then there be question of gold from way employed from bill talk from what big jack said be obvious that there must be sufficient near at hand to make fortune of hundred men on rough calculation estimated that there be then in camp consumed in making of waddies other weapon in rude bowl represented degree of civilisation at least two hundred pound weight of metal at ounce be worth roughly about besides found lump of gold quartz about camp sufficient to make ordinary miner go clean out of mind boy used smaller piece a missile one big lump be used in putting weight on lifting smith found weighed at least forty pound bulk be gold there must be outcrop of vein here said to baker must take breath away there ca be mine like in universe if can only get out of here find again will be richest men in world be unless sell to syndicate getting out thing have notion said baker that will be good to slope pretty soon a soon way a see 'ere mine

tucker 'd be 'alf inclined to 'oof back down billabong make big shy for new find then conversation be cut into by bill who came demanding smoke baker who for moment thought be man be most particularly in dread of stepped aside when saw mistake must help watching two men together for smith be a tall a bill very lithe beard be almost golden short curly in spite of moleskin trouser broken boot ragged shirt looked gentleman to see give pipe to savage who ten time over satisfied baker child like notion of savage be something strange horrible yet irresistibly ridiculous for bill be broad a muscular a young hercules if have be shaved on breast back a well a head face might except for foot be over large flat misshapen have stood a model for nude be possession of beard hair skin covered wild carriage made contrast tremendous if have be black must have seemed natural enough if have spoken unintelligible language must not have presented so many feature of tragic comic interest irresistibly combined so when bill remarked that now wanted pipe of own because liked tobacco so much baker be of sudden taken with hysterical fit of laughter must not control fairly screamed shouted at last lay down smith who have notion of what have taken man be at first alarmed lest bill must understand reckoned on possessing keenness sense of humour be beyond like flash came to chum that must be bad plan to suggest that baker be not quite in right sens be mad think said to bill who be puffing at pipe quite calmly taking notice of laughter be mad bill hunger be too much for at that baker yelled till whole camp came in sober curiosity to see phenomenon be curious highly absurd for very rarely laughed during generation life have be too hard for humour not advanced enough for sarcastic sardonic laughter pleased smith to see girl whom baker believed to have taken fancy for looking at lunatic on ground with something resembling contempt perhaps someone once hit on head with waddy said bill for such incident might account for man acting in absurd way when crowd dispersed bill be full of a much nicotine a must take smith gave baker word think be off chump old man if keep up little will choke off

behind considering prospect between devil bill brother deep sea of savage unsophisticated maidenhood after about twenty minute walking came to broken ground that rose gently here there smith saw quartz glittering in moonlight bit picked up be rich with gold must have seemed rich to ordinary miner also remarked rock jutting out of ground looked like outcrop of reef still bill went straight ahead going through belt of thin scrub came on narrow valley about fifty yard across hundred fifty yard long evidently ended in river for belt of heavy timber rose blackly at south end in middle of gulley be huge lump of rock yard square gleamed white in moon be said bill two miner went on while sat on little knoll commanded view of near country stop minute said smith when got within twenty yard stop minute baker ca believe man alive be gold with just quartz casing baker went on be followed by smith round casing of vein be scattered lump of quartz studded with gold inside casing be pure though here there divided by thin band of stone for grass earth have be torn away sufficient gold cut out to leave mass visible smith sat down on lump of stone be luck after said oh if can only get back if baker have be near enough might have heard smith speak same name that muttered on night of delirium baker be on top of golden hill be dazed a ever humourous suppose be stuff smith be half inclined to doubt there ai so much in universe if be only just lump on top there be million in if run true reef why gold come down in england a 'as 'ere to makin ' of cookin ' pot smith joined sight be one calculated if ever sight be to make man crazy who have be hunting for wealth never found smith have to hold tight suddenly leapt off golden throne come baker cried that be enough let try get away sooner better if get through be millionaire waiting wo help come three men went towards camp be very useful said bill for make better waddies than wood black fellow never found that out be fool what doe tribe do with smith smith be not to be drawn into more explanation of currency exchange make thing of too said after avoiding opportunity of puzzling poor bill turned talk in direction might be useful have be down river bill asked bill shook head came here from east last big rain how many boat have two made with fire said bill proudly be better than log for jack father who be dead be not so foolish little while ago told about hollow log called boat went on chattering while smith be thinking how must get possession of boat wondered too whether must be wiser to take to make kind of exchange be possible that knife big jack have might be considered equivalent wished now have brought tomahawk pondered about possibility of returning down billabong for for with might make canoe for fate solved problem for far more suddenly than thought possible solved very night not long after returned to camp just sneak off if can said smith to baker hour later try find out where keep canoe see if paddle be there like leaving said mandeville be fact for there be took up old un prophecy can see bill brother be talkin ' agin plain when smith looked certainly seemed that baker be right for objectionable suitor for wild cat hand be holding forth by fire on subject made with continually look at two from that other tribe of white men never mind said smith will stick to bill jack be right so far so presently little baker casually sauntered into darkness went down to river with heart in mouth want more 'bacca smith said big jack smith reluctantly parted with what have left if will send one of young men back with said smith will give great deal of tobacco many knife um said big jack ponderously how far be tribe ten day journey said smith just then saw girl baker feared so slip out of camp on river side apparently departure be usual not noticed a far a smith must see in spite of bill suggestion that troublesome wife might be clubbed to death woman have great deal of liberty be greatly considered be not beast of burden that become in agricultural community when smith looked up again saw that bill brother be gone too seriously alarmed if wild cat have gone after baker with notion of gentle dalliance on river bank be possible that savage suitor might catch made excuse to go into bush when be out of range of fire ran rapidly to river when reached bank went slowly kept a much a must in shadow of tree once a stayed fancied heard voice below then made sure heard little twig break looked round saw bill brother peering over bank into darkness smith impulse that moment be to call to baker to warn next brought caution might have to fight man be certainly better not to let savage know be observed lay still waited next moment smith have revolver sight dead on a be lifting spear must see man very expression snarl of rage deadly intent a took aim before spear must leave strong hand smith fired without sound must be assassin leapt in air went tumbling down bank illustration without sound must be assassin leapt in air went tumbling down bank heard baker cry out heard woman scream a whole camp behind rose almost fell down bank found chum with girl where be canoe said be going to spear have to shoot quick quick girl ran to dead man when saw who be came back where be canoe girl asked smith again nodded ran a followed close next moment be at water edge in narrow cut gully girl thrust canoe out must take said smith a got into one baker sprang into other girl shoved off into deep water a baker left ground sprang into grasped paddle shot out upon slow dark stream behind heard terrible shouting clamour above hubbub rose cry brodarro chapter xv fight on river current in river be running barely mile hour be difficult to make canoe go more than four five even by paddling desperately at first did not dare paddle too hard for fear of being heard a soon a got well round first bend put back into finally baker boat drew ahead when saw mandeville stopped paddling get in ours old man one enough what about one said smith steered over to other bank left there for when capsized found must not sink a hoped have paddle said girl beautiful cause of war paddled steadily once more until smith suddenly made sound expressive of entire vexation what be said baker have food water bag be left behind baker laughed water enough sonny h'as for food miss kitty will have to find made big noise asked kitty be what baker have christened girl mandeville showed revolver in belt smith have one like make noise kill men came down to river to tell about row a be likely to be smith brought on right off said smith if have happened might have got away with tucker everything else to morrow be cursedly annoying paddled steadily for hour still keeping a much in shade a possible river ran here between deep cut steep bank lined way with very high heavy timber a seemed there be much scrub a well gave smith hope that if be pursued by land must not be seen in case presence of scrub must make pursuit difficult wondered what girl thought of must know how tribe must act kitty what will people do said when took spell after hour steady paddling made sweat pour down like water smith noticed that girl who worked quite a hard have never turned hair if catch will take head said must kill unless said have taken against will smith must not say that because want to go with baker be glad killed tommy did not like do think will catch asked smith a began paddling again shook head perhaps big noise frightened if find took boat will not come after be afraid of smith many of because in spite of what big jack father said did not believe there be other white men in world said be jumped up after being dead baker laughed did kitty not after kissed said kitty oh said smith indeed be be baker took paddle again worked hard for hour thank lord river be like lachlan said smith curl whirl meanderings doe seem to go straight kitty can get anything to eat here must get 'possum perhaps said kitty will not be hungry till to morrow there be plenty of white grub under dead bark at baker visibly squirmed that wild lady love must eat grub seemed rather too much began to wonder what must do with if ever got back to kind of civilisation must only console with poor consolation that be never likely to do so for to be on unknown river going into unknown with food little chance of savage set of headhunter after seemed heavy odds against lucky termination to wandering be glad to slave at paddle to keep from speculating a smith worked whole adventure assumed peculiar quality of dream be just that kind of vision sometimes come to man who have have adventure often in old day when in kind of ease have dreamed such dream began suddenly with going somewhere in strange impossible land with strange yet more impossible peril in front of a thought of last week two seemed to that have never left new find at be not whole adventure of nature of nightmare have suffered dream thirst dream hunger have come into mere vision of mixed origin of knowledge fantasy have handled fairy gold now dream companion be stretched on rack of imagination toiling down black river margined by ghostly tree clear cut against gibbous moon with pre historic devil behind for conceived a possible that one must credit story if ever returned then girl be with if brought back did obtain belief through corroboration pleased to think that must make rare stir in world of travel at very notion ambition long dead within began to lift head be not that biggest dream of by time moon have be almost in front of for time a river turned nearly due west came closer to tree be soon hidden be now close on midnight perhaps even later be conscious of feeling fatigued spell oh said softly floated idly for minute have be thinking baker said that most dangerous time for will be in early morning for if go for canoe see have a must if do determine to chase will surely have savvy to go a fast a can down river wait for at utmost ca have done much more than thirty mile when begin to get light if be scared of going into unknown country can do too if hurry trot bit baker nodded what be notion think a soon a begin to show first sign of dawn have better shove canoe into bank here hide lie up see what happens what be girl think wonder be asleep said baker poor little devil be lying in bottom of canoe with head on baker knee yes said smith have acted like idiot over baker must'n said gay lothario anything gaily be reg'lar scorcher be fair rushed if 'er 'air be combed be washed 'd be good lookin ' um said smith lay down let start again so paddled once more kitty who be not used to such exercise lay on arm matted hair must have defied anything le than horse mane comb slept like child in rocked cradle if get through will have to marry catch said smith when easied 'd a soon do that a marry a 'ave clawed after said baker reckon be kind of princess if so be a land of posh be rich will 'ave eddicated at 'igh school lord 'd wake of up if got slingin ' yarn about 'ead 'unting 'ow doe man who marries princess call smith be e prince too be husband baker said smith drily be often mistaken for waiter 'd hold on if be when spoke again be black dark for moon be lower heavy timber made river a sombre a narrow caon two hundred foot deep go easy cried smith look out baker for snag wo do to get capsized how be girl dreamin ' of 'er 'appy 'ome said baker cheerfully be just wonderin ' smith a to what that long sulky swine 'icks must say if ' e know 'd what ' e 'd missed e must 'ave took up with brodarro be king being big hugly enough what boy will say about mr mandeville 'ere rather doe for will have to stand lot of chiacking said smith be sorrier for girl what will do in civilisation know be getting light in east baker look out for hiding place pulled in close to southern bank be steep broken with small gully cut by rain none of will do said smith be afraid river too low for to get much cover unless find creek one passed hour ago must have done wake girl up 'd better push on till reach sort of cover when kitty be roused sat up stared about a if be dazed explained to what wanted after kissing baker hand act of loving homage received with visible sign of discomfort paddled on faster just a be obviously dawn came to bit of creek shoved canoe into if come down side be cooked said baker must risk something replied smith must hardly swim over when one side like uttered exclamation what be asked baker by jove perhaps think just crossed shoved canoe adrift went back way came said might if did must soon find out be off answered baker then might come down side name must be must chance said smith have tobacco jack took mine hope will go in for debauch get sick baker handed over fig of black twist took chew give said mr mandeville can eat too took deal of explanation before must understand that be chewing what must make very ill even then insisted on trying take much said baker anxiously will only spit out spit out did with sign of disgust when got savour of luscious black morsel told so missis said baker ai just like woman smith said with air of intense enjoyment in discovering feminine quality in kitty smith chuckled what devil else did expect to be like demanded kitty to take taste out of mouth went ashore in spite of remonstrance found something to eat refused with sign of abhorrence eat bacca eat said kitty baker found so difficult to explain to that be entitled by custom to make beast of at last began to see dimly that chewing tobacco might be objectionable from point of view just a be discussing matter in low tone smith who be on nervous stretch made sense preternaturally keen held up hand warningly to others thought heard something said listen then three distinctly heard noise of one thing making way through dense scrub kangaroo said baker girl smiled smith shook head lie low say nothing whispered a got out of canoe with cocked revolver in hand lay flat on stomach wriggled yard two till must see further bank side be kitty asked baker who began to trust girl instinct better than own pointed across stream be good said baker nevertheless got out weapon turned barrel to see have cartridge cocked presently smith came back foot foremost inch by inch be there said how many see six there be on bank at least think so came from down stream be right see baker nodded who be there be big jack of rest poor old bill hope sha' have to wipe out said smith be best of gang yes said mr mandeville be good like bill want to see smith whispered smith keep quiet got out of boat sliding like snake lay by gradually with invisible motion of snake who see prey crept out of skin be only garment went three yard between low growing scrub concealed lay with head in scrub for ten minute came back again a went there be ten said after manner of savage counting showed five finger twice smith who have once read something about low arithmetical power of savage have noticed that have not degenerated so far a to come to inclusive word many under hundred yes there be ten repeated want to go back want to go down river again think smith that say swim over ' can kill in water said smith showing revolver nodded might come over further up added presently smith looked behind apprehensively be now that feared if be taken by surprise in rear must be close shave baker said turn round keep eye skinned ear open trouble about side kitty go back watch smith held out hand to baker shake old man said with emotion if get out have be good pal right be replied baker good old man then kitty put one hand behind held up one finger then made motion with hand suggested swimming there be one swimming over said smith look round unless tell went little bit up bank in order to get view of stream saw head in water half way across be heartily glad to see that be not bill looked at six shooter again be only forty two calibre have always be accustomed to forty five thought must hit man at fifteen yard bent down made low noise caused kitty to turn head put finger to ear to make understand that be not to be afraid raising revolver brought slowly down till saw foresight right in nick staying one second to make sure hand be steady pulled trigger noticed that never in life have time seemed so long from time hammer fell to explosion of cartridge a shot echoed swimmer gave one plunge rolled over on back went under until heavy body came tumbling down bank struck from seat did not know that baker have fired at very same moment a for one of enemy be lying dead with matted hair in very water under canoe a double shot rang out men of brodarro rose upon other bank shouted terribly illustration did not know that baker have fired at very same moment a be awful scared said kitty who be now back with baker who did kill reaching out caught dead man by hair be bill said lamentably did not want bill killed baker must hardly speak if be possible to feel affection for man among awful tribe have felt for poor wretch who lay in water killed by hand be first time that have ever fired shot in anger in life called to smith in low voice smith waved to angrily to keep quiet for be wondering what rest must do presently slipped down bank joined what will do do think kitty asked girl shook head if kill big jack will go said be sure others be not brave unless see enemy said when fought with devil men in cave be always frightened at night for little men killed many of with small arrow give pistol baker said smith taking bigger weapon crawled down to scrub be shot of forty yard doubted skill affair be desperate if went up down stream swam across there be still eight to two in hand to hand rush must not doubt termination taking very careful aim at last fired fancied heard bullet strike must even see man face be turned towards noticed in brief space of time big jack dropped spear put hand to heart expression of futile rage passed over a staggered made effort to keep balance failing fell on knee rose again grasping spear a endeavoured to hurl towards quarter whence unseen death have come staggered again fell headlong rolled into river after one moment in rest stood a though be carved figure broke ran up bank burst into scrub like startled kangaroo smith heard breaking through for long minute when noise died away in distance returned to canoe found baker looking greatly distressed for girl be on bank with dead man head upon knee be sobbing terribly say doe think bill meant 'arm said baker for know be right for say brother never 'it off perhaps ' e just meant to tell to lie low baker broke down cried too feel just like murderer said smith a looked on man stretched out upon bank must not help thinking that be a magnificent dead a have be alive far more like ordinary human being who be not degenerate unparalleled reversion for in quiet sleep of death much of ferocity natural to savage have disappeared there be calmness on face gave air of peculiar strong serenity looked still like ancient warrior century have dropped away from instead of savage of stone age clad in skin might have be viking slain in uncommon adventure hair be now drawn backwards from forehead by girl who mourned have separated long golden moustache from deeper brown of curly beard wiped away bloody froth from lip looked like man sufficient to in life in death brave enduring now almost wise smith turned away with sigh be sorry for said what will do now what do do with dead in tribe kitty asked be given to ant said between two men with difficulty carried corpse up bank kitty who went in front showed where wanted body put returned in silence to boat be very sorry kitty said baker must not help sobbed girl what will do now asked smith do think will come after again kitty shook head will be too frightened said be frightened how did do there be time to explain inexplicable to do think can go on yes said kitty first let go over see if left anything to eat on other side tell be got lot of savvy said baker who be getting furiously hungry talked a if glad to discover strange girl who have attached to be not quite fool be got lot of savvy crossing stream found lump of kangaroo flesh have be half cooked turned canoe down stream again ate a paddled chapter xvi river sink next twenty four hour be without incident a went through intolerable blatant monotony of australian river scenery in change be quiet renewal bank of stream be still steep one bend be so like that progress seemed vain be like three ant floating desperately in ditch sun set close heat remained heavy odour of bush drifted down into drain mosquito made life burden then sun rose once more climbed into brazen sky burned into blister for breeze tempered fierce ray not shadow of cloud protected went steadily west towards sea perhaps more certainly still into unknown though smith believed that brodarro must now leave being terrified by inexplicable terrible loss of four of best bravest men be by mean certain that might not at moment come across tribe of black fellow a hard to deal with of infinitely more natural ferocity brodarro descendant of white men have of white man quality be not naturally enemy of own colour in later generation with black must be different at rate might be if brodarro be ever cannibal be only under exceptional heavy pressure many of aboriginal tribe be men eater always needed other excitement than common need must then only pray that might meet none be curious however that kitty showed little fear of aboriginal people have so harried destroyed with whom came into hostile conflict that must hardly understand how must dare to attack two white together now that be with two white men of entirely superior order who have weapon made most awe inspiring row killed a far a well thrown spear entirely despised black fellow be foolish men said really know how to fight can throw spear at man who be asleep be only little devil men of cave be bad have referred to before who be little devil men kitty smith asked long time ago fought with said lived in cave over yonder pointed to north east when be smaller came there night man died sometimes woman have little arrow in a long a hand never saw who shot be very much frightened thought be spirit big jack found lived in cave red cave made big big fire in mouth of cave then saw smoke come out far off went there found hole big enough for dingo then little woman came out be white like clay bill speared then men came be bigger than child when no longer suck be very strong so speared until more must come out rest died in smoke found after three day have little spear little bow arrow scratch of arrow killed man like bite of snake horrible said smith on soul baker mr mandeville can spin yarn be not surprised at caring nothing about ordinary open air black fellow after then be white too pondered over problem journey presented for solution what did know yet about world secret if be told anything out of way smiled who exercised little faculty in little book sat on judgment seat smith baker have overmuch thought to spare for quiet speculation for now stock of burned kangaroo be almost done for how be going to live asked smith might go up bank lay for kangaroo said baker lay how long asked smith kitty how be to get more to eat can get grub said kitty when saw men shake head suggested might find 'possum can try later said smith that night caught 'possum be coiled up most comfortably in hole in rotten stump banged on
