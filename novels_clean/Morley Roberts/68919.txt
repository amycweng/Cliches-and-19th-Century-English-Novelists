water edge scientific light of europe be much put out hurried ashore in most irregular unscientific manner having sent others for baggage began to make preparation for going to new york a other good passenger boat be leaving st lawrence for week nature possibly out of revenge for unseemly curiosity evinced by men of science be beforehand with misfortune a be once observed by intelligent if pessimistic anthropoid ape never come singly be twelfth of november sudden blizzard bringing snow must carry broke up communication with south if men of science be to keep appointment with university be necessary to sail from canada at once shipped under protest upon nemagosenda of ton register be little better than tramp be commanded by captain joseph prowse immortal jehoshaphat said captain prowse here be go what with passenger oh get out have got to take 'em said agent philosophically maybe will teach something will be good advertisement gah'n said prowse carryin scientific jossers wo bring better freight next season wish 'd get chock up with cattle ca stand scientist sister married one be 'erbalist in old kent road since went to chokey have lost conceit with science however if must be why send 'em along captain prowse be not popular skipper with sailor said that be hard nut sailor robber that american experience have made nearly a deadly a american captain with belaying pin sailor experience only work backward be good at reminiscence only nemagosenda got crew in spite of captain reputation be possible must not have shipped if have known that men of european light leading be to come with who follow sea have great respect for knowledge despise men in soft hat spectacle can not be denied that scientific men be a rule too simple gentle to look a if must take care of according to jack be first duty of man though premise naturally that even toughest courage greatest skill may come to grief about woman thunderin ' measly lot said simpkins ab to particular mate when scientific passenger came on board why have soft 'ats one long beard three out of four with spec holy sailor what gang harris nodded why there be twenty of 'em bill will bet plug of best to old chew that goin ' for 'em with belayin ' pin must do up 'ole crowd in five minute have sized up said simpkins with sneer then captain roared aye aye sir said mate let go gone sir now then haul in nemagosenda went out into stream took three day so for men of science to settle down for during first few day pathology of sea sickness occupied attention have time for other thing when last night session be over be seen again upon deck affair of nemagosenda became interesting mate port watch developed long threatened divergency captain prowse came to assistance of chief officer with brass belaying pin a result of pathologist indulged in little practical surgery division arose in scientific rank political economist argued with statistician statistic prove that common sailor must be treated with sternness said authority in figure be duty to support authority captain be brute said political economist for two pin must tell so can not neglect human factor say political economy sneered statistician then geologist who be man of sense said be talking rot discussion on poop be broken up by captain who came on deck with face like north west moon in fog having demanded presence of crew aft gave address on duty to superior think yourselves fine lot of chap said captain fiercely opinion of be that be scaly crowd of wharf rat relation of sex be better than must be so look here swine will have know be captain joseph prowse man give slack jaw to officer of mine give to man give to will wish be dead before see be be captain joseph prowse so be crew under have got to know be king here will wade in blood before get off throne mr watt put crawling lot to holy stoning deck captain joseph prowse rejoined scientific passenger crew be same gentleman said thickly there be something deep dark in nature of thing a make so do rough work on board ship be just so necessarily if be to ship crew of angel though might be handy for going aloft 'd turn devil by time 'd ate pound of beef biscuit have ever tried kindness persuasion asked meteorologist captain looked up down ever tried ejaculated scornfully 'ave ever tried anything else be kindness to sailormen to let know who be bos spare belayin pin 'andspike will spoil sailor oh solomon know 'd business when used word did sail to ophir for nothin captain prowse said meek gentleman whose great subject be cannibalism be very unpleasant work rubbing deck with stone cold weather unpleasant said skipper what do think be proposin ' to reward suppose not said ethnologist be sure be awful work must never do captain prowse snorted oh yes must if be in crew remarked if one of gent be captain 'd find crowd must hing sit in focbele drink 'ot coffee be accordin where be what kind of man on top in other word circumstance creates character said statistician be ridiculous exaggeration said authority on heredity man be what be born captain joseph prowse laughed scornfully not be what make of if gent be under 'd make sailor long afore suspected by way must tell what branch of science 'erbalist belongs to conversation followed more pleasant line nemagosenda although little better than tramp in appearance must do ten knot hour on le than twenty ton of coal day soon got out to bank where men of science discussed fishing colour of sea water iceberg yes said geologist iceberg swim on average seven eighth below eighth above gammon said captain prowse rudely why sailor know better be surprised at scientific josser like bein ' so ignorant be one third above two below ask mate if be so ah thanks will said geologist pleasantly mr watt be well informed man rather said prowse nodding there be not den o ' thief in port in europe ca find blindfold e know more about iceberg than for once went trip in dundee whaler ai proud of talk of much for whaler be class a may guess be keen on knowledge be watt will say that for might do worse than ask for ackerate information be perfect whale on fog too if mr watt be authority on fog that captain made out soon have opportunity of showing for half way across bank be impossible to see farther than one must throw hundredweight nemagosenda went tooting in darkness now again in dim world men of science be alarmed entertained by sudden battle in blasphemy between captain prowse well informed mr watt crew of bank fisherman for fog blanket sound in oddest most erratic way throb of screw can not always be heard even in calmest foggy weather such swearing match between nemagosenda smack be when apparently good for three minute so sometimes sliced right in two by sudden dropping down of what meteorologist called anacoustic wall of fog like last word of don whiskerandos in tragedy rehearsed speech be cut off in very flower of youth where blue blinding blaze be coming to asked faint nocturne when captain prowse have expended last carefully prepared oration right of maritime reply only conferred audible oh dog have to thank anacoustic property of fog bank for sudden conclusion said meteorologist for if be judge of human nature that smacksman be still firing red hot word into space yes sir said prowse indignantly be foul mouthed lot be a much a can do to keep even with 'em will slow down more telegraphed full speed ahead left mr watt with awfully worded instruction to sink anything from battleship to meanest brig afloat in saloon sat at head of table drank rum hot science prof that rum 'ot be sailor drink said captain prowse correct drink for drink flourish on reason be that go by contrary be cold work bein at sea so take 'ot sea be salt so take sweet come from west indie prof said geologist warmly what head have captain prowse skipper nodded may well say so affirmed phrenologist gave chart of 'ead once scientific chart with sounding wrote out plain what proved right be sayin ' 'ere there be too deep for paid guinea well worth be for said 'you get married done so mr prowse have living equal wish 'd brought chart with must 'ave interested gent to know what brother scientist thought of must indeed said pathologist there will tell what be said prowse be down righter be be captain of boat be if be afloat on hencoop with crew 'd like to see cock a must crow before gave order authority come nat'ral to will be bos wherever be hancock more rum must have succeeded in whatsoever took hold of phrenology told so wrote out plain have kind of leanin ' towards science ever since phrenologist put 'be 'and on 'ead said with start of surprise 'captain be wonder have always wondered what be made scientific chap look so 'elpless hancock more rum fret gent be captain joseph prowse will put safe ashore die in attempt a again ejaculated hancock more rum fell asleep upon table gentleman said geologist a interest be now secure vote go to bed be still heavy fog nemagosenda be doing ten knot hour other steamer be doing same even more twenty knot liner slowed down in order that might say that have slowed down to about nineteen knot half acting on theory that sooner went through fog belt better for one gave engine steam must make stepped out for america england at pace of indolent torpedo boat result of be that at about four bell in middle watch when mate aching eye must see forty imaginary steamer where there be none omitted to observe that there be real one coming for till be too late nemagosenda uttered one long horrid wail be answered in vain next minute men of science be shot out of bunk steamer be taking in atlantic through hole about size of dock gate what became of lucky unlucky boat got blow in first crew of sinking steamer did not inquire heard toot in distance in answer blew whistle for help though whistle in fog may be evidence of good faith be not necessarily for wide publication be quite possible that stranger if did not sink lost bearing in fog went off in wrong direction at rate crew passenger of nemagosenda found adrift in three boat in le than quarter of hour heard though must not see steamer blow deck out disappear up with goose ender said crew sulkily now of course will blow a ill luck hurry must have in last rush for life most of crew have tumbled into mate second mate boat with light of science be captain simpkins ab immortal jehoshaphat said mr joseph prowse be pretty state of affair man drowning swine of liner be gone down hope codfish be sizing captain up sayin ' what think of simpkins keep holloaing where other boat ca holler more sir whispered simpkins hoarsely throat give out a wind rose three boat drifted apart four eminent scientific person at oar kept boat head on to sea six other eminent person lay on bottom board wished be dead until dawn crawled into east showed that be alone be chill watery dawn a boat topped cold green wave on edge of bank prospect be eminently unkind wind be not heavy blew hard enough to bring spray of curling wave inboard one be soaked to skin sky be lowering overcast though fog be dissipated mist covered sun till looked a simpkins remarked about a warm a new tin plate must be said for captain joseph prowse that retained in measure characteristic of authority claimed for by forced optimism nature of crew made adopt endeavoured to cheer up luck temporary out declared with show of cheerfulness ai first time have be run down with god 'elp gent wo be last be clean against nature of thing for so many learn 'd men to come to grief at one fell blow 'ere there scientific josser may come to grief in crowd so many bein together be best of insurance will pull through mind ask to remember be that be captain what say go now always be very well said meteorologist whose temper be going with skin of hand thought have right to run so fast in fog captain prowse gasped then recovered did tell be captain here same a on steamer did said sulky man of science then hold jaw said captain prowse when like of be asked for criticism will be time for to give till then will give captain lecture on running of vessel god queen enemy sunk ship one other have took away natural gift of authority so shut up though meteorologist choked with rage said more simpkins captain consulted be right in track of steamer more le said captain prowse bein ' so damp can hang out without much drink for day so biscuit 'ave plenty simpkins nodded yes sir 'ere be sulky useless lot sir so be said prowse will 'ave to shape a bid 'em first crooked word there will be man of science missing out of bright gal acksy of talent care where be there will be captain care if be owner 'd run same ai passenger more be crew took drink out of flask sank back in stern sheet want men to keep eye skinned said presently of be astronomer be answered bow oar who be long thin man in wideawake spectacle then keep bright look out will see star said prowse while be on want jossers to know that ai passenger no more boat crew boat crew will have to look lively when sing out so sooner get bit farther south better will be will do muttering that meant being captain whether be on ice floe mud barge fell asleep snored brute be coming out in true colour said astronomer what did mean by saying must see star begging pardon sir said simpkins meant 'd plug plug bung eye up explained simpkins lor ' bless 'd do oh rare chap be captain why year money go in fine wish to heaven be ashore said poor astronomer when get there will see never get job simpkins eyed sleeping skipper in alarm best not let 'ear matey cried 'd haze to death haze work up explained seaman what be thot be learn 'd said simpkins with great contempt mean 'd just sock to till be fair broke up day passed without incident of vital importance be true sighted smoke of steamer hull down on southern horizon saw nothing else across waste of heaving water now again captain woke up made few remark on nature of authority what proposed doing to who did not knuckle under night fell without sign of mutiny on part of scientific crew in very early dawn astronomer who have slept in uneasy snatch woke up for tenth time changed position simpkins geologist be keeping boat before sea be running south east be half blind with fatigue believe see something out there said astronomer feebly be always seein ' suthin ' said simpkins crossly a spoke looked round almost dropped oar wake up captain shouted here be barque almost so near must touch skipper roused up with rest jumped to foot sit down sit down gang of idiot said captain d 'ye want to capsize oh be saved be saved said ethnologist for within mile of vessel lay with main topsail aback there be nothing odd about to uneducated eye skipper looked at simpkins simpkins looked at skipper derelict said for with such light breeze be absurd to see barque with nothing set close reefed main topsail fore topmast staysail hanging in hank like wet duster have seen said geologist seen grandmother said skipper rudely there ai soul aboard be water logged loaded with lumber out of halifax be northerner about six hundred ton register get oar out if deck be awash will be better than boat by time came within cable length of be broad daylight least maritime member of european scientific society be able to form opinion a to being derelict a rolled water came out of scupper for main deck be almost level with sea part of gear be let go most of yard be chafing through parrals main top gallant yard indeed be only hanging by tie lift came crash against mast time sea lifted vessel bow bulwark be gone remains of displaced deck cargo showed through gap a got up to went right aback came round slowly on heel row up close sir said simpkins will jump said captain prowse not with lot must go near with crew of misfit like not for money will go bit closer must swim in ten minute simpkins be on board threw end of vang across boat brought astern thank heaven said men of science a trod slippery deck of kamma funder belonging to copenhagen trouble be only just beginning skipper walked aft on slippery deck climbed upon poop by way of rail for of loose lumber have dislodged smashed poop ladder when found foot upon native heath be once more captain joseph prowse in glory turning about addressed crew simpkins said be chief officer second officer bobeon forget a for others will have know that be crew just drop kind of heightened notion that be passenger will get along easy if look out for squall simpkins turn useless lot to throwin ' remains of deck cargo overboard try couple of 'em at pump maybe seam may have closed up again by now going aft to scuttle disappeared from view well said geologist of infernal oh stow cried simpkins turn to be here ai lucky must consider captain man of word a know so look slippy pas bloomin ' truck over side miserable crew looked at other in despair come now said simpkins impatiently do want to report chap a refusin ' duty geologist who be youngest sturdiest man in crowd said that did astronomer entomologist remonstrated with think 'd better said unhappy insect man prowse seems regular brute be said astronomer pray to heaven that doe find rum on board heaven did not listen captain presently came on deck with flushed face simpkins roared prowse a head appeared over edge of scuttle yes sir said new mate be that lumber over side yet quick for gawd sake said simpkins reluctant men of science commenced sliding board over be going sir answered simpkins goin ' said prowse when got hand on after poop rail goin ' must say so what crowd oh miserable thing will shape will get into condition will make sailor of get two of hoosier on to pump see if be leakin ' very bad then will make sail kamma funder wo make quick passage by time be picked up sail 'er 'ome will make chap fit to ship in worst cape horner that ever sailed turned away stopped when deck clear simpkins can let eat what can get there be plenty of biscuit mighty little else now then star pump astronomer entomologist pumped for life while sea round about waterlogged barque be whitening rapidly with many thousand foot of nova scotian lumber for when captain be out of sight simpkins be encouraging talked what told be horse sense want to get back 'ome to family asked to instrument usual way of livin why of course doe then buck up pitch in learn to do dooty be not hard man can make allowance know did ship to do be luck must now then that will do deck just lay into pump of will sound again a good luck must have there soon appeared reason for hoping that leak in kamma funder have closed blimy said simpkins will 'ave 'er sailin ' like witch yet chuck yerselves into will call captain captain be fast asleep in bunk of late skipper what be become of crew asked new crew a sat round deck ate biscuit took off by steamer said simpkins see have left boat captain say ship paper 'as gone so be took off for sure wish be taken off said weary astronomer that will come dessay replied consolatory simpkins if sail 'er 'ome will get salvage time wo be wasted so cheer up let make sail while couple of keep pump goin ' wind by now be light north westerly breeze though barque worked heavily wallowed in sea simpkins took a went round put geologist at helm keep wind in back o ' neck said simpkins to nervous helmsman will loose foresail jumped up aloft loosed foresail two fore topsail coming down got scientific crew to work here ketch hold of pull there will do belay tie thing up mean on thing silly as member of royal society who be thus addressed for first time since have left school made starboard fore sheet fast to cleat ai such as a want to make out said simpkins a watched critically captain will soon put chap in shape now then of fore topsail 'alliards stretch out lay back of can sing declared that none of must then must said simpkins gave chanty handily boy so handy until have topsail well up just a crew be looking aloft with strange new feeling of actual pleasure in seeing result grow under hand sudden row arose aft captain be interviewing geologist steer small said captain prowse work bally wheel a if be workin ' chaff cutter be doin best said furious man of science beg will speak to civilly will speak to how like said prowse did tell while back a be passenger no more one of crew sir said geologist beg that will be so good a to refrain from speaking to be not accustomed to be talked to in tone captain prowse gasped walking hurriedly to side endeavoured to pull fixed belaying pin from rail after three four trial came to loose one by time kamma funder be yawing abroad when captain prowse came towards wheel again geologist let go in turn sought for weapon captain caught wheel in time to prevent vessel getting right aback roared mutiny mutiny simpkins scientific association came running aft simpkins shrieked prowse ketch hold of geological chap dare of to touch said geologist first one doe will brain held iron pin firmly looked desperate come ketch hold of wheel said prowse in choking voice let said offender violent argument arose be perfectly scandalous said meek astronomer wo put up with cried entomologist must obey order said simpkins will murder screamed skipper if let go will be took aback said simpkins will be lot of trouble care said men of science then captain let go rushed for geologist simpkins broke from astronomer caught spinning wheel just a geologist knocked captain down oh cried pathologist believe have killed hope so said hero of occasion with rather pale face be not going to be bullied by coarse brute of sailor be captain said simpkins mutiny be in heart talked at once pathologist felt captain skull to see whether be still sound will die said doctor have skull like ram take below lock in said astronomer can argue with through door be happy thought even simpkins in spite of ingrained respect for lawful authority of most lawless skipper approved suggestion ai so soft a look said simpkins sea doe bring devil out in man if so be be got carried captain joseph prowse down below a cabin door must not lock jammed short piece of sawed lumber between other side of alley way be mutiny said simpkins be done maybe will cool off when come to find 'ead aching nevertheless situation be not pleasant one be quite certain a to what must be done hold committee meeting said entomologist others said that be nonsense simpkins who now looked on geologist a captain of mutineer touched hat to begged leave to speak well said geologist what be ai of gent good at instrument asked simpkins for if be if must get hold of sextant must be doin thing regular if be to take sight of sun ethnologist turned to astronomer how humanity yearns for certain regularity said must really comfort simpkins if must squint at sun through gaspipe find sextant said astronomer will do what said simpkins 'd never have ' thought though must not be induced to say in public why must never have thought in private revealed to inquisitive ethnologist that astronomer looked measliest of whole gang sir discussion have be held on deck with simpkins at wheel be broken up by captain hammering furiously on jammed door go down soothe said simpkins nervously mind tell done nothin ' give in to superior overwhelmin odds for so did gentleman so did a know bein a done committee went below with geologist leading carried belaying pin in pocket a marched uproar be tremendous what skull must have said ethnologist wish have

well bound to yewrope like to leave without visible sign to say have larrupped when be bound east in united state there be very little respect for man who ca take care of european have silly notion be not uncommon even to find consul who doe understand that sailor be good unless be in state of mutiny near there be end to foolishness of consul a captain noyes often complained with natural bitterness so when after have cursed han twice for steering jammed brass end of telescope right between man eye cut badly be quite sorry for see have almost got to believe that man from abo must be hurt brass telescope properly applied make four neat little cut one on forehead one on bridge of nose one on eyebrow a little consideration of human race nature of circle will show blood ran down into han eye bragg have to walk to break of poop bellow relieve wheel two day afterwards state of oregon owing to favourable change of wind lay at bordeaux a soon a did entire crew got too much to drink not even noyes bragg must handle though skipper be a have averred at beginning of passage captain congress president rolled in one only people who must handle be french police have work cut out next day a be

sardonic be to be found in part of deal with income tax very moment consul have shamefaced crew before saw officer knew where trouble lay thought of boxing glove with often whiled away idle hour when vice consul felt good well now well what be trouble asked consul noyes told where thought lay noyes be a smooth a bad butter have heartiness about must have made child cry for mother time be talking men be muttering that be liar consul be taking crowd in spotted many mark bruise on come by honestly among given without malice by gensd'armes when eye lighted on man from abo stayed there comfortable ship yes yes said consul of course of course tough crowd to be sure here come here a others saw that meant han shoved forward be nice face have got said mr johnson god bless soul have be running against something now must say must say yes by jove have be running against telescope han nodded who gave that noyes looked a black a coat finn pointed at with finger cap'en sir consul looked at noted that be of size probably of same weight looked a hard a nickel steel eye sparkled with certain joy did mr noyes enraged noyes to be given proper handle deserved said angrily if wanted to hit must have done with hand perhaps must have be too much for without weapon suggested consul suavely not retorted noyes incautiously mr johnson looked at shrugged shoulder believe must lick in fair fight said with slight sniff noyes exploded must pound to almighty smash in two minute roared crowd began to see fun sticking out foot edged up closer lost shamefaced look must knock hell out of said one of from behind consul said hush hush then turned to han must lick man not mooch said han defiantly subdued cheer rose from men behind do hear that mr noyes asked consul oh yes hear well be highly irregular of course understand did wrong to hit with telescope with anything for matter of a ship seems to have be anything comfortable one suggest that apologise to man at rate pay off ya ya said han who at rate understood last three word apologise gasped noyes by god will lick first do after apologise that will back up in proceeding against unless must like to settle with now in courtyard with couple of pair of boxing glove said mr johnson persuasively crowd behind hummed applause lick said bragg lick good be not anxious for job be a eager to see scrap a consul be so seldom that officer get chance of seeing real fight besides did not love noyes at inside of two minute inner court saw skipper of state of oregon man from abo stripped to waist singlet pick own second said consul gleefully will be referee timekeeper forgot there be such thing a foreign office did not forget of habit custom of western america there be to be biting gouging kicking said when man go down will have ten second to get up in next moment noyes sailed in be not bad fighter must hit hard at rate sometimes stopped blow previous acquaintance with han head led to go for body be perhaps little in favour for finn be abroad time at first han hit so slowly that when first got there noyes be gone gradually got little quicker when be eleven stone weight used sometimes to box with man who weighed seventeen in first round used to hit when where pleased in second have to look out in third used to get there once finish for day like han grew quicker a grew warmer yet han never touched skipper at in first round be knocked over place to outsider looked thousand to one on authority odd thing be that han rib seemed a hard a head wind be invulnerable twice went down rose quick enough when time be called one puffed skipper in second round clinched when consul called on to break away han fairly threw noyes from will lick yet said johnson now noyes have to defend one of han blow must have killed cow if have fairly landed skipper half in despair hit at opponent head got there stopped han be jarred to shoulder when recovered landed han went down to rise again like five ball on hard court though noyes jabbed again again straight in face never left mark blood behind blow of finn came nearer quicker more fiercely time be called in time to save captain believe will do said noyes believe too said bragg be not encouraging
