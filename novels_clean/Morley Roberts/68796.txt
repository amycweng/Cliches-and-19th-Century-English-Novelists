circumstance captain harry sharpness spink of globeter preserved equanimity a ward mate of swan of avon said be likely to preserve swan dry up ward said commanding officer be so good a to dry up when require advice to run swan will let know in meantime uncalled for jaw on other subject will make very cross do think can lick since went to see swab at foreign office asked ward a edged towards spink

permanency by of lady have be after have lost much said ward discourteously reckon that be mistook when think be that enticing woman hankers to drag in by hair of head kiss by force never said so replied spink fact remains that be not married be selfish beast spink sincerely hope will be married before be through said ward be most insolent mate ever have replied spink most unfeeling did hear

have be raining fog came swirling in thick wreath sometimes half choked wind from north east be light very cold a if blew off face of iceberg a probably did swan have air of thorough discomfort in spite of be steaming into west at best speed of nine knot hour be wonder that spink ward quarrelled there be hardly soul on board who be not in bad temper nothing disturbs seaman a much a fog fact that spink refused to be disturbed by made worse for others be distinctly nervous let fog play on nerve saw steamer ahead that have existence heard fog horn be nothing sound of own blood in ear yes do hear fog horn be on starboard bow said anxiously not bit of ward be on port bow be darned old wind jammer will give friendly hoot made whistle give melancholy wail be not answered by ship for be intended by gigantic liner burst through fog looking like high land booming at rate of at least twenty knot loomed over in obscurity ward gave involuntary howl fetched swan crowd out on deck in time to see that there be need to kick boot off swim for be also in time to answer insulting remark of liner two officer on bridge a scraped past with about length of handspike to spare miserable condemned tramp said liner a swept by oh man drowning dog replied crowd of swan everything else be said never reached mark liner be swallowed up resumed attempt to make good passage in spite of what logged a 'hazy weather what did tell about luck asked coolly ward very naturally have nothing to say till got breath what said then must only have be said to skipper who have so unfortunate disposition towards violence that have to ship officer who must lick be wonder said ward wish have be dead before saw ai thinking of others life if ai of own what be use of arguing with thick head like ward asked spink if blamed express packet slowed down to jog trot skipper must feel a sick a if have anchored 'd log slow ' rotter judge divorce collision must call most praiseworthy swine that ever ran ship down what be logic of why must daunder along at five knot might be lingering just where 'd be caught by such by berg trust in providence luck if like can get out walk at moment bellow be heard for'ard 'ice on starboard bow spink who for talk have eye of cat motioned to man at wheel to starboard helm few spoke swan ground past small berg have narrower shave than with liner if 'd be going trifle slower ward said skipper might have plugged that lump plump in middle must have be down on main deck seeing boat put over side there be arguing with growled mate 'd sicken hog wish be day watch instead of mine if have same temper when wake that went below with will have dandy time with relapsed into silence spink found more trying than open insubordination for spink be cheerful soul here ca stand ward what ca stand asked ward sulkily not being spoken to of course replied skipper order to be more cheerful ask to be polite for know ca be can talk when be wanted to so just talk now wo unless slow down said ward see why must talk be cheerful with sea lunatic well said spink will slow down to half speed to please for lord know there be enough ice about without having lump of for mate ring down to half speed be damned to ward rang to half speed without second order sincerely hope sha regret bein ' weak enough to give way said spink for be deal too easy going reasonable lighted pipe smoked steadily a ward day admitted might be hard to get along with have nerve must have done credit to bull most skipper in western ocean get into state of mind see disaster before be in sight if take to drink be because die of continued scare spink feared nothing under heaven though sometimes drank more than be good for be not because wanted because liked there be great distinction between two way of drinking after few minute of silence turned to ward do feel easier in mind ward do said ward own freely spink snorted a sure a ice be ice when get command of own will take to drink said spink now a be satisfied at getting own way will go below have snooze about six bell in forenoon watch swan ran out of 'bank weather ' into beautiful sunlight ward rang up to full speed about be iceberg small large sparkled like jewel in sun there be one long low berg right ahead of there be one to south'ard be peaked scarped pinnacled into semblance of mediaeval castle ward a spink said have soul for beauty unless wore petticoat to a to seaman ice in shape be ugly if 'd have way 'd have come mucker on beggar ahead said ward a passed to windward of big table topped berg wish be out of fine spell wo last long there be more thick weather ahead of be dago gave up to day at noon with pleasure took grub alone a skipper be fast asleep when turned out again at four o'clock found fog a thick a ever bill day a cross a must stick at having to yank whistle laniard minute so a soon a ward showed nose on bridge bill let out at kind of relief do call demanded savagely wish 'd have laniard round neck 'd have have out of bunk in good time swear a matter of fact ward be only three minute behind time always prided on giving good relief have double globeter be worrying that be so sick asked know damn well that owe hour oh talk go below die a always do when see blanket have there be much ice be blinking round bally shop returned second mate did wake when stopped dead said ward talk of dying when get below retorted day slid off bridge proceeded to justify mate accusation by falling asleep before head touched pillow in spite of melancholy hootings of swan a picked way delicately in fog ice be very nearly eight bell again before captain harry sharpness spink of globeter showed on deck a meant to stay on deck night have really be very moderate so have missed newcastle said lucky for returned ward temper be horrid spink sighed be most unfortunate man that ever commanded blasted hooker that ever sailed sea said day try more than do ward there be time regret ever knew must have be brought up badly to have disposition a have well well ca be helped man be what be meant to be there be get away from must admire to see plug oh say be fairly thick ai be deal thicker than much of pea soup served up in swan though spink rather prided on way men be fed in be nervous asked spink ai by mean happy said ward seaman worthy of name can be happy on bank in weather like be slur on know said spink look over must do if did asked ward spink did not reply to challenge inside of minute ward have something to think of besides quarrelling about nothing fog lifted for moment showed ice about air grew bitterly cold be soon close on freezing point spink slowed down again almost literally felt way through obstacle once touched small berg when did so be going dead slow ward stood by saw 'old man ' handle swan with admiration when be once more through thick of spoke wish must understand spink said with far more respect than often showed be most reckless skipper ever sailed with now be more careful than must be trust in luck till ca see said spink turned over to ward saying go own pace son be most agreeable when be civil next minute catastrophe happened for at half speed old swan bunted nose into low very solid berg result be very much same a if have tried conclusion head on with dock wall crumpled up like bandbox when be inadvertently sat on must have be obvious to least instructed observer that chance of going much farther be very small one indeed trembled be jarred to vitals iron deck lifted up like carpet with wind underneath one of funnel stay parted with loud twang crowd forward came out on deck a if devil be behind fog be still so thick that be impossible to see from bridge soon saw bill day for even ability to sleep through most thing must not stand being thrown out of bunk what be up now roared second mate skipper showed at very best ward must have at half speed said spink coolly that gave southerly drift time to bring blasted berg just where must do work poor ward have word to say spink have plenty spoke to crew below keep quiet there snapped without least sign of disturbed mind up came chief engineer m'pherson in pyjama blue funk what be happened captain oh what be gone wrang noo cried be hit more than penn'orth of ice mr m'pherson replied skipper if be 'd get clothes on tell what water be making look slippy mr ward see to boat mr day take steward couple of hand get store up on deck be so cool that inspired unlimited confidence although be now obvious to that swan very minute be numbered did not require old mac report that water be coming on board like millstream to show that engineer fireman came on deck spink addressed in what considered suitable encouraging term now then stokehold scum le jaw there wo get drowned trip be exceedingly glad to hear for lot of be of different opinion said so there be time to waste indeed none be lost real trouble began when be found that one boat must swim after manner custom of boat in mercantile marine when be staved in by swinging lump of ice moment took water lump be small 'calf ' of larger berg have struck on next moment original obstacle swung alongside ground heavily against steamer there ai enough boat said skipper mr ward d think must hook on to berg will have to board make out a best can a swan be vessel of close on fourteen hundred ton kedge anchor ought to have weighed something like four half hundredweight a matter of fact have once belonged to something in shape of tug weighed barely two ward picked up a if be toy hove on berg followed with warp bully for said skipper a spoke swan gave forth noise very much like hiccup down on ice port watch others get store over side steward blanket can get mr day put over side anything to make raft of may want one if berg melt spar hencoop everything must float went over side of on ice of into water couple of hand in only sound boat kept clear of berg swan shoved floating dunnage to on new vessel have promptly be christened 'the sailor home late home be about to disappear said so in term be quite unmistakable by initiated now then said spink when rest of be over side be ready ward take chronometer a lower down be careful with bag there be ship paper sextant in now boom off said spink for swan going there be tremendous crack on board fore bulkhead said spink then poor old swan cocked stern in air furious gush of steam came up from engine room stokehold ventilator until sea came almost level with after hatch be going down head foremost said crew poor old swan then there be mighty shivaree on board whole of cargo in hold fetched away evidently shot right out at bow mixture of cargo must have be followed by engine slipping from bed for instead of doing dive head foremost swan stern have be high in air went under with big splash lifted ragged bow in fog before went down with long drawn melancholy gurgle war such bad old packet after said sad crew for at least minute one said word then ward spoke where hell luck now spink what be become of theory that half speed in fog be better than going at at rate asked spink have leg to stand on propose to take advice from again have disappointed sadly luck be where be except in matter of officer be notorious have luck with be out of swan without life lost have got heap of grub plenty of blanket fine comfortable iceberg under there be many hour in western ocean might envy make error about come from globeter name be captain harry sharpness spink drunk sober be a good a havin ' life insured to sail with oh be right propose to plug first man growl if be a big a side of house none of be in trim to take up challenge spink lighted pipe three cheer for captain said crew cheered heartily for thanked almost regally though somewhat spoilt effect of afterwards by telling to go to hell out of pick place to camp in at little distance so far a can see in fog there be plenty of room for everyone said spink a night grew dark be where be wrong for soon discovered by falling into water on far side that be on great ice island have picked very small berg indeed spink consoled by telling that must be on long must hardly help believing a seemed so certain of after said to day ward old swan be insured for more than be worth must be surprised if owner be pleased with catastrophe wrapped in blanket lay down in five minute be breathing like child tell said second mate 'old man ' be wonder for have to treat like kid say ward let be kind to to morrow say globeter be just a good a other county mind said ward if do will take advantage of oh let said day be fair scorcher if get too rowdy can always put down on soul be gettin ' to like be got pluck of bull dog where old mac found mac sitting in puddle of melting ice water weeping about family at second engineer whose name be calder be trying to console chief by saying might have be worse canna be waur man said old mac what can be waur than bein wreckit on wee sma bit o ice be

throwing in calder arm insisted that second engineer be mother begged not to insist on having cold bath be puir silly buddy said calder have great opeenion of a engineer though be ' fool seems noo night wore away while mac wept spink slept sleep of righteous ward day smoked in silence a for crew lay huddled up together only woke to swear at new kind of 'doss on whole everyone chief engineer be not unhappy even by reason of attention paid to bottle did not contain medicine fell fast asleep snored like very appropriate fog horn dawn broke very early at about three found most of inhabitant of berg still unconscious in night fog have lifted sea be almost a calm a duck pond what wind there be now blew from west be much warmer than have be within mile there be two three other small berg when spink grunted yawned crawled out of blanket there be nothing else in sight humph said spink be rummy go if did come from globeter must be in blue funk must keep up spirit show what luck like have be in worse fix than many time after with good seaworthy berg underfoot lashing of grub see why anyone must growl if anyone doe will knock head off now of joker be cook found steward booted gently in rib at least said be gently whatever aggrieved steward thought of now then cox said skipper turn out find cook be one of pile of snorin hog let have breakfast by time grub be ready ward day be 'on deck ' sun be beginning to think of doing same two mate looked round horizon saw nothing to comfort only cheerful thing in sight be skipper for very shame more pessimistic ward screwed up smile not so bad be asked spink might be worse own replied mate what course be steerin ' spink straight for globeter replied spink cheerfully how did chap sleep ward said have slept at day averred that have dreamt have be locked in refrigerator belonging to cold meat steamer from australia just then steward said that breakfast be ready consisted of cold tinned beef iced biscuit melted berg there be sign of mutiny among crew at once say cook where be cawfy asked be only reduced to proper sense of situation by few strong remark from captain spink riot subsided before really began belop built greedy son of corby crow a spink called sat down meekly ate what be given then sun came up warmed soon began to feel well happy now real trouble of situation began to develop heat of summer sun when once got high enough to do work began to melt berg be rather higher in middle than be on edge be most amazingly slippery water ran off in stream a be barely big enough to start with looked a if must shortly be crowded never thought of said spink tell ward will turn turtle before know where be must put store in boat have man in to keep clear if berg capsizes luck ai what let on said ward gloomily thing fair melt under will have to swim to thunder with croaking said spink oh do dry up wish berg must said ward a superintended shipment of store when be done put cockney deck hand into made shove off blimy said lim'us be likely to be on y dry of 'ole shoot word soon threatened to become highly appropriate for about berg be distinctly cranky however fast melted above be obviously melting much faster down below for have apparently struck streak of comparatively warm water when ice doe go go fast 'crowd got very uneasy spink got very cross a arranged so a to trim craft sit still swine said spink do want to capsize be so cold be'ind sittin ' still sir said one bolder than rest will warm if have to come over speak to said spink presently undertook to do moment rose to carry out threat iceberg wobbled in most dreadful manner so encouraged offender that laughed if come to 'it captain will go over said with malicious grin so will said ward laying hold of skipper to prevent moving spink be not to be baulked spoke to of men sitting near mutineer jackson come here while go over there dress billing down go jackson for if do will dress down to proper tune arterwards said insubordinate billing a grabbed hold of jackson who looked at skipper appealingly what be to do sir asked be to obey order said spink forgit will plug if do said billing poor jackson be obviously in serious difficulty for billing be bos bully of fo cbele must even lick of fireman there be very tough gentry among gang if come over to sir what will do jackson asked skipper nervously will come over to if be in drink next moment replied spink firmly of johnny think can best be coming be not jackson shook shock head be very hard line on peaceable cove like said jackson if be to catch toko 'd much rather take from billing than from sir a spoke smote billing very violently on nose billing who expected nothing le let horrid bellow out of promptly slipped on ice fell slid overboard with howl berg came near to capsizing then there well done jackson said spink approvingly a billing disappeared in sea very well done indeed then billing rose to surface can swim billing asked spink with air of kindly curiosity oh yes see can so keep on doing till feel little le mutinous took billing rather le than minute to become obedient for though sea be warm enough to melt berg be by mean so warm a swimming bath presently howled for mercy be dragged upon ice once more be lucky for billing that sun by now be really hot stripped off clothes squeezed a dry a must while threatened to kill jackson a soon a must threat be interrupted by sound of large crack presently there be obvious sign that berg be about to capsize lim'us got quite excited a discussed situation came in close till ward ordered to get farther away a rowed off reluctantly encouraged by yelling be goin ' may lord look sideways at if ai oh oh said poor old mac be puir meeserable sinner wi ' sore head medicine will be wet in crack will die wi'out wee drappie oh oh oh berg stopped cracking took on ugly cant big lump of ice broke off down below came up to surface with leap steady swine said spink politely to unhappy crew ward asked where luck be answer be to get never knew for with curious heave berg started on roll with suddenness took with surprise bucked into atlantic together with what material have for raft be lucky thing for at least half of that there have be time to save such dunnage from swan for crowd including m'pherson day must not swim stroke ward grabbed day helped to spar spink did same for old mac in meantime lim'us made everyone furious by squealing with laughter in boat billing threatened with death when got hold of spink have mind breath to rebuke horrid bloodthirsty language with late mutineer reinforced threat oh oh squealed old mac when skipper laid hold of oh oh be drooned be drooned have rheumatism bad in joint spink said be howling illegitimate descendant of three generation without character a dragged to floating oar alongside capsized berg now be not so high out of water there be far more space on for time must be comparatively stable when spink scrambled on first of anyone congratulated on never failing luck helped rest on board whole space be soon occupied by unclad crowd wringing atlantic out of clothes trying to get warm in sun be quite astonishing how cheerful everyone be with single exception of confirmed pessimist chief engineer at end of berg men took to skylarking billing actually forgave jackson done what 'd have ' done said billing for owns now 'd abeost a soon take on big brute ward a 'ave skipper get about when give 'im back talk be that icy be'ind be like froze haustralian mutting a cross a if old woman be relatin ' what 'er mother thought of furgives jackson furgives once hever 'it on smeller agin penny peep show wo be in for sight will be be considered by crowd billing by act of nobility have shown 'gent billing swaggered greatly on strength of crew of course did not think be not paid to do so be officer business hardly occurred to that ice on stood be likely to last for ever in warmth of sun forgot discomfort of past night did not think of night to come ward did be still very gloomy on situation just a spilt said ward be askin ' opinion of luck what do think of now perhaps will use that regal authority of skipper to get out of hole have got in if ever skipper have right to be justly indignant spink thought be that man hole got in like oh do like who be ask that pestered to go half speed almost wept till said 'have own way cross eyed swine ' never addressed word to said ward truculently 'd have given what for well know spink shook head ai sayin ' used very word urged mean be that be what meant when let have own silly way have landed day to say nothin ' of rest on penn'orth of ice in mid atlantic more le bring into argument said day be cunning sort of chap spink need try to raise ruction between ward for wo have know spink be very unfortunate man said poor spink for at very moment 'd give three month pay to be able to lick pair of did think after what chief foreign officer said of authority must be more civilly treated by officer even if have unfortunate disposition compels to lick if can shipped two because ca ai reason for makin ' miserable at anyrate more miserable than bein ' in position of not bein ' able to oh right said day go ahead moan nobody stoppin ' be let alone ward be right a for fightin ' believe must teach to be too much for in month with boxin glove wish must said spink oh day have notion how must enjoy pastin ' fell into contemplation of such joy did not speak till ward clapped on back said be very good sort after if be use to own havin ' gone half speed that time may have put here sayin ' so much mean now approve of buttin ' headlong into ice pack at twenty knot hour to go back to what be sayin ' before started row where be luck spink to mind look so healthy breed of luck a let on be notion that old mac be of opinion to judge by sad expression of countenance to blaze with old fool said spink who care what think luck be where be reckon to get out of with flyin colour never man short nothin ' against certificate of of have noticed life seem to be under especial care of providence believe providence will go back on after plantin ' here safe sound on iceberg day rake up cook give cockney in boat hail will have grub have twist on like machine made hawser went to dinner sun did something of same sort at anyrate went out of sight thick fog came down on castaway 'opes bloomin packet will come run pore blighter down said men a fell to work on grub for accordin ' to 'old man ' who be cheerfulest bloke in difficulty ever struck be right in track of ole shoot of 'em may be picked up scooted into sea again minute a matter of fact be then on southern tail of bank for when swan bunted nose into berg be pretty well at locality on grand bank where usual 'lane to new york be left for lane to halifax very watch before collision have verified position by flying 'blue pigeon a seaman call deep sea lead ever since then have be floating in labrador current to south east to locate exactly be just about where great circle track of steamer from english channel to gulf of mexico cross tail of bank there be chance of something coming along there even if be getting late enough in season for big liner to take route to south'ard for fear of very ice have brought to grief oh yes said crowd when be full up with food be right nevertheless fog did not cheer up to great extent when showed sign of lasting day grew le happy hundred vessel might pas in said ward who for bigness have much le endurance than skipper be now hardly more cheerful than old mac wish be out of oh wish again retorted spink contemptuously do know ward make tired what do get by howlin growlin ' know be goin ' to come out right wo be discouraged by silly jaw of man ought to know better shut up to day surprise ward shut up at very moment there came bellow from billing who have relieved lim'us in boat berg ahoy roared billing hallo replied skipper what be matter now 'ears steamer so help dick bellowed billing joyfully 'ears 'er plain none of bloke 'ear 'er too there be such buzz among crowd that must have be hard to hear fog horn be not until spink have hit three kicked dozen used at least ten pound worth of bad language according to geo ii cap that anything like silence be restored then be obvious that billing have made mistake sea be fairly calm breeze from west be light sound carried long far be coming from westward said spink a consulted toy compass on watch chain said day be bound west be dutchman then come from amsterdam for certainty said 'old man ' crossly now men shout together when say three one two three just a men yelled there be hoot too oot from steamship for moment made believe have heard spink knew better when there be hoot grabbed day by arm by jemima said spink be right day there be two of 'em second squeal never came out of same whistle that first one did now nature of fog be something that fellow can understand seaman must not think be long way off if hear sound faintly even if hear at be bad enough there be worse behind be not to reckon be near because hear plainly that be to be heard farther away at other spot if cease to hear at furthermore notion that sound come from particular direction be biggest trap of lot now uninitiated can understand that understand that seaman be in same awkward fix whenever fog come down to cheer on weary way two steamer coming out of nothingness butting into be commanded by men who trusted to evidence of sens a if be police magistrate trusting to policeman hooted bellowed in most wonderful manner said with one short blast that be directing course to starboard a knew where other be where be directed course with most marvellous precision to exact spot on tail of grand bank in western ocean where must collide did so with most horrid grinding crash with one long last fearful hopeless wail on steam whistle holy sailor said iceberg crew time have be gone done ward asked spink sickly if have remark to make about luck spink have have remark to make about ward in other circumstance must have led to war while be relieving overcharged mind there be horrid uproar coming out of fog for steamship be blowing off steam everyone on board of appeared to be running entire show at top of voice just a be at extreme point of interest fog played one of commonest trick with anacoustic wall shut off whole dreadful play in one single moment castaway turned to other in alarm billing who have nearly lost in fog rowed in close think have foundered said billing certainly looked a if be right in spite of what spink said to believe josser be right said day old mac wept said be sure of that have rheumatic badly that be very cold to add to spink joy once more ward asked if still thought be under especial protection of providence then for first time spink lost temper went for ward by dint of taking by surprise served a jackson have served billing take that swab said enraged skipper will teach to be so discouraging so blasphemous a to cast slur on providence when ward climbed upon ice again said be right spink wait till be on board beastly packet providence have up sleeve everyone sat down smoked said how grieved be for poor unfortunate beggar who have be drowned through having nice comfortable iceberg to take refuge on then have supper went to sleep leaving care in faithful hand of poor spink ah sighed unfortunate disposition cut off from real sympathy have one to confide in at sea ashore a if bein ' ship master be solitary enough must plug ward make hostile wish 'd be brought up better licked more before got into fatal habit of fighting must go to sleep took to walking a far a narrow limit at disposal must allow when found that be in for restless night told man on lookout that must turn in jackson who happened to be look out lingered little before did a be told do think sir asked with trepidation at daring to speak to skipper do think sir that will ever get out o ' of course will said spink what do suppose be here for go to sleep jackson mind own business will be right jackson who be simple minded seaman of real old sort fell asleep feeling that 'old man ' be to be relied on even on iceberg in western ocean in fog a thick a number one canvas for by now fog be thick mistake a spink walked ice squelched with sea boot in melted puddle must hardly see hand before face more than once nearly walked overboard at midnight be even thicker be obliged to give up walking come to anchor on tin of corned beef though be on watch have to be owned that dozed for few minute just a lim'us did in boat lay little way off berg when spink woke found just about a dark a prospect when eye cleared sighed looked about with mind took of tone from fog from dull dead hour of two o'clock in morning wonder if luck be out sighed stared solidly into solidest darkness be certainly monstrously dark in one direction rubbed eye grunted then lighted match looked at little compass mind went back to lady in bristol who have given to be very pretty piece said spink thoughtfully be damned if can see why must be darkest towards east rose up peered into fog again rubbed eye then stood staring perhaps berg said stood a still a if figure have be turned into stone presently looked to sleeping crowd who be a solid with sleep a if be dead nodded in strangest way oh oh if be if only be horrid delusion murmured turned to darkness again shook fist at fog at very moment fog rolled up like curtain right in front of spink not farther than man must chuck biscuit there lay strange almost monstrous apparition of silent lightless derelict steamer what did say to ward about providence asked spink of whole atlantic ocean ward cast nasty uncalled for slur on way when said what did now have got bulge on fatal error about rubbed hand together smiled very happily there will be fine picking in mistake murmured oh will be something like salvage will lay dollar to cent can tell how ever happened ah here come fog again fog dropped down in thin veil till dim ghostly derelict looked still le substantial than have done then heaved rolled in deserted packet must be seen more spink sighed be happy will give ward biggest surprise ever have in life said a turned to boat in young lim'us be doing very solid caulk spink kicked ice into small lump at third attempt hit sleeper on side of head lim'us woke with start heard captain voice just in time to prevent threatening to eviscerate swab who be slinging thing at hold infernal jaw said spink in savage whisper pull in here quiet will murder lim'us obeyed instantly though have doubt a to whether be wise to come within arm length of skipper after having be caught asleep war asleep sir stribey blind if be began a came up to berg dry up say nothin ' said spink if wake anyone will see sleep again for week hand up of truck get stern sheet clear want to get in there be more than chance of not finding derelict of losing iceberg spink knew just a be about to chance remembered that have couple of ball of strong twine in bag into have dumped belonging including precious ship paper when left swan a recalled lucky fact heavenly smile overspread handsome feature be splendid notion said spink feel a proud of a dog with two tail wish chap at foreign office be here now must enjoy better than play stepped to bag a lightly a polar bear after sleeping seal when found twine tied end of to ward leg ward at one end providence at other said spink with grin oh wo be surprised skipper went back to boat paying out twine a went be chuckling in merriest way poor lim'us who be cold very sick of whole affair thought that strain have be too much for ' e balmy on crumpet be what be matter wiv 'im said lim'us a obeyed order reluctantly pulled into solid fog with mad grinning skipper who must probably scupper a soon a be out of earshot of crew wish be in lim'us said 'd give wyges to see commercial rowd agin still spink chuckled paid out twine until suddenly boat ran into still deeper darkness easy boy said skipper with strange note of exultation in voice easy be there now a spoke boat ground up against side of derelict lim'us turned about on thwart touched iron plate with hand if let yell out of said captain will cut throat from ear to ear indeed lim'us be incapable of yelling must do be to gasp did that a effectively a if be bonito with grain in boat drifted towards vessel bow while spink looked for easiest way on board ran like rat said spink oh know way ran got on board other boat think one be now surprisin ' codfish reached bow at last came round on port side there spink found what looked for vessel have be cut down to within six inch of water edge about forty foot aft from bow just a laid out

old fashioned seaman shake head talk dismally of davy jones be nearly minister missionary be well known to who follow sea that gentleman of kind be unlucky to have on board for davy jones be very devil if get chance to drown minister doe at once so that may do more good there can be mistake about for sailorman of great experience will endorse theory with strange oath what sailor say must be true for know business one of missionary be reverend mr ruddle be chief of others who be going to south africa to do good there be six of told thomas ruddle have wife with for must not exist without for part thought marvellous man darling have beautiful smile big black beard voice like bellow of amiable bull mr ruddle be blue eyed with complexion of californian peach voice like flute must have followed to davy jones locker if have asked though did not think of doing anything so unorthodox be not far from having to go there without consent of anyone for when nantucket be within two hundred mile of capetown came on to blow from south east a if very devil be at bellow after old packet have proved that have sufficient power to make headway against gale promptly cracked shaft went drifting away to loo'ard like dutch schuyt on lee tide be very sad misfortune know now when will be in africa said tom ruddle regret to say dear that captain be on main deck using very bad language to chief engineer who be replying to in way can not approve indeed think swears worse than captain stokes if be possible doubt other gentleman in black mostly kept to cabin ruddle went about in most astonishing way if nantucket stood on head ruddle never lost foot when stood on tail be quite at ease when indulged in wild compound wallow in delightful cross pyramidal sea be peculiar attribute of south atlantic in neighbourhood of cape tom ruddle said be 'dear ' even said when captain stokes did flying scoot on main deck brought up against rail with crash almost unshipped teeth what stokes said be not 'dear ' old nantucket went drifting west ' west on branch of current coming round cape run far to north of tristan d'acunha a if have put africa out of mind down below engineer be trying very hard to fake up something to brace round shaft so that must at least turn engine ahead when weather let up little seemed hopeless job to none so hopeless a to engine room crowd just a perseverance with impossible seemed about to be rewarded nantucket gave wallow in awful sea quietly dropped propeller a scared lizard drop tail then very naturally wind took off sea went down smoothed out looked quite pretty to who have be watching grey waste in despair be done said skipper for idea of sailing into table bay be a feasible a sailing to moon wind although have fallen light be still in east threatened to stay so till blew gale after fashion of cape weather where fifty per cent of wind that blow be gale be exceedingly unfortunate said ruddle what will happen to asked fellow in deep melancholy something must said brave leader sure enough did sailing ship hove in sight to loo'ard skipper a soon a heard of stranger made up mind what to do hoisted signal distress want assistance ' presently sailing ship came up under lee within hailing distance backed main topsail be bound for table bay asked captain stokes obliging stranger said be in ten minute be arranged nantucket passenger be being transhipped to ocean wave of thousand ton register belonging to london stokes went on board with last boat shook hand with master of ocean wave when get in send tug out to find said stokes be goin ' to blow heavy in while will do said captain gray be sure that wo come along 'd go under first said stokes will stick by till be a old a flying dutchman beard be down to knee be very rash to say such thing in very cruising ground of vanderdecken of crew of wave heard shivered stokes be hard case believed in nothing said good bye to passenger went on board nantucket ocean wave boarded maintack stood on course with new crowd of passenger who be very much delighted to be on board something did not go to leeward like butter cask how strange to be on board sailing ship said ruddle a stood on poop with skipper who be genial old chap with white beard figure a square a four hundred gallon tank why strange mr ruddle asked captain gray barring rig out look deal more like seaman than parson at least do to eye eye be right captain said ruddle with sigh be very remarkable thing that though have be sailor know nothing about sea have not picked up on board unlucky steamer have just left that be very strange thing to say sir said skipper a eyed ruddle from head to foot may ask how make out once seaman always seaman must say ca imagine forgetting anything never must be very strange story said ruddle if there be evidence for must believe in pocket book below have old discharge a mate yet at present moment there be one on board who know le about sea than do though hold master certificate spin yarn said skipper ruddle told strange tale be informed said minister be at time be about to mention mate in ship belonging to dundee say be told because have not least recollection of to put shortly may tell have accident when became sensible again be in hospital in liverpool what be accident asked captain gray something be told call shearpole came down from aloft struck on head knew more said ruddle who be evidently very poor hand at yarn well well go on said skipper what happened then how do know asked ruddle in turn be knocked silly while crew be taking in sail in very great storm to south of ireland say be very angry with poor fellow up aloft be using dreadful language to be struck down when came to myself be not at if sadly confuse by putting way have forgotten have happened since went to sea did not want to go again became minister instead missionary well be jiggered said gray be corker of yarn be married when be seaman replied ruddle met wife soon after became second present self remarkable story so interested that got married be interesting be do mean to say that remember nothing of sea must go aloft for instance mr ruddle looked up aloft shivered oh must said very look of complicated apparatus with must have be once only too familiar fill with peculiar horror well be damned said gray what be opposite point of compass to sou ' east by sou ' half sou ' southerly give up tell said minister simply gray shook head surprise sir can tell when there be mighty strong likelihood of bad weather comin ' along be not at bad at guessing when be likely to rain said former mate modestly be never caught in shower without umbrella gray shook head again confided to sea air that ruddle be red wonder if know more about weather than that be going to have fine chance to learn mr ruddle said skipper smell howling gale be double distilled dutchman if come out of east like rampin ' ragin ' snortin ' devil call sailor reddest kind of sojer there be many sign of fall of glass be only one swell have be coming in from south east now began to come more from north whole of horizon be in kind of smoke wind have fallen so light now began to puff little though be no more than breeze that man t'gallanbe'ls must look at comfortably there be odd sigh in wind sigh have rising tendency to become wail before long must be wailing mistake for sound be real voice of hurricane foretell skipper looked up to windward spoke to mate mr dixon think have better snug down bit before get dark so clew up t'gallanbe'ls then will take mainsail off after that can reef foresail while breeze hold in east will make can reckon will be hove to by morning there be much doubt of to who knew something of cape weather cape pigeon a wheeled whistled about ocean wave said up clew down at anyrate crew for'ard said so a turned out to shorten sail mr ruddle went below to encourage companion wife by time be a dark a bottom of tar barrel wanted encouragement for wave began to pitch in manner that nantucket have not accustomed to a wind increased song of gale in rigging got on nerve sadly what do think of brother ruddle asked friend chadwick little butter tub of man with courage of lion among heathen denizen of new york slum without a much spirit when wind blew a must enable school girl to face cow in lane what doe brother ruddle think of ruddle said that did not think much of for thought skipper be not frightened although sea threatens to rage friend said chief show sign of unseemly terror with calm confidence bid brave crew haste up aloft reduce mighty spread of canvas be even now engaged in task hear with what strange music somehow begin to have familiar ring in ear encourage other in arduous duty oh friend little think when be safe in heart of africa in back part of bowery how seaman encounter danger on behalf ah be sailor once tom said wife praise dear in praising for now dare not face danger with at one time must have be familiar be wonderful life be wonderful if have not be smitten upon head by shearpole shearpole may be might never have known of dear friend might never have married dear ah be wonderful world be making very remarkable noise upstairs certainly be making noise so be wind mr dixon be saying very unorthodox thing so be smith second mate now again skipper must be heard in exhortation so susan ruddle snugged up alongside husband said that be glad be not seaman though be sure that if be one now must never employ such language ruddle comforted said must fill with horror to know that have ever used of kind of talk felt sure in mind that report of having ever done so must have be malicious invention of enemy since have borne up for church have be a men knew of scrupulousness be extra puritanical even for minister never said 'damn unless have to in course of duty presently ocean wave began to behave little better under shortened canvas old skipper came into cabin with face shining with spray good natured grin on must have encouraged biggest coward at sea in cyclone little mr ruddle cheered up on sight of so did reverend mr blithers who be in state of terror be sheer lunacy be great storm be going down asked blithers be so far encouraged that must speak bless heart replied skipper what be thinking of in nice breeze like in sailin ship too if be in old smokestack like one took gent out of might howl here be in fine tight ship real genuine article be deal safer than if be ashore oh do say so asked blithers oh be possible that can say so with wind howling like indeed gale began to pipe a if meant business hold tongue blithers said ruddle be man missionary howl blithers said brother be unkind ought to be more gentle with weak vessel at that skipper put in oar suggested that so weak vessel must not carry sail retire to cabin at ruddle laughed jovially blithers said be hard cruel devoid of real religious feeling be fool dear man said ruddle go to bed be perhaps natural to be upset by strange uproar noise of wind trampling of men on deck be reason why must say be not religious if be not must be angry with say regrettable thing such a be informed on very good authority said when be seaman believe ever be one said sad angry blithers if be be pity did not stay one for be very unkind man not good to in sad state of mind took five missionary to get blithers into bed went at last when be gone ruddle beamed on rest said poor brother be sadly upset by weather be difficult to understand how can be such coward on water when be real hero on dry land have especial gift of management with backsliding cannibal anything can be believed when remember be once in position of mr dixon whose voice now hear saying something about lee brace knew about everything on board ship now friend thing here be mystery to know what lee brace be can not distinguish with accuracy between binnacle bull whanger if indeed there be such thing a be told by one of seaman on nantucket ah hold tight dear be rocking to fro with ever increasing velocity fear that blithers will never forget night have supper 'old man ' sat out with put on oilskin again went on poop there be mistake about now ocean wave be in for cape stinger gray who be of old fashioned bull headed sort rammed along on very path cyclonic disturbance be taking if have be thoroughly acquainted with nature of cyclone wherever be bred must have turned tail to blast have run into fairer weather towards south a wave be in southern semi circle of storm might have hove to on coming up starboard tack instead of that hung on through night when dawn came be fair howler mistake mr blithers not few of others stayed in bunk be blowing hard enough to make almost anyone ill sea be very high thomas ruddle wife chadwick turned out to breakfast if ruddle trusted to providence susan ruddle trusted to hardly thought possible that disaster must happen to while be to fore mr chadwick be brave enough to hide terror though be in horrid funk hung on to table ate breakfast a best must after eating ruddle mr ruddle chadwick ventured on deck in time to see reefed foresail taken off just a got weather clew garnet chock up gale came screaming across waste of grey sea to tune that skipper altered mind there then hold on with lee gear of foresail mr dixon bellowed then signed to mate to come aft will wear now heave to on starboard tack said 'old man ' be going to be fair perisher a dixon have be throwing out hint night that ought to do run be glad to hear waited for smooth put helm up square after yard roared skipper squared away keeping sail lifting be wonderful said ruddle do wish understood wonder what be doing for square foreyard yelled captain did so got staysail sheet over by proper management came up on other tack with nose pointing nne hauled up what be now weather clew of foresail second mate men jumped aloft furled oh dear said mr ruddle how dreadful to see up there ca believe that ever did chadwick wave be carrying topsail though be reefed be scooting with lee rail awash a soon a foresail be stowed topsail halliard be let go sail partly smothered by spilling line when be furled lower foretopsail be clewed up ruddle who got much excited went down on main deck in spite of sea came over right for'ard by galley mr ruddle said 'oh ruddle said bey dear be so interesting must ' there be staring up at crowd on topsail yard who be fighting bellying canvas like hero bless soul how very remarkable even terrible said ruddle how very extraordinary wonder if ever did that will ask mr dixon if manoeuvre be often performed fell upon busy very cross mate with inquiry though dixon have heard tale about did not credit put down to hallucination do do often do what often asked dixon scornfully why tie sail up like when blow so hard asked ruddle innocently why tie up when be fine must be much easier must think oh go home die said mate savagely be very rude said ruddle like if like can lump said mate have more sense than to come worrying here in gale of wind be real gale asked ruddle very hard one certainly looked like one for squall came harder harder so that topsail when be once smothered be blown out of men grip be abroad bellying once more damn eye hold on to will lose sail after yelled dixon one heard on yard be at grip with canvas again second mate bobeon at bunt be doing cursing be necessary for task like seem to be working very courageously think wrong of to swear at said ruddle severely then dixon turned on a if be going to hit at moment fresh squall struck wave almost laid on beam end though be practically hove to under lower maintopsail never swear said ruddle a mate lifted fist then squall shrieked a wave laid over to ruddle mate lost footing slid between fo'castle fore part of deck house a if be on ice toboggan run mate said awful thing ruddle gasped 'you must oh really must ' then fetched up against lee rail with thump caused common accident wrought very uncommon miracle mr dixon snapped arm like carrot let yell out of reached crowd on yard by crime said men up aloft when old dickie squeal like that mean comin ' aloft to talk to hus like father now then boy grab again 'old 'er a tackled topsail for third time cook came out of lee door of galley picked mate out of swamped scupper easy easy swab said dixon arm broke with cook help got aft when did promptly sat down in cabin fainted right off with pain ruddle still wallowed in scupper for have hit rail with head given most tremendous effectual thump after minute two stirred spat out mouthful of salt water also shook head rubbed then sat up said well be damned what have happened shook head again suddenly jumped to foot miracle happened heard tom ruddle in old day have very finest foretopsail yard ahoy voice that ever rang across waste of ocean came back to now ai dog got that topsail stowed yet roared in accent made second mate on yard shake in rubber boot oh slabsided gang of loafer oh sojers

suddenly become seaman use such language be enough to scare into loosing jack stay tumbling overboard said what be gone wrong with second greaser be just a much surprised a of so much so indeed that must not swear ruddle did for language be awful full abundant brilliant biting told second mate what thought of what thought of relation confided to storm what opinion of crew be always have be of sudden made bound jumping on rail ran up rigging like monkey before must gasp be right in among at bunt exhorting a if be impenitent mule now now up with sailor roared a long black coat flapped in wind like irish pennant dug into bellying canvas with clutch of devil claw crew sighed be subdued to strange fact did a told like best there be now sudden scream from aft mr ruddle caught sight of on yard chadwick cried out oh be husband be swearing so oh tom tom screamed wife come down come down screamed again ruddle heard swore vigorously what be woman doin ' on deck in such weather cried a clawed at sail held with stomach yelled in unison with second mate who now began to see joke of where doe think be said at moment last great fold of top sail rose in air like breaking wave with one yell of triumph whole of crowd threw on smothered life out sock to roared ruddle triumphantly a dropped gathered bunt into skin of sail reached for bunt gasket there be said ruddle then for first time looked at second mate expression of blankest amazement passed across face who devil be asked never saw before be almost impossible to make one heard in howl of gale ruddle did crowd with grin on
