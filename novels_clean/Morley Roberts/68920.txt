'but portland be not dull 'even find so ' said consul 'but of course be to keep here be nearly ready for sea ' will be in three day 'and crew ' so far have got ' sedgwick shook head 'd rather die than let go like how in thunder have kept ticehurst explained wonderful theory `` ve really tried to make comfortable have treated like men give earn while be in port what be to do ' `` ll think of ' said sedgwick thought to purpose for be commonly stated in portland that many master of merchant ship paid boarding house master to induce men to desert when amount of wage due to from ship be more than 'blood money ' have to be paid for new crew think that be line said sedgwick got reporter to go interview mr healy healy being more than half sea over in high delight at having held up ticehurst oriana let go 'curse lot of 'em said healy 'they talk a if boarding house master be necessary scoundrel ay do there be lying in willammette now a have come to winking eye saying now mr healy how much do want to take crew out of ship why have done a low a ten dollar head have have hundred head for putting new crowd in then be be money in pocket of ship owner captain a stand to reason must be if ship owed men more than hundred ten dollar besides saving grub for time when men be doing little ' ticehurst did do ' healy smiled be incautious 'to be sure did must if paid if 'd come in here after long voyage instead of short passage out from liverpool 'd have be in back room with dollar next day be in paper sedgwick smiled ran down to see ticehurst whose ship be lying in stream with united state marshal in charge of to see men stayed on board be not taken off by healy pirate multnomah county official to see that ticehurst stayed more le in sight 'now said ticehurst 'have got ' 'you can try ' said sedgwick so ticehurst filed complaint in united state circuit court in ' damage suit ' against healy laying damage at ten thousand dollar will make sick ' said sedgwick did healy fairly howled by way of immediate revenge sent one of ruffian to catch reporter who have caught beock to good joe ' said healy ' leave feather to fly with stamp on right hand kick rib in will teach to come down here with pencil note book lay trap for inoffending citizen so will ' joe went off to 'do up ' reporter a happened be unlucky for joe reporter be man of hand not at unsuspecting person be joe who went to hospital not man with pencil note book nevertheless a understood how thing shaped in oregon in pacific port generally particular reporter thought healthy to go elsewhere what joe have failed in jack might do healy have very long memory a many injured men must tell 'what like about oregon be climate general uncertainty said ticehurst 'it make feel young again of course sha push libel suit sedgwick ' do will be like vanderdecken when be finished ' said sedgwick 'to try to beat to westward of cape horn of law here will make ancient flying dutchman of 'd try to get to sea ' `` m going to

night sat in hall of hotel denounced healy with much severity `` ll stay till get scalp ' said ticehurst if meant what said be odd that reckoned up what owed hotel put requisite amount of dollar in

ticehurst prescription be getting on nerve skipped from portland last night believe to be on board ' said marshal can look ' said williams shortly if a be probable knew that ticehurst be not in portland also knew be not on board oriana most careful search failed to find 'why take alongside discharge wheat said gregg savagely 'perhaps be under two thousand ton of ' second mate be almost a cross a williams a said afterwards way marshal acted full sized english skipper might be concealed in sextant case at last intruder gave up went ashore 'you need trouble to come on board again said williams `` m skipper now will take to sea if be true be odd that ticehurst be not to be found in astoria have disappeared united state marshal who be still on board oriana laughed for have great sympathy with state official of oregon ' guess skipper have head opined a lounged against rail ejected tobacco juice into blue grey water of great columbia river where be wo give away ' even williams did not know went to sea next morning be towed across bar by tug comet oregon people came on board again made search 'oh come to sea with ' said williams with savage eye have notion that if did there must be part of crew captain ticehurst must leave at mercy ' get rowdy young fellow ' said marshal 'it waste of natural energy better used in learning how to be civil to superior 'but be licked ' said williams be fairly licked ' be game ' said state marshal philosophically a went over side with united state rival 'and if won always must get swelled head ' looked up from boat called ' said williams 'if be licked own where be captain `` ll send word from europe ' said williams a matter of fact sent word by skipper of tug for be captain ticehurst who steered old comet over bar with oriana behind 'now what want to know be said captain to mate 'what want to know be whether be better to treat men a men best crowd in portland ' williams looked melancholy 'well sir may be on pinch owned 'but be
