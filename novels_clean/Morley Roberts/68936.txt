noon helen came to of course tom ca do something said with tear in eye first time ever saw there though not last be horrible to think of drinking way then before two girl be ashamed of of ca do anything what can do helen asked ca take from ca stave liquor there be too much of besides be captain if be brother ca go against ca try persuade tom caught arm looked at so sorrowfully have done helen answered do think have seen going to hell two year without speaking what good be what good be turned away sat down by elsie fanny while just underneath in saloon will be singing old song about pas bottle round did too come round quick at party of one can see easily that if tell everything in way will never finish task until have pile of manuscript a big a log of three year voyage so will have to get on quickly just say what be necessary more now must say that by time be in love with elsie fleming in love a much a man can be in love with passion that trial only strengthened time must not can not destroy be wonder loved for be fairest sweetest maid ever saw with long golden hair bright blue eye that looked straight at one must be very soft too sometimes neat little figure made feel great strong brute be a clumsy a ox though be a quick yet to go aloft a young man if occasion called for mate to show men way when be little more than half across pacific to golden gate began to think that elsie liked more than did anyone else for must often talk to about past life in sunny new south wale shiver to think that father might insist on staying long time in british columbia for be going to take possession of farm left by old uncle near place called thomson fork be sweet to have near in first watch cursed quietly to myself when young jack harmer apprentice struck four bell for at ten o'clock always said good night mr ticehurst must go now how sleepy one doe get at sea dear how can keep eye open when went down seemed a if moon star went out when be old mackenzie first watch be almost fool enough to be jealous of being with then though have wife at home daughter just a old a elsie thought no more of woman a rule than hog doe of harmony a once heard american say still when lay awake heard step overhead for knew well be almost ready to get up then there make unutterable fool of myself by losing natural sleep now be coming to what must willingly leave out hope that people wo think badly of for share in for though be not always such straight walker in life a be yet must not do what evil minded folk might think did somehow have difficulty in putting down for though have spoken of sometimes sorrowfully enough to one who be very dear to yet to write coolly on paper seems cowardly treacherous yet seeing that can harm one knowing a do in heart be to blame must do do a kindly a can be what mean began to see that helen loved more than must have done that hated will bitterly elsie even worse be great surprise to for to tell truth woman a general rule have never taken to very much will be always one in family who have most to do with for part until saw elsie never really loved anyone although like most men have have few trouble until then thought love affair so be very hard to convince that what suspected be true even though believe have natural fitness for judging people seeing through even woman who folk say act from reason like men however think be much different for few of act reasonably have nothing to do with matter in hand now must confess although seems wicked be little pleased at first to think that two woman loved for be vain that certainly touch man vanity yet be sorry too for foresaw trouble unless be very careful though not woe pain came out of business before end first thing made suspect something be wrong be that helen almost ceased to keep will from bottle taunted bitterly so bitterly that if have not usually be good tempered fellow even when drunk might have turned nasty struck then must never leave elsie alone if must help although be not hypocrite enough to pretend to be very fond of indeed elsie said one night to that be afraid mr ticehurst did like laughed saw be true then whenever must helen came walked with hardly ever spoke seems to now when know that be in perpetual conflict be hardly in right mind must like to think that be not be in very difficult position a man will admit loved elsie dearly be convinced brother wife loved be four shut up on ship board think if have be on land must have spoken to elsie run away from others here must not speak without telling more than desired without being in position of lover might have caused trouble for even thought so suspicious doe man get helen might perhaps have come on board more on account than on will time be making very fair headway for have good breeze astern of island a call in san francisco be sandwich island be long way behind if have continued to have fine weather if will have kept sober even so drunk that must not have interfered in working ship thing might not have taken turn did what happened between malay who called matthias might never have occurred when look back on train of circumstance almost make believe in fate though must be unwilling to do for be taught by mother very intelligent woman who read great deal of theology that men have free will can do a please however when be nearing western coast of america will who have great notion much greater one than have by way of navigation began to come up day take observation with until at last weather altered so for worse came on to blow so hard that of must take more now if will drank enough heaven know in fine weather drank deal harder in foul though by getting excited did have usual effect on kept about without going to sleep just where sat lay down so be always on

reckoning a well a must make out be heading straight for coast good bit to nor'ard of true course besides be good fifty mile farther east than will made out according to figure said a much to laughed scornfully be captain of ship said tom interfere if have mind to knock mendocino county into middle of next week will do have be running just right see when be in state be very hard man to work with if differed in figure have often enough big job to convince that be wrong being wrong even second in longitude mean being sixty mile out with only dead reckoning to rely on must have be feeling way cautiously toward coast seeing that in case might fetch up on farallon island lie twenty mile west of golden gate on sixth day of weather began to clear up little in morning watch there seemed

through past farallones without seeing when came down woman cried out at sight of for though controlled must be impossible so sudden be shock to hide felt just then vancouver be coming into wind men be at lee brace a dived suddenly into head sea pitch be tremendous seemed to woman that something must be wrong while will who seaman like knew what have happened though mad with drink rushed on deck with fierce oath dropped chart ran after yet stayed moment will be right said to woman ca tell now followed will who have got hold of old mackenzie by throat while poor fellow looked thunderstruck what devil be doing screamed why keep course man weather brace dog put helm up one stirred while tom mackenzie seeing there took will by wrist threw away from caught a fell roaring mutiny mutiny be

forward to where mackenzie be standing grasped will by arm have never given credit for strength showed then be mad mad drunk be not till walker matthias for hand be on deck by time came to help that secured in struggle will drew back foot kicked malay in face a rose with evilest look ever saw on man countenance drew knife instinctively with left hand caught wrist nearly broke while knife flew out of hand then even by simple action saw that have made enemy of man whom up to time have always be kind to treated with far more consideration than must have got from rough old mac be only by way though be important enough to story have to tie will hand time foamed at mouth ordering crew to assist will have hung dog of shrieked while three woman stood on companion ladder white trembling with fear be with great trouble that got below when be there shut in berth sent two steward in with to see that neither did harm got free then turned attention to saving ship life be in awfully critical situation one in ordinary circumstance might have made man heart quail now with woman loved on board be maddening to think of made curse brother who have brought into think of what be not five mile on lee bow there be land must even distinguish a lifted on sea cruel line of white breaker seemed to run nearly abeam for vancouver be not very weatherly ship gale instead of breaking increased until if have dared must have ordered sail to be shortened went to chart again just a took mackenzie called to mr ticehurst there be big flat topped mountain way inland think must be table mountain yes knew coast even a looked at chart heard order helm to be put up saw why for when have hauled into wind be heading dead for great four fathom bank that lie off bonita point there be channel between land ran on deck spoke to mackenzie pointed out on starboard hand there water be breaking on bank be running for narrow channel under considerable press of canvas seeing how blew for mac relieved of when first put into wind be main top gallant sail now must hing for moment try to get sight of landmark keep sight of for weather be still thick fortunately a might have seemed for chain cable have already be ranged fore aft on deck told mackenzie to see bent on to anchor stopper made ready yet knew that if have to anchor be lost in such gale must only postpone fate for must come home part to dead certainty mackenzie stood together on poop watching anxiously for right moment to haul wind again what do think of mr mackenzie said a clung on to weather backstay where do think will be in hour think will ever see whitechapel again sir answered quietly knew be thinking of home of wife daughter will go to leeward like butter cask in sea now look at land pointed toward line of breaker on land came nearer nearer waited yet few minute then looked at mackenzie inquiringly yes think so sir said with hand motioned men at wheel to put helm down again a came into wind upper foretopsail blew out of boltropes while vessel struggled like beaten hound be being dragged to execution shivered from stem to stern for wave be running what landsman call mountain high now shipped sea moment came in flood over fo cbele head pouring down through scuttle cover of have be washed overboard sent men chest adrift in fo cbele washed blanket out of lower bunk to windward roar of breaker on bank be deafening

other again on earth two sister be not in saloon stepped toward berth helen met rising up from deck where have be crouching down in terror have said be beautiful so be when smiled pleasant light fell about like sunlight on strange rare tropical flower showing rosy complexion delicate skin of full blooded olive coil of dark shining hair never saw so beautiful a be then clothed strangely with fear of death white with passion might have made weaker woman crimson with shame fiercely triumphant with bitter self conquest caught by arm tom dear tom said in wonderful voice came to clearly through howl of wind know there be not hope for pointed toward husband cabin have ruined hate tom now be over will not live say good by to say good by stood thunderstruck motionless for knew what meant even before put up hand took round neck kiss once just once will die for now must not live must not kiss did kiss why know not whether out of pity be not love no not love of kind swear from strong constraint of force of mind can not say a lifted head from hers saw elsie woman did love looking at with shame at fall a thought with scorn freed from helen who sank down on knee without seeing that have be observed went toward elsie too be pale though not with fear for perhaps be ignorant of danger a thought with little feeling of triumph even then for be strange being with jealousy anger be coward traitor said when reached be not elsie answered sharply perhaps will never know that be speaking truth let that be be brave woman for where be father with fanny answered disdainfully even then called came out mr fleming said know position in few minute will be safe ashore get daughter dressed warmly stay at foot of companion with if be necessary come up when call old man shook hand with pointed to will be wife have forgotten look after too said went to will be cabin be fast asleep snoring hard must hardly keep from striking let lie be wonder that woman ceased to love went on deck have not be absent five minute in time wind have increased even more sea seemed to have grown heavier deck be full of water fatal wake be yet broader on weather quarter men be aft under break of poop most of thinking that must go ashore have taken off oilskin sea boot ready for effort to save at last even in state of mind be in then saw clearly strange picture presented wet through with hat on up to knee in water for deck must not clear though of main deck port be stove in out in bulwark remains vividly with now among stood matthias with red handkerchief over head swelled cheek where will have struck by side be walker only man in crowd who seemed cheerful actually smiled perhaps be what scotch called fey suddenly mackenzie called loudly look sir look there be point last of land be bonita point if know coast at sprang into weather mizzen rigging men who have noticed second mate gesture did same at main must see point knew knew if must only weather must put helm up run into san francisco in safety just then harmer who be a cool a cucumber struck four bell matthias man called thompson old one eyed sailor came up to relieve wheel point have to weather be about a far from a land dead to leeward be touch go whether must clear not vancouver made such leeway closehauled that seemed doubtful fancied must have better chance if freed little to let go through water faster yet be ticklish point one not to be decided without thought in situation demanded instant action what think mac said hurriedly will ease point nodded spoke to men at wheel a did so noticed malay face be ghastly with fear although seemed steady enough thought best to alter way stood for englishman have lee wheel ordered to change place what be for sir said matthias almost disrespectfully stared at do a be told dog answered roughly for have time to be polite like steering have noticed before when course be altered got much more way on neared land yet more rapidly called men on to poop for have long before determined not to chance anchor looked down into saloon to see if woman be there a did so mr fleming called if can be of use mr ticehurst be ready think not mr fleming replied a cheerfully a possible will be out of danger in few minute on rock added to myself a closed hatch be breathless awful time confess that for few moment forgot very existence of elsie a calculated over over again chance a neared point depended on hair when looked at mackenzie who be silent gloomy feared worst yet show how strangely one can be affected by one fellow that when saw harmer walker standing side by side almost cheerful face made hope smiled be within three cable length of point roar of breaker came up against wind until deafened watched men at wheel saw matthias flinch visibly a though have be struck by whip did know why be be not good at such thing took deeper dislike to that moment than have ever have stepped up to now in what followed perhaps be to blame yet feel must not have acted differently perhaps looked threatening at a approached at rate let go wheel fell back on grating with angry oath jumped into place struck with heel then saw walker make tremendous spring for with expression of alarm in face a looked beyond that made make half turn movement saved life felt knife of matthias enter shoulder like red hot iron then be wrenched out of hand out of wound by walker in moment two be locked together in be separated by mackenzie others walker stood smiling with knife in hand although blood be running down body did not feel faint kept eye fixed on course kept by vancouver while mackenzie held in arm harmer took lee wheel from luff little cried for be almost on point saw rock nearly dead ahead luff little put helm down on spoke two moment crawled by coast crawled nearer nearer a began to feel be going blind fainting clung to life vision desperately last saw be what can see now will always see a plainly high black point with ring of white water crawl aft yet nearer aft to foremast aft to mainmast then fell knew more for be saved when came to be before wind lay on mattress in cabin near be elsie by helen who be a white a death be watching when opened eye helen fell on knee suddenly went crimson then white again fainted elsie looked harder sterner than have ever seen turned face away near saw mattress with covered figure on figure of dead man for knew shape in state of faintness strange horrible delirium took possession of seemed a if what saw be seen only by that be prophecy of death fainted again when came to be at anchor in san francisco bay doctor from shore be attending to while mackenzie stood by smiling rubbing hand a if delighted to get off looked at knelt down by mackenzie old man whispered did see somebody dead here aye poor chap answered brushing away tear be poor walker walker said how be accident sir said old mac just a rounded point fainted old bark gave heavy roll a put before wind walker a be standing with black dog knife in hand slipped fell blade entered body said after be 'it be knife after threatened to do for yesterday ' where will asked when ended for be somehow anxious to save brother credit must have liked to see dismissed from ship be on deck now a busy a devil in gale of wind growled mackenzie 't be saved ship oh be mighty man sail with more however altered mind about now have taken long time to get to point perhaps if have be better navigator in water of story telling might have done just what will did do have missed trouble of beating to windward to get round to part of story might have put in few word perhaps then like people to understand what be about seems to necessary if be dare say someone will tell one of day at rate here have got into san francisco city like by way for be rascally place managed by professional politician who be worst men in have be badly wounded malay be in prison not having money be likely to stay there be in hospital for three week never have more miserable lonely time if have not be stronger in constitution than most men think must have died so much be worried by love for elsie who be going away thinking scoundrel who have tried to gain love of brother wife of course did not come near though knew fleming be still in city learnt so much from will who have grace to come see thanking too for having saved vancouver must get well soon tom said

prophetic ever heard on man lip saw how vain be turned away shook hand went without saying more than good by tom saw twice after just twice by time be out of hospital vancouver be ready to go to sea being bound to england might have sailed even then only be necessary for tom mackenzie one two others to remain a witness when tried matthias for stabbing will not go into long description of trial for have read in book of late so many trial scene fear must not have patience to give detail after be not necessary since whole affair be so simple yet what followed afterward from that affair can remember a brightly distinctly a if in glass look of dingy court fierce revengeful eye of matthias who never spoke till last appearance of helen fanny elsie be not there when judge after verdict inflicted sentence of eighteen month hard labor on prisoner perhaps have be in prison before knew what meant be simply bitter thought of revengeful oriental at being worsted by opponent when heard sentence leant forward grasped rail in front of tightly spoke skin be dark yet pallid perspiration stood in bead on forehead bit lip until blood came while eye looked more like eye of human beast than of man be what said a looked at spoke with strange intensity hushed noise when come out of jail will track night day wherever go do to escape though think know where be will always be seeking for at last will find if curse of mine must touch must rot wither now time will come when hand will strike down such be meaning of what said although be not put exactly a have here written down if confess a must have to do at last before end of story come that word way be spoken spoken so vehemently with so fixed resolution made shiver feel afraid in way have never done before hope nobody will blame be sure that being in love make coward of man in many way in one moment saw robbed of life love just at fruition beheld clasping elsie to bosom having won from at last avowal of love then stabbed shot in arm ah be dreadful number of fashion mind went to work in quick fever of black apprehension to foretell foresee own possible doom have never thought cowardly then seemed to see what death meant better than have ever done often coward be what be a think now from vivid imagination so many of lack went out of court in strange whirl for see have only just recovered if have be quite well might have laughed instead of feeling a did did not laugh then now on next morning vancouver be to leave harbor being then at anchor off goat island money be due to have taken for will have given discharge sent home for what have saved being quite uncertain what must do if followed elsie to british columbia night saw last of will last ever saw little thinking then how fate mine be bound up together what be

drink a demanded more liquor hear said hurriedly hear man who be husband what fool be know be be wife ah must kill must must be horrified to see passion be in seemed to have touch of real male fury in just a when man be trying to control feeling that if one more provocation be given will commit murder for shook shivered voice be strangely altered just then will came back demanding with oath if be ready to go never spoke must have be sorry to have woman look at a did at when eye be off shook hand with with for last time went away next morning being lonely having nothing to do went out to park made on great sand dune run from higher city to ocean beach cliff house on south side of golden gate for sake of quiet think went out by car walked to place where few ever came chance visitor except

be very curious perhaps more pleasing to fanny than to bunk be upper one through open porthole must look out on to wharf a lay there in much happier frame of mind than have known for many day stared out carelessly watching men at work passer by suddenly to great astonishment saw young harmer looking very miserable unhappy have left vancouver too of course without leave a be apprentice now if be surprised be angry too be such foolish trick thought must give talking to at once spoke through port infernal young fool said what be doing here why did leave ship if ever saw bewildered face be

get dunnage on board away went harmer come back cried only turned nodded cheerfully disappeared in crowd on whole although appearance of harmer added new responsibility to be already sufficient burden be not ill pleased for thoroughly liked have parted with very unwillingly when shook hand on board vancouver for last time a thought then at rate must be companion for if by having to look after be prevented in measure from becoming selfish about elsie might thank boyish foolishness in being unable to prevent running after fanny whom to say truth considered little flirt though dear little girl then harmer might be able to help with elsie be something to have somebody about must trust in case of accident be nearer eleven than ten when steamer whistle shrieked for last time crew began to haul warp on board must see that elsie fanny be beginning to think that father must arrive too late when saw coming along wharf with harmer just behind up to time really believed mr fleming with curious innocence that father often show even who from antecedent character might be expected to know better have never thought of a being daughter lover when have joined daughter on hurricane deck caught sight of harmer standing on main saw in moment that knew almost a much a must tell that for few second be doubtful whether to laugh to be angry saw look at sternly for few second then shook head with very mixed smile on weather beaten face sitting down on nearest beach burst into laughter went up poop ladder caught fanny word why father what be matter with laugh so people will think crazy so be dear clean crazy answered because fancied saw tom ticehurst young harmer down on deck there of course be impossible know that quite impossible be hallucination for what must want here must like to know know of course well well be surprised just then came up showed looking quite easy though confess to feeling more like fool than remember doing since be boy oh then be here ticehurst said old man be vision after be just telling fanny here that thought be going off head laughed why mr fleming said be impossible that too must go to victoria on way to alaska fleming looked at curiously almost winked ah alaska to be sure said did speak of alaska must be nice place will be quite close to come over give call thank for invitation replied laughing will come to tea bring young friend with for harmer now walked up shook hand with old man in most ordinary way sat down between fanny with coolness must not have imitated for life be strange thing to think of amount of impudence boy have from seventeen to twenty three so will do thing man of thirty must almost faint to attempt succeed because know risk run harmer be soon engaged in talk with fanny tried in vain to imitate found elsie a cold a ice must make impression on be almost in despair at very outset if fanny have told truth in morning then elsie held great command over soon gave up attack retreated to berth where smoked savagely be miserable can see did not understand much about woman then passage from san francisco to victoria take about four day in time have to make up mind what be going to do if what fanny said be true elsie loved be only that foolish wretched affair with helen stood in way yet must tell girl how matter be seemed to then seems to now be bound in honor not to tell must not say to brutally that brother wife have made love to be wholly blameless must be cowardly yet ought to clear be awkward dilemma then again be quite possible that fanny be mistaken if did not care for be harder must not court with mark against yet be determined to win a sat in berth grew fierce savage in heart swore must gain must force to love if have to kill who stood in way for love make man devilish sometimes a well a good have come on board saying if see chance to win before get to victoria will let go now when be just outside golden gate swore to follow always yes even if spurns if mock taunt will make come to at last put arm round neck ask forgiveness said unconsciously added will follow night day in sunshine in rain in health sickness then started violently for be using word like of malay who be waiting time to follow for ever in daytime nighttime knew be whetting keen edge of hate must see in cell must imagine recalling face to mind for knew what such men be have served a second mate in vessel have be manned with oriental off scouring of singapore such a matthias be knew only too well must follow even a followed a be light before must be dark shadow behind wished then that have killed on board vancouver for felt that must one day meet who must discern what meeting must bring forth in life know that from time forward never left for in hour vowed to follow elsie until loved saw very clearly that must keep word though have strength to crawl after kill a slept henceforth be always more le in mind yet if must win first did not care might be race between love might be shield to protect in hour of need prayed that might be so if must not then at least let win love before end for two day kept out of fleming way rather out of way of girl for mr fleming must not be avoided a slept in men berth in bunk close to mine believe that first day on board spoke to elsie about indeed know did for heard so afterward think be only on assurance that there be must be nothing between that endured situation so easily in first place although be not rich be fairly well off in australia though british columbian ranch property be not equal in value to have made for yet represented sum of money such a must not scarcely make in many year in hard time must hardly be human nature for father to look upon a right sort of man for daughter especially since be such fool a to quit sea without anything definite awaiting on land so say that if have thought that elsie loved might have found disagreeable companion be consolation to to see that treated in sort of half contemptuous half pitying way for must rather have seen like one of lizard on australian plain such a girl have told of erect spiny frill over head swell out whole length of body until natural ugliness becomes very horror scare anything have curiosity rashness to approach threaten be going to do in alaska british columbia tom said to one day do think of farming seal hunting gold mining what must like to hear plan if have then went on without waiting for answer showing plainly that thought that have none be fool that young idiot harmer why did stick to ship because will never stick to anything mr fleming answered though be clever young fellow fit for other thing than sailoring if be judge a for think be yet when make up mind to thing usually do usually succeed then said with hard smile be well to have belief in one own strength ability sometimes others have strength a well then then answered be very often question of will smiled again dropped subject on third day out from san francisco when be running along coast of oregon found at last opportunity of speaking to elsie first went to fanny fanny dear girl want to speak to few minute sat down beside think know fanny why be here asked be tolerably obvious mr ticehurst answered rather gravely thought yes suppose be first want to be sure whether be right about what told on morning left san francisco be silent looked at seemed trifle distressed well tom thought be answered at length still think be yet know see elsie be strange girl never confides in anyone since dear mother died must never confess anything to still have eye in head ear too since have be with have be harder colder than ever saw in life have said enough to make think that there be something know nothing about make so know joked about yesterday got so angry of sudden like pouring kerosene on fire said be coward when asked why turned white must answer then said of course must be coward if said so did think have right to say think when have saved life by coolness courage then know got angry cried because like very much just a much a do brother on station at home said be cruel beast kind of horrid thing until must think of anything making face at just a did when be child be having quarrel now be about ought to be proud fanny looked up half laughing half cry for dearly loved a knew well dear little sister fanny said for will be sister one day there be something make think ill of be not fault a far a can see ca convince of except by showing be not man think unless accident put back into place once believed held in thought want to speak to must do to day to morrow will be in victoria must not like to part with without speaking if talk with now will probably take time so want if can to prevent anyone interrupting fanny nodded wiped away tear in quick manner just a if be fly very well will know trust if elsie doe went over to harmer who be in fidget kept looking at a if be wondering what meant by talking so confidentially to fanny found elsie sitting by just forward of funnel be reading though when spoke answered put book down in lap kept looking at in nervous way a if wished have not interrupted have be talking minute before seemed to wholly forget that be there spoke without thought of what be going to say miss fleming see call that though little while ago be elsie have determined to speak to in spite of way avoid must rather did not mr ticehurst said have come to time when must do a think fit even if be rude rough have something to say mean to say miss fleming if word in rough broken fashion if stumble over stammer with tongue will know why just a know why be here come now why be on steamer remained mute with head bent down gold of hair loose over eye so must not see trembled little be ripping one of page of book took hold of put down made remonstrance began to feel have power over though how far went must not tell why be here went on scornfully oh on pleasure trip to see advertised coast from san francisco to sitka to behold mount elia glacier by heaven think have ice nearer at hand oh be business wish to gain wealth so give up what understand go into what be a familiar to a sextant be to savage ca be business do know what be miss fleming look think there be girl who knew once be kind bright girl who be joyous whom called by christian name who walked by side in moonlight when sail be silvered shadow dark when kept first watch in vancouver wonder what have become of that girl must have known stopped be still stubborn did not move went on again there must be evil spirit on sea fly like petrel in storm come on board ship enter into heart of find there why fear mr ticehurst interrupted that think fool if be not then talk be vain if be surely be not fit to mate with let cease to talk about for be useless be almost choking with passion be so hard to be misconceived even though have so much reason on side yet since knew be wrong almost wished to shake said at last will not go until have understanding one way other have be beating about bush will do no longer know that love drew up how many can love at time mr ticehurst said one only one replied be utterly mistaken be not mistaken said think be coward traitor if be not might love a be such thing be impossible caught by wrist instinctively tried to free finding must not looked up when caught eye indignant remonstrance died on lip look elsie what can do perhaps can not defend there be situation where man can not for sake of others can say more about will make see be wrong if not by proof by showing what be man incapable of what think in end will make love paused for moment did not move have listened to elsie can see what mean can think whether will falter swerve now ask for be assured do love that did whether will not trust now for can not believe must speak a do if have done what think looked at elsie be very pale must see have moved have shaken conviction that be at war with herself got up went to side then turned beckoning to to look over to seaward with came almost like woman walking in sleep took place by side did so to avoid notice for feared to attract attention indeed saw two passenger looking at curiously one of whom smiled so that began to wish to throw overboard yet think a matter of fact did wrong in allowing to move broke influence held over in measure for have often noticed since to obtain control of people one must keep steadily insisting on one point never allow to go beyond even to think beyond then to do so one must be stronger than be will lose control over a did so make error in judgment elsie said quietly be not going to answer be not worth now up to moment have taken away from past in emotion have almost forgotten helen be just wavering be on point of giving in to yet by last suggestion of mine brought back to must see in mind darker depth of fear distrust of what rightly judged hatred jealousy of helen though think know much of character yet in state of mind be in then seemed to see mind a much more subtle man might have done own error must have cursed own folly have taken book again be holding open in hand until spoke held so lightly that shook wavered caught in hand shut suddenly a though be book of heart have be reading denied right to do turned toward cold once more though by strange influence caught thought be closed book mr ticehurst be book of past be gone for ever dropped over side with mocking smile caught hold of hand held ah said then begin again if past be dead present life future be yet unborn mean one thing now mean other in future will mean same remember what say elsie remember for unless be dead will be acknowledged lover husband at last dropped hand walked away when looked back saw her following with eye must have given much then to have be able to know of what thought went below slept for many hour sleep of exhaustion for though man may be a strong a lion physically excess of emotion take more from than most terrible physical toil next morning be in victoria have did seek opportunity of again speaking with elsie did talk for few moment with fanny told part of what occurred not much said a much be keeping something back tom think know reason why elsie wo have anything to do with do fanny replied there be nothing in at one of day will discover so said little dryly for so young girl elsie be little obstinate have seen horse must not jump gate may have to open yet tom may open of fanny horse may desire grass jump at last will never open shook hand with mr fleming took off hat to elsie said in low voice remember what said elsie for will never forget then turned away did not look back time a have done when parted in hotel yet such be curious state lover be in actually comforted that did not for if have said must have showed be callous cold perhaps though kept command over just for time failed at last must not let see when be gone harmer went ashore too a to boy be so desperately in love calf love have to cheer up way did make laugh now for have larger experience of boy men than have then never mind harmer said will get over in time see if turned round in blazing rage think if have not be for effect of old discipline be yet strong upon must have sworn at for although harmer looked a if butter must melt in mouth knew have very copious vocabulary of abuse at command such a one learns only too easily at sea what mr ticehurst said stammering get over never will want to what be more must if must be not kind of to say so think think what jack said thunderstruck at outburst when meant consolation that will get over first there now said triumphant with retort burst into laughter well well harmer did mean to vex must not quarrel now for jordan hard road to travel believe have got to make lot of money at least have if be going to do anything in country for be what yankee call tough place yes replied harmer now ashamed of of being angry heard one fellow say to on steamer goldarned feller from east think be going to get soft seat over here bet will have to rustle on pacific slope else git then turned to ' d 'ye hear that young feller have got to rustle right smart will get left jack laughed heartily trying to imitate accent of adviser found hard to disguise own pure english learnt in home far across sea wide stretch of american continent night stayed in victoria in rough hotel kept by two brother cornishman who invited to have drink on strength of being englishman though must never have suspected that be such so well did accent disguise truth from in morning two day

obstinacy have brought into trouble thing confess be not so forgiving a to forget though merciful enough not to remind of have taken three day to come up from columbia seemed barely possible under circumstance to retrace step in same time even although horse be not so much burdened there be not so much hard climbing to be done must see mac be bent on getting out traveled without more rest than be absolutely compelled to take on account of animal a for confess that though have traveled that same trail twice yet so greatly be altered by snow must have lost way in first mile for mountaineering knowledge of locality be thing not to be learnt in hurry must come by long custom by native instinct sorrowfully for be always loth to harm even noxious animal a long a leaf alone suggested to mac that must leave horse shook head who will carry provision then said do think can get to landing mac asked will be lucky answered with significant nod if get to other side of columbia tom think have let in for winter up here unless care about snow shoeing over other pas be fool say yes to if like be late when camped partner be in better spirit than have be at noon when held above conversation for have done by dint of forced marching quite a much a did in fine weather pony be very tired there be nothing for to eat next to nothing for grass be deeply buried gave dick little bread however poor animal be grateful for stood by night until at earliest dawn packed again with load be lighter by day food of two men heavier to by day hard toil starvation toward afternoon of that second day came to hardest part of whole trail for on crossing river be freezing cold have to climb side of opposing mountain mac pony traveled well though showed evident sign of fatigue be in much better case than mine who now again staggered sobbed audibly with long drawn breath drew mac attention to shook head must go on there be two way about marched off went behind dick pushed for while though tired yet be not sorry for what did even little assistance be such relief to poor wretched animal who from time be able to bear weight have be used by packer without rest peace a though be machine whose only hope of release be to die starved wounded saddle girth galled of slow starvation at last such be lot of pack horse though poor dick end be more merciful fellow have better fate to expect while life be perpetual round of ill usage hard work by about four o'clock in afternoon sky grew overcast light feathery flake of snow came at first slowly then faster turning what blue distance caught sight of to gray finally hiding dick by time be almost at standstill never thought be very tender hearted man never set up to be indeed if have be only stubborn might have thrashed in way folk must call cruel yet being compelled to urge for sake own confess heart bled to see suffering wretchedness having scarcely strength to lift foot properly have struck fetlock against many projecting stone root until blood ran down congealed on little hoof be growing tender a must see by way winced on rockier piece of trail than common rough coat be standing up staring like of broken haired terrier in spite of sweat ran down thin side heaving flank while now again stumbled with difficulty recovered when came to divide just a if have said that must do so much for stumbled again fell on level ground cutting knee deeply mac noise leaving pony standing came back to be done up poor devil said will go further what will do shook head for be not who arranged ordered thing when mac be about be silent for while there be nothing for said at last one thing must put other kieutan can stand on by time have got pack off dick lay down perfectly flat upon side with blood slowly oozing from knee flank still heaving from exertion have brought up hill to die on top of come on said mac a moved off with what meant to put on other pony at first must not go put hand in pocket took out piece of bread kneeling down by poor animal put to lip mumbled with teeth dropped out then in hat got water out of little pool offered to drank then fell back again took revolver from belt stroked soft nose once more putting weapon to head between eye ear fired shivered over stiffened little be still except for slow drip of blood ran out of ear from vein ball have divided then went on hope one will think weak if confess sight be not quite so clear a have be before if there be strange haziness about cruelly cold trail mountain side did not come from falling snow at camp night spoke little more than be absolutely necessary turned in a soon a have eaten supper drunk tin of coffee smoked couple of pipe fortunately for remaining horse in place have reached there be little feed few tussock of withering frost nipped bunch grass ate greedily to last root sharp teeth must reach then pawed rustled for more using hoof to bare what be hidden under snow for must have left on trail next morning toil suffering of third day march be dreadful for grew footsore foot bled at heel while skin rose in blister on toe rapidly became raw mac be man of iron never faltered grew tired example feeling of shame at being outdone by kept doggedly behind at few pace distance how pony stood day be miracle for must have be made of iron not flesh blood to carry pack while climbing up sliding down steep ascent slope of hill while few yard wind felled tree have to be clambered over almost a dog must do be always clammy with sweat seemed in better condition than on second day perhaps on account of grass have be able to get during night yet have have to work night to get while mac have slept in torpor of great exhaustion late in evening came to bank of columbia across stretched sandy flat belt of scrub until level ended lofty mountain rose once more covered with snow fringed with sullen cloud thousand of foot above where stood mac stopped looked anxiously across broad stream when saw faint curl of bluish smoke rising mile away in sunless air pointed to with more pleased expression have seen on face since have roused so hurriedly on snowy morning three day ago there be somebody over there at rate old man said almost cheerfully though know what thunder be doing here unless be montana bill come up trapping said be going to do if so what be doing down here ca trap here then asked well replied mac might be end of line still ought to be farther up in hill there be much to trap close down on flat see trapper usually have two camp walk line during day take out what be caught in night setting trap again sleeping

butter tub have be made by hunter winter before left there when went west in early spring before came up asked mac what have become of for be not where have left hauled up little way on piece of shingle tied to stump somebody took said more likely when water rose after crossed be carried away perhaps be in pacific by went down to stump found there remains of painter a have be broken violently not cut saw that last suggestion be probably correct sat down to supper by fire gleamed brightly in gathering darkness on surrounding snow water close beneath ate very vile bacon greasy mess of bean have cooked night before left mountain camp how be going to cross mac said when have lighted pipe build raft said then when be over yes why stay there guess if snow more one more fall of heavy snow will block eagle pas a sure a fire hot shrugged shoulder though have be expecting be not pleasant to have prospect of spending whole winter mewed up in mountain so close before doe get very cold here

than forty below zero often often be worse kind of cold than cold back east for be damper here not so steady bah wish be bear so a to hole up till spring of be very encouraging to man who have mostly sailed in warm latitude hated frost worse than poison did please to see that so good tempered man a mac be really put out in vile humor for knew what must only imagine conversation if conversation must be called flagged very soon got out blanket scraping away snow from place where lay close to other in order to preserve what warmth must lay in position commonly called in america spooning like two spoon fitting one into so that there have to be common consent for changing side one of grew damp while other grew cold just a be settling down to sleep heard sudden crack of rifle from other shore against wind came halloa across water mac sat up very unconcernedly a for jumped a if have be shot thinking of course at first that shot have be fired by indian though knew there be hostile tribe in part of british columbia where indeed most of indian be very peaceable told so said mac be montana bill rifle sold be only man up here that carry sharp rose went down to water edge halloa shouted in turn in quietness of windless air heard faintly repeated in distant echo be that mac said mysterious voice bet be answered partner in tone ought to have be heard on arrow lake bully old boy said bill faintly a seemed do know aye reckon know old montana bellow roared mac then will see in morning pard came voice again after there be silence broken only by faint lap of water on shingle a slipped past snort of pony a blew snow out of nostril vainly seeking for tuft of grass rose at earliest dawn saw montana bill slowly coming over level sat down while mac built raft fashioned couple of rude paddle with ax be pony coming across mac asked will try be own lookout said if wo come easy sha drag for will hev to paddle to do fortunately for did want to go over having long lariat round neck actually swam in front of gave tow instead of giving one a be going over mac said to never thought 'd be glad to see montana bill before be got more gas blow about than 'd set up town be more good at bottom be aint more grit in than clay bank though to hear talk 'd think 'd mor'n forty two inch grindstone hope be got good stock of grub in few minute touched bottom shook hand with subject of mac eulogium who looked a bold a brass a fierce a turkeycock have voice of man o ' war bobeon took lariat off pony turned adrift did fellow strike said bill first thing enough to pay for winter board reckon said mac have got plenty of grub bill nodded using common american word for yes be kind of cross breed between yea german ja pronounced short like ye bet have plenty old hank kem up with then

allers camp here year be kind of clear there be chance for cayuse to pick bit to keep bone hide together besides feel more freer down here see more than 'ull do of hill walking line with came to camp now if tell happened during winter be round most uncomfortable most unhappy one ever spent for have so much time to think of elsie how other man more to mind might go to windward of in courting why must not write one book two be not intention now besides have be long enough coming to most serious part of history to tire other people a have tired although must not exactly help because at least nearly happened between time be on vancouver time met again seems important to especially a might have gone very differently if have never be gold hunting in selkirk even if have got out of mountain in fall instead of following spring for thing seem linked together in life in writing one must put everything in unless more particular description becomes tedious because of interfering with story though trapping be interesting enough yet be not writing here about hunting be more interesting still when man tell yarn say be about certain thing want to break off in middle to say something quite different more than like man to get up in middle of job of work such a long splice be wanted to do something be ordered to do be only way of doing literary tom cox traverse three time round deck house once to scuttle butt just putting in time making what literary friend of mine call padding so folk who read can understand why will say nothing of long weary winter if prefer can think that holed up a mac said like bear slept through for in next part of yarn will be spring with snow melting fast trail beginning to look like path again that even sailor who be not mountaineer must hope to travel on without losing life even way part iv love hate have be raining for week in incessant torrent while heavy cloud hung low down slope of sullen sunless mountain when struck camp in spring time loaded gaunt pack pony for rapidly opening trail road lay for twenty mile on bottom of flat closed in more more a went east until be in heart of gold range path be liquid mud in sank to top of long boot sometimes even leaving embedded there pony be nearly sloughed down dozen time in day at worst place be sometimes compelled to take off pack carried piecemeal to firmer ground there loaded again have taken four four half day to cross on last trip now barely reached summit lake in same time yet in spite of miserable weather dank dripping condition in spite of hard work harder idleness when wind rain made almost impossible to sleep be happy far happier than have be since time have so miserably failed to make elsie believe what told for now be going back to with result of long toil there be nothing to prevent staying near perhaps on farm of own until must recognize error at last yet thought well to waste time for though have to great extent got rid of fear concerning that wretched matthias still imprisonment have few more month to run might keep word sworn oath wished to win wear before time after why did not care must do best trust in providence even if trusted in vain have often thought since that be strange how much john harmer be in mind from daylight even to dark during sixth day of toilsome tramp over eagle pas for image often unaccountably came before even dispossessed fair face of whom loved be so time during day must have be very much surprised though perhaps little angry to see come round bend in trail saying half humbly half impudently a approached how do do mr ticehurst almost began to believe after day in second sight clairvoyance other mysterious thing most sensible people look upon a do on charlatanry juggling in fair for presentiment came true in such strange way even if be only accident mere coincidence after yet have seen many thing put down a coincidence puzzled wiser people than tom ticehurst have camped in wretchedly miserable spot have nothing to recommend beyond fact that there really be grass there for wall of rock on right mac bill considered protection from wind acted a break wind often do gave two gale in opposite direction instead of one so wind instead of sweeping over going on way fought contended over head only ceased for moment to rush skrieking again about ear a leapt on fire sent ember here there while rain descended at possible angle perhaps be on account of fizzing of water in fire rattle of branch overhead whistling of wind that heard one approaching grumbling company until be right upon be just then dozen pace out in darkness cutting up wood for fire a stranger approached light let fall ax so that narrowly escaped cutting off big toe for one of two saw be boy that boy john harmer slouched big hat down over eye with wood in arm approached group replenished fire john be talking with western twang a though be determined not to be taken for englishman rain be saying well bet be something like on lake take old hand to know be land be water old hank be nearly drowned in tent other day serve right growled bill who be young feller never see before mostly know everybody in country harmer

little alarmed a must tell by tone of voice well replied mac quietly will tell be up in hill with struck rich got lot of gold did bet did went on in irritating drawl then came down when snow flew have time getting out young feller then at last came to columbia there be drowned said harmer growing pale war replied mac got across right stayed winter trapping with bill here let tell young man must trifle with bill be snorter be must see damn bill almost on jack lip restrained when chinook came up snow began to melt few day back got ready to cross range bill be six day ago better fellow than never struck will what do think pard asked with grin turning to grunted young feller mac went on again if be pardner of yours shipmate for can see be englishman why be glad be here safe then suddenly altering tone turned fiercely on harmer who jumped back in alarm why thunder shake hand with there be waitin john sprang across fire caught by hand confound mr ticehurst how very unkind of said with tear in eye began to think be dead looked unutterably relieved happy bursting with news must see wait till supper jack said then tell be glad to see be too in spite of leaving inlet without asking a to man with whom came montana bill knew spent time in bullying absent hank patterson appeared that harmer have hired to come hunt for a far a columbia river in order to bury decently a have be firmly convinced that be dead when learnt news of at landing whole five of sat down to bean bacon harmer ate very little because wanted to tell something be strangely loth to hear so sure be that must be nothing good certainly must be bad news to bring even impulsive youngster from coast to columbia in such weather well what be harmer said at last hesitated moment be anything about asked quietly lest others must overhear who miss f asked nodded shook head be such luck went on be so doubtful of what have to tell although few hour ago be sure enough that did know how to begin when mat sentence be up mr ticehurst have need to reckon th of august jack looked at then bent over toward be up already sir what be dead then sir have escaped filled pipe while gathered together be dreadfully unfortunate if be true how do know said at length saw in new westminster one night deuce did harmer be sure lad looked uncomfortable wriggled about on seat be old stump of tree felled by former occupant of camping

cabin with two other fellow klootchmen saw pas there be not much light be going quick jumped up rushed out after in rain darkness got away if thought anyone be following missed be glad did boy must have thought little of putting knife into here rubbed own shoulder mechanically besides if have seen must have helped to track then how in name of thunder a mac say did come here at ca be chance did look up san francisco paper to see if anything be reported a to escape harmer brightened a if glad to answer that have done what considered ought to have done yes sir did found nothing about nothing at reflected little saw nothing clearly after imperative necessity of getting down to fork if mat be loose why must have to be very careful be true perhaps might be retaken though did not know if man must be extradited for simply breaking prison if came up country must find might take into oriental skull to harm anyone knew thought made shiver did stay at thomson fork harmer asked to try turn dark current of thought blushed little yes sir only day saw one though what not even fanny wrote to told be going up lake to see what have become of be kind of jack said mean be kind of to come up here how do like country eh turned round comically shrugged shoulder said nothing must see early spring in mountain did not please especially a be in wet belt if did not like country found must stand well for be a hardy a pack pony never complained not though be delayed whole day by rain on return to landing have to go to thomson fork in indian dugout when did arrive there be fine at last sun be shining brilliantly mac harmer be greeted in friendliest manner at hotel by dave bar tender who be resplendent with white shirt of very finest get up diamond stud stood drink at once be welcome to gentleman more too for did think down here that have be lost in snow never expected to hear of again think young lady round here must have interest in mr ticehurst said knowingly for only two day ago called out

sir be not be miss fleming must say be daisy best looking girl between rocky mountain pacific gentleman miss fanny be nice pretty girl will say stopped winked so that must hardly keep from throwing glass at carefully combed oiled head be happy to think that elsie have asked after in morning got horse from ned conlan rode over to mr fleming ranch be situated in long low valley terminated mile above house in narrow gulch down creek came on side be high hill covered on lower slope with bunch grass bull pine higher up with thick scrub ran at last into bare rock on topmost peak of snow lay for nine month of year a approached farm saw few of cattle on opposing slope on near side of valley be farm building house be partly hidden in tree tied horse to fence marched in a fancied a bold a brass in appearance if harmer felt half a uncomfortable a did doubt be sorry for first person saw be fanny first thing did be to upset chair on veranda on top of sleeping dog who at first howled then made rush at barking loudly down di cried fanny how dare o mr ticehurst how glad be be not dead too mr harmer though one said be oh where father wonder will be glad too elsie will be glad a well fanny

gambling last fall come in for news went down country when went to landing for grub followed wondering little whether must have be quite so effusive if have done badly soon forgot that when saw elsie who have just come out of room thought when saw that be little paler than when have last met though perhaps be due to unaccustomed cold sunless winter more than ever merited rough tribute dave have paid in conlan bar be very beautiful to how much more to a came up little shyly shook hand softly saying that be glad that bad news have heard of be not true fancied that have thought of often during winter perhaps have seen have be unjust at rate there be great difference between what be then what be now talked during dinner about winter three australian almost cursed in fact father did curse very admirably while elsie hardly reproved strong language so much did feel that forty degree below zero merited opprobrium must be cast on described gold mining adventure winter trapping by way have added five hundred dollar to other money told fleming that be now worth with still have at home more than five thousand dollar must see gave satisfaction what do think of country now mr fleming asked how long will stay here shook head know boy answered think in spite of cold will have to stand winter here summer must rebuild barn stable there be still lot of cattle adrift somewhere wo sell out

chewed chattered close by door for sake of fresher air when saw siwash jim ride up after tying horse to rail in front of house to dozen other animal in various stage of equine despondency irritation be already attached swaggered into bar brushing against rather rudely a did so harmer eye flashed with indignation a if be who have be insulted be very peaceable man always fight at first chance besides being so much bigger than jim must considered afford to take notice of what ill conditioned little ruffian like did when be probably drunk presently jack spoke to that beastly fellow keep looking at mr ticehurst a if must like to cut throat what be wrong with be jealous of do think be almost blasphemy to dream of such thing looked at mr john harmer so sternly that apologized yet believe must to extent have be that caused trouble ensued almost directly added afterward to danger in already stood turned round looked at jim who returned glance furiously ordered drink then seemed a if be desirous of making drunk presently dave who be a usual behind bar spoke to going back to ranch to night jim jim struck bar hard with fist be not never unless go to set damned place on fire why

sent three men to floor with shock shook house finally jim got hand in hair tried to gouge out eye fortunately be not long enough for to get good hold when felt thumb feeling for eye strength rage ever have seemed to come to rose suddenly with clinging to for moment swayed about then caught throat pushed at arm length from catching hold of belt threw right over head be standing with back to door went through fell on sidewalk rolled off into road where lay insensible very good said dave very well done indeed pick up of fellow see if be dead son of gun will make pay for bottle for table

in one thing at least be near elsie felt a if harmer suspicion about mat be mere chimera that lad in excitement have mistaken dark face of harmless indian for of revengeful malay a to siwash jim why shrugged shoulder did not suppose be so murderously inclined a nettlebury imagined must be hard line on to have two men so ill disposed toward through fault of own a to wish to kill went back to fleming after hard day work in burnt otherwise disposed of almost unparalleled collection of rubbish including old crockery bottle dirty shirt worn out boot have be accumulating indoors out for ten year after being nearly smothered be glad to go down to creek take bath in clear cold water ran into main watercourse issuing two mile away from black caon at back of valley concerning fleming have once spoken to that evening at ranch be pleasantest ever spent in life up to time in spite of black cloud hung over for fanny be a bright happy a bird while elsie who seemed to have come to sens spoke almost freely displaying more disinclination to even apparently than might naturally be set down to instinctive modesty knowledge be courting desired to be received a lover spoke to late that evening when fleming went out to throw down night hay to horse for fanny vanished discreetly at same moment continued to make just enough noise in kitchen to assure be there while be not sufficient to drown even softest conversation good girl be be love yet though well perhaps have better leave unsaid at present elsie said when be alone do remember what said when parted on steamer cast eye down did not answer think do elsie went on said must never forget do think have know why left ship why came to country why went mining why have worked so hard patiently for long long month without seeing answer do know why hesitated moment lifted up blue eye dropped at sight of passion in mine said gently suppose so mr ticehurst yes know elsie be that might be near might get rich enough to be able to claim how fortunate have be in be fortunate in other thing too elsie will answer that elsie approached held up hand stay mr ticehurst if must speak may have judged wrongly be not wholly sure have if have not must only be preparing misery for myself for if answered question a must have want time must have other assurance for how can wholly trust when will not speak a might do ah how must be far better than have expected far better elsie answered quietly be ready to give time time need to prove love for though there be need heart be yours yours only ever from time saw have never even wavered in faith hope care so long a may be near so long a may see sometimes speak to for without will be wretched must be glad even if wretched malay be to kill a threatened thought be cunning to bring in matthias indeed lifted eye then showed sign of fear for perhaps looked at saying to herself there be need of strong man being afraid of such visionary danger spoke after little silence then let be so mr ticehurst if what say be true there at least be nothing for to fear looked at straight then with glorious blue eye must have given world to catch in arm press to heart went on if never give cause why be silent held out hand took pressed must have raised to lip only drew gently away went to rest happy that night give cause indeed what cause must give be what asked without knowing what be coming without feeling ignorance blindness helplessness in strange web of fate fated crime be being woven around without being conscious a animal be in prairie of storm so ready to burst on head whose first faint cloud have risen on horizon of life even before have seen in very hour that have joined vancouver under own brother command went to sleep wondering vaguely what have become of be blind of see nothing until curtain rise on act after act being ignorant still whether end will be sweet bitter to whether will justify smile in happiness tear in bitter tragedy for two day worked in about house putting thing in order on third rode over to fleming early in morning a have be arranged be to go out with mr fleming to look after cattle of neighbor have complained of never felt in better spirit than when rode over short two mile separated for morning be calm bright with touch of glorious freshness known only among mountain on high plateau lifted up from common level of under world even sang softly to myself for black cloud of doubt few day ago have obscured light be driven away by new dawning of hope be content without fear shouted cheerfully for fleming a rode up came to door with whip

turned away took horse from fence rode off rapidly without thinking of harmer of fleming who be standing in amazement at stable a saw when opened swing gate if harmer have come up at gallop went at one until horse be covered with sweat foam flying from champed bit hung about knee like sea foam did not easily melt in hour be at conlan door be received by dave in two minute stood in helen presence when saw last have that rich red complexion showed pure color of blood through delicate skin eye be piercing perhaps little hard figure be full beautiful have always rejoiced too in bright color such a oriental might have chosen richness have suited striking appearance now be woefully altered barely knew color have deserted cheek be wan hollow eye be sunken ringed with dark circle bust have fallen in until looked like ghost of former self ghost be mere vague memory of whom have first known in melbourne dress too be black knew hated in looked even le like voice when spoke no longer rang out with assurance faltered ever again with tear rose to eye checked utterance took hand full of pity for dread of what have to tell for must be something dreadful have changed so much brought so far what be helen said in low voice what did come for mean tom asked though desiring answer came for sake not for will thought might never get letter wanted to see once again ah how much desired that tom be in danger spoke that suddenly in danger moment for man who threatened life nodded sucking dry lip for knew what meant be only afraid of what else have to tell that man have escaped have not be caught o tom be careful be careful if be to die too what do mean helen asked though knew full well what meant looked at ca think yes can perhaps partly not not horror of tom will be dead not only that be murdered in san francisco staggered sat down staring at went on in curiously constrained voice yes very first night came ashore in hotel be intoxicated came in late must have in room made put in next heard shouting out of window over veranda soon afterward then fell asleep in morning found found dead in bed struck right through with stab in heart be robbed too tom nearly killed be so horrible oh be horrible did know what to do be going to send for then read in paper about mat having escaped two day before so came away at once ceased sobbed violently kept silence god alone know what be in heart how came there for moment yes for more than suspected wife of brother murder be blind enough suppose so be then so many time in life wonder suddenly at want of sight when truth come out remembered have once said hated must kill besides loved shivered be still silent looked up caught eye knew be full of doubt rose up suddenly came to fell on knee cried tom not that for god sake look at so knew saw very heart be ashamed of lifted up put on chair heaven how light be to what have be for soul have wasted body away like strong wind fanning fire poor will said at last then asked if have remained for inquest have not answered started at reply if must think what have what might others not do for to disappear like after murder of husband be enough to make people believe guilty of crime wondered that have not be prevented from leaving on questioning further learnt that police suspected certain man who be frequenter of very hotel after manner of kind have got in custody be devoting attention to proving guilty of crime whether there be prima facie proof not still seemed bitter that poor will must be left to stranger while wife came to see though have done to save a thought yet after danger be hardly such a to warrant acting a have done be not person to blame have done poor woman because yet loved a knew even then saw too that be love without hope even if have not be must have learnt be near to elsie be courting old fleming gal be common talk whenever name be mentioned tried to convince that have most likely ceased to think of preferred to believe be only daily hourly irritation of poor will conduct have driven to compare with to disadvantage well whatever fault be have be bitterly expiated a indeed such fault a usually be doe not require statistic to convince anyone who have seen much of world that most of trouble in come directly from drink be in strange situation a sat reflecting suppose strict duty required to go to san francisco yet will must be buried before must get there then what be to do with widow must not stay there must not allow did think desired still be not fit to travel in state of nervous exhaustion indeed be marvel that have be able to come so far even under stimulus of such unwonted excitement must not go away with even for part of return journey for felt elsie must be harder harder to manage more knew saw of helen ended by coming to conclusion that must stay at fork for while must go back try to have explanation with elsie helen bowed head in acquiescence when told what have better do for poor woman be utterly broken down ready to lean on arm be offered who have be so strong in own will be at last content to be advised like obedient child left with mr conlan to whom told a much a thought desirable kissing on forehead took horse rode slowly toward home a left town saw siwash jim sitting on sidewalk looked at with face full of diabolical hatred when got to crest of hill above town turned in saddle saw still gazing after when way home met harmer who be riding even slower than sitting a gingerly in saddle a if be very uncomfortable a have doubt be well mr ticehurst said eagerly when came near what be told looked puzzled well remarked at last seems to must have be mistaken after did see mat when thought did let see when did escape reckoned up be only twelve day ago for helen have taken nine day coming from san francisco according to what told then be impossible for to have seen in new westminster said harmer be very strange must have imagined did see that did escape after then told of brother death why mr ticehurst exclaimed must have done must see must thought have not entered into head said see at there be man in custody for now be hardly likely mat must stay in san francisco if escaped for two day besides be even le likely that must fall across brother very first evening came ashore harmer shook head obstinately will see sir will see know did like captain ticehurst much better than then say be robbed of paper be address among do think started for jack suspicion seemed possible after thing looked more likely than have done at first sight yet be only cowardice that made think so shook head answered yes to question then pray mr ticehurst be careful said jack earnestly carry revolver always besides fellow jim be about again hardly hurt at must be made of iron heard last night threatened to have life threatened men live long jack said be not scared of be only talk blow care much if mat doe get on track must be dangerous did see miss fleming before left said turning conversation shook head have gone to room remained there when went away well harmer will be in town day after to morrow said at last if anything happens can send word go see mr ticehurst meanwhile will do said to morrow morning have to go up lake to logging camp know when will be back be what custer said morning when asked to let come over here very well wo matter dare say answered take care of jack oh mr ticehurst said turning round in saddle wincing a did so be who must be careful pray do be very careful nodded shook hand rode on when came to fleming fanny be at big gate asked question by eye before got close enough to speak yes fanny said be serious then told what have occurred held out hand pressed mine sympathetically be so sorry tom be said said so kindly that voice almost brought tear to eye have elsie spoken to since went fanny asked a walked down to house together while horse followed with head hanging down have even seen tom replied door be locked when knocked told to go away a be room too be not very polite in spite of love for elsie felt somewhat bitter against injustice to be glad to see that made suffer little on part know have said very little about own feeling for care somehow to put down felt more than like to tell stranger be near heart did feel strongly deeply to see who be with by day night a object of fondest hope so unjust be enough to make bitter wished to reproach for be not child boy to be fooled with like go ask to see fanny please said rather sternly a stood outside door tell anything of what told of will matthias fanny started never said anything of matthias cried did fanny well then will have escaped from prison suppose be after by tell elsie just say want to see in few moment came back with tear in eye wo tom be in obstinate fit know though be cry eye out spiteful cat wo come know just told to go away what will do asked nothing fanny answered can tell what like will be so cruel to lover little fanny looked up saucily know tom will see when have one laughed what about jack harmer then well see looked down be very young be more than seventeen looked younger besides care for anybody elsie father tom very well fanny said give kiss from elsie make give back will tom said quite simply kissing rode off quietly across flat to solitary home part v at black caon now a far a have gone in story have related nothing did not see hear be a seems to proper way to do provided nothing important be left out a have learnt since then what happened to other people have pieced story together in mind see be necessary to depart from rule have observed hitherto if want to explain after have come to end of whole history what occurred before that can see must be very clumsy way of narrating affair now what be going to tell have on very good evidence for dave at fork conlan stableman told part afterward a will be seen actually learnt something from siwash jim who here play rather curious important part appears that day after be at fork day spent by way with mr fleming riding round country returning afterward by trail led from black caon down to house siwash jim who have to appearance recovered from injury however be only bruise have inflicted on began to drink early in morning have so dave say quite unnatural power of keeping sober dave can drink more than two men be acquainted with unless be mac old partner so ought to know though jim drank hard did not become drunk only abused called name from coyote upward downward british columbian of standing have at tongue end when jim have exhausted resource of fertile american language started in siwash indian in there be many choice term of abuse in spite of openness dave say be quite evident be dangerous might really have be in peril at time of day if have come to town for jim be deemed bad character among companion have so be said killed one man at least though have never be tried for though sat day in bar using name openly never made move till eight in evening when went out for awhile when returned be accompanied by thin dark man wearing slouch hat over eye whom dave took to be half breed of kind have drink together for stranger paid speaking in good english not with western accent then two went to other side of room what conversation be one know exactly did ever learn dave who be keeping eye on jim say that seemed a if stranger be trying to persuade jim to be quiet stay where be from what occurred afterward there be little doubt supposition be correct moreover name undoubtedly occurred in conversation for dave heard name of ranch a well soon after men came in in consequence of being busy dave did not see jim go out conlan stableman say jim came to stable with stranger got horse when asked where be going said for ride must answer more question time strange man tried to persuade not to go to come have drink if jim have be flush of money there might have be motive for a be not there seemed then to be none beyond sudden absurd fondness that men sometimes conceive for other when drunk if be case be only on stranger side for when horse be brought round to door jim mounted when other man still importuned not to go siwash jim struck at with left hand knocked off hat a stood in light coming from bar just then attention be drawn from jim by sudden shriek from other side of road where conlan private house stood when dave came out looked for again other man have disappeared down road branched about mile out of town into two fork one leading eastward other southward to fleming now a said before most of day have be out riding with mr fleming who left early in order to go to next ranch down road have told whole story about mat escape brother death agreed with be hardly likely to be connected yet acknowledged if be be in much more danger than one must have thought before because deed must show malay be desperado of most fearless dangerous description besides if have robbed will be more than likely knew where be from own letter from address written in pocketbook brother always carried be missing of course conversation made full a be of mat combined with unlucky turn affair have taken with regard to elsie made more nervous than be inclined to acknowledge to father so before went to bed did at ten o'clock for be very tired being still unaccustomed to much riding locked door carefully put table against of thing

on outside at back too where never went drew on boot snatched revolver up leapt at front window through went with crash uttering loud cry a did so for piece of glass cut left arm deeply a came to ground saw horseman in front of by light of fire have already mounted to roof of house recognized siwash jim then whether be that horse rode be frightened at crash made not suddenly bounded into air turned sharp round bolted into brush just where trail came down from black caon a jim disappeared fired with effect that shot be neither returned anticipated be saw due to fact that villain have dropped own six shooter probably at first bound of horse just where have be standing be in blind fury of rage for cowardly treacherous attack on unoffending man life seemed hardly credible to there

siwash jim said be not jim must go must with extraordinary exhibition of strength rose ordered horse in imperative tone saying be quite well enough to do a liked mr conlan appealed to doctor perhaps being glad to advise against opinion of present a such course might indicate superior knowledge said thought best to let have own way think too that helen who seemed to have regained strength have regained with old power of making people do a wished at rate mr conlan meekly acquiesced saying must drive went out to order horse at once when buggy be brought to door helen got up without assistance begged to be quick wife who must never have dared to even suggest hurrying stood aghast at seeing usually masterful husband do a be bid drove off leaving mr conlan to prophesy certain death a result of inexplicable expedition while others speculated more le wildly a to what meant conlan told that helen never spoke way except to ask how much longer be going to be to complain of slowness of pace most woman said ned must have be scared at way drove for be pitch dark if horse have known road a well better than did must have come to grief in first mile never turned hair be wonderful woman sir be already past eleven o'clock when got to top of hill just above fleming from there light of house burning must be distinctly seen although place be hidden by rise helen pointed to nervously demanding

silence cried suddenly though one spoke there be somebody coming three of looked into darkness in there be white figure moving rapidly be elsie screamed fanny joyfully helen sprang from buggy stood in light a elsie exclaimed in wonder at fanny excited voice two woman stood face to face looking in other eye then elsie who for one moment have shown nothing surprise went white with scorn anger how glad must have be to have seen so to have learnt even at moment when stood in greatest peril have ever known that have ridden over to save help even though act added greater danger to in already stood for deed look be deed look of woman who love be jealous might have seemed to have be there that helen coming have overbalanced scale once more against perhaps for last time be glad did not know that

escaped from prison have given mean of killing lover have given tom ticehurst up to matthias to murderer murderer fell back time did not recover lay insensible still holding girl dress with a desperate clutch a though be keeping back from following man who be upon track that terrible midnight elsie stooped freed dress saying to fanny see to see to ran down to stable again just a father rode through higher gate a girl who have known ridden from childhood be saddling first one came to in stable be riding hard desperately in dark not quarter of mile behind siwash jim trail upon be ran from house straight up into mountain for nearly ten mile then followed verge of black caon for more than mile farther when came up to place stayed for one moment heard dull sullen roar of broken water three hundred foot beneath then rode on again a though be a irresistibly impelled a be be just a bound to cut way through what fate have placed before a have be to carve narrow tremendous chasm in living rock at last came to fork in trail if have not be there before with mr fleming must most likely have never seen jim night perhaps never again have stayed at very spot left hand fork be main track led right over mountain into nicola valley while left disused one be partially obliterated by thick growing weed led back through impassable scrub rough rock to middle of black caon have passed that end of without thinking for indeed be scarcely likely must have turned off there chance seemed thousand to one jim must take left hand path just because did seem so certain alighted from horse struck light latest horse track led to right hand have relied on taking widest path continuing in until be too late to catch man who have so skillfully doubled on have doubt that curse at losing revolver be changed into chuckle a thought of riding headlong in night until horse be exhausted while be returning way have come stopped to think then getting on horse rode back slowly to where trail joined at edge of caon must wait for there waited more than hour be strange how such little circumstance alter everything for not only must jim following nicola trail have resulted in something very different waiting hour during cooled somewhat lost first blind rage of passion in have set out set reflecting a to what must do if have come up with at full gallop must have shot there then must have expected must have be just vengeance now be quietly waiting for to shoot when appeared seemed to hardly le cowardly conduct than own then if gave warning must probably escape be not so generous a to let have chance yet in after year seeing followed from what did think be more generous than just ought to have regarded a avenging arm of law have struck a coolly a executioner determined to give chance for life though giving be risking own held dear if only for elsie sake so backed horse into brush where commanded trail cocking revolver sat waiting in hour heard tramp of horse though at first must not tell from way sound came at last saw have be right in conjecture that enemy be given into hand heart beat fast hand be steady for have full command over waited until be nearly alongside of then spoke throw up hand siwash jim said in voice rang out over roar of water below be dead man threw up a sat there must see horse be wearied out if have not be perhaps voice must have startled compelled to fire what be going to do said sullenly peering in direction for must barely see against background of tree brush whereas have against sky will tell miserable scoundrel answered first get off horse do slowly will put two bullet through mind dismounted slowly tie horse to sapling if will be kind enough said further be in hurry about attempt to get behind know what will happen when have done a ordered spoke again have got match yes replied of course have villain same set house on fire with well now rake up brush make little fire here what for said quickly for believe thought for moment meant to roast alive undeceived if be idea so that can see other replied for be going to give chance for life though deserve where be six shooter dropped grunted picked up said so make haste if want to be killed with own weapon what thought be ca say without more word set about making fire soon having vigorous blaze by saw plainly enough look of fear distrust hatred cast at piled on branch though checked once twice when thought be going too far to gather when there be sufficient light to illuminate whole space about opposing bank of caon told be enough that will do said go stand at edge of caon hesitated be not going to shoot like dog put down there be said trembling like dog said passionately did not try to smother like bear in den to burn alive in own house do a tell will shoot now roll body in river go went a asked have got cartridge demanded pointed to belt growled that have plenty then stay there will tell will do with be going to empty revolver can have when be empty will get off horse then can load again when see have filled can do best for do hear nodded head kept eye fixed on anxiously a though not daring to hope be going to be so foolish a word be even to extent of firing revolver into air though have suspicion of what be really doing what act must bring about alighted from horse let go for there be danger of running away even struck lightly sent up trail out of way of accident then keeping own revolver pointed at jim who stood like statue raised in left hand fired report rang out over hill threw siwash jim weapon saying load chamber slowly count a do so what fool be to be sure not to have shot dead let lie though must not have be free from danger encompassed yet must have be fewer far fewer more easily contended with acted a fate must have even a counted heard jim count too in strained hoarse voice one two three four five six be armed man again armed in light almost half way between glittered in eye fell on face be life mine life be worth nothing mine be precious with possibility of love yet knew not of love be hurrying toward even then side by side with hate death when jim weapon be loaded turned toward with barrel pointed to ground eye be fixed on mine fixed with look of fear hatred hatred now predominated lowered own revolver until stood on equal term look said sternly see that burning branch above fire be already half burnt through when fall look out for yourself stood still perfectly still while behind under flood in caon fretted roared menacingly angrily hungrily sappy branch cracked cracked again be bending bending slowly not yet falling when jim threw weapon up fired treacherous to last aim be not sure surer than mine when returned shot a fired again felt sting in left shoulder branch fell slowly slowly ah a slowly a jim did for sank on knee rolled over sideways slipped backward on verge of caon sloping treacherous verge a slipped caught long root disclosed by falling earth with last strength of life hung on to yard below a ran to edge stopped there horror struck desire for vengeance be satisfied more than satisfied for if must have restored to solid ground life must have done bidden go way so saw more for face be ghastly horrible to see lip disclosed teeth a breathed through convulsively nostril be widely distended knelt down vainly reached out hand be yard below to go distance meant death for a well knelt there saw fail gradually eye closed opened again again caught lower lip between teeth bit through through then head fell back hand relaxed be gone heard sullen plunge of body a fell three hundred foot into water below remained still motionless for moment what thing man be that must do such deed rose feeling of sorrow remorse for terrible death of fellow creature made stagger put hand to brow then peered over edge of caon what be looking for be looking into river of fate took revolver threw into caon that must slay other man a fell struck projecting rock exploding echo in narrow space roared thundered up gorge toward east where just beyond mountain first faint sign of rosy dawn be written upon heaven be that omen of peace love to of fairer brighter day lifted heart above prayed might be so be yet night still dark darkest hour be before dawn for a turned back to caon stepped across to fire have lighted poor foolish ignorant jim to death looked up saw before thin face feared more than others wicked eye of escaped enemy matthias of vancouver have never believed coward for have faced death too often few minute ago have risked life in manner few men must have imitated confess that in horrible surprise of moment in strange unexpectedness of sudden most unlooked for appearance be stricken dumb motionless stood glaring at with opened eye while heart blood ran cold for be unarmed by own act of revulsion remorse wounded too for must feel blood trickle slowly from shoulder have be deeply scored by second bullet from jim revolver be in same position have put in in clear space with thick brush on side through there be escape in there be shelter single tree to left of blazing fire be already gradually crawling in dry brush surely be delivered into enemy hand for be armed carried revolver on whose bright barrel fire glinted harshly how long stood facing other can not say seemed hour if have fired then might have killed at once for be unable to move did not desire must see did not a hot eye devoured gleamed with light of savage joy triumph spoke at last in curiously quiet voice be checked now again with sort of sob made shiver ah mr ticehurst said slowly know look a if did be glad feel like that be afraid looked at answered be lie from time forward be lie for feared more no said think not be pale just now shook shake even after what have be through look at pointed weapon at hand be a steady a rock lowered again stroked barrel softly with lean left hand remember what said to went on thomas ticehurst do have kept word ah have thought of many time many time tortured treated like dog in jail sent to beat kicked starved never complained lest time there must be longer when lay down at night thought of time when must kill knew must come have just now when saw by side of own grave looking down did know whether be other man thought perhaps have killed if have be must have killed paused still stood there with flood of thought rushing through what must do if have taken eye off mine for one single moment must have sprung on did not while talked horse champing bit in brush cruelest of own horse moved put head through branch looked at oh if be only on back did not speak how will kill said matthias at last must like to cut to piece paused again then horse have not yet seen moved on other side of trail where have come up have heard others knew must be animal have ridden came out of brush into light of fire knew be elsie heart gave tremendous leap then stood still how have become possessed of spoke in voice must not recognize a own so hoarse terrible be how did get that white horse villain asked looked at fiercely without at first seeing how must hurt then look of beast like cruel cunning came into eye ah said knew be girl horse how did get perhaps must like to know will never see again never where be now where knew a little a did way spoke horrible thing put into voice made boil with fury be lying dog cried though have said nothing must be so wrathful grinned diabolically seeing how have hurt then laughed loud in insulting triumphant manner be too much made one tremendous bound across fire landed within three foot of fired at same moment whether have wounded not did not know revolver went spinning two yard off grappled in death hug have said that siwash jim be hard man to beat whether be that be weak with wound not found matthias who be mad with hate fury most terrible antagonist have ever tackled be a slippery a eel a lithe a snake withal grip be like of steel trap yet if must prevent drawing knife be at belt did not care be match if not in agility at least in strength must never let go be for one moment still after grappled trust will never see anything look more like devil than eye in light of fire shone while gnashed teeth ground until foam saliva oozed out of mouth like mad dog venom forehead be seamed wrinkled cheek be sucked in then blown out convulsively whole aspect be more hideous than of beast of prey then struggle began at first be trial of strength for although be so much bigger knew own power force of iron nerve hoped to overcome thus reeled to fro twice went through fire where once held for instant with malicious joy be short lived for pain added to strength forced backward until struck trunk of tree heavy blow then swayed hither thither for have by right wrist left shoulder not daring to alter grip on right hand lest must get knife held in same way at last came to very verge of caon spurned track jim have made in agony for moment thought must throw in have not lost hope if have that moment must have be last in second have staggered to fire tried strength to free right hand at last by sudden wrench did dropped finger like lightning on knife just a bent left wrist over struck in face with own clenched hand went down knife ripped shoulder by very place that jim bullet have struck rolled over over madly blindly burning on scattered ember tearing on jagged root small branch smashed a strove to dash on ground struggled to free arm have gripped above elbow to end battle at one blow though once drove point more than inch into biceps three time cut deeply did not injure nerve so a to paralyse limb yet felt be becoming insensible so tremendous be strain excitement felt that must make last effort die somehow rose to knee still grappling if looked tithe a horrible a did covered with blood saliva sweat must have be horrible to see glared in other eye for one moment then loosing hold on left arm caught right wrist with hand with freed hand struck with remaining strength full in face while twisted right wrist with force must have broken only compelled to relinquish bloody piece of steel then rolled over again lay locked in other arm there be moment truce for human nature must not stand strain think believed be beaten at mercy for be on top of lying half across breast with face not six inch from mine spoke in horrible voice shook with hate pain triumph have got now will kill a did brother great god then be who have done after better have be for to have held peace for word roused again a nothing else must have done caught throat with hand though struck viciously held a lay on top of saw die then knew more for little while a lay there insensible still bled what be called to whether be that soul have gone out to meet someone returned in triumph for awoke with momentary feeling of gladness whether be unconscious effort of brain in presence of new terrible danger can not say know be that when spasm of joy passed felt weak unable to move under weight of matthias whose protruding eye tongue mocked at hideously in death a though revenge be even now being accomplished saw fiery brush creeping across space lay between fire jim have kindled at bidding be to die by fire at last when horrible night be passing dawn be already breaking on eastern horizon for must not stir limb be like lead heart beat feebly foot be cold lay glaring at fire a did so saw that revolver have struck out of matthias hand be lying a far from fire a fire be from how be that there be such clear intellect at time in very presence of death saw then that shot have fired from weapon have brought enemy up just in time for otherwise might have be wearied out lost now thought if must only get to to fire might thus bring help for what enemy have left now save crawling fire might even bring elsie then how did dead villain who lay across choking still get horse what have happened to in hand tried to scream sighed a softly a vague wind be impelling slow fire toward how near came how near nearer yet like serpent rearing head spitting viciously a came then thought how slow be why did not come end at once let die looked at fire again be within two foot of must feel heat within eighteen inch of revolver be glad watched feverishly then weapon muzzle be pointed almost at suppose exploded shot dead a called for help how strange be put up hand feebly tried to move dead body so a to screen might a well have tried to uproot tree for must barely move hand looked at fire again a crawled on on now wavering now staying one moment to lift up thousand little crest vicious eye then stooping to lick up grass dried brush on lay a glared at intently at last reached weapon coiled round triumphantly a though have be goal licking round round must flame heat cartridge enough if did where must bullet go asked that deliriously for be in fever instead of being cold at heart blood ran through like fire thought began to feel fire be so close to heard explosion of heated weapon be yet alive come elsie come if be not dead come save come thought cried out loudly not even ear that heard sharper sound afar must have caught once more once again cartridge fired heard crash saw horse burst like flame through black brush there be white thing before eye looked up saw elsie own true love after then fainted dead away did not recover until long long after ask sometimes even now when hour be burnt into soul return to sight like old brand coming out on healed flesh when be struck sudden sharply whether after enemy have be balked of revenge to die one death go into oblivion be lot of who face rising sun after while veil eye when last fire sink in western sea suffered ten thousand death by violence by cruel ambush torture by crawling flame flashing knife in interval between rescue recovery from fever that wound horror of brought upon told elsie told that lay raving only ten day seemed incredible to a shook head in vague disbelief that made fear for reason if have be in care of stranger who be unfamiliar to might have thought worn out relic of dead buried era whose monument have crumbled slowly to ash in very fire through soul have passed shrieking for forgetful dead have loved though saw only vaguely like spirit in cloud knew without sight a lay half unconscious a beneficent presence only grew gradually to feel that elsie who still lived after century of delirium loved with passion have felt for say have felt for be like child desire for be scarcely more than pathetic longing for tenderness of thought touch until great strength have be pride returned in flood brought passion with once more how strangely came to pas have foretold in last talk with elsie have said angrily for be angered that must one day speak to though swore must not that must implore pardon did who have be so strong self contained in meekest dearest way thought of maiden must devise then asked if must marry must marry stared at in astonishment not at asking for seemed most natural thing in world for to do at idiocy of question do believe love elsie said at last for have heard that love make most sensible people quite stupid if be in right sens dear must not have asked must think not indeed broke in smiled tenderly because know very well that settled that long enough ago on board vancouver said stoutly then have voice in elsie said not least assure made up mind so did said elsie softly what do mean dear leant head against shoulder against big beard whispered made up mind dear tom that if did love must never love anyone else go be nun nurse life be why be so hard know yes knew well enough where be helen meantime be drawing so near end of story that must say have to in few word have remained at ranch until doctor have declared be going to recover be fault of did then went away what told elsie have never known will ever ask parted good friend yes best of friend returned home to melbourne never saw again
