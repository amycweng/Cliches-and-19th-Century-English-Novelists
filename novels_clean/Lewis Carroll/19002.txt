trouble of getting up picking daisy when white rabbit with pink eye ran close by there be nothing very remarkable in did alice think so very much out of way to hear rabbit say to dear dear will be too

rabbit hole under hedge in moment down went alice after never once considering how in world be to get out again rabbit hole went straight on like tunnel for way then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice have not moment to think about stopping before found falling down what seemed deep well well be very deep fell very slowly for have plenty of time a went down to look about to wonder what

in long low hall lit up by row of lamp hung from roof illustration there be door round hall be locked when alice have be round tried walked sadly down middle wondering how be ever to get out again suddenly came upon little three legged table made of solid glass there be nothing lying upon tiny golden key alice first idea be that might belong to one of door of hall ala lock be too large key too small at rate must open none of however on second time round came to low curtain behind be door about eighteen inch high tried little key in keyhole fitted alice opened door looked down small passage not larger than rat hole into loveliest garden ever saw how longed to get out of dark hall wander about among bed of bright flower cool fountain must not even get head through doorway even if head must go through thought poor alice must be very little use without shoulder oh how wish must shut up like telescope think must if only knew how to begin for see so many out of way thing have happened lately that alice began to think very few thing indeed be really impossible there be nothing else to do so went back to table half hoping might find key on at rate book of rule for shutting up people like telescope time there be little bottle on certainly be not there before said alice tied round neck of bottle be paper label with word drink beautifully printed on in large letter be very well to say drink will look first said wise little alice see whether bottle marked poison not for alice have read several nice little story about child got burnt eaten up by wild beast other unpleasant thing because must not remember simple rule friend have given such a if get into fire will burn that if cut finger very deeply with knife generally bleeds have never forgotten that if drink bottle marked poison be almost certain to disagree with sooner later however bottle be not marked poison so alice tasted finding very nice have in fact sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffy hot buttered toast very soon finished off what curious feeling said alice must be shutting up like telescope be so indeed be now only ten inch high face brightened up a occurred to that be now right size for going through little door into lovely garden first however waited for few minute to see whether be going to shrink further felt little nervous about for might end know said alice

great hurry enormous puppy be looking down at with large round eye feebly stretching out one paw trying to reach poor thing said alice in coaxing tone tried hard to whistle to be terribly alarmed while at thought that might be hungry in case must probably devour in spite of coaxing hardly knowing what did picked up little bit of stick held out to puppy whereupon puppy jumped into air off foot at once with yelp of delight rushed at stick made believe to worry then alice dodged behind great thistle to keep from being run over moment appeared at other side puppy made dart at stick tumbled head over heel in hurry to get hold then alice thinking be very like having game of play with cart horse expecting moment to be trampled under foot ran round thistle again then puppy begin series of short charge at stick running very little way forward time long way back barking hoarsely while till at last sat down good way off panting with tongue hanging out of mouth great eye half shut seemed to alice good opportunity for making escape set off at once ran till puppy bark sounded quite faint in distance till be quite tired out of breath yet what dear little puppy be said alice a leant against buttercup to rest fanned with hat must have liked teaching trick if if 'd only be right size to do oh 'd nearly forgotten that have got to grow up again let see how be to be managed suppose

caterpillar contemptuously who be brought back again to beginning of conversation alice felt little irritated at caterpillar making such very short remark drew up said very gravely think ought to tell who be first why said caterpillar here be puzzling question a alice have reason ready caterpillar seemed to be in very bad temper turned round walked away come back caterpillar called after have something important to say sounded promising alice turned came back again keep temper said caterpillar be that said alice swallowing down anger a well a must no said caterpillar alice thought might a well wait a have nothing else to do perhaps after caterpillar might tell something worth hearing for minute puffed away at hookah without speaking at last unfolded arm took hookah out of mouth again

said caterpillar well must like to be little larger sir if must mind said alice three inch be such wretched height to be be very good height indeed said caterpillar loudly angrily rearing straight up a spoke be exactly three inch high be not used to pleaded poor alice in piteous tone thought to herself wish creature must be so easily offended will get used to in time said caterpillar put hookah into mouth began smoking again time alice waited quietly until chose to speak again in few minute caterpillar took hookah out of mouth got down off mushroom crawled away into grass merely remarking a went top will make grow taller stalk will make grow shorter top of what stalk of what thought alice of mushroom said caterpillar just a if have asked aloud in moment be out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at mushroom for minute then picked carefully broke in two taking stalk in one hand top in other illustration doe stalk do said nibbled little bit of to try next moment felt violent blow on chin have struck foot be good deal frightened by very sudden change a did not shrink further have not dropped top of mushroom did not give up hope yet there be hardly room to open mouth with chin pressing against foot did at last managed to bite off little bit of top of mushroom come head free at last said alice in tone of delight changed into alarm in moment when found that shoulder be nowhere to be seen looked down upon immense length of neck seemed to rise like stalk out of sea of green leaf lay far below illustration what can green stuff be said alice where have shoulder got to oh poor hand how be ca' see be moving about a spoke result seemed to follow except little rustling among leaf then tried to bring head down to hand be delighted to find that neck must

god hand on whom shadow of sin outermost fringe of shadow of sorrow have yet fallen will have felt bitter contrast between haunting selfishness spoil best deed life be overflowing love for think child first attitude to world be simple love for living thing will have learned that best work man can do be when work for love sake only with thought of name gain earthly reward deed of ours suppose on side grave be really unselfish yet if one can put forth one power in task where nothing of reward be hoped for little child whispered thanks airy touch of little child pure lip one seems to come somewhere near to there be idea of publication in mind when wrote little book be wholly afterthought pressed on by perhaps too partial friend who always have to bear blame when writer rush into print can truly say that praise of theirs have ever given one hundredth part of pleasure have be to think of sick child in hospital where have be delight to to send copy forgetting for few bright hour pain weariness perhaps thinking lovingly of unknown writer of tale perhaps even putting up childish prayer oh how much need for one who can dimly hope to stand day not quite out of sight of pure young face before great white throne be very sure writes lady visitor at home for sick child that there will be many loving earnest prayer for on easter morning from child must like to quote further from letter a embodying suggestion may perhaps thus come to notice of one able willing to carry out want to send one of easter greeting for very dear child who be dying at home be just fading away 'alice have brightened of weary hour in illness know letter must be such delight to especially if must put beinnie at top must know have sent for know must so value suffers so much that long for what know must so please thank very much for sending letter for writing minnie name be quite sure that child will say loving prayer for 'alice man ' on easter day be sure letter will help little one to real easter joy how do wish that who have won heart confidence of so many child must do for what be so very near heart yet what one will do viz write book for child about god be not goody begin at right end about religion to make see what really be get quite miserable very often over child come across hardly of have idea of really knowing that god love of loving confiding in will love trust be sure that want to be happy will not let suffer more than be necessary a for going to in same way must never think of be dreadfully afraid of if think of at generally only do when have be naughty look on connected with a very grave dull when be full of fun thoroughly happy be sure unconsciously hope be not looking be sure wonder think of in way for people never talk of in connection with what make little life brightest if be naughty people put on solemn face say be very angry shocked something frightens for rest be talked about only in way make think of church having to be quiet a for being taught that joy gladness brightness be joy that be wearying for to be happy be not hard stern always doing thing to make day brighter caring for so tenderly wanting to run to with little joy sorrow be not taught do so long to make trust a trust to feel that will 'take part a do with in little woe to go to in play enjoyment not only when say prayer be quite grateful to one little dot short time ago who said to mother be in bed put out hand to see if can feel jesus angel thought perhaps in dark 'd touch never have yet ' do so want to want to go to to feel how if be there must be happy let add for feel have drifted into far too serious vein for preface to fairy tale deliciously nave remark of very dear child friend whom asked after acquaintance of two three day if have read 'alice 'looking glass ' oh yes replied readily have read of think more slowly thoughtfully think 'through looking glass ' be more stupid than be adventure think so be question felt must be hardly discreet for to enter upon lewis carroll dec easter greeting to child who love alice dear child please to fancy if can that be reading real letter from real friend whom have seen whose voice can seem to to hear wishing a do now with heart happy easter do know delicious dreamy feeling when one first wake on summer morning with twitter of bird in air fresh breeze coming in at open window when lying lazily with eye half shut one see a in dream green bough waving water rippling in golden light be pleasure very near to sadness bringing tear to one eye like beautiful picture poem be not that mother gentle hand undraws curtain mother sweet voice that summons to rise to rise forget in bright sunlight ugly dream frightened so when be dark to rise enjoy happy day first kneeling to thank that unseen friend who sends beautiful sun be strange word from writer of such tale a alice be strange letter to find in book of nonsense may be so perhaps may blame for thus mixing together thing grave gay others may smile think odd that one must speak of solemn thing at except in church on sunday think nay be sure that child will read gently lovingly in spirit in have written for believe god mean thus to divide life into two half to wear grave face on sunday to think out of place to even so much a mention on week day do think care to see only kneeling figure to hear only tone of prayer that doe not also love to see lamb leaping in sunlight to hear merry voice of child a roll among hay surely innocent laughter be a sweet in ear a grandest anthem that ever rolled up from dim religious light of solemn cathedral if have written anything to add to store of innocent healthy amusement be laid up in book for child love so well be surely something may hope to look back upon without shame sorrow a how much of life must then be recalled when turn come to walk through valley of shadow easter sun will rise on dear child feeling life in limb eager to rush out into fresh morning air many easter day will come go before find feeble gray headed creeping wearily out to bask once more in sunlight be good even now to think sometimes of great morning when sun of righteousness will arise with healing in wing surely gladness need not be le for thought that will one day see brighter dawn than when lovelier sight will meet eye than waving tree rippling water when angel hand will undraw curtain sweeter tone than ever loving mother breathed will wake to new glorious day when sadness sin darkened life on little earth will be forgotten like dream of night be past affectionate friend lewis carroll easter christmas greeting
