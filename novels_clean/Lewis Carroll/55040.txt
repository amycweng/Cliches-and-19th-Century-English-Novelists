what do think did actually thought be housemaid began ordering about mary ann said go home very minute fetch pair of glove fan quick now perhaps couldnt see very clearly with pink eye for im sure alice doesnt look very like housemaid doe however be very good natured little girl so wasnt bit offended ran off to rabbit house a quick a must be lucky found door open for if have have to ring suppose real mary ann must have come to open door must never have let alice come in im sure be very lucky didnt meet real mary ann a trotted upstairs for im afraid must have taken alice for robber so at last found way into rabbit room there be pair of glove lying on table be just going to take up go away when happened to see little bottle on table of course have word drink on label of course alice

illustration door opened inwards so of course there wasnt room to open so when rabbit got tired of waiting came to fetch glove for of course couldnt get in so what do think did now come to picture sent bill lizard up to roof of house told to get down chimney alice happened to have one of foot in fire place so when heard bill coming down chimney just gave little tiny kick away went bill flying up into sky poor little bill dont pity very much how frightened must have be dear little puppy well doesnt look such very little puppy doe then see alice have grown very small indeed thats what make puppy look so large when alice have eaten one of little magic cake that found in white rabbit house made get quite small directly so that must get through door else must never have got out of house again wouldnt have be pity because then wouldnt have dreamed other curious thing be going to read about so really be little puppy see isnt little pet look at way barking at little stick that alice be holding out for can see be little afraid of time because shes got behind great thistle for fear must run over must have be just about a bad for a must be for to be run over by waggon four horse have got little pet puppy at home if have hope youre always kind to give nice thing to eat once upon time knew little child about a big a have little pet dog of own be called dash be what told about birthday treat do know one day remembered be dash birthday day so said let give dash nice birthday treat like what have on birthday so thought thought now what be like best of on birthday thought thought at last called out together why oatmeal porridge of course so of course thought dash must be quite sure to like very much too illustration so went to cook got to make saucerful of nice oatmeal porridge then called dash into house said now dash youre going to have birthday treat expected dash must jump for joy didnt one bit so put saucer down before said now dash dont be greedy eat nicely like good dog so dash just tasted with tip of tongue then made oh such horrid face then do know did hate so wouldnt eat bit more of so have to put down throat with spoon wonder if alice will give little puppy porridge dont think can because hasnt got with cant see saucer in picture vii blue caterpillar must like to know what happened to alice after have got away from puppy be far too large animal know for to play with dont suppose must much enjoy playing with young hippopotamus must must always be expecting to be crushed a flat a pancake under great heavy foot so alice be very glad to run away while wasnt looking well wandered up down didnt know what in world to do to make herself grow up to right size again of course knew that have to eat drink something be regular rule know couldnt guess what thing illustration however soon came to great mushroom be so tall that couldnt see over top of without standing on tip toe what do think saw something that im sure never talked to in life be large blue caterpillar ill tell soon what alice caterpillar talked about first let have good look at picture curious thing standing in front of caterpillar be called hookah used for smoking smoke come through long tube that wind round round like serpent do see long nose chin at least look exactly like nose chin dont really be two of leg know caterpillar have got quantity of leg can see more of further down what bother must be to caterpillar counting over lot of leg night to make sure hasnt lost of great bother must be having to settle leg have better move first think if have forty fifty leg if wanted to go walk youd be such time in settling leg to begin with youd never go walk at what did alice caterpillar talk about wonder well alice told how very confusing be being first one size then caterpillar asked if liked size be just then alice said must like to be just little bit larger three inch be such wretched height to be just mark off three inch on wall about length of middle finger youll see what size be caterpillar told one side of mushroom must make grow taller other side must make grow shorter so alice took two little bit of with to nibble managed to make quite nice comfortable height before went on to visit duchess illustration viii pig baby must like to hear about alices visit to duchess be very interesting visit indeed can assure of course knocked at door to begin with nobody came so have to open for now if look at picture youll see exactly what alice saw when got inside door led right into kitchen see duchess sat in middle of room nursing baby baby be howling soup be boiling cook be stirring soup cat be cheshire cat be grinning a cheshire cat always do thing be happening just a alice went in duchess have beautiful cap gown hasnt im afraid hasnt got very beautiful face baby well daresay youve seen several nicer baby than more good tempered one too however take good look at well see if know again next time meet cook well may have seen nicer cook once twice im nearly sure youve never seen nicer cat now have wouldnt like to have cat of own just like one with lovely green eye smiling so sweetly duchess be very rude to alice wonder why even called own baby pig wasnt pig be ordered cook to chop off alices head though of course cook didnt do at last threw baby at so alice caught baby took away with think be about best thing must do so wandered away through wood carrying ugly little thing with great job be to keep hold of wriggled about so at last found out that proper way be to keep tight hold of left foot right ear dont try to hold on to baby like child there be not many baby that like being nursed in way well so baby kept grunting grunting so that alice have to say to quite seriously if youre going to turn into pig dear ill have nothing more to do with mind now at last looked down into face what do think have happened to look at picture see if can guess illustration why thats not baby that alice be nursing be ah knew wouldnt know again though told to take good look at yes be baby turned into little pig so alice put down let trot away into wood said to herself be very ugly baby make rather handsome pig think dont think be right ix cheshire cat alone alone poor alice baby not even pig to keep company so may be sure be very glad indeed when saw cheshire cat perched up in tree over head cat have very nice smile doubt just look what lot of teeth got isnt alice just little shy of well yes little then couldnt help having teeth know must have helped smiling supposing have be cross so on whole be glad doesnt alice look very prim holding head so straight up with hand behind just a if be going to say lesson to cat illustration reminds there little lesson want to teach while be looking at picture of alice cat now dont be in bad temper about dear child very little lesson indeed do see that fox glove growing close to tree do know why called fox glove perhaps think got something to do with fox indeed fox never wear glove right word be folk glove did ever hear that fairy used to be called good folk now weve finished lesson well wait minute till youve got temper again well do feel quite good natured again temper ache crossness about corner of mouth then well go on cheshire pus said alice wasnt that pretty name for cat must tell way ought to go from here so cheshire cat told way ought to go if wanted to visit hatter way to go to visit march hare theyre mad said cat then cat vanished away just like flame of candle when go out so alice set off to visit march hare a went along there be cat again told didnt like coming going so quickly illustration so time cat vanished quite slowly beginning with tail ending with grin wasnt that curious thing grin without cat must like to see one if turn up corner of leaf youll have alice looking at grin doesnt look bit more frightened than when be looking at cat doe x mad tea party be mad tea party see alice have left cheshire cat have gone off to see march hare hatter a cheshire cat have advised found having tea under great tree with dormouse sitting between there be only three at table there be quantity of tea cup set along cant see table

hair for fear people must think youre mad there be nice green arm chair at end of table looked a if be just meant for alice so went sat down in then have quite long talk with march hare hatter dormouse didnt say much see be fast asleep generally only just woke up for moment now then a long a be asleep be very useful to march hare hatter because have nice round soft head just like pillow so must put elbow on lean across talk to other quite comfortably wouldnt like people to use head for pillow must if be fast asleep like dormouse wouldnt feel so suppose care about illustration im afraid gave alice very little to eat drink however after bit helped to tea bread butter only dont quite see where got bread butter have plate for nobody seems to have plate except hatter believe march hare

to child who love alice dear child please to fancy if can that be reading real letter from real friend whom have seen whose voice can seem to to hear wishing a do now with heart happy easter do know

waving water rippling in golden light be pleasure very near to sadness bringing tear to one eye like beautiful picture poem be not that mother gentle hand undraws curtain mother sweet voice that summons to rise to rise forget in bright sunlight ugly dream frightened so when be dark to rise enjoy happy day first kneeling to thank that unseen friend who sends beautiful sun be strange word from writer of such tale a alice be strange letter to find in book of nonsense may be so perhaps may blame for thus mixing together thing grave gay others may smile think odd that one must speak of solemn thing at except in church on sunday think nay be sure that child will read gently lovingly in spirit in have written for believe god mean thus to divide life into two half to wear grave face on sunday to think out of place to even so much a mention on week day do think care to see only kneeling figure to hear only tone of prayer that doe not also love to see lamb leaping in sunlight to hear merry voice of child a roll among hay surely innocent laughter be a sweet in ear a grandest anthem that ever rolled up from dim religious light of solemn cathedral if have written anything to add to store of innocent healthy amusement be laid up in book for child love so well be surely something may hope to look back upon without shame sorrow a how much of life must then be recalled when turn come to walk through valley of shadow easter sun will rise on dear child feeling life in limb eager to rush out into fresh morning air many easter day will come go before find feeble grey headed creeping wearily out to bask once more in sunlight be good even now to think sometimes of great morning when sun of righteousness will arise with healing in wing surely gladness need not be le for thought that will one day see brighter dawn than when lovelier sight will meet eye than waving tree rippling water when angel hand will undraw curtain sweeter tone than ever loving mother breathed will wake to new glorious day when sadness sin darkened life on little earth will be forgotten like dream of night be past affectionate friend lewis carroll christmas greeting from fairy to child lady dear if fairy
