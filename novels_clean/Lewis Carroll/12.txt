beginning to melt away just like bright silvery mist in moment alice be through glass have jumped lightly down into looking glass room very first thing did be to look whether there be fire in fireplace be quite pleased to find that there be real one blazing away a brightly a one have left behind so will be a warm here a be in old room thought alice warmer in fact because therell be one here to scold away from fire oh what fun itll be when see through glass in here cant get at then began looking about noticed that what must be seen from old room be quite common uninteresting that rest be a different a possible for instance picture on wall next fire seemed to be alive very clock on chimney piece know can only see back of in looking glass have got face of little old man grinned at dont keep room so tidy a other alice thought to herself a noticed several of chessman down in hearth among cinder in moment with little oh of surprise be down on hand knee watching chessman be

think can hear went on a put head closer down im nearly sure cant see feel somehow a if be invisible here something began squeaking on table behind alice made turn head just in time to see one of white pawn roll over begin kicking watched with great curiosity to see what must happen next be voice of child white queen cried out a rushed past king so violently that knocked over among cinder precious lily imperial kitten began scrambling wildly up side of fender imperial fiddlestick said king rubbing nose have be hurt by fall have right to be little annoyed with queen for be covered with ash from head to foot alice be very anxious to be of use a poor little lily be nearly screaming into fit hastily picked up queen set on table by side of noisy little daughter queen gasped sat down rapid journey through air have quite taken away breath for minute two must hing little lily in silence a soon a have recovered breath little called out to white king who be sitting sulkily among ash mind volcano what volcano said king looking up anxiously into fire a if thought be most likely place to find one blewmeup panted queen who be still little out of breath mind come upthe regular waydont get blown up alice watched white king a slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last said why youll be hour hour getting to table at rate id far better help hadnt king took notice of question be quite clear that must neither hear see so alice picked up very gently lifted across more slowly than have lifted queen that mightnt take breath away before put on table thought might a well dust little be so covered with ash said afterwards that have never seen in life face a king made when found held in air by invisible hand being dusted be far too much astonished to cry out eye mouth went on getting larger larger rounder rounder till hand shook so with laughing that nearly let drop upon floor oh please dont make such face dear cried out quite forgetting that king couldnt hear make laugh so can hardly hold dont keep mouth so wide open ash will get into itthere now think youre tidy enough added a smoothed hair set upon table near queen king immediately fell flat on back lay perfectly still alice be little alarmed at what have done went round room to see if must find water to throw over however must find nothing bottle of ink when got back with found have recovered queen be talking together in frightened whisperso low that alice must hardly hear what said king be saying assure dear turned cold to very end of whisker to queen replied havent got whisker horror of moment king went on will never never forget will though queen said if dont make memorandum of alice looked on with great interest a king took enormous memorandum book out of pocket began writing sudden thought struck took hold of end of pencil came way over shoulder began writing for poor king looked puzzled unhappy struggled with pencil for time without saying anything alice be too strong for at last panted out dear really must get thinner pencil cant manage one bit writes manner of thing dont intend what manner of thing said queen looking over book in alice have put white knight be sliding down poker balance very badly thats not memorandum of feeling there be book lying near alice on table while sat watching white king for be still little anxious about have ink ready to throw over in case fainted again turned over leaf to find part that must read for in language dont know said to herself be like ykcowrebbaj sevot yhtils eht dna gillirb sawt ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg did sevogorob eht erew lla ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna puzzled over for time at last bright thought struck why looking glass book of course if hold up to glass word will go right way again be poem alice

herself that couldnt make out at somehow seems to fill head with ideasonly dont exactly know what be however somebody killed something thats clear at rate oh thought alice suddenly jumping up if dont make haste will have to go back through looking glass before ive seen what rest of house be like let have look at garden first be out of room in moment ran down stairsor at least wasnt exactly running new invention of hers for getting down stair quickly easily a alice said to herself just kept tip of finger on hand rail floated gently down without even touching stair with foot then floated on through hall must have gone straight out at door in same way if hadnt caught hold of door post be getting little giddy with so much floating in air be rather glad to find walking again in natural way chapter ii garden of live flower must see garden far better said alice to herself if must get to top of hill here path lead straight to itat least doesnt do that after going few yard along path turning several sharp corner suppose will at last how curiously twist more like corkscrew than path well turn go to hill supposeno doesnt go straight back to house well then ill try other way so did wandering up down trying turn after turn always coming back to house do what must indeed once when turned corner rather more quickly than usual ran against before must stop use talking about alice said looking up at house pretending be arguing with im not going in again yet know must have to get through looking glass againback into old roomand thered be end of adventure so resolutely turning back upon house set out once more down path determined to keep straight on till got to hill for few minute went on well be just saying really will do time when path gave sudden twist shook a described afterwards next moment found actually walking in at door oh too bad cried never saw such house for getting in way never however there be hill full in sight so there be nothing to be done start again time came upon large flower bed with border of daisy willow tree growing in middle o tiger lily said alice addressing to one be waving gracefully about in wind wish must talk can talk said tiger lily when there anybody worth talking to alice be so astonished that must not speak for minute quite seemed to take breath away at length a tiger lily only went on waving about spoke again in timid voicealmost in whisper can all flower talk a well a can said tiger lily great deal louder isnt manner for to begin know said rose really be wondering when youd speak said to myself face have got sense in though not clever one still youre right colour that go long way dont care about colour tiger lily remarked if only petal curled up little more shed be right alice didnt like being criticised so began asking question arent sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of there tree in middle said rose what else be good for what must do if danger came alice asked say bough wough cried daisy thats why branch be called bough didnt know cried daisy here began shouting together till air seemed quite full of little shrill voice silence one of cried tiger lily waving passionately from side to side trembling with excitement know cant get at panted bending quivering head towards alice wouldnt dare to do never mind alice said in soothing tone stooping down to daisy who be just beginning again whispered if dont hold tongue ill pick there be silence in moment several of pink daisy turned white thats right said tiger lily daisy be worst of when one speaks begin together enough to make one wither to hear way go on how be can talk so nicely alice said hoping to get into better temper by compliment ive be in many garden before none of flower must talk put hand down feel ground said tiger lily then youll know why alice did so very hard said dont see what have to do with in most garden tiger lily said make bed too softso that flower be always asleep sounded very good reason alice be quite pleased to know never thought of before said opinion that never think at rose said in rather severe tone never saw anybody that looked stupider violet said so suddenly that alice quite jumped for hadnt spoken before hold tongue cried tiger lily a if ever saw anybody keep head under leaf snore away there till know more whats going on in world than if be bud be there more people in garden besides alice said not choosing to notice rose last remark there one other flower in garden can move about like said rose wonder how do youre always wondering said tiger lily shes more bushy than be be like alice asked eagerly for thought crossed mind there little girl in garden somewhere well have same awkward shape a rose said shes redderand petal be shorter think petal be done up close almost like dahlia tiger lily interrupted not tumbled about anyhow like yours thats not fault rose added kindly youre beginning to fade knowand then one cant help one petal getting little untidy alice didnt like idea at so to change subject asked doe ever come out here daresay youll see soon said rose shes one of thorny kind where doe wear thorn alice asked with curiosity why round head of course rose replied be wondering hadnt got too thought be regular rule shes coming cried larkspur hear footstep thump thump thump along gravel walk alice looked round eagerly found that be red queen shes grown good deal be first remark have indeed when alice first found in ash have be only three inch highand here be head taller than alice fresh air doe said rose wonderfully fine air be out here think ill go meet said alice for though flower be interesting enough felt that must be far grander to have talk with real queen cant possibly do said rose must advise to walk other way sounded nonsense to alice so said nothing set off at once towards red queen to surprise lost sight of in moment found walking in at front door again little provoked drew back after looking everywhere for queen whom spied out at last long way off thought must try plan time of walking in opposite direction succeeded beautifully have not be walking minute before found face to face with red queen full in sight of hill have be so long aiming at where do come from said red queen where be going look up speak nicely dont twiddle finger time alice attended to direction explained a well a must that have lost way dont know what mean by way said queen way about here belong to mebut why did come out here at added in kinder tone curtsey while youre thinking what to say save time alice wondered little at be too much in awe of queen to disbelieve ill try when go home thought to herself next time im little late for dinner time for to answer now queen said looking at watch open mouth little wider when speak always say majesty only wanted to see what garden be like majesty thats right said queen patting on head alice didnt like at though when say gardenive seen garden compared with must be wilderness alice didnt dare to argue point went on thought id try find way to top of hill when say hill queen interrupted must show hill in comparison with youd call that valley shouldnt said alice surprised into contradicting at last hill cant be valley know must be nonsense red queen shook head may call nonsense if like said ive heard nonsense compared with must be a sensible a dictionary alice curtseyed again a be afraid from queen tone that be little offended walked on in silence till got to top of little hill for minute alice stood without speaking looking out in direction over countryand most curious country be there be number of tiny little brook running straight across from side to side ground between be divided up into square by number of little green hedge reached from brook to brook declare marked out just like large chessboard alice said at last there ought to be men moving about somewhereand so there be added in tone of delight heart began to beat quick with excitement a went on great huge game of chess thats being playedall over worldif be world at know oh what fun be how wish be one of wouldnt mind being pawn if only might jointhough of course must like to be queen best glanced rather shyly at real queen a said companion only smiled pleasantly said thats easily managed can be white queen pawn if like a lily too young to play youre in second square to begin with when get to eighth square youll be queen just at moment somehow other began to run alice never must quite make out in thinking over afterwards how be that began remembers be that be running hand in hand queen went so fast that be must do to keep up with still queen kept cry faster faster alice felt must not go faster though have not breath left to say so most curious part of thing be that tree other thing round never changed place at however fast went never seemed to pas anything wonder if thing move along with thought poor puzzled alice queen seemed to guess thought for cried faster dont try to talk not that alice have idea of doing that felt a if must never be able to talk again be getting so much out of breath still queen cried faster faster dragged along be nearly there alice managed to pant out at last nearly there queen repeated why passed ten minute ago faster ran on for time in silence with wind whistling in alices ear almost blowing hair off head fancied now now cried queen faster faster went so fast that at last seemed to skim through air hardly touching ground with foot till suddenly just a alice be getting quite exhausted stopped found sitting on ground breathless giddy queen propped up against tree said kindly may rest little now alice looked round in great surprise why do believe weve be under tree whole time everythings just a be of course be said queen what must have well in country said alice still panting little youd generally get to somewhere elseif ran very fast for long time a weve be doing slow sort of country said queen now here see take running can do to keep in same place if want to get somewhere else must run at least twice a fast a id rather not try please said alice im quite content to stay hereonly be so hot thirsty know what youd like queen said good naturedly taking little box out of pocket have biscuit alice thought must not be civil to say though wasnt at what wanted so took ate a well a must be very dry thought have never be so nearly choked in life while youre refreshing said queen ill just take measurement took ribbon out of pocket marked in inch began measuring ground sticking little peg in here there at end of two yard said putting in peg to mark distance will give directionshave biscuit thank said alice one quite enough thirst quenched hope said queen alice did not know what to say to luckily queen did not wait for answer went on at end of three yard will repeat themfor fear of forgetting at end of four will say good bye at end of five will go have got peg put in by time alice looked on with great interest a returned to tree then began slowly walking down row at two yard peg faced round said pawn go two square in first move know so youll go very quickly through third squareby railway must thinkand youll find in fourth square in time well that square belongs to tweedledum tweedledeethe fifth be mostly waterthe sixth belongs to humpty dumptybut make remark ii didnt know have to make onejust then alice faltered out must have said extremely kind of to tell thishowever well suppose saidthe seventh square be foresthowever one of knight will show wayand in eighth square will be queen together feasting fun alice got up curtseyed sat down again at next peg queen turned again time said speak in french when cant think of english for thingturn out toe a walkand remember who be did not wait for alice to curtsey time walked on quickly to next peg where turned for moment to say good bye then hurried on to last how happened alice never knew exactly a came to last peg be gone whether vanished into air whether ran quickly into wood can run very fast thought alice there be way of guessing be gone alice began to remember that be pawn that must soon be time for to move chapter iii looking glass insect of course first thing to do be to make grand survey of country be going to travel through something very like learning geography thought alice a stood on tiptoe in hope of being able to see little further principal riversthere be none principal mountainsim on only one dont think got name principal townswhy what be creature making honey down there cant be beesnobody ever saw bee mile off know for time stood silent watching one of be bustling about among flower poking proboscis into just a if be regular bee thought alice however be anything regular bee in fact be elephantas alice soon found out though idea quite took breath away at first what enormous flower must be be next idea something like cottage with roof taken off stalk put to themand what quantity of honey must make think ill go down andno wont just yet went on checking just a be beginning to run down hill trying to find excuse for turning shy so suddenly itll never do to go down among without good long branch to brush awayand what fun itll be when ask how like walk will sayoh like well enough here came favourite little toss of head only be so dusty hot elephant did tease so think ill go down other way said after pause perhaps may visit elephant later on besides do so want to get into third square so with excuse ran down hill jumped over first of six little brook ticket please said guard putting head in at window in moment everybody be holding out ticket be about same size a people quite seemed to fill carriage now then show ticket child guard went on looking angrily at alice great many voice said together like chorus of song thought alice dont keep waiting child why time be worth thousand pound minute im afraid havent got one alice said in frightened tone there wasnt ticket office where came from again chorus of voice went on there wasnt room for one where came from land there be worth thousand pound inch dont make excuse said guard must have bought one from engine driver once more chorus of voice went on with man drive engine why smoke alone be worth thousand pound puff alice thought to herself then there use in speaking voice didnt join in time a hadnt spoken to great surprise thought in chorus hope understand what thinking in chorus meansfor must confess that dont better say nothing at language be worth thousand pound word will dream about thousand pound tonight know will thought alice time guard be looking at first through telescope then through microscope then through opera glass at last said youre travelling wrong way shut up window went away so young child said gentleman sitting opposite to be dressed in white paper ought to know way shes going even if doesnt know own name goat be sitting next to gentleman in white shut eye said in loud voice ought to know way to ticket office even if doesnt know alphabet there be beetle sitting next to goat be very queer carriage full of passenger altogether a rule seemed to be that must speak in turn went on with shell have to go back from here a luggage alice couldnt see who be sitting beyond beetle hoarse voice spoke next change engine said be obliged to leave off sound like horse alice thought to herself extremely small voice close to ear said might make joke on thatsomething about horse hoarse know then very gentle voice in distance said must be labelled lass with care know after other voice went on what number of people there be in carriage thought alice saying must go by post a shes got head on must be sent a message by telegraph must draw train herself rest of way so on gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forward whispered in ear never mind what say dear take return ticket time train stop indeed shant alice said rather impatiently dont belong to railway journey at alli be in wood just nowand wish must get back there might make joke on said little voice close to ear something about must if must know dont tease so said alice looking about in vain to see where voice came from if youre so anxious to have joke made why dont make one little voice sighed deeply be very unhappy evidently alice must have said something pitying to comfort if must only sigh like other people thought be such wonderfully small sigh that have heard at if hadnt come quite close to ear consequence of be that tickled ear very much quite took off thought from unhappiness of poor little creature know be friend little voice went on dear friend old friend wont hurt though be insect what kind of insect alice inquired little anxiously what really wanted to know be whether must sting not thought wouldnt be quite civil question to ask what then dont little voice began when be drowned by shrill scream from engine everybody jumped up in alarm alice among rest horse who have put head out of window quietly drew in said only brook have to jump over everybody seemed satisfied with though alice felt little nervous at idea of train jumping at however itll take into fourth square thats comfort said to herself in moment felt carriage rise straight up into air in fright caught at thing nearest to hand happened to be goat beard beard seemed to melt away a touched found sitting quietly under treewhile gnat for be insect have be talking to be balancing on twig just over head fanning with wing certainly be very large gnat about size of chicken alice thought still couldnt feel nervous with after have be talking together so long then dont like insect gnat went on a quietly a if nothing have happened like when can talk alice said none of ever talk where come from what sort of insect do rejoice in where come from gnat inquired dont rejoice in insect at alice explained because im rather afraid of themat least large kind can tell name of of of course answer to name gnat remarked carelessly never knew to do whats use of having name gnat said if wont answer to use to said alice useful to people who name suppose if not why do thing have name at cant say gnat replied further on in wood down there theyve got nameshowever go on with list of insect youre wasting time well there horse fly alice began counting off name on finger right said gnat half way up bush youll see rocking horse fly if look made entirely of wood get about by swinging from branch to branch what doe live on alice asked with great curiosity sap sawdust said gnat go on with list alice looked up at rocking horse fly with great interest made up mind that must have be just repainted looked so bright sticky then went on there dragon fly look on branch above head said gnat there youll find snap dragon fly body be made of plum pudding wing of holly leaf head be raisin burning in brandy what doe live on frumenty mince pie gnat replied make nest in christmas box then there butterfly alice went on after have taken good look at insect with head on fire have thought to herself wonder if thats reason insect be so fond of flying into candlesbecause want to turn into snap dragon fly crawling at foot said gnat alice drew foot back in alarm may observe bread butterfly wing be thin slice of bread butter body be crust head be lump of sugar what doe live on weak tea with cream in new difficulty came into alices head supposing couldnt find suggested then must die of course must happen very often alice remarked thoughtfully always happens said gnat after alice be silent for minute two pondering gnat amused meanwhile by humming round round head at last settled again remarked suppose dont want to lose name indeed alice said little anxiously yet dont know gnat went on in careless tone only think how convenient must be if must manage to go home without for instance if governess wanted to call to lesson must call out come here there must have to leave off because there wouldnt be name for to call of course wouldnt have to go know must never do im sure said governess must never think of excusing lesson for if couldnt remember name shed call miss a servant do well if said miss didnt say anything more gnat remarked of course youd miss lesson thats joke wish have made why do wish have made alice asked very bad one gnat only sighed deeply while two large tear came rolling down cheek shouldnt make joke alice said if make so unhappy then came of melancholy little sigh time poor gnat really seemed to have sighed away for when alice looked up there be nothing whatever to be seen on twig a be getting quite chilly with sitting still so long got up walked on very soon came to open field with wood on other side of looked much darker than last wood alice felt little timid about going into however on second thought made up mind to go on for certainly wont go back thought to herself be only way to eighth square must be wood said thoughtfully to herself where thing have name wonder whatll become of name when go in shouldnt like to lose at allbecause theyd have to give must be almost certain to be ugly one then fun must be trying to find creature have got old name thats just like advertisement know when people lose dogsanswers to name of dash have on brass collarjust fancy calling everything met alice till one of answered only wouldnt answer at if be wise be rambling on in way when reached wood looked very cool shady well at rate great comfort said a stepped under tree after being so hot to get into theinto what went on rather surprised at not being able to think of word mean to get under theunder theunder know putting hand on trunk of tree what doe call wonder do believe got namewhy to be sure hasnt stood silent for minute thinking then suddenly began again then really have happened after now who be will remember if can im determined to do being determined didnt help much must say after great deal of puzzling be l know begin with l just then fawn came wandering by looked at alice with large gentle eye didnt seem at frightened here then here then alice said a held out hand tried to stroke only started back little then stood looking at again what do call fawn said at last such soft sweet voice have wish knew thought poor alice answered rather sadly nothing just now think again said that wont do alice thought nothing came of please must tell what call said timidly think that might help little ill tell if youll move little further on fawn said cant remember here so walked on together though wood alice with arm clasped lovingly round soft neck of fawn till came out into open field here fawn gave sudden bound into air shook free from alices arm im fawn cried out in voice of delight dear youre human child sudden look of alarm came into beautiful brown eye in moment have darted away at full speed alice stood looking after almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost dear little fellow traveller so suddenly however know name now said thats comfort alicealicei wont forget again now of finger post ought to follow wonder be not very difficult question to answer a there be only one road through wood two finger post pointed along ill settle alice said to herself when road divide point different way did not seem likely to happen went on on long way wherever road divided there be sure to be two finger post pointing same way one marked to tweedledums house other to house of tweedledee do believe said alice at last that live in same house wonder never thought of beforebut cant stay there long ill just call say how dyou do ask way out of wood if must only get to eighth square before get dark so wandered on talking to herself a went till on turning sharp corner came upon two fat little men so suddenly that must not help starting back in moment recovered feeling sure that must be chapter iv tweedledum tweedledee be standing under tree with arm round others neck alice knew be in moment because one of have dum embroidered on collar other dee suppose theyve got tweedle round at back of collar said to herself stood so still that quite forgot be alive be just looking round to see if word tweedle be written at back of collar when be startled by voice coming from one marked dum if think be wax work said ought to pay know wax work werent made to be looked at for nothing nohow contrariwise added one marked dee if think be alive ought to speak im sure im very sorry be alice must say for word of old song kept ringing through head like ticking of clock must hardly help saying out loud tweedledum tweedledee agreed to have battle for tweedledum said tweedledee have spoiled nice new rattle just then flew down monstrous crow a black a tar barrel frightened hero so quite forgot quarrel know what youre thinking about said tweedledum isnt so nohow contrariwise continued tweedledee if be so might be if be so must be a isnt aint thats logic be thinking alice said very politely be best way out of wood getting so dark must tell please little men only looked at other grinned looked so exactly like couple of great schoolboy alice couldnt help pointing finger at tweedledum saying first boy nohow tweedledum cried out briskly shut mouth up again with snap next boy said alice passing on to tweedledee though felt quite certain must only shout out contrariwise so did youve be wrong cried

spread large umbrella over brother looked up into dont think be said at leastnot under here nohow may rain outside mayif chooses said tweedledee weve objection contrariwise selfish thing thought alice be just going to say good night leave when tweedledum sprang out from under umbrella seized by wrist do see that said in voice choking with passion eye grew large yellow in moment a pointed with trembling finger at small white thing lying under tree only rattle alice said after careful examination of little white thing not rattle snake know added hastily thinking that be frightened only old

perfect scream time tweedledee be trying best to fold up umbrella with in be extraordinary thing to do that quite took off alices attention from angry brother couldnt quite succeed ended in rolling over bundled up in umbrella with only head out there lay opening shutting mouth large eyeslooking more like fish than anything else alice thought of course agree to have battle tweedledum said in

queen voice rising to squeak a went on much be etter be etter be e e etter be e ehh last word ended in long bleat so like sheep alice quite started looked at queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped up in wool alice rubbed eye looked again couldnt make out what have happened at be in shop be that reallywas really sheep be sitting on other side of counter rub a must must make nothing more of be in little dark shop leaning with elbow on counter opposite to be old sheep sitting in arm chair knitting now then leaving off to look at through great pair of spectacle what be want to buy sheep said at last looking up for moment from knitting dont quite know yet alice said very gently must like to look round first if might may look in front of on side if like said sheep cant look round youunless youve got eye at back of head a happened alice have not got so contented with turning round looking at shelf a came to shop seemed to be full of manner of curious thingsbut oddest part of be that whenever looked hard at shelf to make out exactly what have on that particular shelf be always quite empty though others round be crowded a full a must hold thing flow about so here said at last in plaintive tone after have spent minute so in vainly pursuing large bright thing looked sometimes like doll sometimes like work box be always in shelf next above one be looking at one be most provoking of allbut ill tell what added a sudden thought struck ill follow up to very top shelf of itll puzzle to go through ceiling expect even plan failed thing went through ceiling a quietly a possible a if be quite used to be child teetotum sheep said a took up pair of needle youll make giddy soon if go on turning round like be now working with fourteen pair at once alice couldnt help looking at in great astonishment how can knit with so many puzzled child thought to herself get more more like porcupine minute can row sheep asked handing pair of knitting needle a spoke littlebut not on landand not with needle alice be beginning to say when suddenly needle turned into oar in hand found be in little boat gliding along between bank so there be nothing for to do best feather cried sheep a took up pair of needle didnt sound like remark needed answer so alice said nothing pulled away there be something very queer about water thought a now then oar got fast in must hardly come out again feather feather sheep cried again taking more needle youll be catching crab directly dear little crab thought alice must like that didnt hear say feather sheep cried angrily taking up quite bunch of needle indeed did said alice youve said very oftenand very loud please where be crab in water of course said sheep sticking of needle into hair a hand be full feather say why do say feather so often alice asked at last rather vexed im not bird be said sheep youre little goose offended alice little so there be more conversation for minute two while boat glided gently on sometimes among bed of weed made oar stick fast in water worse then ever sometimes under tree always with same tall river bank frowning over head oh please there be scented rush alice cried in sudden transport of delight there really areand such beauty neednt say please to about sheep said without looking up from knitting didnt put there im not going to take em away meantplease may wait pick alice pleaded if dont mind stopping boat for minute how be to stop said sheep if leave off rowing itll stop of so boat be left to drift down stream a must till glided gently in among waving rush then little sleeve be carefully rolled up little arm be plunged in elbow deep to get rush good long way down before breaking offand for while alice forgot about sheep knitting a bent over side of boat with just end of tangled hair dipping into waterwhile with bright eager eye caught at one bunch after of darling scented rush only hope boat wont tipple over said to herself oh what lovely one only couldnt quite reach certainly did seem little provoking almost a if happened on purpose thought that though managed to pick plenty of beautiful rush a boat glided by there be always more lovely one couldnt reach prettiest be always further said at last with sigh at obstinacy of rush in growing so far off a with flushed cheek dripping hair hand scrambled back into place began to arrange new found treasure what mattered to just then that rush have begun to fade to lose scent beauty from very moment that picked even real scented rush know last only very little whileand being dream rush melted away almost like snow a lay in heap at feetbut alice hardly noticed there be so many other curious thing to think about hadnt gone much farther before blade of one of oar got fast in water wouldnt come out again so alice explained afterwards consequence be that handle of caught under chin in spite of series of little shriek of oh oh oh from poor alice swept straight off seat down among heap of rush however wasnt hurt be soon up again sheep went on with knitting while just a if nothing have happened that be nice crab caught remarked a alice got back into place very much relieved to find still in boat be didnt see said alice peeping cautiously over side of boat into dark water wish hadnt let goi must so like to see little crab to take home with sheep only laughed scornfully went on with knitting be there many crab here said alice crab sort of thing said sheep plenty of choice only make up mind now what do want to buy to buy alice echoed in tone be astonished half frightenedfor oar boat river have vanished all in moment be back again in little dark shop must like to buy egg please said timidly how do sell fivepence farthing for onetwopence for two sheep replied then two be cheaper than one alice said in surprised tone taking out purse only must eat if buy two said sheep then ill have one please said alice a put money down on counter for thought to herself mightnt be at nice know sheep took money put away in box then said never put thing into people must never doyou must get for so saying went off to other end of shop set egg upright on shelf wonder why wouldnt do thought alice a groped way among table chair for shop be very dark towards end egg seems to get further away more walk towards let see be chair why got branch declare how very odd to find tree growing here actually here little brook well be very queerest shop ever saw so went on wondering more more at step a everything turned into tree moment came up to quite expected egg to do same chapter vi humpty dumpty however egg only got larger larger more more human when have come within few yard of saw that have eye nose mouth when have come close to saw clearly that be humpty dumpty cant be anybody else said to herself im a certain of a if name be written over face might have be written hundred time easily on enormous face humpty dumpty be sitting with leg crossed like turk on top of high narrow one alice quite wondered how must keep balanceand a eye be steadily fixed in opposite direction didnt take least notice of thought must be stuffed figure after how exactly like egg be said aloud standing with hand ready to catch for be moment expecting to fall very provoking humpty dumpty said after long silence looking away from alice a spoke to be called eggvery said looked like egg sir alice gently explained egg be very pretty know added hoping to turn remark into sort of compliment people said humpty dumpty looking away from a usual have more sense than baby alice didnt know what to say to wasnt at like conversation thought a never said anything to in fact last remark be evidently addressed to treeso stood softly repeated to herself humpty dumpty sat on wall humpty dumpty have great fall king horse king men couldnt put humpty dumpty in place again that last line be much too long for poetry added almost out loud forgetting that humpty dumpty must hear dont stand there chattering to like humpty dumpty said looking at for first time tell name business name be alice stupid enough name humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently what doe mean must name mean something alice asked doubtfully of course must humpty dumpty said with short laugh name mean shape amand good handsome shape be too with name like yours might be shape almost why do sit out here alone said alice not wishing to begin argument why because there nobody with cried humpty dumpty did think didnt know answer to ask dont think youd be safer down on ground alice went on not with idea of making riddle simply in good natured anxiety for queer creature that wall be so very narrow what tremendously easy riddle ask humpty dumpty growled out of course dont think so why if ever did fall offwhich there chance ofbut if did here pursed lip looked so solemn grand that alice must hardly help laughing if did fall went on king have promised mewith very own mouthtoto to send horse men alice interrupted rather unwisely now declare thats too bad humpty dumpty cried breaking into sudden passion youve be listening at doorsand behind treesand down chimneysor couldnt have known havent indeed alice said very gently in book ah well may write such thing in book humpty dumpty said in calmer tone thats what call history of england be now take good look at im one have spoken to king be mayhap youll never see such to show im not proud may shake hand with grinned almost from ear to ear a leant forward a nearly a possible fell off wall in doing so offered alice hand watched little anxiously a took if smiled much more end of mouth might meet behind thought then dont know what must happen to head im afraid must come off yes horse men humpty dumpty went on theyd pick up again in minute must however conversation be going on little too fast let go back to last remark one im afraid cant quite remember alice said very politely in case start fresh said humpty dumpty turn to choose subject talk about just a if be game thought alice so here question for how old did say be alice made short calculation said seven year six month wrong humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly never said word like though meant how old be alice explained if id meant id have said said humpty dumpty alice didnt want to begin argument so said nothing seven year six month humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully uncomfortable sort of age now if youd asked advice id have said leave off at sevenbut too late now never ask advice about growing alice said indignantly too proud other inquired alice felt even more indignant at suggestion mean said that one cant help growing older one cant perhaps said humpty dumpty two can with proper assistance might have left off at seven what beautiful belt youve got on alice suddenly remarked have have quite enough of subject of age thought if really be to take turn in choosing subject be turn now at least corrected on second thought beautiful cravat must have saidno belt meani beg pardon added in dismay for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended began to wish hadnt chosen subject if only knew thought to herself be neck be waist evidently humpty dumpty be very angry though said nothing for minute two when did speak again be in deep growl be amostprovokingthing said at last when person doesnt know cravat from belt know very ignorant of alice said in so humble tone humpty dumpty relented cravat child beautiful one a say present from white king queen there now be really said alice quite pleased to find that have chosen good subject after gave humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully a crossed one knee over other clasped hand round gave mefor un birthday present beg pardon alice said with puzzled air im not offended said humpty dumpty mean what be un birthday present present given when isnt birthday of course

smiling a took out memorandum book worked sum for humpty dumpty took book looked at carefully that seems to be done right began youre holding upside down alice interrupted to be sure be humpty dumpty said gaily a turned round for thought looked little queer a be saying that seems to be done rightthough havent time to look over thoroughly just nowand show that there be three hundred sixty four day when might get un birthday present certainly said alice only one for birthday present know there glory for dont know what mean by glory alice said humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously of course

minute humpty dumpty began again theyve temper of themparticularly verb theyre proudestadjectives can do anything with not verbshowever can manage whole lot of impenetrability thats what say must tell please said alice what that mean now talk like reasonable child said humpty dumpty looking very much pleased meant by impenetrability that weve have enough of subject must be just a well if youd mention what mean to do next a suppose dont mean to stop here rest of life thats great deal to make one word mean alice said in thoughtful tone when make word do lot of work like said humpty dumpty

alice didnt venture to ask what paid with so see cant tell seem very clever at explaining word sir said alice must kindly tell meaning of poem called jabberwocky let hear said humpty dumpty can explain poem be ever inventedand good many havent be invented just yet sounded very hopeful so alice repeated first verse twas brillig slithy toves did gyre gimble in wabe mimsy be borogoves mome

humpty dumpty stretching out one of great hand can repeat poetry a well a other folk if come to oh neednt come to alice hastily said hoping to keep from beginning piece im going to repeat went on

of unsatisfactory repeated aloud a be great comfort to have long word to say of unsatisfactory people ever met never finished sentence for at moment heavy crash shook forest from end to end chapter vii lion unicorn next moment soldier came running through wood at first in two three then ten twenty together at last in such crowd that seemed to fill whole forest alice got behind tree for fear of being run over watched go by thought that in life have never seen soldier so uncertain on foot be always tripping over something other whenever one went down several more always fell over so that ground be soon covered with little heap of men then came horse having four foot managed rather better than foot soldier even stumbled now then seemed to be regular rule that whenever horse stumbled rider fell off instantly confusion got worse moment alice be very glad to get out of wood into open place where found white king seated on ground busily writing in memorandum book ive sent king cried in tone of delight on seeing alice did happen to meet soldier dear a came through wood yes did said alice several thousand must think four thousand two hundred seven thats exact number king said

anglo saxon attitude only got more extraordinary moment while great eye rolled wildly from side to side alarm said king feel faintgive ham sandwich on messenger to alices great amusement opened bag hung round neck handed sandwich to king who devoured greedily sandwich said king there nothing hay left now messenger said peeping into bag hay then king murmured in faint whisper alice be glad to see

market place get best view by old bridge im sure dont know lion growled out a lay down again there be too much dust to see anything what time monster be cutting up cake alice have seated on bank of little brook with great dish on knee be sawing away diligently with knife very provoking said in reply to lion be getting quite used to being called monster ive cut several slice already always join on again dont know how to manage looking glass cake unicorn remarked hand round first cut afterwards sounded nonsense alice very obediently got up carried dish round cake divided into three piece a

kept none for anyhow said lion do like plum cake monster before alice must answer drum began where noise came from couldnt make out air seemed full of rang through through head till felt quite deafened started to foot sprang across little brook in terror have just time to see lion unicorn rise to foot with angry look at being interrupted in feast before dropped to knee put hand over ear vainly trying to shut out dreadful uproar if doesnt drum out of town thought to herself nothing ever will chapter viii own invention after while noise seemed gradually to die away till be dead silence alice lifted up head in alarm there be one to be seen first thought be that must have be dreaming about lion unicorn queer anglo saxon messenger however there be great dish still lying at foot on have tried to cut plum cake so wasnt dreaming after said to herself unlessunless be part of same dream only do hope dream not red king dont like belonging to person dream went on in rather complaining tone ive great mind to go wake see what happens at moment thought be interrupted by loud shouting of ahoy ahoy check knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon brandishing great club just a reached horse stopped suddenly youre prisoner knight cried a tumbled off horse startled a be alice be more frightened for than for herself at moment watched with anxiety a mounted again a soon a be comfortably in saddle began once more youre here voice broke in ahoy ahoy check alice looked round in surprise for new enemy time be white knight drew up at alices side tumbled off horse just a red knight have done then got on again two knight sat looked at other for time without speaking alice looked from one to other in bewilderment shes prisoner know red knight said at last yes then came rescued white knight replied well must fight for then said red knight a took up helmet hung from saddle be something shape of horse head put on will observe rule of battle of course white knight remarked putting on helmet too always do said red knight began banging away at other with such fury that alice got behind tree to be out of way of blow wonder now what rule of battle be said to herself a watched fight timidly peeping out from hiding place one rule seems to be that if one knight hit other knock off horse if miss tumble off himselfand rule seems to be that hold club with arm a if be punch judywhat noise make when tumble just like whole set of fire iron falling into fender how quiet horse be let get on off just a if be table rule of battle that alice have not noticed seemed to be that always fell on head battle ended with falling off in way side by side when got up again shook hand then red knight mounted galloped off be glorious victory wasnt said white knight a came up panting dont know alice said doubtfully dont want to be anybodys prisoner want to be queen so will when youve crossed next brook said white knight ill see safe to end of woodand then must go back know thats end of move thank very much said alice may help off with helmet be evidently more than must manage by however managed to shake out of at last now one can breathe more easily said knight putting back shaggy hair with hand turning gentle face large mild eye to alice thought have never seen strange looking soldier in life be dressed in tin armour seemed to fit very badly have queer shaped little deal box fastened across shoulder upside down with lid hanging open alice looked at with great curiosity see youre admiring little box knight said in friendly tone own inventionto keep clothes sandwich in see carry upside down so that rain cant get in thing can get out alice gently remarked do know lid open didnt know knight said shade of vexation passing over face then thing must have fallen out box be use without unfastened a spoke be just going to throw into bush when sudden thought seemed to strike hung carefully on tree can guess why did that said to alice alice shook head in hope bee may make nest in itthen must get honey youve got bee hiveor something like onefastened to saddle said alice yes very good bee hive knight said in discontented tone one of best kind not single bee have come near yet other thing be mouse trap suppose mouse keep bee outor bee keep mouse out dont know be wondering what mouse trap be for said alice isnt very likely there must be mouse on horse back not very likely perhaps said knight if do come dont choose to have running about see went on after pause a well to be provided for everything thats reason horse have anklet round foot what be for alice asked in tone of great curiosity to guard against bite of shark knight replied invention of own now help on ill go with to end of woodwhats dish for meant for plum cake said alice wed better take with knight said itll come in handy if find plum cake help to get into bag took very long time to manage though alice held bag open very carefully because knight be so very awkward in putting in dish first two three time that tried fell in instead rather tight fit see said a got in last there be so many candlestick in bag hung to saddle be already loaded with bunch of carrot fire iron many other thing hope youve got hair well fastened on continued a set off only in usual way alice said smiling thats hardly enough said anxiously see wind be so very strong here a strong a soup have invented plan for keeping hair from being blown off alice enquired not yet said knight ive got plan for keeping from falling off must like to hear very much first take upright stick said knight then make hair creep up like fruit tree now reason hair fall off be because hang downthings never fall upwards know plan of own invention may try if like didnt sound comfortable plan alice thought for few minute walked on in silence puzzling over idea now then stopping to help poor knight who certainly be not good rider whenever horse stopped did very often fell off in front whenever went on again generally did rather suddenly fell off behind otherwise kept on pretty well except that have habit of now then falling off sideways a generally did on side on alice be walking soon found that be best plan not to walk quite close to horse im afraid youve not have much practice in riding ventured to say a be helping up from fifth tumble knight looked very much surprised little offended at remark what make say that asked a scrambled back into saddle keeping hold of alices hair with one hand to save from falling over on other side because people dont fall off quite so often when theyve have much practice ive have plenty of practice knight said very gravely plenty of practice alice must think of nothing better to say than indeed said a heartily a must went on little way in silence after knight with eye shut muttering to alice watching anxiously for next tumble great art of riding knight suddenly began in loud voice waving right arm a spoke be to keep here sentence ended a suddenly a have begun a knight fell heavily on top of head exactly in path where alice be walking be quite frightened time said in anxious tone a picked up hope bone be broken none to speak of knight said a if didnt mind breaking two three of great art of riding a be saying isto keep balance properly like know let go bridle stretched out arm to show alice what meant time fell flat on back right under horse foot plenty of practice went on repeating time that alice be getting on foot again plenty of practice too ridiculous cried alice losing patience time ought to have wooden horse on wheel that ought doe that kind go smoothly knight asked in tone of great interest clasping arm round horse neck a spoke just in time to save from tumbling off again much more smoothly than live horse alice said with little scream of laughter in spite of must do to prevent ill get one knight said thoughtfully to one twoseveral there be short silence after then knight went on again im great hand at inventing thing now daresay noticed that last time picked up be looking rather thoughtful be little grave said alice well just then be inventing new way of getting over gatewould like to hear very much indeed alice said politely ill tell how came to think of said knight see said to myself only difficulty be with foot head be high enough already now first put head on top of gatethen stand on headthen foot be high enough seethen im over see yes suppose youd be over when be done alice said thoughtfully dont think must be rather hard havent tried yet knight said gravely so cant tell for certainbut im afraid must be little hard looked so vexed at idea alice changed subject hastily what curious helmet youve got said cheerfully be that invention too knight looked down proudly at helmet hung from saddle yes said ive invented better one than thatlike sugar loaf when used to wear if fell off horse always touched ground directly so have very little way to fall seebut there be danger of falling into to be sure happened to onceand worst of be before must get out again other white knight came put on thought be own helmet knight looked so solemn about that alice did not dare to laugh im afraid must have hurt said in trembling voice being on top of head have to kick of course knight said very seriously then took helmet off againbut took hour hour to get out be a fast asas lightning know thats different kind of fastness alice objected knight shook head be kind of fastness with can assure said raised hand in excitement a said instantly rolled out of saddle fell headlong into deep ditch alice ran to side of ditch to look for be rather startled by fall a for time have kept on very well be afraid that really be hurt time however though must see nothing sol of foot be much relieved to hear that be talking on in usual tone kind of fastness repeated be careless of to put man helmet onwith man in too how can go on talking so quietly head downwards alice asked a dragged out by foot laid in heap on bank knight looked surprised at question what doe matter where body happens to be said mind go on working same in fact more head downwards be more keep inventing new thing now cleverest thing of sort that ever did went on after pause be inventing new pudding during meat course in time to have cooked for next course said alice well not next course knight said in slow thoughtful tone certainly not next course then must have to be next day suppose have two pudding course in one dinner well not next day knight repeated a before not next day in fact went on holding head down voice getting lower lower dont believe that pudding ever be cooked in fact dont believe that pudding ever will be cooked yet be very clever pudding to invent what did mean to be made of alice asked hoping to cheer up for poor knight seemed quite low spirited about began with blotting paper knight answered with groan wouldnt be very nice im afraid not very nice alone interrupted quite eagerly youve idea what difference make mixing with other thingssuch a gunpowder sealing wax here must leave have just come to end of wood alice must only look puzzled be thinking of pudding be sad knight said in anxious tone let sing song to comfort be very long alice asked for have heard good deal of poetry day long said knight very very beautiful everybody hears sing iteither brings tear into eye else else what said alice for
