yellow splotch fairyland yes be fairyland said vice warden might a well give hint muttered to lady about going back to morrow eats like shark must hardly do for to mention wife caught idea at once

leave door closed again still noble sonata went pealing through room be arthur masterly touch roused echo thrilled very soul with tender music of immortal pathetique ' be not till last note have died away that tired happy traveler must bring to utter word good night to seek much needed pillow chapter ride on lion next day glided away pleasantly enough partly in settling in new quarter partly in strolling round neighbourhood under arthur guidance trying to form general idea of elveston inhabitant when five o'clock arrived arthur proposed without embarrassment time to take with up to 'the hall ' in order might make acquaintance with earl of ainslie who have taken for season renew acquaintance with daughter lady muriel first impression of gentle dignified yet genial old man be entirely favourable real satisfaction showed on daughter face a met with word be indeed unlooked for pleasure be very soothing for remains of personal vanity failure disappointment of many long year much buffeting with rough world have left in yet noted be glad to note evidence of far deeper feeling than mere friendly regard in meeting with arthur though be a gathered almost daily occurrence conversation between in earl be only occasional sharer have ease spontaneity rarely met with except between very old friend a knew that have not known other for longer period than summer be now rounding into autumn felt certain that 'love love alone must explain phenomenon how convenient must be lady muriel laughingly remarked propos of having insisted on saving trouble of carrying cup of tea across room to earl if cup of tea have weight at then perhaps lady must sometimes be permitted to carry for short distance one can easily imagine situation said arthur where thing must necessarily have weight relatively to other though must have usual weight looked at by desperate paradox said earl tell how must be will never guess well suppose house just a be placed few billion mile above planet with nothing else near enough to disturb of course fall to planet earl nodded of course though might take century to do be five o'clock tea to be going on while said lady muriel other thing said arthur inhabitant must live life grow up die still house must be falling falling falling now a to relative weight of thing nothing can be heavy know except by trying to fall being prevented from doing so grant that granted that well now if take book hold out at arm length of course feel weight be trying to fall prevent if let go fails to floor if be falling together must be trying to fall quicker know for if let go what more must do than fall a hand must be falling too at same rate must never leave for must be to get ahead of in race must never overtake failing floor see clearly said lady muriel make one dizzy to think of such thing how can make do there be more curious idea yet ventured to say suppose cord fastened to house from below pulled down by one on planet then of course house go faster than natural rate of falling furniture with noble self must go on failing at old pace must therefore be left behind practically must rise to ceiling said earl inevitable result of must be concussion of brain to avoid said arthur let have furniture fixed to floor tied down to furniture then five o'clock tea must go on in peace with one little drawback lady muriel gaily interrupted must take cup down with what about tea have forgotten tea arthur confessed that doubt must rise to ceiling unless chose to drink on way think be quite nonsense enough for one while said earl what news doe gentleman bring from great world of london drew into conversation now took more conventional tone after while arthur gave signal for departure in cool of evening strolled down to beach enjoying silence broken only by murmur of sea far away music of fisherman song almost a much a late pleasant talk sat down among rock by little pool so rich in animal vegetable zoophytic be right word life became entranced in study of when arthur proposed returning to lodging begged to be left there for while to watch muse alone fisherman song grew ever nearer clearer a boat stood in for beach must have gone down to see land cargo of fish have not microcosm at foot stirred curiosity yet more keenly one ancient crab be for ever shuffling frantically from side to side of pool have particularly fascinated there be vacancy in stare aimless violence in behaviour that irresistibly recalled gardener who have befriended sylvie bruno a gazed caught concluding note of tune of crazy song silence followed be broken by sweet voice of sylvie must please let out into road what after old beggar again gardener yelled began singing thought saw kangaroo worked coffee mill looked again found be

mental aberration in various direction returned to normal condition of sobriety with exception of small yellowish brown mouse continued to run wildly up down road lashing tail like little lion let follow said sylvie also turned out happy thought mouse at once settled down into business like jog trot with must easily keep pace only phenomenon gave uneasiness be rapid increase in size of little creature be following became moment more more like real lion soon transformation be complete noble lion stood patiently waiting for to come up with thought of fear seemed to occur to child who patted stroked a if have be shetland pony imagethe mouse lion help up cried bruno in moment sylvie have lifted upon broad back of gentle beast seated behind pillion fashion bruno took good handful of mane in

where danger must be way said bruno carefully turning round with face to wood now walk backwards walk gently be frightened oo sha' trip sylvie did trip notwithstanding in fact led in hurry across so many little stick stone that be really wonder poor child must keep on foot at be far too much excited to think of what be doing silently pointed out to bruno best place to lead to so a to get view of whole garden at once be little rising ground about height of potato when have mounted drew back into shade sylvie might see heard bruno cry out triumphantly now oo may look then followed clapping of hand be done by bruno sylvie be silent only stood gazed with hand clasped together be half afraid did like after bruno too be watching anxiously when jumped down off mound began wandering up down little walk cautiously followed about evidently anxious that must form own opinion of without hint from when at last drew long breath gave verdict in hurried whisper without slightest regard to grammar be loveliest thing a never saw in life before little fellow looked a well pleased a if have be given by judge jury in england put together did really do by bruno said sylvie for be helped bit bruno began with merry little laugh at surprise have be at afternoon thought oo 'd like here poor little fellow lip began to quiver in moment burst out cry running up to sylvie flung arm passionately round neck hid face on shoulder there be little quiver in sylvie voice too a whispered why what be matter darling tried to lift up head kiss bruno only clung to sobbing must be comforted till have confessed tried to spoil oor garden first will never never then came burst of tear drowned rest of sentence at last got out word liked putting in flower for oo sylvie never be so happy before rosy little face came up at last to be kissed wet with tear a be sylvie be cry too by time said nothing bruno dear never be so happy before though why two child who have never be so happy before must be cry be mystery to felt very happy too of course did cry big thing never do know leave to fairy only think must have be raining little just then for found drop two on cheek after went through whole garden again flower by flower a if be long sentence be spelling out with kiss for comma great hug by way of full stop when got to end doos oo know be river edge sylvie bruno solemnly began sylvie laughed merrily what do mean said pushed back heavy brown hair with hand looked at with dancing eye in big teardrop be still glittering bruno drew in long breath made up mouth for great effort mean revenge said now oo under'tand looked so happy proud at having said word right at last that quite envied rather think sylvie did under'tand at gave little kiss on cheek seemed to do just a well so wandered off lovingly together in among buttercup with arm twined round other whispering laughing a went never so much a once looked back at poor yes once just before quite lost sight of bruno half turned head nodded saucy little good bye over one shoulder be thanks got for trouble very last thing saw of be sylvie be stooping down with arm round bruno neck saying coaxingly in ear do know bruno have quite forgotten that hard word do say once more come only once dear bruno must try again chapter changed crocodile marvellous mysterious have quite passed out of life for moment common place reigned supreme turned in direction of earl house a be now 'the witching hour ' of five knew must find ready for cup of tea quiet chat lady muriel father gave delightfully warm welcome be not of folk meet in fashionable drawing room who conceal such feeling a may chance to posse beneath impenetrable mask of conventional placidity man with iron mask ' be doubt rarity marvel in own age in modern london one must turn head to give second look no be real people when looked pleased meant that be pleased when lady muriel said with bright smile be very glad to see again knew that be true still did not venture to disobey injunction crazy a felt to be of lovesick young doctor by so much a alluding to existence be only after have given full detail of projected picnic to invited that lady muriel exclaimed almost a after thought do if can bring doctor forester with be sure day in country must do good be afraid study too much be 'on tip of tongue ' to quote word only book be woman look checked just in time with something of feeling of one who have crossed street have be run over by passing 'hansom think have too lonely life went on with gentle earnestness left room to suspect double meaning do get to come forget day tuesday week can drive over must be pity to go by rail there be so much pretty scenery on road open carriage just hold four oh will persuade to come said with confidence thinking must take power of persuasion to keep away picnic be to take place in ten day though arthur readily accepted invitation brought nothing must say must induce to call either with without on earl daughter in meanwhile no feared to wear out welcome said have seen enough of for one while when at last day for expedition arrived be so childishly nervous uneasy thought best so to arrange plan that must go separately to house intention being to arrive time after so a to give time to get over meeting with object purposely made considerable circuit on way to hall a called earl house if must only manage to lose way bit thought to myself must suit capitally in succeeded better sooner than have ventured to hope for path through wood have be made familiar to by many solitary stroll in former visit to elveston how must have so suddenly so entirely lost even though be so engrossed in thinking of arthur lady love that heeded little else be mystery to open place said to myself seems to have memory about can not distinctly recall surely be very spot where saw fairy child hope there be snake about mused aloud taking seat on fallen tree certainly like snake suppose bruno like either no doe like said demure little voice at side be not afraid of know doe like say be too waggly word fail to describe beauty of little group couched on patch of moss on trunk of fallen tree that met eager gaze sylvie reclining with elbow buried in moss rosy cheek resting in palm of hand bruno stretched at foot with head in lap imagefairies resting too waggly be must say in so sudden emergency be not praticular bruno said carelessly do like straight animal best like dog when wag tail sylvie interrupted know do bruno there be more of dog be there mister sir bruno appealed to must like to have dog if have got nuffin head tail admitted that dog of kind must be uninteresting there be such dog a sylvie thoughtfully remarked there must be cried bruno if professor shortened up for shortened up said that be something new how doe do be got curious machine sylvie be beginning to explain welly curious machine bruno broke in not at willing to have story thus taken out of mouth if oo put in finoruvver at one end oo know turn handle come out at uvver end oh ever so short a short a short sylvie echoed one day when be in outland oo know before came to fairyland sylvie took big crocodile shortened up for did look so funny kept looking round saying be rest of got to then eye looked unhappy not eye sylvie interrupted course not said little fellow only eye must see wherever rest of have got to eye must see wherever how short be crocodile asked a story be getting little complicated half a short again a when caught so long said bruno spreading out arm to full stretch tried to calculate what must come to be too hard for please make out for dear child who read did leave poor thing so short a did well sylvie took back again got stretched to to how much be sylvie two time half little bit more said sylvie must like that better than other way be afraid oh did though bruno put in eagerly be proud of new tail oo never saw crocodile so proud why must go round walk on top of tail along back way to head imagea changed crocodile not quite way said sylvie must know ah did once bruno cried triumphantly oo be looking watched walked on tippiety toe so a must wake 'cause thought be asleep got paw on tail walked walked way along back walked walked on forehead walked tiny little way down nose there now be good deal worse than last puzzle please dear child help again believe crocodile never walked along own forehead sylvie cried too much excited by controversy to limit number of negative oo know reason why did bruno scornfully retorted have welly good reason heerd say 'why must walk on own forehead ' so course did oo know if be good reason bruno said why must get up tree will in minute said bruno soon a have done talking only two people ca' talk comfably togevver when one getting up tree other be appeared to that conversation must scarcely be 'comfable while tree be being climbed even if 'peoples be doing be evidently dangerous to oppose theory of bruno so thought best to let question drop to ask for account of machine that made thing longer time bruno be at loss left to sylvie be like mangle said if thing be put in get squoze squeezeled bruno interrupted yes sylvie accepted correction did not attempt to pronounce word be evidently new to get like come out oh ever so long once bruno began again sylvie writed wrote sylvie whispered well wroted nursery song professor mangled longer for be 'there be little man have little gun bullet know rest interrupted must say long mean way that came out of mangle will get professor to sing for said sylvie must spoil to say must like to meet professor said must like to take with to see friend of mine that live near here must like to come think professor must like to come said sylvie be very shy 'd like very much only 'd better not come size know difficulty have occurred to already have felt that perhaps there must be slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny friend into society what size will be enquired 'd better come a common child sylvie thoughtfully replied that be easiest size to manage must come to day said thinking then must have at picnic sylvie considered little not to day replied have got thing ready will come on tuesday next if like now really bruno must come do lesson wi oo must say beally bruno ' little fellow pleaded with pouting lip made look prettier than ever always show be there be something horrid coming wo kiss if be so unkind ah have kissed sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph well then will unkiss threw arm round neck for novel apparently not very painful operation be very like kissing sylvie remarked a soon a lip be again free for speech oo know nuffin about be just conkery bruno replied with much severity a marched away sylvie turned laughing face to will come on tuesday said very well said let be tuesday next where be professor did come with to fairyland said sylvie promised 'd come see day be getting lecture ready so have to stay at home at home said dreamily not feeling quite sure what have said yes sir lordship lady muriel be at home please to walk way chapter three badger still more dreamily found following imperious voice into room where earl daughter arthur be seated so be come at last said lady muriel in tone of playful reproach be delayed stammered though what be that have delayed must have be puzzled to explain luckily question be asked carriage be ordered round hamper containing contribution to picnic be duly stowed away set forth there be need for to maintain conversation lady muriel arthur be evidently on most delightful of term where one have need to check thought after thought a rise to lip with fear will not be appreciated will give ' offence will sound too serious will sound flippant like very old friend in fullest talk rippled on why must desert picnic go in other direction suddenly suggested party of four be surely self sufficing a for food hamper why must what genuine lady argument laughed arthur lady never know on side onus probandi burden of proving lie do men always know asked with pretty assumption of meek docility with one exception only one can think of dr watt who have asked senseless question must deprive neighbour of good against will ' fancy that a argument for honesty position seems to be `` m only honest because see reason to steal ' thief answer be of course complete crushing ' deprive neighbour of good because want do against will because there be chance of getting to consent to ' can give one other exception said argument heard only to day not by lady 'why must walk on own forehead ' what curious subject for speculation said lady muriel turning to with eye brimming over with laughter may know who propounded question did walk on own forehead ca' remember who be that said faltered where heard whoever be hope will meet at picnic said lady muriel be far more interesting question than 'be picturesque ruin ' be autumn tint lovely will have to answer two question ten time at least afternoon be one of misery of society said arthur why ca' people let one enjoy beauty of nature without having to say so minute why must life be one long catechism be just a bad at picture gallery earl remarked went to ra last may with conceited young artist did torment must have minded criticizing picture have to agree with else to argue point must have be worse be depreciatory criticism of course said arthur see 'of course at why did ever know conceited man dare to praise picture one thing dread next to not being noticed be to be proved fallible if once praise picture character for infallibility hang by thread suppose be figure picture venture to say 'draws well ' somebody measure find one of proportion eighth of inch wrong be disposed of a critic 'did say draw well ' friend enquire sarcastically while hang head blush no only safe course if one say 'draws well ' be to shrug shoulder well repeat thoughtfully 'draws well humph ' be way to become great critic thus airily chatting after pleasant drive through few mile of beautiful scenery reached rendezvous ruined castle where rest of picnic party be already assembled spent hour two in sauntering about ruin gathering at last by common consent into few random group seated on side of mound commanded good view of old castle surroundings momentary silence that ensued be promptly taken possession of more correctly taken into custody by voice voice so smooth so monotonous so sonorous that one felt with shudder that other conversation be precluded that unless desperate remedy be adopted be fated to listen to lecture of man must foresee end speaker be broadly built man whose large flat pale face be bounded on north by fringe of hair on east west by fringe of whisker on south by fringe of beard whole constituting uniform halo of stubbly whitey brown bristle feature be so entirely destitute of expression must not help saying to myself helplessly a if in clutch of night mare be only penciled in final touch a yet have way of ending sentence with sudden smile spread like ripple over vast blank surface be gone in moment leaving behind such absolute solemnity felt impelled to murmur be not be somebody else that smiled do observe such be phrase with wretch began sentence do observe way in that broken arch at very top of ruin stand out against clear sky be placed exactly right there be exactly enough of little more little le must be utterly spoiled imagea lecture on art oh gifted architect murmured arthur inaudibly to lady muriel foreseeing exact effect work must have when in ruin century after death do observe where tree slope down hill indicating with sweep of hand with patronising air of man who have arranged landscape how mist rising from river fill up exactly interval where need indistinctness for artistic effect here in foreground few clear touch be not amiss back ground without mist know be simply barbarous yes need indistinctness orator looked so pointedly at a uttered word felt bound to reply by murmuring something to effect hardly felt need that enjoyed looking at thing better when must see quite so great man sharply took up from point of view be correctly put for anyone who have soul for art view be preposterous nature be one thing art be nature show world a be art a latin author tell art know word have escaped memory ar est celare naturam arthur interposed with delightful promptitude quite so orator replied with air of relief thank ar est celare naturam be for few peaceful moment orator brooded frowningly over quotation welcome opportunity be seized voice struck into silence what lovely old ruin be cried young lady in spectacle very embodiment of march of mind looking at lady muriel a proper recipient of really original remark admire autumn tint on tree do intensely lady muriel shot meaning glance at replied with admirable gravity oh yes indeed indeed so true be strange said young lady passing with startling suddenness from sentiment to science that mere impact of certain coloured ray upon retina must give such exquisite pleasure have studied physiology then certain young doctor courteously enquired oh yes be sweet science arthur slightly smiled seems paradox doe not went on that image formed on retina must be inverted be puzzling candidly admitted why be see thing upside down have never heard theory then that brain also be inverted indeed what beautiful fact how be proved thus replied arthur with gravity of ten professor rolled into one what call vertex of brain be really base what call base be really vertex be simply question of nomenclature last polysyllable settled matter how truly delightful fair scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm will ask physiological lecturer why never gave that exquisite theory 'd give something to be present when question be asked arthur whispered to a at signal from lady muriel moved on to where hamper have be collected devoted ourselves to more substantial business of day 'waited ' on ourselves a modern barbarism combining two good thing in such way a to secure discomfort of advantage of of having picnic with servant to wait upon have not yet reached out of way region of course gentleman did not even take place until lady have be duly provided with imaginable creature comfort then supplied with plate of something solid glass of something fluid found place next to lady muriel have be left vacant apparently for arthur a distinguished stranger have turned shy have placed next to young lady in spectacle whose high rasping voice have already cast loose upon society such ominous phrase a man be bundle of quality objective be only attainable through subjective arthur be bearing bravely several face wore look of alarm thought high time to start le metaphysical topic in nursery day began when weather did suit for out of door picnic be allowed to have peculiar kind that enjoyed hugely table cloth be laid under table instead of upon sat round on floor believe really enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than ever did orthodox arrangement have doubt of lady muriel replied there be nothing well regulated child hate so much a regularity believe really healthy boy must thoroughly enjoy greek grammar if only might stand on head to learn carpet dinner certainly spared one feature of picnic be to chief drawback chance of shower suggested chance rather certainty of live thing occurring in combination with one food spider be bugbear now father have sympathy with sentiment have dear for earl have caught word turned to listen to suffering be men replied in sweet sad tone seemed natural to have pet aversion will never guess lady muriel said with delicate silvery laugh be music to ear declined to attempt impossible doe like snake said in stage whisper now be that unreasonable aversion fancy not liking such dear coaxingly clingingly affectionate creature a snake not like snake exclaimed be such thing possible no doe like repeated with pretty mock gravity be not afraid of know doe like say be too waggly be more startled than liked to show there be something so uncanny in echo of very word have so lately heard from little forest sprite that be only by great effort succeeded in saying carelessly let banish so unpleasant topic wo sing something lady muriel know do sing without music only song know without music be desperately sentimental be afraid be tear ready quite ready quite ready came from side lady muriel not being one of lady singer who think de rigueur to decline to sing till have be petitioned three four time have pleaded failure of memory loss of voice other conclusive reason for silence began at once image'three badger on mossy stone there be three badger on mossy stone beside dark covered way dream monarch on throne so stay stay though old father languishes alone stay stay stay there be three herring loitering around longing to share that mossy seat herring try to sing what have found that make life seem so sweet thus with grating uncertain sound bleat bleat bleat mother herring on salt sea wave sought vainly for absent one father badger writhing in cave shrieked out son shalt have bun shrieked 'if will behave yea bun bun bun ' fear ' said 'your son have gone astray daughter left while slept 'yes be ' badger said 'it a say ' 'they must be better kept ' thus poor parent talked time away wept wept wept here bruno broke off suddenly herring song want anuvver tune sylvie said ca' sing not wizout oo play for image'three badger writhing in cave instantly sylvie seated upon tiny mushroom happened to grow in front of daisy a if be most ordinary musical instrument in world played on petal a if be note of organ such delicious tiny music be such teeny tiny music bruno held head on one side listened very gravely for few moment until have caught melody then sweet childish voice rang out once more oh dear beyond dearest dream fairer than fairest seems to feast rosy hour away to revel in roundelay how blest must be life so free ipwergis pudding to consume drink subtle azzigoom if in other day hour mid other fluff other flower choice be given how to dine 'name what thou wilt shalt be thine ' oh then see life for ipwergis pudding to consume drink subtle azzigoom oo may leave off playing now sylvie can do uvver tune much better wizout compliment mean 'without accompaniment ' sylvie whispered smiling at puzzled look pretended to shut up stop of organ badger did not care to talk to fish did not dote on herring song never have experienced dish to name belongs oh to pinch tail be wish tongs yea tongs tongs ought to mention that marked parenthesis in air with finger seemed to very good plan know there be sound to represent more than there be for question suppose have said to friend be better to day that want to understand that be asking question what can be simpler than just to make in air with finger must understand in moment image'those aged one waxed gay 'and be not fish ' eldest sighed 'whose mother dwells beneath foam 'they be fish ' second one replied 'and have left home ' wicked fish ' youngest badger cried 'to roam yea roam roam ' gently badger trotted to shore sandy shore fringed bay in mouth living herring bore aged one waxed gay clear rang voice through ocean roar 'hooray hooray hooray ' so got safe home again bruno said after waiting minute to see if have anything to say evidently felt that remark ought to be made must help wishing there be such rule in society at conclusion of song that singer herself must say right thing not leave to audience suppose young lady have just be warbling grating uncertain sound ' shelley exquisite lyric arise from dream of thee how much nicer must be instead of having to say oh thank thank for young lady to remark a draw on glove while impassioned word 'oh press to thine own will break at last be still ringing in ear must do know so did break at last knew must added quietly

lady muriel be speaker for moment be only fact must clearly realise how came to be there how came to be there how glass of champagne came to be there be question felt better to think out in silence not commit to statement till understood thing little more clearly 'first accumulate mass of fact then construct theory that believe be true scientific method sat up rubbed eye began to accumulate fact smooth grassy slope bounded at upper end by venerable ruin half buried in ivy at lower by stream seen through arching tree dozen gaily dressed people seated in little group here there open hamper

grouped in two in three arthur be alone while tongue be talking be silent while face be gay be gloomy despondent here be fact indeed researcher felt that theory must be constructed without delay lady muriel have just risen left party must be cause of despondency theory hardly rose to dignity of working hypothesis clearly more fact be needed researcher looked round once more now fact accumulated in such bewildering profusion that theory be lost among for lady muriel have gone to meet strange gentleman just visible in distance now be returning with of talking eagerly joyfully like old friend who have be long parted now be moving from group to group introducing new hero of hour young tall handsome moved gracefully at side with erect bearing firm tread of soldier verily theory looked gloomy for arthur eye caught mine crossed to be very handsome said abominably handsome muttered arthur then smiled at own bitter word lucky one heard doctor forester said lady muriel who have just joined let introduce to cousin eric lindon captain lindon must say arthur shook off ill temper instantly completely a rose gave young soldier hand have heard of said be very glad to make acquaintance of lady muriel cousin yes be be distinguished for a yet said eric so soon got to call with winning smile doubt glancing at lady muriel if even amount to good conduct badge be something to begin with must come

chapter how to make phlizz week passed without further communication with 'hall a arthur be evidently fearful that might 'wear out welcome when on sunday morning be setting out for church gladly agreed to proposal to go round enquire after earl who be said to be unwell eric who be strolling in garden gave good report of invalid who be still in bed with lady muriel in attendance be coming with to church enquired thanks courteously replied be not exactly in line know be excellent institution for poor when be with own folk go just to set example be not known here so think will excuse sitting out sermon country preacher be always so dull arthur be silent till be out of hearing then said to almost inaudibly where two three be gathered together in name there be in midst of yes assented doubt be principle on church going rest when doe go continued thought ran so much together that conversation be often slightly elliptical suppose repeat word believe in communion of saint by time have reached little church into goodly stream of worshiper consisting mainly of fisherman family be flowing service must have be pronounced by modern aesthetic religionist religious aesthete be to be crude cold to coming fresh from ever advancing development of london church under soi disant 'catholic rector be unspeakably refreshing there be theatrical procession of demure little chorister trying best not to simper under admiring gaze of congregation people share in service be taken by people unaided except that few good voice judiciously posted here there among kept singing from going too far astray there be murdering of noble music contained in bible liturgy by recital in dead monotone with more expression than mechanical talking doll no prayer be prayed lesson be read best of sermon be talked found repeating a left church word of jacob when 'awaked out of sleep ' beurely lord be in place be none other house of god be gate of heaven ' yes said arthur apparently in answer to thought 'high service be fast becoming pure formalism more more people be beginning to regard a 'performances in only 'assist ' in french sense be specially bad for little boy 'd be much le self conscious a pantomime fairy with dressing up stagy entrance exit being always en evidence wonder if be eaten up with vanity blatant little coxcomb when passed hall on return found earl lady muriel sitting out in garden eric have gone for stroll joined conversation soon turned on sermon have just heard subject of be beelfishness what change have come over pulpit arthur remarked since time when paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue 'the doing good to mankind in obedience to will of god for sake of everlasting happiness ' lady muriel looked at enquiringly seemed to have learned by intuition what year of experience have taught that way to elicit arthur deepest thought be to assent dissent simply to listen at time went on great tidal wave of selfishness be sweeping over human thought right wrong have somehow be transformed into gain loss religion have become sort of commercial transaction may be thankful that preacher be beginning to take nobler view of life be not taught again again in bible ventured to ask not in bible a whole said arthur in old testament doubt reward punishment be constantly appealed to a motif for action that teaching be best for child israelite seem to have be mentally utter child guide child thus at first appeal a soon a possible to innate sense of right wrong when stage be safely past appeal to highest motive of desire for likeness to union with supreme good think will find to be teaching of bible a whole beginning with 'that thy day may be long in land ending with 'be ye perfect even a father be in heaven be perfect ' be silent for awhile then arthur went off on tack look at literature of hymn now how cankered be through through with selfishness there be few human composition more utterly degraded than modern hymn quoted stanza lord tend to thee repaid thousandfold will be then gladly will give to thee giver of yes said grimly be typical stanza very last charity sermon heard be infected with after giving many good reason for charity preacher wound up with 'and for give will be repaid thousandfold ' oh utter meanness of such motive to be put before men who do know what self sacrifice be who can appreciate generosity heroism talk of original sin went on with increasing bitterness can have stronger proof of original goodness there must be in nation than fact that religion have be preached to a commercial speculation for century that still believe in god must have gone on so long lady muriel musingly remarked if opposition have be practically silenced put under what french call la cloture surely in lecture hall in private society such teaching must soon have be hooted down trust so said arthur though want to see 'brawling in church legalised must say that preacher enjoy enormous privilege ill deserve misuse terribly put man into pulpit virtually tell 'now may stand there talk to for hour wo interrupt by so much a word will have own way what doe give in return willow twaddle that if be addressed to over dinner table must think 'does man take for fool ' return of eric from walk checked tide of arthur eloquence after few minute talk on more conventional topic took leave lady muriel walked with to gate have given much to think about said earnestly a gave arthur hand be so glad came in word brought real glow of pleasure into pale worn face of on tuesday a arthur did not seem equal to more walking took long stroll by having stipulated that be not to give whole day to book be to meet at hall at about tea time on way back passed station just a afternoon train came in sight sauntered down stair to see

little progress at last by sudden question betrayed cause of disquiet must let look at flower have in hand willingly said handing bouquet botany be knew favourite study of flower be to so entirely new mysterious be really curious to see what botanist must say of did not diminish disquiet on contrary became moment more excited a turned over be from central india said laying aside part of bouquet be

sylvie who gravely silently laid finger on lip then beckoned to bruno to follow ran out into garden found in position of defendant whose two most important witness have be suddenly taken away let give flower stammered out at last quite wit end ' a to how to get out of difficulty know much more about than do accept most gratefully have not yet told earl be beginning when be interrupted to great relief by arrival of eric lindon to arthur however new comer be saw clearly anything welcome face clouded over drew little back from circle took further part in conversation be wholly maintained for minute by lady muriel lively cousin who be discussing new music have just arrived from london do just try one pleaded music look easy to sing at sight song quite appropriate to occasion then suppose

to think of to think of when be far away ' look of displeasure have begun to come over arthur face when young captain spoke of love so lightly faded away a song proceeded listened with evident delight face darkened again when eric demurely remarked think bey soldier lad ' must have fitted tune just a well why so must lady muriel gaily retorted soldier sailor tinker tailor what lot of word must fit in think bey tinker lad sound best to spare friend further pain rose to go just a earl be beginning to repeat particularly embarrassing question about flower have not yet ' yes have have tea thank hastily interrupted now really must be going good evening lady muriel made adieu escaped while earl be still absorbed in examining mysterious bouquet lady muriel accompanied to door must have given

know how will go nosegay be only phlizz know bruno made up last word be in whisper a evidently did not wish arthur to hear of there seemed to be little risk hardly seemed to notice child paced on silent abstracted when at entrance to wood bid hasty farewell ran off seemed to wake out of day dream bouquet vanished a sylvie have predicted when day two afterwards arthur once more visited hall found earl daughter with old housekeeper out in garden examining fastening of drawing room window be holding inquest lady muriel said advancing to meet admit a accessory before fact to tell know about flower accessory before fact decline to answer question gravely replied reserve defence well then turn be evidence please flower have disappeared in night went on turning to arthur be quite sure one in house have meddled with somebody must have entered by window fastening have not be tampered with said earl must have be while be dining lady said housekeeper be said earl thief must have seen bring flower turning to have noticed that did not take away must have known great value be simply priceless exclaimed in sudden excitement never told how got said lady muriel day stammered may be free to tell just now must excuse earl looked disappointed kindly said very well will ask question imagefive o'clock tea consider very bad queen evidence lady muriel added playfully a entered arbour pronounce to be accomplice sentence to solitary confinement to be fed on bread butter do take sugar be disquieting certainly resumed when 'creature comfort have be duly supplied to find that house have be entered by thief in out of way place if only flower have be eatable one might have suspected thief of quite shape mean that universal explanation for mysterious disappearance cat did ' said arthur yes replied what convenient thing must be if thief have same shape be so confusing to have of quadruped others biped have occurred to said arthur a curious problem in teleology science of final cause added in answer to enquiring look from lady muriel final cause be well suppose say last of series of connected event of series being cause of next for whose sake first event take place last event be practically effect of first be yet call cause of arthur pondered moment word be rather confusing grant said will do last event be effect of first necessity for event be cause of necessity for first seems clear enough said lady muriel now let have problem be merely what object can imagine in arrangement by different size roughly speaking of living creature have special shape for instance human race have one kind of shape biped set ranging from lion to mouse be quadruped go down step two further come to insect with six leg hexapod beautiful name be not beauty in sense of word seems to diminish a go down creature becomes more wo say 'ugly ' of of god creature more uncouth when take microscope go few step lower still come upon animalculae terribly uncouth with terrible number of leg other alternative said earl must be diminuendo series of repetition of same type never mind monotony of let see how must work in other way begin with race of men creature require let say horse cattle sheep dog exactly require frog spider do muriel lady muriel shuddered perceptibly be evidently painful subject can dispense with said gravely well then will have second race of men yard high who must have one source of exquisite enjoyment not possessed by ordinary men arthur interrupted what source said earl why grandeur of scenery surely grandeur of mountain to depends on size relative to double height of mountain of course be twice a grand halve height produce same effect happy happy happy small lady muriel murmured rapturously none short none short none short enjoy tall let go on said earl will have third race of men five inch high fourth race inch high must eat common beef mutton be sure lady muriel interrupted true child be forgetting set must have own cattle sheep own vegetation added what must cow inch high do with grass waved far above head be true must have pasture within pasture so to speak common grass must serve inch high cow a green forest of palm while round root of tall stem must stretch tiny carpet of microscopic grass yes think scheme will work fairly well must be very interesting coming into contact with race below sweet little thing inch high bull dog must be doubt if even muriel must run away from one of think ought to have crescendo series a well said lady muriel only fancy being hundred yard high one must use elephant a paper weight crocodile a pair of scissors must have race of different size communicate with one enquired must make war on one for instance enter into treaty war must exclude think when must crush whole nation with one blow of fist must conduct war on equal term anything involving collision of mind only must be possible in ideal world for of course must allow mental power to irrespective of size perhaps fairest rule must be that smaller race greater must be intellectual development do mean to say said lady muriel that manikin of inch high be to argue with surely surely said earl argument doe depend for logical force on size of creature utters tossed head indignantly must not argue with man le than six inch high cried 'd make work what at said arthur listening to nonsense with amused smile embroidery readily replied what lovely embroidery must do yet if did wrong said must argue question know why agree that must be done reason be said lady muriel one must sacrifice one dignity so far of course one must echoed arthur more than one must argue with potato must be altogether excuse ancient pun infra dig doubt said even pun doe quite convince well if be not reason said lady muriel what reason must give tried hard to

instantaneous change be startling two figure seemed to flash back into former place be suited can coom back good night t'ye one of be saying so whole dialogue be repeated when have parted for second time let go several way strolled on through town real usefulness of magic power thought must be to undo harm painful event accident have not long to wait for opportunity of testing property also of magic watch for even a thought passed through mind accident be imagining occurred light cart be standing at door of 'great millinery depot ' of elveston laden with card board packing case driver be carrying into shop one by one one of case have fallen into street scarcely seemed worth while to step forward pick up a man must be back again in moment yet in moment young man riding bicycle came

into shop head be cut bleeding one knee seemed to be badly injured be speedily settled that have better be conveyed at once to only surgery in place helped in emptying cart placing in pillow for wounded man to rest on be only when driver have mounted to place be starting for surgery bethought of strange power possessed of undoing harm now be time said to a moved back hand of watch saw almost without surprise time thing restored to place have occupied at critical moment when have first noticed fallen packing case instantly stepped out into street picked up box replaced in cart in next moment bicycle have spun round corner passed cart without let hindrance soon vanished in distance in cloud of dust delightful power of magic thought how much of human suffering have not only relieved actually annihilated in glow of conscious virtue stood watching unloading of cart still holding magic watch open in hand a be curious to see what must happen when again reached exact time at have put back hand result be one that if only have considered thing carefully might have foreseen a hand of watch touched mark spring cart have driven off be by time way down street be back again at door in act of starting while oh woe for golden dream of world wide benevolence have dazzled dreaming fancy wounded youth be once more reclining on heap of pillow pale face set rigidly in hard line told of pain resolutely endured oh mocking magic watch said to a passed out of little town took seaward road led to lodging good fancied must do be vanished like dream evil of troublesome world be only abiding reality now must record experience so strange that think only fair before beginning to relate to release much enduring reader from obligation may feel to believe part of story must not have believed freely confess if have not seen with own eye then why must expect of reader who quite possibly have never seen anything of sort be passing pretty little villa stood rather back from road in own ground with bright flower bed in front creeper wandering over wall hanging in festoon about bow window easy chair forgotten on lawn with newspaper lying near small pug dog couchant before resolved to guard treasure even at sacrifice of life front door standing invitingly half open here be chance thought for testing reverse action of magic watch pressed beversal peg ' walked in in house entrance of stranger might cause surprise perhaps anger even going so far a to expel said stranger with violence here knew nothing of sort must happen ordinary course of event first to think nothing about then hearing footstep to look up see then to wonder what business have there must be reversed by action of watch must first wonder who be then see then look down think more about a to being expelled with violence event must necessarily come first in case so if can once get in said to myself risk of expulsion will be over image'the pug dog sat up ' pug dog sat up a precautionary measure a passed a took notice of treasure be guarding let go by without even one remonstrant bark take life seemed to be saying wheezily to take trash take daily telegraph awful contingency did not face party in drawing

accustomed to action of watch smile ceased a browning say on four pretty face got out piece of needle work sat down one noticed in least a quietly took chair sat down to watch when needle work have be unfolded be ready to begin mother said come be done at last may fold up work girl child took notice whatever of remark on contrary set to work at once sewing if be proper word to describe operation such a have never before witnessed of threaded needle with short end of thread attached to work be instantly pulled by invisible force through stuff dragging needle after nimble finger of little sempstress caught at other side only to lose again next moment so work went on steadily undoing neatly stitched little dress be steadily falling to piece now then one of child must pause a recovered thread became inconveniently long wind on bobbin start again with short end at last work be picked to piece put away lady led way into next room walking backwards making insane remark not yet dear must get sewing done first after be not surprised to see child skipping backwards after exclaiming oh mother be such lovely day for walk in dining room table have only dirty plate empty dish on

hypercritical reader resolute to believe item of weird adventure what need to tell how mutton be placed on spit slowly unroasted how potato be wrapped in skin handed over to gardener to be buried how when mutton have at length attained to rawness fire have gradually changed from red heat to mere blaze died down so suddenly that cook have only just time to catch last flicker on end of match how maid having taken mutton off spit carried backwards of course out of house to meet butcher who be coming also backwards down road longer thought over strange adventure more hopelessly tangled mystery became be real relief to meet arthur in road get to go with up to hall to learn what news telegraph have brought told a went what have happened at station a to further adventure thought best for

again a went home till be in house have lit bed room candle then said more to than to heart knoweth own bitterness never understood word now next few day passed wearily enough felt inclination to call by at hall still le to propose that arthur must go with seemed better to wait till time gentle healer of bitterest sorrow must have helped to recover from first shock of disappointment have blighted life business however soon demanded presence in town have to announce to arthur must leave for while hope to run down again in month added must stay now if must think be good for to be alone ca' face

completed tour be down in ditch there said sylvie amusing young frog went down on hand knee to look for for felt very curious to know how young frog ought to be amused after minute search found sitting at edge of ditch by side of little frog looking rather disconsolate how be getting on bruno said nodding to a looked up ca' amuse more bruno answered very dolefully 'cause wo say what must like to do next have showed duck weed live caddis worm wo say nuffin what must oo like ' shouted into ear of frog little creature sat quite still took notice of be deaf think bruno said turning away with sigh be time to get theatre ready who be audience to be only frog said bruno have comed yet want to be drove up like sheep must save time suggested if be to walk round with sylvie to drive up frog while get theatre ready be good plan cried bruno where be sylvie be here said sylvie peeping over edge of bank be just watching two frog be having race won bruno eagerly inquired sylvie be puzzled doe ask such hard question confided to what be to happen in theatre asked first have birthday feast sylvie said then bruno doe bit of shakespeare then tell story must think frog like feast best well there be generally very few of get will keep mouth shut so tight be just a well do added because bruno like to cook cook very queerly now be in must just help to put with head right way soon managed part of business though frog kept up most discontented croaking time what be saying asked sylvie be saying fork ' be very silly of be not going to have fork announced with severity want feast have just got to open mouth bruno will put of in at moment bruno appeared wearing little white apron to show that be cook carrying tureen full of very queer looking soup watched very carefully a moved about among frog must not see that of opened mouth to be fed except one very young one be nearly sure did accidentally in yawning however bruno instantly put large spoonful of soup into mouth poor little thing coughed violently for time so sylvie have to share soup between to pretend to enjoy for certainly be very queerly cooked only ventured to take one spoonful of sylvie summer soup bruno said be must candidly confess that be not at nice must not feel surprised that so many of guest have kept mouth shut up tight what be soup made of bruno said sylvie who have put spoonful of to lip be making wry face over bruno answer be anything encouraging bit of thing entertainment be to conclude with bit of shakespeare a sylvie expressed be to be done by bruno sylvie being fully engaged in making frog keep head towards stage after bruno be to appear in real character tell story of own invention will story have moral to asked sylvie while bruno be away behind hedge dressing for first 'bit think so sylvie replied doubtfully there generally be moral only put in too soon will say bit of shakespeare no will only act said sylvie know hardly of word when see what be dressed like have to tell frog what character be be always in such hurry to guess hear saying 'what what ' so indeed be have only sounded like croaking till sylvie explained must now make out wawt wawt quite distinctly why do try to guess before see know sylvie said always do sometimes begin guessing week week before day so now when hear frog croaking in particularly melancholy way may be sure be trying to guess bruno next shakespeare 'bit be that interesting however chorus of guessing be cut short by bruno who suddenly rushed on from behind scene took flying leap down among frog to re arrange for oldest fattest frog who have never be properly arranged so that must see stage so have idea what be going on be getting restless have upset several of frog turned others round with head wrong way be good at bruno said to do 'bit ' of shakespeare when there be nobody to look at see did count a anybody so set to work with stick stirring up very much a must stir up tea in cup till most of have at least one great stupid eye gazing at stage oo must come sit among sylvie said in despair have put two side by side with nose same way ever so many time do squarrel so so sylvie took place a beistress of ceremony bruno vanished again behind scene to dress for first 'bit ' hamlet be suddenly proclaimed in clear sweet tone knew so well croaking ceased in moment turned to stage in curiosity to see what bruno idea be a to behaviour of shakespeare greatest character according to eminent interpreter of drama hamlet wore short black cloak chiefly used for muffling up face a if suffered good deal from toothache turned out toe very much a walked to be not to be hamlet remarked in cheerful tone then turned head over heel several time cloak dropping off in performance felt little disappointed bruno conception of part seemed so wanting in dignity wo say more of speech whispered to sylvie think not sylvie whispered in reply generally turn head over heel when doe know more word bruno have meanwhile settled question by disappearing from stage frog instantly began inquiring name of next character will know directly cried sylvie a adjusted two three young frog have struggled round with back to stage macbeth added a bruno re appeared macbeth have something twisted round went over one shoulder under other arm be meant believe for scotch plaid have thorn in hand held out at arm length a if be little afraid of be dagger macbeth inquired in puzzled sort of tone instantly chorus of thorn thorn arose from frog have quite learned to understand croaking by time be dagger sylvie proclaimed in peremptory tone hold tongue croaking ceased at once shakespeare have not told so far a know that macbeth have such eccentric habit a turning head over heel in private life bruno evidently considered quite essential part of character left stage in series of somersault however be back again in few moment having tucked under chin end of tuft of wool probably left on thorn by wandering sheep made magnificent beard reached nearly down to foot shylock sylvie proclaimed beg pardon hastily corrected king lear have noticed crown bruno have very cleverly provided one fitted exactly by cutting out centre of dandelion to make room for head king lear folded arm to imminent peril of beard said in mild explanatory tone ay inch king then paused a if to consider how must best be proved here with possible deference to bruno a shakespearian critic must express opinion that poet did not mean three great tragic hero to be so strangely alike in personal habit do believe that must have accepted faculty of turning head over heel a proof at of royal descent yet appeared that king lear after deep meditation must think of other argument by to prove kingship a be last of 'bits of shakespeare never do more than three sylvie explained in whisper bruno gave audience quite long series of somersault before finally retired leaving enraptured frog cry out more more suppose be way of encoring performance bruno must appear again till proper time came for telling story imagethe frog birthday treat when appeared at last in real character noticed remarkable change in behaviour tried more somersault be clearly opinion that however suitable habit of turning head over heel might be to such petty individual a hamlet king lear must never do for bruno to sacrifice dignity to extent be equally clear that did not feel entirely at ease standing alone on stage with costume to disguise though began several time there be mouse kept glancing up down on side a if in search of more comfortable quarter from to tell story standing on one side of stage partly overshadowing be tall foxglove seemed a evening breeze gently swayed hither thither to offer exactly sort of accommodation that orator desired having once decided on quarter needed only second two for to run up stem like tiny squirrel to seat astride on topmost bend where fairy bell clustered most closely from whence must look down on audience from height that shyness vanished began story merrily once there be mouse crocodile man goat lion have never heard 'dramatis persona ' tumbled into story with such profusion in such reckless haste fairly took breath away even sylvie gave little gasp allowed three of frog who seemed to be getting tired of entertainment to hop away into ditch without attempting to stop mouse found shoe thought be mouse trap so got right in stayed in ever so long why did stay in said sylvie function seemed to be much same a of chorus in greek play have to encourage orator draw out by series of intelligent question 'cause thought must get out again bruno explained be clever mouse knew must get out of trap why did go in at said sylvie jamp jamp bruno proceeded ignoring question at last got right out again looked at mark in shoe man name be in so knew be own shoe have thought be said sylvie why did tell oo thought be mouse trap indignant orator replied please mister sir will oo make sylvie attend sylvie be silenced be attention in fact be most of audience now a frog kept hopping away there be very few of left so mouse gave man shoe man be welly glad cause have got one shoe be hopping to get other here ventured on question do mean 'hopping ' 'hoping ' bofe said bruno man took goat out of sack have heard of sack before said wo hear of again said bruno said to goat will walk about here till come back went tumbled into deep hole goat walked round round walked under tree wug tail looked up in tree sang sad little song oo never heard sad little song can sing bruno asked

cut anything out besides relentlessly erasing be unsuitable on score of reverence decency must be inclined to omit also seems too difficult not likely to interest young reader resulting book might be slightly fragmentary must be real treasure to british maiden who have taste for poetry if be needful to apologize to one for new departure have taken in story by introducing along with what will hope prove to be acceptable nonsense for child of graver thought of human life must be to one who have learned art of keeping such thought wholly at distance in hour of mirth careless ease to mixture will

announcing sudden death of dear friend incubus that men have striven to shake off few more interesting subject of enquiry must be found by student of history than various weapon have be used against
