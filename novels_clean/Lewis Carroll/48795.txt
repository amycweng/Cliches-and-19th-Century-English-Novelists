done in previous volume morality of sport with special reference to letter have received from lover of sport in point out many great advantage men get from try to prove that suffering inflicts on animal be too trivial to be regarded when came to think subject out to arrange whole of argument pro con found much too large for treatment here day hope to publish essay on subject at present will content with stating net result have arrived at be that god have given to man absolute right to take life of other animal for reasonable cause such a supply of food that have not given to man right to inflict pain unless when necessary that mere pleasure advantage doe not constitute such necessity consequently that pain inflicted for purpose of sport be cruel therefore wrong find far more complex question than have supposed that case on side of sportsman be much stronger one than have supposed so for present say more about objection have be raised to severe language have put into mouth of arthur at p on subject of sermon at pp on subject of choral service chorister have already protested against assumption that be ready to endorse opinion of character in story in two instance admit that be much in sympathy with arthur in opinion far too many sermon be expected from preacher a consequence great many be preached be not worth listening to a consequence of be very apt not to listen reader of paragraph probably heard sermon last sunday morning well let if can name text state how preacher treated then a to chorister other accessoriesof music vestment procession cwhich have come along with into fashionwhile freely admitting that ritual movement be sorely needed that have effected vast improvement in church service have become dead dry to last degree hold that like many other desirable movement have gone too far in opposite direction have introduced many new danger for congregation new movement involves danger of learning to think that service be done for that bodily presence be need contribute for clergy congregation alike involves danger of regarding elaborate service a end in of forgetting that be simply mean very hollowest of mockery unless bear fruit in life for chorister seems to involve danger of self conceit a described at p danger of regarding part of service where help be not required a not worth attending to danger of coming to regard service a mere outward forma series of posture to be assumed of word to be said sung while thought be elsewhereand danger of familiarity breeding contempt for sacred thing let illustrate last two form of danger from own experience not long ago attended cathedral service be placed immediately behind row of men member of choir must not help noticing that treated lesson a part of service to needed not to give attention a affording convenient opportunity for arranging music book c c also have frequently seen row of little chorister after marching in procession to place kneel down a if about to pray rise from knee after minute spent in looking about being too evident that attitude be mere mockery surely be very dangerous for child to thus accustom to pretend to pray a instance of irreverent treatment of holy thing will mention custom doubt many of reader have noticed in church where clergy choir enter in procession viz at end of private devotion be carried on in vestry be of course inaudible to congregation final amen be shouted loud enough to be heard through church serf a signal to congregation to prepare to rise when procession appears admits of dispute that be for purpose that be thus shouted when remember to whom that amen be really addressed consider that be here used for same purpose a one of church bell must surely admit that be piece of gross irreverence to be much a if be to see bible used a footstool a instance of danger for clergy introduced by new movement let mention fact that according to experience clergyman of school be specially apt to retail comic anecdote in most sacred name wordssometimes actual text from bibleare used a theme for jesting many such thing be repeated a having be originally said by child whose utter ignorance of evil must doubt acquit in sight of god of blame must be otherwise for who consciously use such innocent utterance a material for unholy mirth let add however most earnestly that fully believe that profanity be in many case unconscious environment a have tried to explain at p make difference between man man rejoice to think that many of profane storieswhich find so painful to listen to must feel sin to repeatgive to ear pain to conscience shock that can utter not le sincerely than two prayer hallowed be thy name from hardness of heart contempt of thy word commandment good lord deliver to must desire to add for sake for own keble beautiful petition help day to live more nearly a pray be in fact for consequencesfor grave danger to speaker to hearer involvesrather than for what be in mourn over clerical habit of profanity in social talk to believing hearer brings danger of loss of reverence for holy thing by mere act of listening to enjoying such jest also temptation to retail for amusement of others to unbelieving hearer brings welcome confirmation of theory religion be fable in spectacle of accredited champion thus betraying trust to speaker must surely bring danger of loss of faith for surely such jest if uttered with consciousness of harm must necessarily be also uttered with consciousness at moment of reality of god a living being who hears say who allows habit of thus uttering holy word with thought of meaning be too likely to find for god have become myth heaven poetic fancythat for light of life be gone that be at heart atheist lost in darkness may be felt there be fear at present time increasing tendency to irreverent treatment of name of god of subject connected with religion of theatre be helping downward movement by gross caricature of clergyman put upon stage of clergy be helping by showing that can lay aside spirit of reverence along with surplice can treat a jest when outside church name thing to pay almost superstitious veneration when inside salvation army have fear with best intention done much to help by coarse familiarity with treat holy thing surely one who desire to live in spirit of prayer hallowed be thy name ought to do what can however little may be to check so have gladly taken unique opportunity however unfit topic may seem for preface to book of kind to express thought have weighed on mind for long time did not expect when wrote preface to vol

bring to write come soon always welcome letter follows arthur seemed so like arthur speaking that gave quite thrill of pleasure at once began preparation needed for journey chapter ii love curfew fayfield junction change for elveston what subtle memory must there be linked to commonplace word caused flood of happy thought to fill brain dismounted from carriage in state of joyful excitement for must not at first account true have taken very journey at same hour of day six month ago many thing have happened since then old man memory have slender hold on recent event sought missing link in vain suddenly caught sight of benchthe only one provided on cheerless platformwith lady seated on whole forgotten scene flashed upon a vividly a if be happening over again yes thought bare platform be for rich with memory of dear friend be sitting on very bench invited to share with quotation from shakespearei forget what ill try earl plan for dramatisation of life fancy figure to be lady muriel wont undeceive too soon so strolled along platform resolutely making believe a child say that casual passenger seated on bench be lady muriel remembered so well be facing away from aided elaborate cheatery be practising on though be careful in passing spot to look other way in order to prolong pleasant illusion be inevitable that when turned to walk back again must see who be be lady muriel illustration spend for whole scene now returned vividly to memory to make repetition of stranger still there be same old man whom remembered seeing so roughly ordered off by station master to make room for titled passenger same with difference no longer tottering feebly along platform actually seated at lady muriels side in conversation with yes put in purse be saying remember youre to spend for minnie mind bring something nice thatll do real good give love so intent be on saying word although sound of footstep have made lift head look at did not at first recognise raised hat a approached then there flashed across face genuine look of joy so exactly recalled sweet face of sylvie when last met in kensington garden felt quite bewildered rather than disturb poor old man at side rose from seat joined in walk up down platform for minute two conversation be a utterly trivial commonplace a if be merely two casual guest in london drawing room of seemed to shrink just at first from touching on deeper interest linked life together elveston train have drawn up at platform while talked in obedience to station master obsequious hint of way lady time up be making best of way towards end contained sole first class carriage be just passing now empty bench when lady muriel noticed lying on purse in gift have just be so carefully bestowed owner of unconscious of loss be being helped into carriage at other end of train pounced on instantly poor old man cried mustnt go off think he lost let run with can go quicker than said be already half way down platform flying running be much too mundane word for such fairy like motion at pace left possible effort of mine hopelessly in rear be back again before have well completed audacious boast of speed in running be saying quite demurely a entered carriage really think must have done quicker indeed replied plead guilty of gross exaggeration throw on mercy of court court will overlook itfor once then manner suddenly changed from playfulness to anxious gravity be not looking best said with anxious glance in fact think look more of invalid than when left very much doubt if london agrees with may be london air said may be hard workor rather lonely life anyhow ive not be feeling very well lately elveston will soon set up again arthur prescriptionhes doctor know heard from morningis plenty of ozone new milk pleasant society pleasant society said lady muriel with pretty make believe of considering question well really dont know where can find for have so few neighbour new milk can manage do get of old friend mr hunter up there on hill side may rely upon quality little bessie come to school day pass lodging so must be very easy to send ill follow advice with pleasure said ill go arrange about tomorrow know arthur will want walk youll find quite easy walkunder three mile think well now that weve settled point let retort own remark upon dont think youre looking quite best daresay not replied in low voice sudden shadow seemed to overspread face ive have trouble lately matter about ive be long wishing to consult couldnt easily write about im so glad to have opportunity do think began again after minute silence with visible embarrassment of manner most unusual in that promise deliberately solemnly given be always bindingexcept of course where fulfilment must involve actual sin cant think of other exception at moment said that branch of casuistry be usually believe treated a question of truth untruth surely be principle eagerly interrupted always thought bible teaching about consisted of such text a lie not one to have thought about point replied seems to that essence of lying be intention of deceiving if give promise fully intending to fulfil be certainly acting truthfully then if afterwards break doe not involve deception can not call untruthful pause of silence ensued lady muriels face be hard to read looked pleased thought also puzzled felt curious to know whether question have a began to suspect bearing on breaking off of engagement with captain now major lindon have relieved from great fear said thing be of course wrong somehow what text must quote to prove wrong enforce payment of debt if promise something to b b have claim upon a sin if break promise seems to more analogous to stealing than to lying new way of looking at itto said seems true way also however wont deal in generality with old friend like for be old friend somehow do know think began a old friend said with playfulness of tone ill accorded with tear glistened in eye thank very much for saying so replied like to think of a old friend though dont look must have be almost necessary sequence with other lady seemed to have long passed out of time when compliment such triviality be possible here train paused at station where two three passenger entered carriage so no more be said till have reached journey end on arrival at elveston readily adopted suggestion that must walk up together so a soon a luggage have be duly taken charge ofhers by servant who met at station mine by one of porterswe set out together along familiar lane now linked in memory with so many delightful association lady muriel at once recommenced conversation at point where have be interrupted knew of engagement to cousin eric did also hear yes interrupted anxious to spare pain of giving detail heard have come to end must like to tell how happened said a be very point want advice about have long realised that be not in sympathy in religious belief idea of christianity be very shadowy even a to existence of god life in sort of dreamland have not affected life feel sure now that most absolute atheist may be leading though walking blindfold pure noble life if knew good deed broke off suddenly turned away head entirely agree with said have not saviour own promise that life will surely lead to light yes know said in broken voice still keeping head turned away so told said must believe for sake if must wished for sake must see thing a did be wrong went on passionately god can not approve such low motif a still be not that broke off knew loved have promised then be that broke off released unconditionally faced again now having quite recovered usual calmness of manner then what difficulty remains be dont believe did of own free will now supposing did against will merely to satisfy scruple must not claim on remain just a strong a ever must not promise be a binding a ever father say cant help fearing be biased by love for ive asked one else have many friendsfriends for bright sunny weather not friend for cloud storm of life not old friend like let think little said for minute walked on in silence while pained to heart at seeing bitter trial have come upon pure gentle soul strove in vain to see way through tangled skein of conflicting motif if love truly seemed at last to grasp clue to problem be not that for voice of god may not hope that be sent to even a ananias be sent to saul in blindness that may receive sight once more seemed to hear arthur whispering what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband broke silence with word if still love truly hastily interrupted at leastnot in way believe loved when promised be very young be hard to know whatever feeling be be dead now motive on side be love on mine isduty again there be long silence whole skein of thought be tangled worse than ever time broke silence dont misunderstand said when said heart be not did not mean be one el at present feel bound to till know be absolutely free in sight of god to love other than ill never even think of one elsein way mean must die sooner have never imagined gentle friend capable of such passionate utterance ventured on further remark until have nearly arrived at hall gate longer reflected clearer became to that call of duty demanded sacrificepossibly of happiness of lifewhich seemed ready to make tried to make clear to also adding warning on danger surely awaited union in mutual love be wanting only argument for worth considering said in conclusion seems to be supposed reluctance in releasing from promise have tried to give to argument full weight conclusion be that doe not affect right of case invalidate release have given belief be that be entirely free to act a now seems right be very grateful to said earnestly believe please cant put into proper word subject be dropped by mutual consent only learned long afterwards that discussion have really served to dispel doubt have harassed so long parted at hall gate found arthur eagerly awaiting arrival before parted for night have heard whole storyhow have put off journey from day to day feeling that must not go away from place till fate have be irrevocably settled by wedding taking place how preparation for wedding excitement in neighbourhood have suddenly come to end have learned from major lindon who called to wish good bye that engagement have be broken off by mutual consent how have instantly abandoned plan for going abroad have decided to stay on at elveston for year two at rate till newly awakened hope must prove true false how since memorable day have avoided meeting with lady muriel fearing to betray feeling before have have sufficient evidence a to how regarded be nearly six week since happened said in conclusion can meet in ordinary way now with need for painful allusion must have written to tell only kept hoping from day to day thatthat there must be more to tell how must there be more foolish fellow fondly urged if never even go near do expect offer to come from arthur be betrayed into smile no said hardly expect that im desperate coward there doubt about what reason have heard of for breaking off engagement good many arthur replied proceeded to count on finger first be found that be dying ofsomething so broke off then be found that be dying ofsome other thing so broke off then major turned out to be confirmed gamester so earl broke off then earl insulted so major broke off got good deal broken off thing considered have on very best authority of course oh certainly communicated in strictest confidence defect elveston society suffers from want of information isnt one of reticence seems seriously do know real reason im quite in dark did not feel that have right to enlighten so changed subject to le engrossing one of new milk agreed must walk over next day to hunter farm arthur undertaking to set part of way after have to return to keep business engagement chapter iii streak of dawn next day proved warm sunny started early to enjoy luxury of good long chat before must be obliged to leave neighbourhood have more than due proportion of very poor remarked a passed group of hovel too dilapidated to deserve name of cottage few rich arthur replied give more than due proportion of help in charity so balance be kept suppose earl doe good deal give liberally have not health strength to do more lady muriel doe more in way of school teaching cottage visiting than must like to reveal then at least be not one of idle mouth one so often meet with among upper class have sometimes thought must have hard time of if suddenly called on to give raison dtre to show cause why must be allowed to live longer whole subject said arthur of what may call idle mouth mean person who absorb of material wealth of communityin form of food clothes so onwithout contributing equivalent in form of productive labour be complicated one doubt ive tried to think out seemed to that simplest form of problem to start with be community without money who buy sell by barter only make yet simpler to suppose food other thing to be capable of keeping for many year without spoiling yours be excellent plan said what be solution of problem commonest type of idle mouth said arthur be doubt due to money being left by parent to own child so imagined maneither exceptionally clever exceptionally strong industriouswho have contributed so much valuable labour to need of community that equivalent in clothes c be say five time a much a needed for can not deny absolute right to give superfluous wealth a chooses so if leaf four child behind say two son two daughter with enough of necessary of life to last life time can not see that community be in way wronged if choose to hing in life to eat drink be merry most certainly community must not fairly say in reference to if man will not work neither let eat reply must be crushing labour have already be done be fair equivalent for food be eating have have benefit of on what principle of justice can demand two quota of work for one quota of food yet surely said there be something wrong somewhere if four people be well able to do useful work if work be actually needed by community elect to sit idle think there be said arthur seems to to arise from law of godthat one will do a much a can to help othersand not from right on part of community to exact labour a equivalent for food have already be fairly earned suppose second form of problem be where idle mouth posse money instead of material wealth yes replied arthur think simplest case be that of paper money gold be form of material wealth bank note be merely promise to hand over so much material wealth when called upon to do so father of four idle mouth have done let say five thousand pound worth of useful work for community in return for community have given what amounted to written promise to hand over called upon to do so five thousand pound worth of food c then if only us one thousand pound worth leaf rest of note to child surely have full right to present written promise to say hand over food for equivalent labour have be already done now think case well worth stating publicly clearly must like to drive into head of socialist who be priming ignorant pauper with such sentiment a look at bloated haristocrats doing not stroke o work for theirselves living on sweat of brow must like to force to see that money haristocrats be spending represents so much labour already done for community whose equivalent in material wealth be due from community might not socialist reply much of money doe not represent honest labour at if must trace back from owner to owner though might begin with several legitimate step such a gift bequeathing by will value received must soon reach owner who have moral right to have got by fraud other crime of course successor in line must have better right to than have doubt doubt arthur replied surely that involves logical fallacy of proving too much be quite a applicable to material wealth a be to money if once begin to go back beyond fact that present owner of certain property came by honestly to ask whether previous owner in past age got by fraud must property be secure after minute thought felt obliged to admit truth of general conclusion arthur continued from mere standpoint of human right man against man be thisthat if wealthy idle mouth who have come by money in lawful way even though not one atom of labour represents have be own doing chooses to spend on own need without contributing labour to community from whom buy food clothes community have right to interfere with quite thing when come to consider divine law measured by standard man be undoubtedly doing wrong if fails to use for good of in need strength skill that god have given that strength skill belong to community to be paid to a debt belong to man to be used for own enjoyment do belong to god to be used according to will be not left in doubt a to what will be do good lend hoping for nothing again anyhow said idle mouth very often give away great deal in charity in so called charity corrected excuse if seem to speak uncharitably must not dream of applying term to individual must say generally that man who gratifies fancy occurs to himdenying in nothingand merely give to poor part even of superfluous wealth be only deceiving if call charity even in giving away superfluous wealth may be denying miser pleasure in hoarding grant that gladly said arthur given that have that morbid craving be doing good deed in restraining even in spending on persisted typical rich man often doe good by employing people who must otherwise be out of work be often better than pauperising by giving money im glad youve said that said arthur must not like to quit subject without exposing two fallacy of statementwhich have gone so long uncontradicted that society now accepts a axiom be said dont even see one one be merely fallacy of ambiguitythe assumption that doing good be benefiting somebody be necessarily good thing to do be right thing other be assumption that if one of two specified act be better than be necessarily good act in must like to call fallacy of comparisonmeaning that assumes that what be comparatively good be therefore positively good then what be test of good act that will be best arthur confidently replied even then be unprofitable servant let illustrate two fallacy nothing illustrates fallacy so well a extreme case fairly come under suppose find two child drowning in pond rush in save one of child then walk away leaving other to drown clearly have done good in saving child life again supposing meet inoffensive stranger knock down walk on clearly be better than if have proceeded to jump upon break rib buts be quite unanswerable said must like instance from real life well let take one of abomination of modern society charity bazaar interesting question to think outhow much of money reach object in view be genuine charity whether even be spent in best way subject need regular classification analysis to understand properly must be glad to have analysed said have often puzzled well if be really not boring let suppose charity bazaar to have be organised to aid fund of hospital that b c give service in making article to sell in acting a salesman while x y z buy article money so paid go to hospital there be two distinct specie of such bazaar one where payment exacted be merely market value of good supplied be exactly what must have to pay at shop other where fancy price be asked must take separately first market value case here b c be exactly in same position a ordinary shopkeeper only difference being that give proceeds to hospital practically be giving skilled labour for benefit of hospital seems to to be genuine charity dont see how must use better x y z be exactly in same position a ordinary purchaser of good to talk of charity in connection with share of business be sheer nonsense yet be very likely to do so secondly case of fancy price here think simplest plan be to divide payment into two part market value excess over that market value part be on same footing a in first case excess be have to consider well b c earn so may put out of question be gift from x y z to hospital opinion be that be not given in best way far better buy what choose to buy give what choose to give a two separate transaction then there be chance that motive in giving may be real charity instead of mixed motivehalf charity half self pleasing trail of serpent be over therefore be that hold such spurious charity in utter abomination ended with unusual energy savagely beheaded with stick tall thistle at road side behind be startled to see sylvie bruno standing caught at arm too late to stop whether stick reached not must not feel sure at rate took not smallest notice of smiled gaily nodded to saw at once that be only visible to eerie influence have not reached to arthur why did try to save said thats not wheedling secretary of charity bazaar only wish be added grimly doos oo know that stick went right froo head said bruno have run round to by time have secured hand just under chin be glad arent thistle well weve threshed that subject out anyhow arthur resumed im afraid ive be talking too much for patience for strength must be turning soon be about end of tether take o boatman thrice thy fee take give willingly for invisible to thee spirit twain have crossed with quoted involuntarily for utterly inappropriate irrelevant quotation laughed arthur be ekalled by few excelled by none strolled on a passed head of lane led down to beach noticed single figure moving slowly along seaward be good way off have back to be lady muriel unmistakably knowing that arthur have not seen a have be looking in other direction at gathering rain cloud made remark tried to think of plausible pretext for sending back by sea opportunity instantly presented im getting tired said dont think must be prudent to go further have better turn here turned with for few step a again approached head of lane said a carelessly a must dont go back by road too hot dusty down lane along beach be nearly a short youll get breeze off sea yes think will arthur began at moment came into sight of lady muriel checked too far round yet certainly must be cooler stood hesitating looking first one way then othera melancholy picture of utter infirmity of purpose how long humiliating scene must have continued if have be only external influence be impossible to say for at moment sylvie with swift decision worthy of napoleon took matter into own hand go drive up way said to bruno ill get along took hold of stick that arthur be carrying gently pulled down lane be totally unconscious that will own be acting on stick appeared to think have taken horizontal position simply because be pointing with be not orchis under hedge there said think that decides ill gather a go along illustration be not orchis meanwhile bruno have run on beyond lady muriel with much jumping about shouting shout audible to one sylvie much a if be driving sheep managed to turn round make walk with eye demurely cast upon ground in direction victory be ours since be evident that lover thus urged together must meet in minute turned walked on hoping that sylvie bruno must follow example a felt sure that fewer spectator better must be for arthur good angel

will never forget marvellous flower will bring if possibly can said how to fulfil promise mused to myself on way back to lodging be problem entirely beyond skill chapter viii in shady place ten day glided swiftly away day before great party be to take place arthur proposed that must stroll down to hall in time for afternoon tea hadnt better go alone suggested surely will be very much de trop well itll be kind of experiment said fiat experimentum in corpore vili added with graceful bow of mock politeness towards unfortunate victim see will have to bear sight to morrow night of lady love making agreable to everybody except right person will bear agony better if have dress rehearsal beforehand part in play being apparently that of sample wrong person well arthur said musingly a set forth there such part in regular company heavy father that wont do thats filled already singing chambermaid well first lady double that part comic old man youre not comic enough after im afraid there part for well dressed villain only with critical side glance im leetle uncertain about dress found lady muriel alone earl having gone out to make call at once resumed old term of intimacy in shady arbour where tea thing seemed to be always waiting only novelty in arrangement one lady muriel seemed to regard a entirely matter of course be that two of chair be placed quite close together side by side strange to say be not invited to occupy of have be arranging a came along about letter writing arthur began will want to know how be enjoying swiss tour of course must pretend be of course meekly assented skeleton in cupboard suggested be always difficulty quickly put in when youre traveling about when there be cupboard in hotel however be very portable one will be neatly packed in nice leather case please dont think about writing said when youve anything more attractive on hand delight in reading letter know well how tiring be to write be sometimes arthur assented for instance when youre very shy of person have to write to doe that show in letter lady muriel enquired of course when hear one talkingyou for instancei can see how desperately shy be can see that in letter well of course when hear one talk fluentlyyou for instanceyou can see how desperately un shy isnot to say saucy shyest most intermittent talker must seem fluent in letter writing may have taken hour to compose second sentence there be close after first then letter dont express that might express thats merely because system of letter writing be incomplete shy writer ought to be able to show that be so why shouldnt make pause in writing just a must do in speaking might leave blank spacessay page at time very shy girlif there be such thingmight write sentence on first sheet of letterthen put in couple of blank sheetsthen sentence on fourth sheet so on quite foresee that wei mean clever little boy lady muriel said to evidently with kind wish to bring into conversation be going to become famousof course invention be common property nowfor new code of rule for letter writing please invent more little boy well thing greatly needed little girl be way of expressing that dont mean anything explain little boy surely can find difficulty in expressing total absence of meaning mean that must be able when dont mean thing to be taken seriously to express wish for human nature be so constituted that write seriously be taken a joke mean a joke be taken seriously at rate be so in writing to lady ah youre not used to writing to lady lady muriel remarked leaning back in chair gazing thoughtfully into sky must try very good said arthur how many lady may begin writing to a many a can count on finger of hand a many a can count on thumb of one hand lady love replied with much severity what very naughty little boy be isnt with appealing glance at he little fractious said perhaps he cutting tooth while to myself said how exactly like sylvie talking to bruno want tea naughty little boy volunteered information he getting very tired at mere prospect of great party to morrow then will have good rest beforehand soothingly replied tea isnt made yet come little boy lean well back in chair think about nothingor about whichever prefer same same arthur sleepily murmured watching with loving eye a moved chair away to tea table began to make tea then hell wait for tea like good patient little boy will bring london paper said lady muriel saw lying on table a came out father said there be nothing in except horrid murder trial society be just then enjoying daily thrill of excitement in studying detail of specially sensational murder in thief den in east of london have appetite for horror arthur replied hope have learned lesson must teach usthough be very apt to read backwards illustration be sitting at foot speak in riddle said lady muriel please explain see now suiting action to word be sitting at foot just a if be second gamaliel thanks be to who have risen to bring chair back to former place pray dont disturb tree grass make very nice easy chair what be lesson one always read wrong arthur be silent for minute must like to be clear what be mean said slowly thoughtfully before say anything to youbecause think about anything approaching to compliment be so unusual utterance for arthur that brought flush of pleasure to cheek a replied be that give idea to think about one first thought arthur proceeded in reading of anything specially vile barbarous a done by fellow creature be apt to be that see new depth of sin revealed beneath seem to gaze down into abyss from higher ground far apart from think understand now mean that one ought to thinknot god thank thee be not a other men arebut god be merciful to also who might be for thy grace sinner a vile a said arthur meant great deal more than that looked up quickly checked waited in silence one must begin further back think think of other man same age a poor wretch look back to time when began lifebefore have sense enough to know right from wrong then at rate be equal in god sight nodded assent have then two distinct epoch at may contemplate two men whose life be comparing at first epoch be so far a moral responsibility be concerned on precisely same footing be alike incapable of doing right wrong at second epoch one mani be taking extreme case for contrasthas won esteem love of around character be stainless name will be held in honour hereafter other man history be one unvaried record of crime life be at last forfeited to outraged law of country now what have be cause in case of man condition being what be at second epoch be of two kindsone acting from within other from without two kind need to be discussed separatelythat be if have not already tired with prosing on contrary said lady muriel be special delight to to have question discussed in wayanalysed arranged so that one can understand book profess to argue out question be to intolerably wearisome simply because idea be arranged hap hazarda sort of first come first served be very encouraging arthur replied with pleased look cause acting from within make man character what be at given moment be successive act of volitionthat be act of choosing whether will do that be to assume existence of free will said in order to have point made quite clear if not be quiet reply cadit quaestio have more to say will assume rest of audiencethe majority may say looking at from arthur point of viewimperiously proclaimed orator proceeded cause acting from without be surroundingswhat mr herbert spencer call environment now point want to make clear be that man be responsible for act of choosing not responsible for environment hence if two men make on given occasion when be exposed to equal temptation equal effort to resist to choose right condition in sight of god must be same if be pleased in one case so will be in other if displeased in one case so also in other be so no doubt see quite clearly lady muriel put in yet owing to different environment one may win great victory over temptation while other fall into black abyss of crime surely must not say men be equally guilty in sight of god said arthur else must give up belief in god perfect justice let put one more case will show meaning even more forcibly let one man be in high social positionthe other say common thief let one be tempted to trivial act of unfair dealingsomething can do with absolute certainty that will never be discoveredsomething can with perfect ease forbear from doingand distinctly know to be sin let other be tempted to terrible crimea men must consider itbut under almost overwhelming pressure of motivesof course not quite overwhelming a must destroy responsibility now in case let second man make greater effort at resistance than first also suppose to fall under temptationi say that second man be in god sight le guilty than other lady muriel drew long breath upset one idea of right wrongjust at first why in dreadful murder trial must say suppose that be possible that least guilty man in court be murderer that possibly judge who tried by yielding to temptation of making one unfair remark have committed crime outweighing criminal whole career certainly must arthur firmly replied sound like paradox admit just think what grievous sin must be in god sight to yield to very slight temptation must have resisted with perfect ease to do deliberately in full light of god law what penance can atone for sin like cant reject theory said how seems to widen possible area of sin in world be that so lady muriel anxiously enquired oh not so not so be eager reply to seems to clear away much of cloud hang over world history when view first made clear to remember walking out into field repeating to myself line of tennyson there seemed room for sense of wrong thought perhaps real guilt of human race be infinitely le than fancied itthat million whom have thought of a sunk in hopeless depth of sin be perhaps in god sight scarcely sinning at allwas more sweet than word can tell life seemed more bright beautiful when once that thought have come livelier emerald twinkle in grass purer sapphire melt into sea voice trembled a concluded tear stood in eye lady muriel shaded face with hand be silent for minute be beautiful thought said looking up at last thank youarthur for putting into head earl returned in time to join at tea to give very unwelcome tidings that fever have broken out in little harbour town lay below usa fever of so malignant type though have only appeared day two ago there be already more than dozen down in two three of whom be reported to be in imminent danger in answer to eager question of arthurwho of course took deep scientific interest in matterhe must give very few technical detail though have met local doctor appeared however that be almost new diseaseat least in century though might prove to be identical with plague recorded in historyvery infectious frightfully rapid in action will not however prevent party to morrow said in conclusion none of guest belong to infected district be a know exclusively peopled by fisherman so may come without fear arthur be very silent way back on reaching lodging immediately plunged into medical study connected with alarming malady of whose arrival have just heard chapter ix farewell party on following day arthur reached hall in good time a only few of guestsit be to be party of eighteenhad a yet arrived be talking with earl leaving opportunity of few word apart with hostess who be very learned looking man with large spectacle arthur enquired havent met here before have he new friend of ours said lady muriel german believe be such dear old thing quite most learned man ever metwith one exception of course added humbly a arthur drew up with air of offended dignity young lady in blue just beyond talking to foreign looking man be learned too dont know said lady muriel im told shes wonderful piano forte player hope youll hear to night asked that foreigner to take in because he very musical too he french count believe sings splendidly sciencemusicsingingyou have indeed got complete party said arthur feel quite privileged person meeting star do love music party isnt quite complete said lady muriel havent brought two beautiful child went on turning to brought here to tea know one day last summer again addressing arthur be such darling be indeed assented why havent brought with promised father must im very sorry said really be impossible to bring with here most certainly meant to conclude sentence be with feeling of utter amazement can not adequately describe heard going on speaking be to join here in course of evening be word uttered in voice seeming to come from lip im so glad lady muriel joyfully replied will enjoy introducing to of friend here when do expect took refuge in silence only honest reply must have be be not remark didnt say isnt true have not moral courage to make such confession character of lunatic be not believe very difficult to acquire be amazingly difficult to get rid of seemed quite certain that such speech a must quite justify issue of writ de lunatico inquirendo lady muriel evidently thought have failed to hear question turned to arthur with remark on other subject have time to recover from shock of surpriseor to awake out of momentary eerie condition whichever be when thing around seemed once more to be real arthur be saying im afraid there help for must be finite in number must be sorry to have to believe said lady muriel yet when one come to think of there be new melody now day people talk of a last new song always recall to tune ive known a child day must comeif world last long enough said arthur when possible tune will have be composedevery possible pun perpetrated lady muriel wrung hand like tragedy queen worse than possible book written for number of word be finite itll make very little difference to author suggested instead of saying what book will write author will ask book will write mere verbal distinction lady muriel gave approving smile lunatic must always write new book surely went on couldnt sane book over again true said arthur book must come to end also number of lunatic book be a finite a number of lunatic number be becoming greater year said pompous man whom recognised a self appointed showman on day of picnic so say replied arthur when ninety per cent of be lunatic seemed to be in wildly nonsensical mood asylum will be put to proper use be pompous man gravely enquired to shelter sane said arthur will bar ourselves in lunatic will have own way outside theyll do little queerly doubt railway collision will be always happening steamer always blowing up most of town will be burnt down most of ship sunk most of men killed murmured pompous man who be evidently hopelessly bewildered certainly arthur assented till at last there will be fewer lunatic than sane men then come out go in thing return to normal condition pompous man frowned darkly bit lip folded arm vainly trying to think out be jesting muttered to at last in tone of withering contempt a stalked away by time other guest have arrived dinner be announced arthur of course took down lady muriel be pleased to find seated at other side with severe looking old lady whom have not met before whose name have a be usual in introduction entirely failed to catch merely gathering that sounded like compound name a partner for banquet appeared however to be acquainted with arthur confided to in low voice opinion that be very argumentative young man arthur for part seemed well inclined to show worthy of character have given hearing say never take wine with soup be not confidence to be launched upon society a matter of general interest at once challenged combat by asking when must say that property commence in plate of soup be soup sternly replied what be before be yours doubt said arthur when did begin to own up to moment of being put into plate be property of host while being offered round table be let say held in trust by waiter did become mine when accepted when be placed before when took first spoonful be very argumentative young man be old lady must say said audibly time feeling that society have right to know arthur smiled mischievously shouldnt mind betting shilling said that eminent barrister next certainly be possible to say word so a to make begin with capital cant answer never bet sternly replied not even sixpenny point at whist never repeated whist be innocent enough whist played for money shuddered arthur became serious again im afraid cant take view said consider that introduction of small stake for card playing be one of most moral act society ever did a society how be so said lady muriel because took card once for out of category of game at cheating be possible look at way croquet be demoralising society lady be beginning to cheat at terribly if theyre found out only laugh call fun when there money at stake be out of question swindler be not accepted a wit when man sits down to card cheat friend out of money doesnt get much fun out of itunless think fun to be kicked down stair if gentleman thought a badly of lady a do neighbour remarked with bitterness there must be very fewvery few seemed doubtful how to end sentence at last took honeymoon a safe word on contrary said arthur mischievous smile returning to face if only people must adopt theory number of honeymoonsquite of new kindwould be greatly increased may hear about new kind of honeymoon said lady muriel let x be gentleman arthur began in slightly raised voice a now found with audience of six including mein herr who be seated at other side of polynomial partner let x be gentleman y lady to whom think of proposing applies for experimental honeymoon be granted forthwith young coupleaccompanied by great aunt of y to act a chaperonestart for month tour during have many moonlight walk many tte tte conversation can form more correct estimate of others character in four week than must have be possible in a many year when meeting under ordinary restriction of society be only after return that x finally decides whether will will not put momentous question to y in nine case out of ten pompous man proclaimed must decide to break off then in nine case out of ten arthur rejoined unsuitable match must be prevented party saved from misery only really unsuitable match old lady remarked be made without sufficient money love may come afterwards money be needed to begin with remark be cast loose upon society a sort of general challenge a such be at once accepted by several of within hearing money became key note of conversation for time fitful echo of be again heard when dessert have be placed upon table servant have left room earl have started wine in welcome progress round table im very glad to see keep up old custom said to lady muriel a filled glass really delightful to experience once more peaceful feeling come over one when waiter have left roomwhen one can converse without feeling of being overheard without having dish constantly thrust over one shoulder how much more sociable be to be able to pour out wine for lady to hand dish to who wish for in case kindly send peach down here said fat red faced man who be seated beyond pompous friend ive be wishing for themdiagonallyfor time yes be ghastly innovation lady muriel replied letting waiter carry round wine at dessert for one thing always take wrong way roundwhich of course brings bad luck to everybody

instead of word money spent on have income derived from sale of instead of thats where money go to motto be thats where money come from red faced man scowled evidently considered arthur beneath notice so lady muriel took up cudgel do hold theory enquired that people can preach teetotalism more effectually by being teetotaler certainly do replied red faced man now here be case in point unfolding newspaper cutting let read letter from teetotaler to editor sir be once moderate drinker knew man who drank to excess went to give up drink said will ruin health drink said why shouldnt yes said know when to leave off turned away from drink in way said let drink in mine be off then saw that to do good with must forswear drink from hour havent touched drop there what do say to that looked round

moderate drinker never do so arthur quietly replied even stern old lady laughed at need many other thing to make perfect dinner said lady muriel evidently anxious to change subject mein herr what be idea of perfect dinner party old man looked round smilingly gigantic spectacle seemed more gigantic than ever perfect dinner party repeated first must be presided over by present hostess that of course gaily interposed what else mein herr can tell have seen said mein herr in mine ownin country have traveled in paused for full minute gazed steadily at ceilingwith so dreamy expression on face

in english dinner party remarked have never known small talk run short pardon mein herr respectfully replied did not say small talk said conversation such topic a weather politics local gossip be unknown among be vapid controversial what need for conversation be topic of interest of novelty to secure thing have tried various plansmoving picture wild creature moving guest revolving humorist

leaning forward eager to catch fragment of mein herr oration chapter one moving picture be proclaimed in silvery voice of hostess dining table be shaped like circular ring mein herr began in low dreamy tone however be perfectly audible in silence guest be seated at inner side a well a outer having ascended to place by winding staircase from room below along middle of table run little railway

truck making face other way thus guest see picture paused silence seemed deader than ever lady muriel looked aghast really if go on exclaimed will have to drop pin oh fault be in answer to appealing look from mein herr be forgetting duty chapter two wild creature found moving picture little monotonous said mein herr people didnt care to talk art through whole dinner so tried wild creature among flower laid just a do about table be to be seen here mouse there beetle here spider lady muriel shuddered there wasp here toad there snake father said lady muriel plaintively did hear that so have plenty to talk about when got stung old lady began be chained up dear madam old lady gave satisfied nod there be silence to follow time third chapter lady muriel proclaimed at once moving guest even wild creature proved monotonous orator proceeded so left guest to choose own subject to avoid monotony changed made table of two ring inner ring moved slowly round time along with floor in middle inner row of guest thus inner guest be brought face to face with outer guest be little confusing sometimes to have to begin story to one friend finish to plan have fault know fourth chapter lady muriel hastened to announce revolving humorist for small party found excellent plan to have round table with hole cut in middle large enough to hold one guest here placed best talker revolved slowly facing other guest in turn told lively anecdote whole time shouldnt like murmured pompous man must make giddy revolving like must decline to here appeared to dawn upon perhaps assumption be making be not warranted by circumstance took hasty gulp of wine choked mein herr have relapsed into reverie made further remark lady muriel gave signal lady left room chapter x jabbering jam when last lady have disappeared earl taking place at head of table have issued military order gentleman close up rank if please when in obedience to command have gathered ourselves compactly round pompous man gave deep

ah yes came next instead of giving whole reward of learning in one lump used to pay for good answer a occurred how well remember lecturing in day with heap of small coin at elbow be very good answer mr jones meant shilling mostly bravo mr robinson meant crown now ill tell how worked not one single fact must of take in without fee when clever boy came up from school got paid more for learning than got paid for teaching then came wildest craze of what craze said last one said old man must have tired out with long story college wanted to get clever boy so adopted system have heard be very popular in england college competed against other boy let out to highest bidder what goose be why be bound to come to university somehow neednt have paid em money went in getting clever boy to come to one

so call be to do best must for national welfarein such thing a making war peace commercial treaty so forth undoubtedly said function of out be so traveller assured though be very incredulous at first to prevent in from succeeding in of thing to criticize to amend proceeding corrected must be unpatriotic to hinder government in doing what be for good of nation have always held patriot to be greatest of hero unpatriotic spirit to be one of worst of human ill excuse for moment old gentleman courteously replied taking out pocket book have few memoranda here of correspondence have with

word have used in writing to hinder be very word used in reply allow to read portion of letter can assure writes that unpatriotic a may think recognised function of opposition be to hinder in manner not forbidden by law action of government process be called legitimate obstruction greatest triumph opposition can ever enjoy be when be able to point out that owing to obstruction government have failed in everything have tried to do for good of nation friend have not put quite correctly said opposition must doubt be glad to point out that government have failed through own fault not that have failed on account of obstruction think so gently replied allow now to read to newspaper cutting friend enclosed in letter be part of report of public speech made by statesman who be at time member of

to what portion of national history must guess that speaker be referring really number of successful war have waged during last century replied with glow of british pride be far too great for to guess with chance of success be be then engaged in however will name india a most probable mutiny be doubt crushed at time that speech be made what fine manly patriotic speech must have be exclaimed in outburst of enthusiasm think so replied in tone of gentle pity yet friend tell that disordered dispirited foe simply meant statesman who happened to be in power at moment that pursuit simply meant obstruction that word have routed enemy simply meant that opposition have succeeded in hindering government from doing of work nation have empowered to do thought best to say nothing seemed queer to

object by examining at end of thirty forty yearsnot at beginning gently replied on average knowledge then found be about one fifth of what be at firstthe process of forgetting going on at very steady uniform rateand who forgets least get most honour most reward then give money when need no longer make live most of life on nothing hardly that give order to tradesman supply for forty sometimes fifty year at own risk then get fellowshipwhich pay in one year a much a fellowship pay in fiftyand then can easily pay bill with interest suppose fails to get fellowship must occasionally happen occasionally happens be mein herr turn now to make admission what becomes of tradesman calculate accordingly when man appears to be getting alarmingly ignorant stupid will sometimes refuse to supply longer have idea with what enthusiasm man will begin to rub up forgotten science language when butcher have cut off supply of beef mutton who be examiner young men who have just come brimming over

seemed to hear say chapter xvi beyond voice didnt quite catch what said be next word reached ear certainly not in voice of sylvie of bruno whom must just see through crowd of guest standing by piano listening to count song mein herr be speaker didnt quite catch what said repeated ive doubt take view of thank very much for kind attention there be only one verse left to be sung last word be not in gentle voice of mein herr in deep bass of french count in silence followed final stanza of tottles rang through room illustration never yelled tottles see now couple settled down in quiet lodging out of town submissively tearful wife accepts plain humble life yet begs one boon on bended knee ducky darling dont resent mamma might come for two three never yelled tottles meant conclusion of song be followed by quite chorus of thanks compliment from part of room gratified singer responded to by bowing low in direction be to great privilege said to lady muriel to have met with so marvellous song accompaniment to be so strange so mysterious be a if new music be to be invented will play once again so a to show what mean returned to piano song have vanished bewildered singer searched through heap of music lying on adjoining table be not there either lady muriel helped in search others soon joined excitement grew what can have become of exclaimed lady muriel nobody knew one thing only be certain that one have be near piano since count have sung last verse of song nevare mind said most good naturedly will give with memory alone sat down began vaguely fingering note nothing resembling tune came out then too grew excited what oddness how much of singularity might lose not word alone tune alsothat be quite curious suppose supposed heartily be that sweet little boy who found for count suggested quite perhaps be thief of course be cried lady muriel bruno where be darling bruno replied seemed that two child have vanished a suddenly a mysteriously a song be playing trick lady muriel gaily exclaimed be only ex tempore game of hide seek little bruno be embodied mischief suggestion be welcome one to most of for of guest be beginning to look decidedly uneasy general search be set on foot with much enthusiasm curtain be thrown back shaken cupboard opened ottoman turned over number of possible hiding place proved to be strictly limited search came to end almost a soon a have begun must have run out while be wrapped up in song lady muriel said addressing to count who seemed more agitated than others doubt theyve found way back to housekeeper room not by door be earnest protest of knot of two three gentleman who have be grouped round door one of actually leaning against for last half hour a declared door have not be opened since song began uncomfortable silence followed announcement lady muriel ventured further conjecture quietly examined fastening of window opened a door proved to be well fastened inside not yet at end of resource lady muriel rang bell ask housekeeper to step here said to bring childrens walking thing with ive brought lady said obsequious housekeeper entering after minute of silence thought young lady must have come to room to put on boot here boot love added cheerfully looking in direction for child there be answer turned to lady muriel with puzzled smile have little darling hid dont see just now lady muriel replied rather evasively can leave thing here wilson ill dress when theyre ready to go two little hat sylvies walking jacket be handed round among lady with many exclamation of delight there certainly be sort of witchery of beauty about even little boot did not miss share of favorable criticism such natty little thing musical young lady exclaimed almost fondling a spoke what tiny tiny foot must have finally thing be piled together on centre ottoman guest despairing of seeing child again began to wish good night leave house there be only eight nine leftto whom count be explaining for twentieth time how have have eye on child during last verse of song how have then glanced round room to see what effect de great chest note have have upon audience how when looked back again have disappearedwhen exclamation of dismay began to be heard on side count hastily bringing story to end to join in outcry walking thing have disappeared after utter failure of search for child there be very half hearted search made for apparel remaining guest seemed only too glad to get away leaving only count four self count sank into easy chair panted little who then be dear child pray said why come why go in so little ordinary fashion that music must make to vanishthat hat boot must make to vanishhow be pray ive idea where be be must say on finding appealed to by general consent for explanation count seemed about to ask further question checked hour make to become late said wish to very good night lady betake to bedto dreamif indeed be not dreaming now hastily left room stay awhile stay awhile said earl a be about to follow count be not guest know arthur friend be at home here thanks said a with true english instinct drew chair together round fire place though fire be burninglady muriel having taken heap of music on knee to have one more search for strangely vanished song dont sometimes feel wild longing said addressing to to have something more to do with hand while talk than just holding cigar now then knocking off ash oh know youre going to say be to arthur who appeared about to interrupt majesty of thought supersedes work of finger man severe thinking shaking off cigar ash come to same total a woman trivial fancy most elaborate embroidery thats sentiment isnt only better expressed arthur looked into radiant mischievous face with grave very tender smile yes said resignedly be sentiment exactly rest of body activity of mind put in writer tell be acme of human happiness plenty of bodily rest at rate lady muriel replied glancing at three recumbent figure around what call activity of mind be privilege of young physician only said earl old men have claim to be active what can old man do die good many other thing must hope arthur said earnestly well maybe still have advantage of in many way dear boy not only that day be dawning while mine be setting interest in lifesomehow cant help envying that will be many year before lose hold of yet surely many human interest survive human life said many do doubt form of science only think mathematics for instance seems to posse endless interest one cant imagine form of life race of intelligent being where mathematical truth must lose meaning fear medicine stand on different footing suppose discover remedy for disease hitherto supposed to be incurable well be delightful for moment doubtfull of interestperhaps brings fame fortune what then look on few year into life where disease have existence what be discovery worth then milton make jove promise too much of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed poor comfort when one fame concern matter will have ceased to have meaning at rate one care to make fresh medical discovery said arthur see help for thatthough will be sorry to give up favorite study still medicine disease pain sorrow sini fear theyre linked together banish sin banish military science be yet stronger instance said earl without sin war must surely be impossible still mind have have in life keen interest not in sinful will surely find congenial line of work hereafter wellington may have more battle to fightand yet doubt not that for one so true there must be other nobler work to do than when fought at waterloo victor must ever be lingered over beautiful word a if loved voice like distant music died away into silence after minute two began again if im not wearying must like to tell idea of future life have haunted for year like sort of waking nightmarei cant reason out of pray do arthur replied almost in breath lady muriel put aside heap of music folded hand together one idea earl resumed have seemed to to overshadow rest be that of eternityinvolving a seems to do necessary exhaustion of subject of human interest take pure mathematics for instancea science independent of present surroundings have studied little take subject of circle call curve of second degree in future life must only be question of so many year hundred of year if like for man to work out property then might go to curve of third degree say that took ten time a long see have unlimited time to deal with can hardly imagine interest in subject holding out even for though there be limit to degree of curve might study yet surely time needed to exhaust novelty interest of subject must be absolutely finite so of other branch of science when transport in thought through thousand million of year fancy possessed of a much science a one created reason can carry ask what then with nothing more to learn can one rest content on knowledge for eternity yet to be lived through have be very wearying thought to have sometimes fancied one might in event say be better not to be pray for personal annihilationthe nirvana of buddhist be only picture said besides working for oneself may there not be helping of others surely surely lady muriel exclaimed in tone of relief looking at father with sparkling eye yes said earl so long a there be others needing help given age age more surely created reason must at length reach same dead level of satiety then what be there to look forward to know weary feeling said young doctor have gone through more than once now let tell how have put to have imagined little child playing with toy on nursery floor yet able to reason to look on thirty year ahead might not say to by time will have have enough of brick ninepin how weary life will be yet if look forward through thirty year find great statesman full of interest joy far more intense than baby life must givejoys wholly inconceivable to baby mindjoys such a baby language must in faintest degree describe now may not life million year hence have same relation to life now that man life have to child just a one might try in vain to express to child in language of brick ninepin meaning of politics so perhaps description of heaven with music feast street of gold may be only attempt to describe in word thing for really have word at dont think that in picture of life be in fact transplanting that child into political life without making allowance for growing up think understand said earl music of heaven may be something beyond power of thought yet music of earth be sweet muriel child sing something before go to bed do said arthur a rose lit candle on cottage piano lately banished from drawing room to make room for semi grand there be song here have never heard sing hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven near pourest thy full heart read from page have spread open before little life here earl went on be to grand time like child summer day one get tired a

took way among solemn memorial of quiet dead thinking of many who have during past year disappeared from place have gone to join majority very few step brought in sight of object of search lady muriel dressed in deepest mourning face hidden by long crape veil be kneeling before little marble cross round be fastening wreath of flower cross stood on piece of level turf unbroken by mound knew that be simply memorial cross for one whose dust reposed elsewhere even before reading simple inscription in loving memory of arthur forester md whose mortal remains lie buried by sea whose spirit have

moment went on more hurriedly went down to harbour several time one know of vast graf be however showed house died in be comfort stood in very room wherewhere struggled in vain to go on flood gate have given way at last outburst of grief be most terrible have ever witnessed totally regardless of presence flung down on turf burying face in grass with hand clasped round little marble cross oh darling darling sobbed god meant life to be so beautiful illustration in church yard be startled to hear thus repeated by lady muriel very word of darling child whom have seen weeping so bitterly over dead hare have mysterious influence passed from sweet fairy spirit ere went back to fairyland into human spirit loved so dearly idea seemed too wild for belief yet be there not more thing in heaven earth than be dreamt of in philosophy god meant to be beautiful whispered surely be beautiful god purpose never fails dared say more rose left at entrance gate to earl house waited leaning on gate watching sun set revolving many memoriessome happy sorrowfuluntil lady muriel joined be quite calm again now do come in said father will be so pleased to see old man rose from chair with smile to welcome self command be far le than daughter tear coursed down face a grasped hand in pressed warmly heart be too full to speak sat silent for minute two then lady muriel rang bell for tea do take five oclock tea know said to with sweet playfulness of manner remembered so well even though cant work wicked will on law of gravity make teacup descend into infinite space little faster than tea remark gave tone to conversation by tacit mutual consent avoided during first meeting after great sorrow painful topic filled thought talked like light hearted child who have never known care did ever ask question lady muriel began propos of nothing what be chief advantage of being man instead of dog indeed said think there be advantage on dog side of question a well doubt replied with pretty mock gravity became so well on man side chief advantage seems to to consist in having pocket be borne in upon meupon must say for father be returning from walkonly yesterday met dog carrying home bone what wanted for ive idea certainly there be meat on strange sensation came over have heard something exactly like before almost expected next word to be perhaps meant to make cloak for winter however what really said be father tried to account for by wretched joke about pro bono publico well dog laid down bonenot in disgust with pun must have shown to be dog of tastebut simply to rest jaw poor thing did pity so wont join charitable association for supplying dog with pocket how must like to have to carry walking stick in mouth ignoring difficult question a to raison dtre of walking stick supposing one have hand mentioned curious instance have once witnessed of reasoning by dog gentleman with lady child large dog be down at end of pier on be walking to amuse child suppose gentleman put down on ground umbrella lady parasol then led way to other end of pier from sent dog back for deserted article be watching with curiosity dog came racing back to where stood found unexpected difficulty in picking up thing have come for with umbrella in mouth jaw be so far apart that must get firm grip on parasol after two three failure paused considered matter then put down umbrella began with parasol of course that didnt open jaw nearly so wide be able to get good hold of umbrella galloped off in triumph one couldnt doubt that have gone through real train of logical thought entirely agree with said lady muriel dont orthodox writer condemn view a putting man on level of lower animal dont draw sharp boundary line between reason instinct that certainly be orthodox view generation ago said earl truth of religion seemed ready to stand fall with assertion that man be only reasoning animal be at end now man can still claim certain monopoliesfor instance use of language a enables to utilise work of many by division of labour belief that have monopoly of reason have long be swept away yet catastrophe have followed a old poet say god be where be most religious believer must now agree with bishop butler said not reject line of argument even if led straight to conclusion that animal have kind of soul survives bodily death must like to know to be true lady muriel exclaimed if only for sake of poor horse sometimes ive thought that if anything must make cease to believe in god of perfect justice must be suffering of horseswithout guilt to deserve without compensation be only part of great riddle said earl why innocent being ever suffer be great strain on faithbut not breaking strain think suffering of horse said be chiefly caused by man cruelty so that be merely one of many instance of sin causing suffering to others than sinner dont find greater difficulty in suffering inflicted by animal upon other for instance cat playing with mouse assuming to have moral responsibility isnt that greater mystery than man over driving horse think be said lady muriel looking mute appeal to father what right have to make assumption said earl many of religious difficulty be merely deduction from unwarranted assumption wisest answer to most of be think behold know not anything mentioned division of labour just now said surely be carried to wonderful perfection in hive of bee so wonderfulso entirely super human said earl so entirely inconsistent with intelligence show in other waysthat feel doubt at that be pure instinct not a hold very high order of reason look at utter stupidity of bee trying to find way out of open window doesnt try in reasonable sense of word simply bang about must call puppy imbecile behaved so yet be asked to believe that intellectual level be above sir isaac newton then hold that pure instinct contains reason at on contrary said earl hold that work of bee hive involves reason of highest order none of be done by bee god have reasoned out have put into mind of bee conclusion only of reasoning process how do mind come to work together asked what right have to assume that have mind special pleading special pleading lady muriel cried in most unfilial tone of triumph why said just now mind of bee did not say mind child earl gently replied have occurred to a most probable solution of bee mystery that swarm of bee have only one mind among often see one mind animating most complex collection of limb organ when joined together how do know that material connection be necessary may not mere neighbourhood be enough if so swarm of bee be simply single animal whose many limb be not quite close together be bewildering thought said need night rest to grasp properly reason instinct tell ought to go home so good night ill set part of way said lady muriel ive have walk to day will do good have more to say to will go through wood will be pleasanter than over common even though be getting little dark turned aside into shade of interlacing bough formed architecture of almost perfect symmetry grouped into lovely groined arch running out far a eye must follow into endless aisle chancel nave like ghostly cathedral fashioned out of dream of moon struck poet always in wood began after pause silence seemed natural in dim solitude begin thinking of fairy may ask question added hesitatingly do believe in fairy momentary impulse be so strong to tell of experience in very wood have to make real effort to keep back word rushed to lip if mean by believe believe in possible existence say yes for actual existence of course one must need evidence be saying other day went on that must accept anything on good evidence be not priori impossible think named ghost a instance of provable phenomenon must fairy be instance yes think so again be hard to check wish to say more be not yet sure of sympathetic listener have theory a to what sort of place must occupy in creation do tell what think about must for instance supposing such being to exist must have moral responsibility mean light bantering tone suddenly changed to one of deep seriousness must be capable of sin can reasonon lower level perhaps than men womennever rising think above faculty of child have moral sense most surely such being without free will must be absurdity so be driven to conclusion that be capable of sin believe in cried delightedly with sudden motion a if about to clap hand now tell have reason for still strove to keep back revelation felt sure be coming believe that there be life everywherenot material only not merely what be palpable to sensesbut immaterial invisible a well believe in own immaterial essencecall soul spirit what will why must not other similar essence exist around not linked on to visible material body did not god make swarm of happy insect to dance in sunbeam for one hour of bliss for other object that can imagine than to swell sum of conscious happiness where will dare to draw line say have made more yes yes assented watching with sparkling eye be only reason for not denying have more reason than have not well yes said feeling might safely tell now must not find fitter time place to say have seen themand in very wood lady muriel asked more question silently paced at side with head bowed down hand clasped tightly together only a tale went on drew little short quick breath now then like child panting with delight told what have never yet breathed to other listener of double life more than for mine might have be noonday dream of double life of two dear child when told of

silent in minute two child appeared coming straight towards through arched opening among tree have arm round other setting sun shed golden halo round head like what one see in picture of saint be looking in direction evidently did not see soon made out that lady muriel have for once passed into condition familiar to that be of eerie that though must see child so plainly be quite invisible to

for think be love for feel be love for im sure be nothing love once more heard bruno delicate little voice alone say whose be skill paint valley hill like picture so fair to sight fleck green meadow with sunshine shadow till little lamb leap with delight again uprose that silvery voice whose angelic sweetness must hardly bear ti secret untold to heart cruel cold though ti sung by angel above in note that ring clear for ear can hear name of secret be love then bruno joined in again with for think be love for feel be love for im sure be nothing love be pretty little fellow exclaimed a child
