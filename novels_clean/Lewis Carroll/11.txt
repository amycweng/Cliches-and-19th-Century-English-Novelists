book sister be reading have picture conversation in what be use of book thought alice without picture conversation so be considering in own mind a well a must for hot day made feel very sleepy stupid whether pleasure of making daisy chain must be worth trouble of getting up picking daisy when suddenly white rabbit with pink eye ran close by there be nothing so very remarkable in did alice think so very much out of way to hear rabbit say to oh dear oh dear will be late when thought over afterwards occurred to that ought to have wondered at at time seemed quite natural when rabbit actually took watch out of waistcoat pocket looked at then hurried on alice started to foot for flashed across mind that have never before seen rabbit with waistcoat pocket watch to take out of burning with curiosity ran across field after fortunately be just in time to see pop down large rabbit hole under hedge in moment down went alice after never once considering how in world be to get out again rabbit hole went straight on like tunnel for way then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice have not moment to think about stopping before found falling down very deep well well be very deep fell very slowly for have plenty of time a went down to look about to wonder what be going to happen next first tried to look down make out what be coming to be too dark to see anything then looked at side of well noticed that be filled with cupboard book shelf here there saw map picture hung upon peg took down jar from one of shelf a passed be labelled orange marmalade to great disappointment be empty did not like to drop jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put into one of cupboard a fell past well thought alice to herself after fall a will think nothing of tumbling down stair how brave theyll think at home why wouldnt say anything about even if fell off top of house be very likely true down down down must fall never come to end wonder how many mile ive fallen by time said aloud must be getting somewhere near centre of earth let see must be four thousand mile down think for see alice have learnt several thing of sort in lesson in schoolroom though be not very good opportunity for showing off knowledge a there be one to listen to still be good practice to say over yes thats about right distancebut then wonder what latitude longitude ive got to alice have idea what latitude be longitude thought be nice grand word to say presently began again wonder if will fall right through earth how funny itll seem to come out among people walk with head downward antipathy think be rather glad there be one listening time a didnt sound at right word will have to ask what name of country be know please maam be new zealand australia tried to curtsey a spokefancy curtseying a youre falling through air do think must manage what ignorant little girl shell think for asking itll never do to ask perhaps will see written up somewhere down down down there be nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss very much to night must think dinah be cat hope theyll remember saucer of milk at tea time dinah dear wish be down here with there be mouse in air im afraid might catch bat thats very like mouse know do cat eat bat wonder here alice began to get rather sleepy went on saying to herself in dreamy sort of way do cat eat bat do cat eat bat sometimes do bat eat cat for see a couldnt answer question didnt much matter way put felt that be dozing off have just begun to dream that be walking hand in hand with dinah saying to very earnestly now dinah tell truth did ever eat bat when suddenly thump thump down came upon heap of stick dry leaf fall be over alice be not bit hurt jumped up on to foot in moment looked up be dark overhead before be long passage white rabbit be still in sight hurrying down there be not moment to be lost away went alice like wind be just in time to hear say a turned corner oh ear whisker how late getting be close behind when turned corner rabbit be no longer to be seen found in long low hall be lit up by row of lamp hanging from roof there be door round hall be locked when alice have be way down one side up other trying door walked sadly down middle wondering how be ever to get out again suddenly came upon little three legged table made of solid glass there be nothing on except tiny golden key alices first thought be that might belong to one of door of hall ala lock be too large key be too small at rate must not open of however on second time round came upon low curtain have not noticed before behind be little door about fifteen inch high tried little golden key in lock to great delight fitted alice opened door found that led into small passage not much larger than rat hole knelt down looked along passage into loveliest garden ever saw how longed to get out of dark hall wander about among bed of bright flower cool fountain must not even get head through doorway even if head must go through thought poor alice must be of very little use without shoulder oh how wish must shut up like telescope think must if only knew how to begin for see so many out of way thing have happened lately that alice have begun to think very few thing indeed be really impossible there seemed to be use in waiting by little door so went back to table half hoping might find key on at rate book of rule for shutting people up like telescope time found little bottle on certainly be not here before said alice round neck of bottle be paper label with word drink beautifully printed on in large letter be very well to say drink wise little alice be not going to do in hurry ill look first said see whether marked poison not for have read several nice little history about child who have got burnt eaten up by wild beast other unpleasant thing because must not remember simple rule friend have taught such a that red hot poker will burn if hold too long that if cut finger very deeply with knife usually bleeds have never forgotten that if drink much from bottle marked poison be almost certain to disagree with sooner later however bottle be not marked poison so alice ventured to taste finding very nice have in fact sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee hot buttered toast very soon finished off what curious feeling said alice must be shutting up like telescope so be indeed be now only ten inch high face brightened up at thought that be now right size for going through little door into lovely garden first however waited for few minute to see if be going to shrink further felt little nervous about for might end know said alice to herself in going out altogether like candle wonder what must be like then tried to fancy what flame of candle be like after candle be blown out for must not remember ever having seen thing after while finding that nothing more happened decided on going into garden at once ala for poor alice when got to door found have forgotten little golden key when went back to table for found must not possibly reach must see quite plainly through glass tried best to climb up one of leg of table be too slippery when have tired out with trying poor little thing sat down cried come there use in cry like said alice to herself rather sharply advise to leave off minute generally gave very good advice though very seldom followed sometimes scolded so severely a to bring tear into eye once remembered trying to box own ear for having cheated in game of croquet be playing against for curious child be very fond of pretending to be two people use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why there hardly enough of left to make one respectable person soon eye fell on little glass box be lying under table opened found in very small cake on word eat be beautifully marked in currant well ill eat said alice if make grow larger can reach key if make grow smaller can creep under door so way ill get into garden dont care happens ate little bit said anxiously to herself way way holding hand on top of head to feel way be growing be quite surprised to find that remained same size to be

house quite forgetting that be now about thousand time a large a rabbit have reason to be afraid of presently rabbit came up to door tried to open a door opened inwards alices elbow be pressed hard against that attempt proved failure alice heard say to then ill go round get in at window that wont thought alice after waiting till fancied heard rabbit just under window suddenly spread out hand

dead silence instantly alice thought to herself wonder what will do next if have sense theyd take roof off after minute two began moving about again alice heard rabbit say barrowful will do to begin with barrowful of what thought alice have not long to doubt for next moment shower of little pebble came rattling in at window of hit in face ill put stop to said to herself shouted out youd better not do again produced dead silence alice noticed with surprise that pebble be turning into little cake a lay on floor bright idea came into head if eat one of cake thought sure to make change in size a cant possibly make larger must make smaller suppose so swallowed one of cake be delighted to find that began shrinking directly a soon a be small enough to get through door ran out of house found quite crowd of little animal bird waiting outside poor little lizard bill be in middle being held up by two guinea pig who be giving something out of bottle made rush at alice moment appeared ran off a hard a must soon found safe in thick wood first thing ive got to do said alice to herself a wandered about in wood be to grow to right size again second thing be to find way into lovely garden think will be best plan sounded excellent plan doubt very neatly simply arranged only difficulty be that have not smallest idea how to set about while be peering about anxiously among tree little sharp bark just over head made look up in great hurry enormous puppy be looking down at with large round eye feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch poor little thing said alice in coaxing tone tried hard to whistle to be terribly frightened time at thought that might be hungry in case must be very likely to eat up in spite of coaxing hardly knowing what did picked up little bit of stick held out to puppy whereupon puppy jumped into air off foot at once with yelp of delight rushed at stick made believe to worry then alice dodged behind great thistle to keep from being run over moment appeared on other side puppy made rush at stick tumbled head over heel in hurry to get hold of then alice thinking be very like having game of play with cart horse expecting moment to be trampled under foot ran round thistle again then puppy began series of short charge at stick running very little way forward time long way back barking hoarsely while till at last sat down good way off panting with tongue hanging out of mouth great eye half shut seemed to alice good opportunity for making escape so set off at once ran till be quite tired out of breath till puppy bark sounded quite faint in distance yet what dear little puppy be said alice a leant against buttercup to rest fanned with one of leaf must have liked teaching trick very much ifif id only be right size to do oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let seehow be to be managed suppose ought to eat drink something other great question be what great question certainly be what alice looked round at flower blade of grass did not see anything that looked like right thing to eat drink under circumstance there be large mushroom growing near about same height a herself when have looked under on side of behind occurred to that might a well look see what be on top of stretched up on tiptoe peeped over edge of mushroom eye immediately met of large blue caterpillar be sitting on top with arm folded quietly smoking long hookah taking not smallest notice of of anything else chapter v advice from caterpillar caterpillar alice looked at other for time in silence at last caterpillar took hookah out of mouth addressed in languid sleepy voice who be said caterpillar be not encouraging opening for conversation alice replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least know who be when got up morning think must have be changed several time since then what do mean by said caterpillar sternly explain cant explain im afraid sir said alice because im not see dont see said caterpillar im afraid cant put more clearly alice replied very politely for cant understand to begin with being so many different size in day be very confusing isnt said caterpillar well perhaps havent found so yet said alice when have to turn into chrysalisyou will day knowand then after into butterfly must think youll feel little queer wont not bit said caterpillar well perhaps feeling may be different said alice know be must feel very queer to said caterpillar contemptuously who be brought back again to beginning of conversation alice felt little irritated at caterpillar making such very short remark drew up said very gravely think ought to tell who be first why said caterpillar here be puzzling question a alice must not think of good reason a caterpillar seemed to be in very unpleasant state of mind turned away come back caterpillar called after ive something important to say sounded promising certainly alice turned came back again keep temper said caterpillar be that said alice swallowing down anger a well a must no said caterpillar alice thought might a well wait a have nothing else to do perhaps after might tell something worth hearing for minute puffed away without speaking at last unfolded arm took hookah out of mouth again said so think youre changed do im afraid be sir said alice cant remember thing a usedand dont keep same size for ten minute together cant remember what thing said caterpillar well ive tried to say how little busy bee came different alice replied in very melancholy voice repeat be old father william said caterpillar alice folded hand began be old father william young man said hair have become very white yet incessantly stand on head do think at age be right in youth father william replied to son feared might injure brain now that im perfectly sure have none why do again again be old said youth a mentioned before have grown most uncommonly fat yet turned back somersault in at door pray what be reason of in youth said sage a shook grey lock kept limb very supple by use of ointmentone shilling box allow to sell couple be old said youth jaw be too weak for anything tougher than suet yet finished goose with bone beak pray how did manage to do in youth said father took to

awfully clever have answered three question be enough said father dont give air do think can listen day to such stuff be off ill kick down stair be not said right said caterpillar not quite right im afraid said alice timidly of word have got altered be wrong from beginning to end said caterpillar decidedly there be silence for minute caterpillar be first to speak what size do want to be asked oh im not particular a to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often know dont know said caterpillar alice said nothing have never be so much contradicted in life before felt that be losing temper be content now said caterpillar well must like to be little larger sir if wouldnt mind said alice three inch be such wretched height to be be very good height indeed said caterpillar angrily rearing upright a spoke be exactly three inch high im not used to pleaded poor alice in piteous tone thought of wish creature wouldnt be so easily offended youll get used to in time said caterpillar put hookah into mouth began smoking again time alice waited patiently until chose to speak again in minute two caterpillar took hookah out of mouth yawned once twice shook then got down off mushroom crawled away in grass merely remarking a went one side will make grow taller other side will make grow shorter one side of what other side of what thought alice to herself of mushroom said caterpillar just a if have asked aloud in moment be out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at mushroom for minute trying to make out be two side of a be perfectly round found very difficult question however at last stretched arm round a far a must go broke off bit of edge with hand now be said to herself nibbled little of right hand bit to try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin have struck foot be good deal frightened by very sudden change felt that there be time to be lost a be shrinking rapidly so set to work at once to eat of other bit chin be pressed so closely against foot that there be hardly room to open mouth did at last managed to swallow morsel of lefthand bit come head free at last said alice in tone of delight changed into alarm in moment when found that shoulder be nowhere to be found must see when looked down be immense length of neck seemed to rise like stalk out of sea of green leaf lay far below what can green stuff be said alice where have shoulder got to oh poor hand how be cant see be moving about a spoke result seemed to follow except little shaking among distant green leaf a there seemed to be chance of getting hand up to head tried to get head down to be delighted to find that neck must bend about easily in direction like serpent have just succeeded in curving down into graceful zigzag be going to dive in among leaf found to be nothing top of tree under have be wandering when sharp hiss made draw back in hurry large pigeon have flown into face be beating violently with wing serpent screamed pigeon im not serpent said alice indignantly let alone serpent say again repeated pigeon in more subdued tone added with kind of sob ive tried way nothing seems to suit havent least idea what youre talking about said alice

have tasted egg certainly said alice who be very truthful child little girl eat egg quite a much a serpent do know dont believe said pigeon if do why then theyre kind of serpent thats can say be such new idea to alice that be quite silent for minute two gave pigeon opportunity of adding youre looking for egg know well enough what doe matter to whether youre little girl serpent matter good deal to said alice hastily im not looking for egg a happens if be shouldnt want yours dont like raw well be off then said pigeon in sulky tone a settled down again into nest alice crouched down among tree a well a must for neck kept getting entangled among branch now then have to stop untwist after while remembered that still held piece of mushroom in hand set to work very carefully nibbling first at one then at other growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter until have succeeded in bringing down to usual height be so long since have be anything near right size that felt quite strange at first got used to in few minute began talking to herself a usual come there plan done now how puzzling change be im never sure what im going to be from one minute to however ive got back to right size next thing be to get into beautiful gardenhow be that to be done wonder a said came suddenly upon open place with little house in about four foot high life there thought alice itll never do to come upon size why must frighten out of wit so began nibbling at righthand bit again did not venture to go near house till have brought down to nine inch high chapter vi pig pepper for minute two stood looking at house wondering what to do next when suddenly footman in livery came running out of woodshe considered to be footman because be in livery otherwise judging by face only must have called fishand rapped loudly at door with knuckle be opened by footman in livery with round face large eye like frog footman alice noticed have powdered hair curled over head felt very curious to know what be about crept little way out of wood to listen fish footman began by producing from under arm great letter nearly a large a handed over to other saying in solemn tone for duchess invitation from queen to play croquet frog footman repeated in same solemn tone only changing order of word little from queen invitation for duchess to play croquet then bowed low curl got entangled together alice laughed so much at have to run back into wood for fear of hearing when next peeped out fish footman be gone other be sitting on ground near door staring stupidly up into sky alice went timidly up to door knocked there sort of use in knocking said footman that for two reason first because im on same side of door a be secondly because theyre making such noise inside one must possibly hear certainly there be most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling sneezing now then great crash a if dish kettle have be broken to piece please then said alice how be to get in there might be sense in knocking footman went on without attending to if have door between for instance if be inside might knock must let out know be looking up into sky time be speaking alice thought decidedly uncivil perhaps cant help said to herself eye be so very nearly at top of head at rate might answer questionshow be to get in repeated aloud will sit here footman remarked till tomorrow at moment door of house opened large plate came skimming out straight at footman head just grazed nose broke to piece against one of tree behind next day maybe footman continued in same tone exactly a if nothing have happened how be to get in asked alice again in louder tone be to get in at said footman thats first question know be doubt only alice did not like to be told so really dreadful muttered to herself way creature argue enough to drive one crazy footman seemed to think good opportunity for repeating remark with variation will sit here said on off for day day what be to do said alice anything like said footman began whistling oh there use in talking to said alice desperately he perfectly idiotic opened door went in door led right into large kitchen be full of smoke from one end to other duchess be sitting on three legged stool in middle nursing baby cook be leaning over fire stirring large cauldron seemed to be full of soup there certainly too much pepper in soup alice said to herself a well a must for sneezing there be certainly too much of in air even duchess sneezed occasionally a for baby be sneezing howling alternately without moment pause only thing in kitchen did not sneeze be cook large cat be sitting on hearth grinning from ear to ear please must tell said alice little timidly for be not quite sure whether be good manner for to speak first why cat grin like cheshire cat said duchess thats why pig said last word with such sudden violence alice quite jumped saw in moment that be addressed to baby not to so took courage went on again didnt know that cheshire cat always grinned in fact didnt know that cat must grin can said duchess most of em do dont know of do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into conversation dont know much said duchess thats fact alice did not at like tone of remark thought must be a well to introduce other subject of conversation while be trying to fix on one cook took cauldron of soup off fire at once set to work throwing everything within reach at duchess babythe fire iron came first then followed shower of saucepan plate dish duchess took notice of even when hit baby be howling so much already that be quite impossible to say whether blow hurt not oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up down in agony of terror oh there go precious nose a unusually large saucepan flew close by very nearly carried off if everybody minded own business duchess said in hoarse growl world must go round deal faster than doe must not be advantage said alice who felt very glad to get opportunity of showing off little of knowledge just think of what work must make with day night see earth take twenty four hour to turn round on axis talking of ax said duchess chop off head alice glanced rather anxiously at cook to see if meant to take hint cook be busily stirring soup seemed not to be listening so went on again twenty four hour think be twelve oh dont bother said duchess never must abide figure with began nursing child again singing sort of lullaby to a did so giving violent shake at end of line speak roughly to little boy beat when sneeze only doe to annoy because know tease chorus in cook baby joined wow wow wow while duchess sang second verse of song kept tossing baby violently up down poor little thing howled so that alice must hardly hear word speak severely to boy beat when sneeze for can thoroughly enjoy pepper when plea chorus wow wow wow here may nurse bit if like duchess said to alice flinging baby at a spoke must go get ready to play croquet with queen hurried out of room cook threw frying pan after a went out just missed alice caught baby with difficulty a be queer shaped little creature held out arm leg in direction just like star fish thought alice poor little thing be snorting like steam engine when caught kept doubling up straightening out again so that altogether for first minute two be a much a must do to hold a soon a have made out proper way of nursing be to twist up into sort of knot then keep tight hold of right ear left foot so a to prevent undoing carried out into open air if dont take child away with thought alice theyre sure to kill in day two wouldnt be murder to leave behind said last word out loud little thing grunted in reply have left off sneezing by time dont grunt said alice thats not at proper way of expressing baby grunted again alice looked very anxiously into face to see what be matter with there must be doubt that have very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also eye be getting extremely small for baby altogether alice did not like look of thing at perhaps be only sobbing thought looked into eye again to see if there be tear there be tear if youre going to turn into pig dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with mind now poor little thing sobbed again grunted be impossible to say went on for while in silence alice be just beginning to think to herself now what be to do with creature when get home when grunted again so violently that looked down into face in alarm time there must be mistake about be neither more le than pig felt that must be quite absurd for to carry further so set little creature down felt quite relieved to see trot away quietly into wood if have grown up said to herself must have made dreadfully ugly child make rather handsome pig think began thinking over other child knew who might do very well a pig be just saying to herself if one only knew right way to change when be little startled by seeing cheshire cat sitting on bough of tree few yard off cat only grinned when saw alice looked good natured thought still have very long claw great many teeth so felt that ought to be treated with respect cheshire pus began rather timidly a did not at know whether must like name however only grinned little wider come pleased so far thought alice went on must tell please way ought to go from here depends good deal on where want to get to said cat dont much care where said alice then doesnt matter way go said cat so long a get somewhere alice added a explanation oh youre sure to do said cat if only walk long enough alice felt that must not

pocket till be about foot high then walked down little passage thenshe found at last in beautiful garden among bright flower bed cool fountain chapter viii queen croquet ground large rose tree stood near entrance of garden rose growing on be white there be three gardener at busily painting red alice thought very curious thing went nearer to watch just a came up to heard one of say look out now five dont go splashing paint over like couldnt help said five in sulky tone seven jogged elbow on seven looked up said thats right five always lay blame on others youd better not talk said five heard queen say only yesterday deserved to be beheaded what for said one who have spoken first thats none of business two said seven yes be business said five ill tell himit be for bringing cook tulip root instead of onion seven flung down brush have just begun well of unjust thing when eye chanced to fall upon alice a stood watching checked suddenly others looked round also of bowed low must tell said alice little timidly why be painting rose five seven said nothing looked at two two began in low voice why fact be see miss here ought to have be red rose tree put white one in by mistake if queen be to find out must have head cut off know so see miss be doing best afore come to at moment five who have be anxiously looking across garden called out queen queen three gardener instantly threw flat upon face there be sound of many footstep alice looked round eager to see queen first came ten soldier carrying club be shaped like three gardener oblong flat with hand foot at corner next ten courtier be ornamented over with diamond walked two two a soldier did after came royal child there be ten of little dear came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couple be ornamented with heart next came guest mostly king queen among alice recognised white rabbit be talking in hurried nervous manner smiling at everything be said went by without noticing then followed knave of heart carrying king crown on crimson velvet cushion last of grand procession came king queen of heart alice be rather doubtful whether ought not to lie down on face like three gardener must not remember ever having heard of such rule at procession besides what must be use of procession thought if people have to lie down upon face so that couldnt see so stood still where be waited when procession came opposite to alice stopped looked at queen said severely who be said to knave of heart who only bowed smiled in reply idiot said queen tossing head impatiently turning to alice went on whats name child name be alice so please majesty said alice very politely added to herself why theyre only pack of card after neednt be afraid of who be said queen pointing to three gardener who be lying round rose tree for see a be lying on face pattern on back be same a rest of pack must not tell whether be gardener soldier courtier three of own child how must know said alice surprised at own courage business of mine queen turned crimson with fury after glaring at for moment like wild beast screamed off with head off nonsense said alice very loudly decidedly queen be silent king laid hand upon arm timidly said consider dear be only child queen turned angrily away from said to knave turn over knave did so very carefully with one foot get up said queen in shrill loud voice three gardener instantly jumped up began bowing to king queen royal child everybody else leave off screamed queen make giddy then turning to rose tree went on what have be doing here may please majesty said two in very humble tone going down on one knee a spoke be trying see said queen who have meanwhile be examining rose off with head procession moved on three of soldier remaining behind to execute unfortunate gardener who ran to alice for protection shant be beheaded said alice put into large flower pot stood near three soldier wandered about for minute two looking for then quietly marched off after others be head off shouted queen head be gone if please majesty soldier shouted in reply thats right shouted queen can play croquet soldier be silent looked at alice a question be evidently meant for yes shouted alice come on then roared queen alice joined procession wondering very much what must happen next itsits very fine day said timid voice at side be walking by white rabbit who be peeping anxiously into face very said alice wheres duchess hush hush said rabbit in low hurried tone looked anxiously over shoulder a spoke then raised upon tiptoe put mouth close to ear whispered shes under sentence of execution what for said alice did say what pity rabbit asked didnt said alice dont think at pity said what for boxed queen ear rabbit began alice gave little scream of laughter oh rabbit whispered in frightened tone queen will hear see came rather late queen said get to place shouted queen in voice of thunder people began running about in direction tumbling up against other however got settled down in minute two game began alice thought have never seen curious croquet ground in life be ridge furrow ball be live hedgehog mallet live flamingo soldier have to double up to stand on hand foot to make arch chief difficulty alice found at first be in managing flamingo succeeded in getting body tucked away comfortably enough under arm with leg hanging down generally just a have got neck nicely straightened out be going to give hedgehog blow with head must twist round look up in face with puzzled expression that must not help bursting out laughing when have got head down be going to begin again be very provoking to find that hedgehog have unrolled be in act of crawling away besides there be generally ridge furrow in way wherever wanted to send hedgehog to a doubled up soldier be always getting up walking off to other part of ground alice soon came to conclusion that be very difficult game indeed player played at once without waiting for turn quarrelling while fighting for hedgehog in very short time queen be in furious passion went stamping about shouting off with head off with head about once in minute alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure have not a yet have dispute with queen knew that might happen minute then thought what must become of theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here great wonder be that there one left alive be looking about for way of escape wondering whether must get away without being seen when noticed curious appearance in air puzzled very much at first after watching minute two made out to be grin said to herself cheshire cat now will have somebody to talk to how be getting on said cat a soon a there be mouth enough for to speak with alice waited till eye appeared then nodded use speaking to thought till ear have come at least one of in minute whole head appeared then alice put down flamingo began account of game feeling very glad have someone to listen to cat seemed to think that there be enough of now in sight more of appeared dont think play at fairly alice began in rather complaining tone quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear speakand dont seem to have rule in particular at least if there be nobody attends to themand youve idea how confusing be thing being alive for instance there arch ive got to go through next walking about at other end of groundand must have croqueted queen hedgehog just now only ran away when saw mine coming how do like queen said cat in low voice not at said alice shes so extremely just then noticed that queen be close behind listening so went on likely to win that hardly worth while finishing game queen smiled passed on who be talking to said king going up to alice looking at cat head with great curiosity friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow to introduce dont like look of at said king however may kiss hand if like id rather not cat remarked dont be impertinent said king dont look at like that got behind alice a spoke cat may look at king said alice ive read that in book dont remember where well must be removed said king very decidedly called queen who be passing at moment dear wish must have cat removed queen have only one way of settling difficulty great small off with head said without even looking round ill fetch executioner said king eagerly hurried off alice thought might a well go back see how game be going on a heard queen voice in distance screaming with passion have already heard sentence three of player to be executed for having missed turn did not like look of thing at a game be in such confusion that never knew whether be turn not so went in search of hedgehog hedgehog be engaged in fight with hedgehog seemed to alice excellent opportunity for croqueting one of with other only difficulty be that flamingo be gone across to other side of garden where alice must see trying in helpless sort of way to fly up into tree by time have caught flamingo brought back fight be over hedgehog be out of sight doesnt matter much thought alice a arch be gone from side of ground so tucked away under arm that might not escape again went back for little more conversation with friend when got back to cheshire cat be surprised to find large crowd collected round there be dispute going on between executioner king queen who be talking at once while rest be quite silent looked very uncomfortable moment alice appeared be appealed to by three to settle question repeated argument to though a spoke at once found very hard indeed to make out exactly what said executioner argument be that couldnt cut off head unless there be body to cut off from that have never have to do thing before wasnt going to begin at time of life king argument be that anything have head must be beheaded that werent to talk nonsense queen argument be that if something wasnt done about in le than time shed have everybody executed round be last remark have made whole party look so grave anxious alice must think of nothing else to say belongs to duchess youd better ask about shes in prison queen said to executioner fetch here executioner went off like arrow cat head began fading away moment be gone by time have come back with duchess have entirely disappeared so king executioner ran wildly up down looking for while rest of party went back to game chapter ix mock turtle story cant think how glad be to see again dear old thing said duchess a tucked arm affectionately into alices walked off together alice be very glad to find in such pleasant temper thought to herself that perhaps be only pepper have made so savage when met in kitchen when im duchess said to not in very hopeful tone though wont have pepper in kitchen at soup doe very well withoutmaybe always pepper make people hot tempered went on very much pleased at having found out new kind of rule vinegar make sourand camomile make bitterandand barley sugar such thing make child sweet tempered only wish people knew that then wouldnt be so stingy about know have quite forgotten duchess by time be little startled when heard voice close to ear youre thinking about something dear make forget to talk cant tell just now what moral of be will remember in bit perhaps hasnt one alice ventured to remark tut tut child said duchess everythings got moral if only can find squeezed up closer to alices side a spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to first because duchess be very ugly secondly because be exactly right height to rest chin upon alices shoulder be uncomfortably sharp chin however did not like to be rude so bore a well a must game going on rather better now said by way of keeping up conversation little ti so said duchess moral of isoh ti love ti love make world go round somebody said alice whispered that done by everybody minding own business ah well mean much same thing said duchess digging sharp little chin into alices shoulder a added moral of istake care of sense sound will take care of how fond be of finding moral in thing alice thought to herself dare say youre wondering why dont put arm round waist duchess said after pause reason be that im doubtful about temper of flamingo will try experiment might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at anxious to have experiment tried very true said duchess flamingo mustard bite moral of isbirds of feather flock together only mustard isnt bird alice remarked right a usual said duchess what clear way have of putting thing mineral think said alice of course be said duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything alice said there large mustard mine near here moral of isthe more there be of mine le there be of yours oh know exclaimed alice who have not attended to last remark vegetable doesnt look like one be quite agree with said duchess moral of isbe what must seem to beor if youd like put more

better alice said very politely if have written down cant quite follow a say thats nothing to what must say if chose duchess replied in pleased tone pray dont trouble to say longer than said alice oh dont talk about trouble said duchess make present of everything ive said a yet cheap sort of present thought alice im glad dont give birthday present like did not venture to say out loud thinking again duchess asked with dig of sharp little chin ive right to think said alice sharply for be beginning to feel little worried just about a much right said duchess a pig have to fly m here to alices great surprise duchess voice died away even in middle of favourite word moral arm be linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up there stood queen in front of with arm folded frowning like thunderstorm fine day majesty duchess began in low weak voice now give fair warning shouted queen stamping on ground a spoke head must be off that in about half time take choice duchess took choice be gone in moment let go on with game queen said to alice alice be too much frightened to say word slowly followed back to croquet ground other guest have taken advantage of queen absence be resting in shade however moment saw hurried back to game queen merely remarking that moment delay must cost life time be playing queen never left off quarrelling with other player shouting off with head off with head whom sentenced be taken into custody by soldier who of course have to leave off being arch to do so by end of hour so there be arch left player except king queen alice be in custody under

poolshe must hear rattle of teacup a march hare friend shared never ending meal shrill voice of queen ordering off unfortunate guest to executiononce more pig baby be sneezing on duchess knee while plate dish crashed around itonce more shriek of gryphon squeaking of lizard slate pencil choking of suppressed guinea pig filled air mixed up with distant sob of miserable mock turtle so sat on with closed eye half believed in wonderland though knew have to open again must change to dull realitythe grass must be only rustling in wind pool rippling to waving of reedsthe rattling teacup must change to tinkling sheep bell queen shrill cry to voice of shepherd boyand sneeze of baby shriek of gryphon other queer noise must change knew to confused clamour of busy farm yardwhile lowing of cattle in distance must take place of mock turtle heavy sob lastly pictured to herself how same little sister of hers must in after time be grown woman how must keep through riper year simple loving heart of childhood how must gather about other little child make eye bright eager with many strange tale perhaps even with dream of wonderland of long ago how must feel with simple sorrow find pleasure in simple joy remembering own child life happy summer day end
