well with nodded went way mr caldwell returned to little dining room holding head high till have shut door when burst into tempest of tear be lymphatic woman ordinarily subject to sudden squall of passion when lost self control must have sobbed aloud now when fit be on in face of whole community although constant effort of life be to keep up appearance have recovered however before servant came in with candle be sitting in window looking out anxiously greyness of long june day be darkening down to night now there be change in sultry stillness of air summer lightning played about in strip of sky above house opposite one of house be butcher shop while mr caldwell sat there butcher brought out lamb killed mr caldwell watched operation with interest did strange thing in day in little irish seaport being englishwoman looked on like civilised traveller intelligently studying custom of savage people a darkness gathered trouble of mind increased husband did not return sickening sensation of dread took possession of where have gone what be doing doubtless enjoying what bitterness there be in thought did not grudge pleasure be hard that must find so little in company why be there distraction for torment of mind be awful must try remedy went to sideboard poured out whisky even a raised to lip felt unworthy to have recourse to put glass down untouched after went leant against window frame be about midnight very few people passed whenever man appeared in distance have moment of hope only to be followed by sickening sensation of disappointment mental anguish be so great that for time paid attention to physical symptom have now begun by degree however became importunate oh relief of trouble of mind ceased when physical pain became acute therefore welcomed a pleasant distraction be obliged to think be practical too there be one in house to help sleeping child be of course out of question two young servant maid of work nurse nearly a much so besides there be difficulty of calling felt must not disturb jane who be in nursery for fear of rousing child must ever get to bridget room be further off step by step climbed stair clinging to banister with one hand holding candle in other several time sank down waited silently with contracted face till paroxysm have passed at last reached door bridget be awake have heard coming holy mother exclaimed startled out of habitual sullenness by mistress agonised face yer ill ma'be let help to bed fetch doctor nurse bridget mr caldwell be just able to gasp in urgency excitement of moment there be truce to hostility bridget jumped up in night dress bare foot supported mistress to room there be obliged to leave alone so happened that just a grey dawn trembled with first flush of new brighter day child arrived unassisted without welcome sent up wail of protest when doctor came at last have time to attend to pronounced to be fine child declared that have made good beginning must do well for word nurse declared to be of happy omen father be not fit to appear until late in day came in humbly filled with remorse for mi spent night be received with feeble flicker of smile so touched softened that made more of new child took greater interest in than have done in of others at time of birth there be difficulty about name for father proposed to call elizabeth after sister said mr caldwell objected elizabeth be miss gottley name also fact recollected did not mention that did not like name seemed reason enough for not choosing husband persisted then there be hot dispute on subject above baby cradle dispute ended in compromise mother agreeing to have child christened elizabeth if be not called so must not have called eliza elsie elspeth bessie betsy be left nothing for to call beth upon consideration parent liked diminutive father because be unaccustomed mother because have association of kind attached to for first three month of life beth cried incessantly a if bewailing advent then one day opened eye wide looked out into world with interest chapter ii be sunshine really that first called into conscious existence blessed heat light up to moment that recognised with certain acknowledgment of consequently of thing in general outside have be a unconscious a white grub without leg moment roused calling forth from sens first response in thrill of warmth well being to awoke quickening intellect at same time with stimulating effort to discover from whence comfort came must remember circumstance in connection with earliest awakening knew of be feeling of warmth brightness said recurred to at odd time ever afterwards must be recalled at will may see in first awakening foreshadowing of fact that be born to be child of light to live in certainly be always light for craved actual light of day however nothing yearned for ever came to in form thought of thus when asked for sunshine be grudgingly given fate often forcing into dark dwelling time light illumines spirit be being bestowed upon in limitless measure next step in awakening be to kind of self consciousness be lying on nurse lap out of door looking up at sky one be saying oh pretty thing be long year before connected phrase with although smiled in response to voice uttered then found on foot in garden moving very carefully for fear of falling everything about be gigantic from jane nettle nurse at whose skirt tugged when wanted to attract attention to brown wallflower purple larkspur must not reach to pull there be thin hedge at end of garden through looked out on path across field thick hedge on left in thrush have built nest at immense height above head jane lifted up to look into nest there be nothing in then jane lifted up again oh there be blue egg there jane lifted up third time egg have brown spot on mystery of egg awed did not ask how came to be there felt solemn wonder in fact colour caused sensation of pleasure positive thrill to run through be first recognition of beauty be to beauty of colour not of form that sens awoke through life have keen joy nice discrimination in colour seemed to herself to have always known name spot on egg be positive that have come between first second peep show how defective faculty of observation became so exact under cultivation be to begin with beth also betrayed other trait with regard to spot carried through life trick of being most positive when be quite in wrong for one want of faith in other people for jane said did see spot time dearie spot just comed beth declared dearie spot always there jane answered spot comed beth maintained dearie spot always there only did see spot comed now beth stamped then because jane shook head sat down suddenly on gravel sent up howl brought father out chucked jane under chin jane giggled then made sign there be mr caldwell looking from one to other to beth recollection seemed a if have rapidly acquired experience of first period incident that remembered be apparently trifling in who can say of what significance a indication in first few year have there be there with intelligence to interpret probably must have found foreshadowing of might be do suffer must have be time to teach to therefore earliest impression be more interesting than much occurred to in after life have carefully collected in hope of finding clue in to what followed in several instance seems to that impression left by chance observation incident on baby mind made possible for to do many thing in after life certainly never must have done for early influence must be affectation therefore to apologise for such detail nothing can be trivial insignificant tends to throw light on mysterious growth of moral intellectual being many cramped soul struggle on in after year vainly endeavouring to rise on broken wing might have importance of such seeming trifle in development be recognised have won way upward from first untrammelled uninjured be jesuit be not who said give child until be six year old after that can do a like with be time to make indelible impression of principle upon mind in first period of life character be blossom must be carefully touched in second petal fall fruit set be hard acrid then until third period when if thing go well will ripen on bough be sweet wholesome if ill will drop off immediately rot upon ground beth be combative child always at war with jane there be great battle fought about big black velvet bonnet beth wanted to wear one day beth screamed kicked scratched bit finally went out in bonnet triumphantly found standing alone on edge of great green world dotted with yellow gorse hot wide dusty road stretched mile away in front of at infinite distance overhead be blue sky flecked with cloud so white dazzling that eye ached when looked at have stopped moment to cry wait for jane walked on however taking notice beth struggled after whimpering out of breath choked with dust scorched with heat parched with thirst tired to death how suffered heartless lark sang overhead regardless of misery never afterwards lark without recalling long white road heat dust fatigue tore off velvet bonnet threw away then began despairing wait for in midst of cry saw little yellow flower growing in grass at roadside plumped down then there inconsequently to gather by time jane be out of sight at moment beth became aware of fact also perceived appalling expanse of bright blue sky above sat gazing upwards paralysed with terror be first experience of loneliness first terrified sensation of immensity then snowdrop crocus be out sky grew black sat on nursery floor looked up at in solemn wonder flake of snow began to fall few at first then thicker thicker till air be full of jane said scotch be picking goose immediately beth saw scotch sitting in vague scene picking goose in frenzied haste throwing great handful of feather up in air be probably first independent flight of imagination be astonishing how little consciousness of time there be in reminiscence season be confounded be a if thing have happened not in succession abreast there be snow on ground when brother jim be with in wash house making horse hair snare to catch bird made running loop of horse hair tied on to stick then went out stuck in ground in garden outside wash house window sprinkled crumb of bread crept carefully back to watch first came robin with noiseless flight lit on ground with head on one side child be too eager in excitement made noise robin flew away next came sparrow saw child saw crumb with habitual self possession of race stretched in head between stick picked out largest piece of bread carried off in triumph immediately afterwards blackbird flew down hopped in among snare unconsciously in moment be caught with wild shout of joy child rushed out to secure prize when reached spot blackbird have burst bond escaped then beth threw chunk of wood at brother cut head open cry brought out household beth be well shaken be always being shaken at time marched off promptly to papa dressing room made to sit on little chair in middle of floor where amused by singing at top of voice around sebastopol around ocean time gun go off down fall russian wondered why father mother be laughing when came to release before appeared however brother jim victim have come to door with head tied up peeped in knew that be friend again because shot ripe gooseberry at across floor a if have be marble there be discrepancy here seeing that snow ripe gooseberry be not in season at same time be likely however that broke brother head more than once occasion became confounded in recollection when child went to bathe off beach beth must not let jane dip if kicking scratching screaming must prevent there used to be terrible scene between until at last one day somebody else old scotch nurse interfered persuaded beth to go into water with consent to be dipped three time beth went like lamb instead of having to be dragged in pushed under given time to recover breath between dip half choked with sand salt water finally dragged out exhausted by struggle certainly suffering more than have benefited by immersion cold water came up about took breath away a old scotch nurse led in beth clung to hand panted wait a nerved for dip nurse have promised to wait until beth be ready be beth faith in promise gave courage to go bravely through ordeal old scotch nurse never deceived a jane have done so beth learnt that there be people in world can depend on there be one painful circumstance in connection with battle on beach beth be such tiny girl did not think necessary to give bathing dress consequently be marched into water with nothing on agony of shame suffered be indescribable worst of be shame wore off jim teased about called little girl dreadful term of reproach in day when boy be taught to consider superior being beth flew at fought for be beaten then took off thing in nursery scampered up down before with nothing on just to show how little cared be astonishing how small part beth family play in childish recollection father took very little notice of child be out of health irritable only tried to save annoyance not to disturb be object of everybody life probably only appeared on scene when beth be naughty recollection being painful be quickly banished remembered coming downstairs when be standing in hall one day when mother be away from home have letter in hand asked if must send love to mamma heart bounded seemed to such tremendous thing to be asked be dying to send love agony of shyness came upon must not utter word have little hymn book in hand however held out to father no must not do must not send book only love did love mamma did not word must come through life be afflicted with inability to speak at critical time dumb always be apt to be when affection be concerned except occasionally in moment of strong excitement in anger when be driven to bay intensity of feeling must probably have made dumb in case in moment of emotion doubtless hardness of about at impressionable period strengthened defect be impossible to escape from hampering influence of infancy among beth many recollection of day there be not one of caress given received of expression of tenderness so never became familiar with exquisite language of love be long in learning that be not thing to be ashamed of concealed later day with mighty effort summoned up courage enough to go down to father be determined to send message to mamma when came to point be again unable to utter word on subject mother have gone to stay with relation in england beth found father in dining room several other people be present be standing by sideboard mixing whisky water so instead of sending love to mamma beth exclaimed confidently pleasantly if drink whisky will be drunk again smart slap rewarded sally beth turned pale recoiled be first taste of human injustice to drink to be drunk be to merely natural sequence of cause effect must not conceive why must be slapped turned out of room so promptly for uttering simple truth beth be present at many discussion between father mother took much interest in more perhaps because most of what be said be mystery to wondered why mention of moon faced bessie disturbed mother countenance jane nettle too when mother be out father used to come talk to jane laughed good deal admired jane white teeth child used to make jane show teeth after papa say jane got nice white teeth beth said to mother one day never forgot glance mr caldwell threw at husband eye fell before even servant henry mr caldwell exclaimed then left room beth learned what meant in after year career of one of brother furnishing clue like father like son be after mr caldwell went to visit relation in england accompanied by two of child be in summer jane took beth to castle hill morning to see steamer with mother on board go by sea be iridescent like molten silver sky be high cloudless where sea sky met mingled on horizon be impossible to determine number of steamer passed far out looked quite small beth did not think there be room in of for mother brother sister did not therefore interest much did policeman who came talked to jane castle hill little winding path up have come green of grass bramble fern ruined masonry against leant union of sea sky shore light colour absorbed drew out of soul expanded spread wing stretched out spiritual arm to meet clasp beloved nature of felt to be part be earliest recognition of kinship glimpse of greatness moment of ecstasy never to be forgotten first stirring in herself of creative faculty for in joy burst out into little song far on border of arcane be a if pleasure played upon using a passive instrument by attained to audible expression for how must child know word like arcane came to a thing do have known forgotten whole song did in fact held a possession sacred to herself never recorded told more than one line although stayed with lingered on lip in heart for rest of life be great moment for moment when further faculty first awoke on looking back to in after year fancied found in confirmation of opinion afterwards formed genius to be yet only word for soul must not believe that have soul that be at equally developed even in who have obtained be child under six at time jane nettle be woman between twenty thirty policeman must not say what age be be only one of three throbbed responsive to beauty of wonderful scene before felt being flooded with glory of hour meanwhile what parent must have called education have begun went with mildred elder sister to day school used to run down street together without nurse sense of freedom be delicious to beth have to pas market where great mealy specimen potato be displayed mary lynch shop be vegetable woman who used to talk to mr caldwell about child when went there one other always called poor little body upon commented afterwards among mary lynch be large red faced woman when child wanted to describe stout person always said a fat a mary lynch one house beth have to pas on way to school made strong impression on imagination be gloomy abode with broad doorstep deep portico broken window mud splashed door from beneath always expected to see slender stream of blood slowly trickling for man called macgregor have murdered wife there beaten brain out with poker beth never heard name macgregor in after life without shiver of dislike much of time at school be spent in solitary confinement for breach of peace with face a impassive a monkey must do most mischievous thing be always experimenting in naughty trick a on one occasion when miss deeble left schoolroom for minute have to come hurrying back recalled by wild shriek found that beth have managed in minute to tip up form with four child on throw book out of window sprinkle ink over floor miss deeble marched downstairs to empty kitchen left sitting on stool in middle of with b c in hand beth took interest in alphabet in day hunted black beetle with bellow instead of learning hearthstone be place of execution when found beetle must blow along to with bellow there despatch have horror of creature in childhood a matured whole temperament changed in respect when met beetle on stair must turn fly rather than pas must feel nauseated shiver with disgust for hour after if thought of knew exact moment that horror came upon happened when be ten year old found beetle one day lying on back thinking be dead took up be swinging by antenna when creature suddenly wriggled round twined prickly leg about finger giving start from never recovered beth probably got a far a b ab while be at miss deeble if be backward with book other faculty began to be acute be down in empty kitchen that first felt enchantment of music one suddenly played piano overhead beth listened spell bound again again player played always same thing practising beth knew note long afterwards be trying waltz of chopin came upon one with be quite familiar knew that have heard over over again must not think when where presently however a played perceived smell of black beetle instantly be back in disused kitchen of miss deeble listening to practising overhead beth sens be acute from first memory helped by involuntary association of incongruous idea many people recollection be stimulated by sense of smell be rarer thing for sense of taste to be associated with past in same way a be in beth case there be many circumstance be recalled by taste of food have be eating at time occurred child often dined in garden in early day once piece of apple dumpling beth be eating slid off plate on to gravelled walk one picked up put on plate again covered with stone grit sight of hot apple dumpling made think of gravel ever afterwards filled with disgust so that must not eat have great aversion to bread butter too for long time that got over must have be too great inconvenience to have child dislike staple food in probability be forced to conquer aversion afterwards grew to like bread butter still if by chance circumstance caused dislike to recurred to when be eating piece be obliged to stop incident set up association happened one evening when father mother be out beth be alone in dining room eating bread butter towie cat came into room with mouse in mouth mouse be alive towie let run little way then pounced down upon then gave pat to make run again beth lying on stomach on floor watching proceeding naturally also became cat with mouse at last towie began to eat mouse beginning with head crushed

to recur to with same result even description of anything horrifying affected in way one day when be growing up mother told at dinner that have be on pier that morning have seen body of man discoloured swollen from being in water long time towed into harbour by fishing boat beth listened asked question a always did on occasion with deepest interest be taking soup strongly flavoured with catsup at moment story in way interfered with appetite next time tried catsup ever afterwards perceived that swollen discoloured corpse immediately felt nauseated be curious that association of idea be disagreeable have not single pleasant one in connection with food chapter iii of beth be not eye at time be ear brain be a busy a squirrel in autumn storing observation registering impression doe not do to trust to child not understanding may not understand at moment will remember same more perhaps because doe not understand curiosity will help to solve problem beth did humorous thing at time have sense of humour be merely experimenting big eye looked out of impassive face solemnly one suspected phenomenal receptivity that stolid mask concealed because alphabet did not interest formed poor opinion of intellect truth be that have use for letter figure book of nature of life be spread out before be conning content to more purpose than one else must have interpreted to in day a to

tub of water for bird to drink beth hunkered down beside held out hand full of corn pigeon be very tame presently beautiful blue rock came up confidently began to eat eye be deep rich orange colour beth caught stroked glossy plumage delighting in exquisite metallic sheen on neck breast colour gave almost painful sensation of pleasure changed on sudden into fit of blind exasperation grief for loss of kitty have gripped again with horrid twinge clenched teeth in pain finger closed convulsively round pigeon throat held out at arm length shook viciously till nictitating membrane dropped over eye head sank back bill opened hung from hand inert heap of ruffled feather then tension of nerve relaxed be relief to have crushed life out of something let bird drop stood looking at a animal might have looked with impassive face betrays shade of emotion a did so however bird showed sign of life suddenly quickening into interest stooped down turned over examined then sprinkled with water made drink rapidly revived when be able to stand let go be soon feeding among companion a if nothing have happened beth watched for little with same animal like expressionless gravity of countenance then moved off unconcernedly never mentioned incident to one never forgot only feeling about be that pigeon have have narrow escape chapter vi beth be fine instrument sensitive to touch considering way be handled must have be wonder if discordant effect have not be constantly produced upon hers be nature with wide range be probable that conceivable impulse be latent in possibility of good evil exactly must predominate depended upon influence of early year almost influence came under be haphazard there be intelligent direction of thought systematic training to form good habit brother be sent to school a soon a be old enough so have advantage of regular routine strict discipline from first couple of hour day for lesson be considered enough for little girl for rest of time so long a be on premise not naughty be to say gave trouble be taken for granted that be safe morally physically of parent seem to have suspected extreme precocity there be doubt that beth suffered seriously in after life from mistake of in authority over at period people admired bright eye without realising that must see with not only that must see that must not help seeing even if have realised must merely have scolded for learning anything in way preferred that must not know be not sufficiently intelligent to perceive that be not what know of thing what think of make for good evil beth be accordingly allowed to run wild expected to see nothing time mind be being involuntarily stored with observation from in time to come for want of instruction must be forced to draw own often erroneous conclusion kitty departure be beth first great grief suffered terribly prop stay of little life have gone comfort kindness order discipline be essential to nature mr caldwell be good woman who must certainly do what thought best for child be exhausted by unconscionable production of too numerous family family have mean strength to bring up properly husband health too grew ever more precarious found obliged to do in power to help with duty be arduous there be good deal that must do in way of writing official letter managing money matter task for be much better fitted than for management of child child meanwhile have to be left to care of others not that must have be bad thing for have mother have sufficient discrimination to enable to choose proper kind of people to be with unfortunately for everybody however mr caldwell have be brought up on old fashioned principle that absolute ignorance of human nature be best qualification for wife mother be consequently quite unprepared for possibility have not formed part of own simple limited personal experience never suspected for one thing that servant conversation must be undesirable if appearance character from last mistress be satisfactory therefore when kitty have gone put anne in place without misgiving anne principal recommendation being that be nice looking girl have pretty deferential manner anne came from one of cabin on irish side of road where people pig poultry with occasional cow goat donkey herded together indiscriminately window be about foot square be not made to open sometimes have glass in be oftener stopped up with rag before door be heap of manure pool of stagnant water there be regular footway mere beaten track in front of cabin on wet day be ankle deep in mud woman hung about door day long knitting men blue stocking did little else apparently men woman be usually in torpid state result doubtless of breathing poisoned atmosphere of insufficient food took strong stimulant to rouse love hate jealousy whisky battle murder sudden death conversation be gross be very immoral be hardly necessary to say so for with men woman child animal crowded together in such surroundings morbid craving for excitement to people who have comfort wholesome interest in life fall prey immorality be inevitable be boast of place that there be illegitimate child must have be better sign if there have be mr caldwell true to training lived opposite to vice squalor serenely indifferent to anne therefore who knew nothing about management of child be not in respect proper person to have charge of have all own way in nursery way be to hing that must help used to call child in morning then leave to own device moment be awake be pretty soon for be full of life began to batter other with pillow dance about room in night dress pitch tent with bed clothes on floor make noise enough to bring mother down upon then anne must be summoned come hurrying up help to huddle on clothes somehow never washed encouraged to perform own ablution did with end of towel dipped in jug consequence be be generally in very dirty state took meal with parent papa must notice dirt eventually storm at mamma in italian when word must ensue in tone made child quake then mamma must storm at anne for whom child felt sorry result must be bath bore with fortitude for fear of getting anne into further trouble even made good resolution about washing kept for few day then however began to shirk again have again to be scrubbed resolution of child must be shored up by kindly supervision otherwise be hardly likely that will cement into good habit beth suffered from continual sense of discomfort in day for want of proper attention clothing fitted badly be fastened on with anything came to hand in way of tape button hair be ill brushed be so continually found fault with sense of self respect be checked in development lost faith in own power to do anything right well consequence be most profound disheartenment endured in silence with exquisite uncomplaining fortitude of little child made mark on countenance however in settled expression of discontent being mistaken for bad disposition repelled people made many enemy people generally said that mildred be dear beth did not look pleasant for many long day to come very few troubled to try make look so can not be said that beth parent neglected child on contrary father thought much of education of future be importance of present did not strike so with mother parent be careless care stopped short too soon be astonishing amount of liberty child have be sent out of door a soon a be dressed in morning because sunshine air be so essential to child if went for walk anne accompanied very often anne be wanted then child be left to loiter about garden

learning by heart from book did not come naturally to learned by ear easily enough not by sight hymn prayer kitty have repeated to very soon picked up kitty have true sympathetic insight to inform of what child required little lesson be proper to occasion have comfort in what beth learned now on contrary often filled with gloom of hymn such a when gathering cloud around view day be dark friend be few made especially miserable be always dark day to when repeated with heavy cloud collecting overhead solitary little speck on mountain side wandering alone chapter vii be significant to note that church figure largely in beth recollection of time religion not at there be in fact connection between two in mind captain mr caldwell protested strongly against what called cant seemed to have called everything cant except occasional cold reading aloud of bible on sunday bald observance of church service bible read aloud to child without expounding service attended without comment display of religious emotion in everyday life regarded a symptom of insanity if heard people discus religion with enthusiasm profess to love lord be genuinely shocked kind of thing thought such cant so like horrid dissenter made extra careful that child must hear nothing of sort from point of view be right wise in beth case especially for unsatisfied soul be of quality soon yearns for fine fulness of faith little heart must have filled to bursting with first glad conception of love divine whole being must have stirred to speak emotion even though speech meant martyrdom thanks to precaution of parent however heard nothing to stimulate natural tendency to religious fervour after kitty departure gradually image of blessed lady faded from mind be succeeded by of god of parent death dealing
