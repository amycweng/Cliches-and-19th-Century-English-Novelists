be how happened that evadne made acquaintance at early age be during first visit to fraylingay while be still quite tiny be hardly in teen that event referred to in illustration of one of evadne characteristic occurred twin have arrived late in afternoon be taken into dining room where table be already decorated for dinner evidently attracted good deal of attention said nothing at dessert however to evadne have come down with elder child dining room door be seen to open with portentous slowness there appeared in aperture two little figure in long nightgown forefinger in mouth inquisitive nose tilted in air bright eye round with astonishment be like middle of night to have expected to find room empty oh naughty child lady adeline exclaimed darling cried mr frayling evadne

diavolo up in midst of general hilarity carried out of room with hand pressed tight on thigh child have come down armed with open penknife with to defend angelica must encounter ogre giant on stair in scrambling up table have managed to strike in thigh with have severed femoral artery with curious shame make child dislike to own that be hurt have contrived to conceal accident for moment with

be safely accomplished by time mr diavolo be sufficiently exhausted to be good go to sleep then quietly fainted be about again in time to catch when woke keep quiet so by unwearied watching prevented accident until danger be over diavolo afterward heard parent praise in unmeasured term to parent one day in absence happened to return while be still in room being doubtless wide awake to advantage of such connection took opportunity of promising solemnly in presence of such respectable witness to marry a soon a be able have added word tourniquet to vocabulary during time having looked up in

antidote to poison of what to do in case of many possible accident also of nursing theoretically be not solitary instance of quiet power of girl already compelled even elderly gentleman much overworked absorbed to sacrifice in service chapter iii be notable thing that in almost instance be father influence forced evadne to draw conclusion in regard to life quite unlike of own very distasteful to be most conservative of men yet be continually setting mind off at tangent in search of premise upon to found ultra liberal conclusion primitive theory about woman that be good for for one thing differed so materially from fact a observed day formed constant mental stimulus to busy brain be greatly indebted woman must confine attention to housekeeping remarked once when talk about higher education of woman first began to irritate elderly gentleman be be fit for be said evadne yes know arithmetic enough to do properly why asked because have brain answered woman have be clever ventured seriously yes of course exceptional woman ca argue from exceptional woman then ordinary woman have brain can not learn arithmetic concluded precisely answered irritably such sign of intelligence always did irritate somehow evadne found food for reflection in remark have done certain amount of arithmetic herself in schoolroom have never found difficult then have not gone far enough perhaps went at once to get colenso barnard smith to see found more fascinating when attacked of own free will with intelligence than have done when necessity in shape of governess forced to pay attention went through in few week at odd time then asked father advice about book on advanced mathematics advanced mathematics exclaimed can keep account know answered doubtfully then what be nonsense about advanced mathematics oh have finished barnard smith thought must like to go on explained now be that like sex observed smiling at own superiority pick thing up with parrot like sharpness have intelligence enough to make practical application of woman closely resembles parrot in mental process in use make of fine phrase doe not understand to produce effect of cleverness such a 'advanced mathematics evadne bent brow let ruminate little in infinite self content then asked abruptly can men keep account who have never seen account kept of course not answered seeing in new instance of feminine imbecility laughing ah observed then added thoughtfully a moved away must like to see how account be kept never have more conversation with father upon subject from time forward mathematics have before be only incident in way of lesson became interest in life solid part of education although found must do arithmetic without great difficulty never occurred to either that father must be wrong that there might be in making of exceptional woman habit of love respect kept attention from point must have led to judgment upon father be too unconscious of a separate unit to make personal application of anything a yet mind at time like hold of ship with general cargo be merely being stored with raw material be to be distributed over whole life turned by degree to many purpose useful beautiful not impossibly detestable remark of father about woman be fit for kept well watered from time to time with other conventional expression of contemptuous kind be undoubtedly seed of much more than knowledge of higher mathematics be that set mind off on long patient inquiry into condition capacity of woman made in end of nineteenth century essentially did not begin inquiry of set purpose be not even conscious of particular attention paid to subject have foregone conclusion to arrive at wish to find evidence in favour of woman must prove man wrong only coming across so many sneer at incapacity of woman fell insensibly into habit of asking why question to begin with be always why be woman such inferior being by degree a reading extended changed form then asked doubtfully be woman such inferior being position carried in front of father at once by hundred year led rapidly on to final conclusion that woman have originally congenital defect of inferiority that although have still much way to make up now rest with to be inferior not a choose have industrious habit of writing what thought about work studied there be interesting record still in existence of course of reading between age of twelve nineteen consists of one thick volume on title page of have written roundly without flourish commonplace book date first entry be made in careful unformed

record be proof contains that argument upon formed opinion be found in enemy work alone have drawn own conclusion after having done so a happened have satisfaction of finding confirmation strong in john stuart mill on subjection of woman came across by accident accident by way for lady adeline hamilton well be responsible brought book to fraylingay forgot when went home evadne happening to find throwing about took charge of read with avidity found for world of thought in must breathe freely vicar of wakefield be one of early favourite read several time make mention of twice in commonplace book first notice of be childish little synopsis very quaint in unconscious irony interesting principally from fact that be struck even then by point upon afterward became so strong vicar say be good man very fond of wife family be very fond of wife be queer must only read little never taught to improve although have book be learned footnote be point alluded to have two daughter who be spiteful did not like other girl to be pretty have bad taste too wanted to go to church overdressed thought finer to ride plough horse than walk doe not say that ever read anything either if have must have

forgot though have lost money have great trouble vicar be put in prison be very ill preached to prisoner everybody loved like 'the vicar of wakefield ' very much if can not find book a nice will read again gentle hermit ' be silly suppose punch took edwin angelina out of to laugh at quite three year must have elapsed before again mention vicar of wakefield in meantime have be reading fair variety

lewes life of goethe be one of wrote glowing description of at end of say found book on sofa in drawing room began without thinking read read until have nearly finished quite forgetting to ask leave of course went at once to tell father a soon a thought of mother be there too inclined to scold father frowned said alone will do harm wo understand ' asked if might finish said 'oh yes impatiently

perceiving powerful stimulant under influence of everything be lost sight of point perceived have never to fight daily exhausting battle for private opinion a talkative people have simply because

expressly remember what wrote about first time read will not look to see until have written what think now because must like to know if still agree with a be then be interesting to note how very much doe agree with a be then feeling in fact be same have passed from heart to head be resolved by process into positive opinion held with conscious knowledge delivered with greatly improved power of

be making mistake said what exclaimed ready to bluster must have countenance such conduct why be perfectly revolutionary if other woman follow example not one man in ten will be able to get wife when want to marry be very terrible answered in even way to hear that so large majority will be condemned to celibacy have doubt have good ground for making assertion be not point however what be thinking of be risk run of bringing more serious trouble on by cutting evadne adrift from influence of happy childhood casting lot among stranger into world of intrigue alone will come to sens when find so

so concealed evadne letter from wrote to again surreptitiously in order to reproach for seeming to insinuate that mother must stoop to do anything underhand evadne sighed when received letter thought of letting matter drop why must dislike to see father in position unreasonable husband father usually occupy that of being ostensibly obeyed while in reality be carefully kept in dark a to what be going on about why must object to allow mother to act a so many other worthy weak woman daily do in self defence for love of peace quietness there seemed to be no great good to be gained by persisting

common to class to keep private trouble to nobody knew precisely what difficulty have be intimate friend whom delicacy debarred from making inquiry least of lady adeline just mentioned matter to mr orton beg asked be difficulty may be discussed better not think latter answered of course subject dropped poor lady adeline be too much occupied with domestic anxiety of own at time to feel more than passing gleam of sympathetic interest in other people a lord dawne have hinted to mr beg be now question of how best to educate twin parent have made what considered suitable arrangement for instruction child unfortunately be not satisfied with have have governess in common while be still quite small mr hamilton well have old fashioned idea about superior education of boy consequently when child have outgrown nursery governess decided that angelica must have more advanced have at same time engaged tutor for diavolo sending to school being out of question because of fear of further trouble from artery have severed when arrangement became known child be seen to put head together do like having different teacher diavolo inquired tentatively said angelica lady adeline have tried to prepare governess latter brought experience of anything like angelica to help to understand that young lady so warning went for nothing little affection go long way with child said to lady adeline always endeavour to make pupil understand care for wish to make lesson task pleasure to be good system must think lady adeline observed speaking dubiously however can do long division dear governess asked angelica when sat down to lesson for first time miss apsley angelica answered sweetly then will show how must attend know last be said with playful authority so angelica attended how did get on morning lady adeline asked miss apsley anxiously afterward oh perfectly latter answered dear child be interest endeavour lady adeline said more such docility be unnatural did not like look of at next day angelica with innocent air gave miss apsley long division sum have completed during night be done by immense number of figure covered four sheet of foolscap gummed together miss apsley worked at for hour to verify finding quite correct decided that angelica knew long division enough must go on to something else first impression be that have secured singularly apt pupil be much surprised when began to teach angelica next rule in arithmetic to find that must not make dear child see angelica listened tried with appearance of honest intention getting red hot with effort must not put slate down must go on trying till head ached be so eager to learn work a might must hing long division miss apsley said have never known anything so singular lady adeline sighed for about week twin lay low tutor have found absolutely impossible to teach diavolo anything boy be perfectly docile must sit with bright eye riveted on master face listening with might main apparently at end of explanation tutor found same thing diavolo never have faintest idea of what have be talking about at end of week however child changed tactic when lesson ought to have begun one morning diavolo went to miss apsley sat down beside in angelica place with smiling countenance without word of explanation while angelica presented to tutor with diavolo book under arm please sir said there must have be mistake diavolo find that be mixed somehow wrong got mind got mine can do lesson quite easily ca do own can do mine ca do holding up book be like see ca learn from lady ca learn from man so be going to be pupil be going to be miss apsley understand twin expect be always awkward about there be so often something wrong with know fact of matter be that be diavolo be tutor governess appealed to mr hamilton well mr hamilton well sent for twin lectured lady adeline sitting by seriously perplexed child stood to attention together listened respectfully then went back to lesson with undeviating cheerfulness diavolo did angelica angelica did diligently none other must do state of thing must not continue in order to end mr hamilton well have recourse to weak expedient have more than once successfully employed unknown to lady adeline sent for twin consulted wish privately what do want asked well sir diavolo answered think be fair for angelica only to have beastly governess to teach when know a much a do be precious sight sharper taught all know diavolo did angelica broke in yes said diavolo with wise nod be beastly unfair continued to put off with squeaking governess long division when ought to be doing mathematics latin greek dear child what use must mathematics latin greek be to mr hamilton well protested just a much use a will to diavolo answered decidedly doe know half a much about good of education a do just ask whisked round on brother a spoke demanded tell papa diavolo what be use of being educated be sure know diavolo answered impressively dear boy mathematics be education in mr hamilton well began didactically moving long white hand in way always suggested lace ruffle will teach to reason then will teach to reason too said angelica setting down on arm of chair a if have made up mind intended to let know movement be quick diavolo deliberate men be always jeering at woman in book for not being able to reason be going to learn if there be help in mathematics continued found something other day where be now be down on knee in moment emptying content of pocket on to floor sifting there be two pocket handkerchief of fine texture exceedingly dirty a if have be there for month one used carried in bosom of dress up sleeve ball of string catapult swan shot silver pen pencil holder part of old song book pocket book tin tack knife with several blade scissors etc also silver fruit knife two coloured pencil indiarubber scrap of dirty paper wrapped round piece of almond toffee be apparently what wanted for took off toffee threw latter into grate whither diavolo eye followed regretfully spread paper out on lap whence be seen to be covered with cabalistic looking figure here be said copied out of book other day put round toffee because knew must be wanting then must see time took out of pocket not forget why did throw toffee away said diavolo shut up listen angelica rejoined from floor politely then began to read 'histories make men wise poet witty mathematics subtle natural philosophy deep moral grave logic rhetoric able to contend ' now be what want papa want to know have good time expect will have to contend to get will soon learn how said diavolo encouragingly mr hamilton well have always enjoyed child precocity provided amused must make do anything so after conference announced that have be questioning angelica have found that really be too far advanced for governess have therefore decided that must share diavolo lesson with tutor governess accordingly disappeared from hamilton house first tutor found that have vocation for teaching left also be procured with great difficulty at considerable expense for fame of heavenly twin be wide spread parent be determined besides not to let candidate engage under pleasing delusion that task of teaching must be something of sinecure tutor finally secured turned out to be very good fellow fortunately gentleman with keen sense of humour twin appreciated so that took to at once treated pretty well on whole lesson be usually lively time angelica who continued to be taller stronger wickeder of two soon proved cleverer also like evadne be consumed by rage to know insisted upon dragging diavolo on with be interesting to see sitting side by side dark head touching fair one a bent together intently over problem when diavolo be not quick enough angelica must rouse up in old way by knocking head be still harder of two against angelica did see strike brother mr elli sternly demanded first time witnessed performance know whether saw not sir certainly did strike angelica answered irritably why to wake up see sir diavolo proceeded to explain in imperturbable drawl angelica discovered be born with hee red air ee predisposition to be muff mostly be on father side of family if be one be because slapped tendency out of a soon a perceived angelica interrupted get on diavolo have patience with when be so slow know want to learn be why be snailing be rather trick of diavolo to snail over lesson for in a in many other thing be very unlike good little boy who loved book besides evincing many other trait of character equally unpopular at present time diavolo must not work unless angelica made worst collision with tutor be upon subject wake up theodore will mr elli said during first week of study not until call diavolo be bland response mr elli resisted for time diavolo be firm must hing lady adeline cautioned tutor to give in if saw opportunity of doing so with dignity young scamp will be jeeringly triumphant if do mr elli objected oh lady adeline answered diavolo pride upon being gentleman say gentleman never jeer make unpleasant idea on latter point by way be peculiarly own will probably differ from a to what be be not unpleasant mr elli made point of calling boy diavolo in casual way a if have forgotten dispute a early a possible after found that lady adeline be right diavolo showed not slightest sign of having heard got out book at once did lesson a if liked mr hamilton well have habit of always saying little more than be necessary on subject be born naturalist have never conquered problem of what not to say be so incautious a to come into schoolroom one morning while lesson be going on warn mr elli to be most careful about what gave twin to read in latin because of classic delicacy boy be expected to swallow without injury to be much too highly seasoned for young lady must make judicious excerpt said slap came dictionary down upon table angelica be deep in ex in moment excerpt found be to pick take out passed dictionary to diavolo who studied definition of made remark from day forth however spent spare moment have in poring over latin text book until mastered language simply for purpose of finding out what be that angelica ought not to know there be a have already be stated lively scene at lesson talk le do more mr elli rashly recommended in early day of acquaintance after when disagreed claimed that have authority to settle difference by tearing other hair scratching other across table when interfered sometimes scratched too mr hamilton well raised salary eventually child invariably have discussion about everything a soon a be over called talking out after have sinned suffered punishment great delight be to come coax tutor to talk out must then criticize own conduct impartially point out what might have done what might have done what ought to have be done on side discussion usually took place at schoolroom tea meal tutor child a rule thoroughly enjoyed mr elli be not bound to have tea with twin have politely invited on day of arrival explaining that parent be out must give great pleasure to entertain tea being ready took to schoolroom where found square table just large enough for four daintily decorated with flower very nice china have to buy own china because break so much angelica said seeing that tutor noticed be kind of thing papa got for indicating hugely thick white cup saucer stood on mantelpiece on stand of royal blue plush covered with glass shade broke others have that one mounted a warning to papa have taste at tutor face be study be first of remark have heard child decided that must balance table better if poured out tea good naturedly acquiesced sat down with angelica on right diavolo on left fourth seat opposite be unoccupied there be cover laid asked who be expected oh be for peace angel said diavolo casually prevents difficulty at tea know angelica supplemented mind difficulty thought might object so asked holiness indicating empty chair to preserve order mr elli did not at first appreciate boon be conferred on by presence of peace angel soon learnt to be on honour thick bread butter to day said diavolo looking longingly at plentiful supply variety of cake on table what doe mean exactly mr elli asked pausing with teapot raised to pour why see be naughty morning angelica explained a mamma be going out put on honour a punishment not to eat cake have good mind not to eat anything said diavolo considering plate of thick bread butter beside discontentedly then will be cutting off nose to vex face said angelica diavolo caught up piece of bread butter to throw at held up hand cry appeal to peace angel forgot said diavolo transferring bread to plate child studied tutor during tea be man of thirty somewhat careworn about eye with excessively kind pleasant face clean shaven thick reddy brown hair be above middle height little stooped at shoulder of average strength like look of said angelica frankly thank answered smiling vote for permanent arrangement said looking at diavolo be just then hidden behind huge slice of bread biting nodded intelligently permanent arrangement referred to be to have tutor to tea agreed wisely stipulating however that presence of peace angel must also be permanent even tried to persuade twin to invite to lesson that firmly declined will like being tutor think diavolo observed during first tea will if like said angelica significantly be going to diavolo asked yes think so answered taking good look at mr elli like look of red in hair now be that woman reason diavolo exclaimed appealing to mr elli yes be said angelica preparing to defend by shuffling note book out of pocket ruffling leaf over listen to read ' tinge of red in hair denotes strength energy of character good staying power ' want muff for tutor do there be born muff enough in family without importing woman reason be always good one a men might see if 'd only stop chattering listen to may be well expressed will bear examination mr elli suggested do like being tutor diavolo depends on whom have to teach if be good fellow will have nice time here on whole hope sir angelica observed why be tutor to earn living mr elli answered smiling again child remembered when be having tea under shadow of supposititious peace angel wing after first occasion on when tutor tried to separate during fight at lesson have turned simultaneously attacked made text of recommendation expressed strong objection to having manual labour imposed upon a well a other work maintained that if only have called affray struggle for daily bread fight for livelihood must quite have enjoyed further suggested that such diversion must be much more interesting than being mere commonplace tutor who only taught lesson must not understand why fight be not a much fun for a for thought unreasonable when found be not to be persuaded to countenance way of varying monotony not that there be ever much monotony in neighbourhood of heavenly twin managed to introduce variety into everything quickness of action when be roused be phenomenal one day while at work saw sparrow pick up piece of bread take to roof tree of angle of house visible from schoolroom window drop chase a fell twin have made bet a to must beat bird bread quarrelled because must not agree a to have bet on bird on bread boxed other ear almost before race be over mr elli although continually upon guard be not by mean always match for over over again found that caution have be fanned to sleep by flattering attention while trap be being laid for with most innocent air in world a on one occasion when diavolo betrayed into dissertation on consistency of scripture angelica asked to kindly show how to reconcile prov viii for wisdom be better than ruby thing may be desired be not be compared to with eccles for in much wisdom be much grief increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow way with be admirable however completely won heart thing that respected for most be fact that took in punch on own account must show lot of thing in that must never have discovered a angelica said read bit in way made seem ever so much funnier than when read must tell who drew picture moment looked at so that punch day came to be looked forward to by child a one of pleasantest event of week lesson be suspended moment paper arrived if have be good when be naughty mr elli put paper in pocket be greatest punishment must inflict upon only one ever made sulk must be good for hour in advance to earn right of having punch shown to moment came be certainly by mean of intelligent interpretation of that tutor managed to cultivate taste in many way give true idea of art importance of art at outset also of ethic be a careful of angelica physical a of mental education being strongly imbued by then new idea that woman must have full use of limb lung heart other organ muscle so that life might be pleasure to not continual exertion have strong objection to artificial waist impressed beauty of tenniel classical purity of figure upon child by teaching to appreciate contrast present to bulging vulgarity made manifest by keene showed also that while du maurier depicted with admirable artistic interpretation refined surroundings attenuated form of woman a be linley sambourne that master of lovely line pointed moral by drawing woman a must be there be nothing conventional about heavenly twin be therefore easy to make good impression upon in direction tutor soon have practical proof of success must have be eminently satisfactory if trifle embarrassing child be out on lawn in front of house one afternoon when lady arrived to call upon mother be struck by appearance a descended from carriage followed into drawing room to have good look at be one of heroic woman who have constancy to squeeze figure in beyond y shape be commonest deformity to of hourglass bulge out more above below line of compression there be good many other people in room whom heavenly twin saluted politely then sat down opposite to object of interest gazed at why be tied so tight in middle angelica asked at last in voice silenced everybody else in room doe hurt mean to have good figure when grow up like venus de medici know can show picture of if like have stitch on look awfully nice though said diavolo angelica think 'd be able to eat more with kind of figure yes angelica candidly confessed looking at victim compassionately must think now that can eat pudding meat can not to mention dessert diavolo ejaculated with genuine concern mr elli will get child out of room somehow lady adeline whispered to tutor who have come in for tea be true do think mr elli began loudly addressing hamilton well across room be true that dr galbraith be going to try horrible experiment in vivisection afternoon what be vivisection asked angelica diverted cutting up live animal to find out what make go said tutor in three minute there be vestige of heavenly twin about place chapter xx twin have code of ethic differed in respect from ordinarily accepted in state of life honoured mother must help a said apologetically father looked upon a fair game for amusement what be unearthly noise heard morning mr elli asked one day oh did wake sir diavolo exclaimed did mean to be only yowling papa out of bed with fiddle be idle sometimes wo get up be so bad for know wish must see scooting down corridor after angelica observed do know speaks just same at time of day in dressing gown a doe in evening in dress clothes 'd die if heard habit of twin be to read letter might find lying about be dishonourable to read other people letter mr elli admonished severely when became aware of peculiarity be for angelica answered defiantly might a well say dishonourable to squint have always done everybody know do warn not to leave letter lying about diavolo be because be greater fun to hunt for diavolo interpreted precisely when angelica gave reason usually cleared of obscurity in way how be to know what go on in family if read letter angelica demanded what necessity be there for to know necessity retorted not be interested in one own family affair why must wanting in intelligence be not that know must be wanting in affection too right feeling hope be not that mr elli quite need be afraid about own letter sha touch drawled diavolo of course must be very different thing be glad draw line somewhere mr elli observed sarcastically be far from satisfied however noticed eventually that dust collected on letter of own if left lying about soon discovered that when intelligent pupil gave word kept uncompromisingly be one of virtue other be loyalty to other devotion to mother hardly counted for virtue because never carried far enough to make sacrifice for sake must have sacrificed very life for other must have fought for right to die until there be very little left of of to execute of such peculiar quality be affection have gone straight to fountain tower by shortest cut across field afternoon when mr elli suggested vivisection a possible occupation for dr galbraith never doubted that must discover hard at work in underground cellar most likely to must be guided by cry of victim must be able to conquer reluctance to allow to assist at experiment by threat of exposure be considerably chagrined when having carefully concealed in thick shrubbery in order to reconnoitre house came upon in garden innocently occupied in idle pursuit of pruning rose tree be somewhat startled when suddenly saw hot red face set like two moon in clump of greenery peeping out at with animated eye hollo said be hungry face disappeared behind bush be angelica diavolo whispered anxiously of course be retorted thought be too angry disgusted disappointed something murmured apologetically evidently much relieved dr galbraith went on with pruning presently twin appeared walking down proper approach to garden hand in hand demurely after have saluted host politely stood stared at well said at last suppose be too late said angelica for what asked without pausing in occupation for viv viv vivinesectionining vivinesectionining what on earth oh light broke in upon who told be mr elli said angelica did tell be exactly diavolo explained with conscientious accuracy asked papa if be true that be going to afternoon what be doing dr galbraith asked astutely be in drawing room angelica answered trying to find out from lady why tied up so tight in middle so came off here to see yes said diavolo wanted to catch at little brute misbegotten by dr galbraith began diavolo interrupted sir exclaimed drawing up with expression of a much indignation a must be got into small patrician feature if instantly withdraw that calumny will have to fight on mother behalf will consider duty to inform her of insinuation be cause of offence apologize said dr galbraith taking off hat bowing low assure expression be used a mere faon de parler accept explanation sir said

for not at once recognizing use propriety of what come so easily naturally to so far be easy enough to understand surely further than that be impossible to go because be a yet incomplete creature in state of progression with fair play must continue on on other hand development may be entirely arrested be curious that priesthood while preaching perfection invariably do best to stop progress will never believe that change be for better until be accomplished there be denying so hinder forever when must be first to help encourage be bringing yourselves into disrepute by just try realize

longing to be free pursued made sign on such occasion only sat with lip severely placid felt knot climb in throat with foot unseen crushed wild passion out against floor beneath banquet where meat become a wormwood uttered not word yet there be nothing in colonel colquhoun manner nothing in treatment of in least objectionable what suffered from be simply contact with inferior moral body intellectual starvation inevitable in constant association with mind too willow to contain sort of mental sustenance for sharing pleasing fact that evadne be getting on very well together dawned on quite suddenly one day be who perceived that absence of friction be entirely due to restriction polite society imposes upon manner of gentleman lady in ordinary everyday intercourse when bond be not

discovered great gap whole of dangerous work of fiction have disappeared chapter xii colonel colquhoun have gradually fallen into habit of riding out walking alone with mr guthrie brimston continually of course people began to make much of intimacy to talk of way neglected poor young wife only part of arrangement be not agreeable to latter be having to entertain major guthrie brimston sometimes during lady absence lady when stayed to tea for there be really harm in flirtation a evadne be acute enough to perceive mr guthrie brimston be one of woman who pride upon having train of admirer be not above robbing other woman of companionship of husband in order to swell own following while many men rather affect society of lady because be not bit stiff know allow certain laxity of language be particularly piquant to masculine mind when complacent lady be relation be really right know mr guthrie brimston be really quite right know husband understood other perfectly while evadne on part be content to know colonel colquhoun be so innocently occupied for be beginning to think of a kind of big child of weak moral purpose for whose good behaviour must be held responsible be relief when mr guthrie brimston took off hand healthy minded human being like to dwell on misery be suffering have suffered be therefore comfort to know upon whole at period of life evadne be not at unhappy have friend pleasure occupation latter being multifarious climate of malta at time of year suited to perfection picturesque place with romantic history strange tradition be in unfailing source of interest delight to dear old mr beale have kept heart from hardening into bitterness just by loving giving good motherly hug now then when evadne be inclined to rail must say pity wicked people dear pity pity doe more good in world than blame however well deserved may soften sinner by pitying never by hard word once melt into mood of pity will be able to endure thing must otherwise drive mad mr malcomson helped too during first burst of unpopularity brought upon herself by daring to act upon own perception of right wrong in defiance of old established injustice of society when even most kindly disposed hung back suspiciously not knowing what dangerous sort of new creature might eventually prove to be at earliest mutter of storm mr malcomson came forward boldly to support evadne so also did mr sillinger mr st john be of evadne particular friend have injured health by excessive devotion to duty be sent to malta in hope that warm bright climate might strengthen chest be weak point restore

austin b price evadne owed kind large hearted chivalrous gentleman much gratitude repaid with much affection be really first to discover that there be anything remarkable about be to also owed considerable further development of originally feeble sense of humour mr price first impression that be uncommon character have be confirmed by one of rapid phrase of hers contained in few word embodiment of feeling familiar to multitude of people who have power to express delivered third time met happened to be at of afternoon dance held on board flag ship on occasion colonel colquhoun liked to show although did not dance in afternoon so be there sitting out mr price be courteously endeavouring to entertain surprise said a american to find so little inclination in free enlightened

disagreeable upon by action in matter of clarence old mr beale came to one day in kindliness to tell private opinion of friend who have stood by loyally in public be sure did with best motive dear be bravely done old lady said patting hand be advised by who know world have have more experience than have have interfere again interference doe good people will say such thing if do will make pay for disinterestedness seems to that question be not will have to pay be not bound to pay evadne rejoined neglecting to do what be to obviously right thing making endeavour such a be sure to be applauded working in hope of reward in fact seems to to be terribly old fashioned idea miserable remnant of bribery corruption of dark age when people be kept in such dense ignorance that must be treated like child told if be good must have for prize if be bad must be punished be quite right be sure dear rejoined mr beale same think must interfere again if be seems have not done clarence good evadne murmured one day to mr price well be hardly to be expected answered at raised eyebrow interrogatively calumny attach to name in moment take lifetime to remove because large majority of people prefer to think worst of other clarence will have to live down own little difficulty what have to consider now be not how little benefit have derived from brave defense of how many other people may have saved from similar attack fancy will be time before people will venture to spread scandal of kind here in malta again have taught lesson may be sure of so be disheartened lose sight of final result in consideration of immediate consequence hard part of teaching be that teacher seldom see anything of good have done be very evident at time that evadne view of life be becoming much too serious for own good perceiving mr price let fall word one day in course of conversation afterward treasured in heart to great advantage be duty to be happy said human being be entitled to certain amount of pleasure

escape made sign might have worried by implying reproach have moment of good feeling however kindly impulse too being a already asserted anything monster under influence of one of sat down wrote sharp remonstrance to mr frayling however only drew from that gentleman expression of sincere admiration for son in law generous disposition of regret that daughter of must behave so badly to one who must show so nobly forgiving with reiteration of determination however not to countenance until must come to sens so that actual good be done although doubtless colonel colquhoun be better for acting on impulse be about time that became aware of fact that evadne have gradually formed party of own be making house centre of attraction to best people in place knew that such support be evidence of strength must only confirm in view especially when even who have opposed most bitterly at first be caught intriguing to get into colquhoun house clique naturally be gratified by position reflected

during time that managed to identify completely with grandfather in estimation of people of morningquest charming manner be family trait heavenly twin have always be popular in city on own account spontaneity extreme affability having usually be held to balance monkey trick hamilton house however be ten mile distant from morningquest have hitherto be thought of a hamilton well after year at castle became identified with old stock alien hamilton well being dropped out of sight altogether duke have always be popular have like ancestor lived much in castle on hill overlooking city have dominated latter by personality a well a by place so that people predisposed by pressure of hereditary habit to recognize pre eminence of one of family being no longer subject to authority of duke a in old day when be ruler who must be obeyed looked up to involuntarily a example to be followed be how came to pas for last half century there have be two influence at work in morningquest that of chime full fraught with spiritual suggestion that of duke be just opposite be influence of good evil needle to say effect of latter be much more certain of two great change however came over duke

be like child in punch who when threatened with policeman at corner exclaimed in derision why be father besides time be changing rapidly influence remained to aristocracy be already only dominant so long a went way of popular feeling be human directly retrograded to past privilege idea superstition taste people laughed at knew that threatened rule of priest be far fetched anachronism need not fear for in aggregate therefore gave up with interest to observation of such evidence of effect on individual a duke must betray to from time to time theory be that having grown too old for worldly dissipation have entered church in search of new form of excitement to vary monotony generally a so many elderly coquette do when can no longer attract attention in other way people maintained be nature of such religious consolation a enjoyed upon supposition certain lapse of be accounted for uncharitably in truth duke be perfectly sincere have turned so late in life however that be apt by force of habit to get muddled difficulty be to disconnect past from present two having tendency to mix up in mind great interest of old age be building of roman catholic cathedral in morningquest

lecturing on sin of vanity promise that must sing in chorus dance in ballet if leg be good when must have be discoursing about danger of vain world pointing moral of happy humble obscurity on occasion lady fulda who be always beside suffered good deal must pull up in whisper sometimes made repeat until everyone in place have heard then at last when did understand must hasten to correct of course be

weigh worth must hardly say be fine day without first glancing at weather just to be sure that have not changed since decided to make remark have great loving heart if did not sigh for husband child be because be never in presence of creature for many minute without feeling flood of tenderness for suffuse whole being so that affection be always satisfied because of grand presence people expected great thing of none of ever went disappointed away filled heart nobody ever complains of head when heart be full love be secret of beauty power twin arrived late one day at morne immediately afterward whole castle be pervaded by presence sign of appeared in most unlikely place mysterious packet rolled up in sheet of time considerably soiled known a angelica work nobody have ever seen opened be found in oriel room on seat of chair sacred to duke cricket cap of diavolo be discovered on one of tall candle stood on altar in private chapel of castle a if have be used a extinguisher peculiar intentness be also observed in expression of child countenance be thought to betoken mischief because always hitherto have be noticed that when gravity of demeanour be most exemplary wickedness of design upon be engaged be sure to be extreme old symptom be misleading at time for twin settled down at once with lively intelligent interest to innocent occupation of studying way of household own conduct being distinguished for most part by masterly inactivity for truth be be thinking have lately taken to reading book paper magazine of day found in library at hamilton house at morne followed same occupation thus have opportunity of seeing question interested treated from different point of view at home have be liberal protestant progressive at tendency of everything be roman catholic conservative retrograde be doing best a conversation with different people at time showed to discover why wherefore right wrong of difference angelica be naturally first to draw definite conclusion for herself having made up own mind began to instruct diavolo be teaching to respect woman for one thing when did respect beat made thoughtful must strike if did know ca strike back because be girl remonstrated must say that if did know that cruellest thing can do to woman be to hurt feeling retorted oh feeling exclaimed diavolo have got castanets clack where must have feeling angelica raised hand then dropped by side again looked at what do mean by nonsense demanded always have fought everything out ever since be born yes said regretfully used to be a hard a nail when got good hit at made knuckle tingle now be getting boggy everywhere just look at arm angelica ripped tight sleeve open to shoulder with one of sudden jerk looked at arm now see mine said diavolo taking off coat turning shirt sleeve up in more deliberate way angelica held out arm beside to compare hers be round white firm with little blue vein visible beneath fine transparent skin be hard muscle bone burnt brown with sun coarse of texture compared with hers see now said angelica slowly drew down tattered remains of sleeve then looked at diavolo thoughtfully from to full length reflection of herself in long mirror

loveth chasteneth betimes 'withhold not correction from child for if thou beatest with rod will not die ' be only boy see have mind enlarged in way because if tell girl thing understands at once when men grow up thing go wrong still think ought to thrash other be also primitive way of settling dispute of nation just hack other down in hundred sacrificing life be precious to woman must be loving for sake of idea be always changing certainly be stupid part of humanity concluded how ever discovered way to manage other ca imagine be right one ' whip for horse bridle for as rod for fool back ' so saying flounced out of room without however administering parting slap of kind expected episode made lasting impression on diavolo a be apparent in much that said particularly in remark made during conversation have with grandfather toward end of year capital understanding have always existed between diavolo grandfather fact caused lady adeline heart to sink time observed have opposite effect on duke quite exhilarating effect indeed be cause of certain of lapse lady fulda have so often to deplore a when for instance aided abetted diavolo in of worst trick then have to sit sheepishly by saying nothing when boy be found out corrected lady fulda be puzzled by intelligent glance passed between two at such time diavolo be perfectly loyal never once got grandfather into trouble one of dream of old duke life be to make good catholic of diavolo to end conversation be often directed intermittently be true because diavolo be skilled in art of beguiling into other subject when suited duke be turning attention at time under lady fulda direction to spiritual welfare of class of woman in former time have be accustomed to countenance in quite way lady fulda have established refuge for in morningquest father be deeply interested in success of undertaking heavenly twin be also much interested at first must not make out why aunt fulda so often breakfasted in outdoor dress whether have

be usually half over duke sat at end of long table with twin on side of be generally limp querulous in morning more kindly disposed toward father ricardo than to own flesh blood a angelica pointed out on one occasion when lady fulda came in always went up to father kissed did not rise to receive salute invariably held hand second asked news anxiously to always answered yes then must say must tell afterward go to seat now take plenty of rest refreshment be necessary be necessary heavenly twin be inclined to regard scene with scorn contempt of ignorance at first when lord dawne came to castle for few day with widowed aunt lady claudia ideala paid same reverent attention to lady fulda report a duke father ricardo did reserved judgment until must know more about matter asked mr elli for explanation told bluntly to mind own business further puzzled by remark chanced to hear make about lady fulda to dr galbraith did not overhear what dr galbraith have said to lead up to mr elli

have just completed lovely solo be unexpectedly following up by audacious pa seul be ancestor like diavolo whispered to angelica enthusiastically angelica dampened ardent admiration of coup by refusing to believe that diminutive duke have done on purpose chapter iii next day diavolo happened to stroll into oriel room about tea time finding grandfather sitting there alone looking down upon morningquest from accustomed seat in great deep window be open carefully chose soft cushion placing on low sill so that must rest back against stretching out on floor looked up at old gentleman

change for worse be out of health out of temper depressed have spent most of leave at monte carlo did not say so at first be waiting for to question have done so must have said something snappy about feminine curiosity a did not do so lost temper went off to mess drank too much be terrible thing for man to be brought into constant association with woman who never doe anything in small way that can carp at say word can contradict robs of most cherished illusion shake confidence in own infallible strength discernment knowledge judgment superiority generally outrage prejudice on subject of what woman ought to be leaf nothing with to compare to own advantage be miserable state to evadne be rapidly reducing poor colonel colquhoun not certainly of malice prepense with best intention did not like opinion therefore ceased to express opinion in presence took exception to many of observation so let word think fall out of vocabulary confined talk to clear narrative of occurrence uninterrupted by comment be art have to acquire for have natural aptitude for faculty of observation having hitherto served a instrument with must extract lesson from life lens used for purpose of collecting data on exact scientific principle a matter from to draw conclusion with practice became adept in art of describing one while at same time withholding other so that conversation interested colonel colquhoun without however giving anything to cavil at be like dish exactly suited to taste delicate to insipidity because palate be hardened to pepper when returned from switzerland gave detail of own doings be interesting enough to take out of until one day when unfortunately occurred to that be making effort to entertain determined that must not be entertained like child indeed might be deuced clever woman be going to have feminine air of superiority so snubbed into silence having succeeded became exceedingly annoyed because must not talk be opposition wanted not acquiescence be not clever enough with cleverness straightforward nineteenth century young woman to understand such subtlety have always heard that contrariness of woman be cause of provocation must never have be made to comprehend that removal of cause must be even more provoking than contrariness great endeavour of life have be to cultivate acquire quality in understood that woman be wanting when succeeded expected to please found colonel colquhoun a peculiar on subject a father have be when proved that although of imbecile sex must do arithmetic colonel colquhoun waited week to snap at for asking how have spent leave be obliged at last to give up hope of being questioned then felt aggrieved certainly took interest in reflected did care rap if went to dog altogether in fact must probably be rather glad because then must be free must waste world of attention care upon dirty little child picked up in street for have thought sympathy clearly wanted to get rid of must get rid of felt be going to bad must go to bad be fault must know have treated with possible consideration have never have slightest cause for complaint have even stuck up for against own interest with old as of father by jove while be treating colonel colquhoun commanding crack corp one of smartest officer in majesty service with studied indifference be thinking affectionately of same dear old pompous portly papa to whom in fact have never borne slightest ill will colonel colquhoun be sure although have done injury of allowing to marry to kind of man whom be against principle even to countenance at point irritation overflowed must contain no longer do know where spent most of leave asked one morning at breakfast evadne answered innocently at monte carlo said with emphasis hope enjoyed have always heard be very beautiful

cheerfully suppose can lose great deal there can lose posse well yes of course must if liked be quite sure must never do anything so stupid looked at curiously disapprove of gambling then asked oh of course disapprove then see have taste for be apologetically said to signify that did not in least mean to sit in judgment upon have fine taste for driving people to such extremity then asserted looked at inquiringly what mean be explained that if must have be with must not have gone to monte carlo evadne kept countenance with difficulty for just a colonel colquhoun spoke recollected conversation have have at breakfast one morning under precisely similar circumstance be to say in accustomed place temper placidly content politely striving to bottle up chronic form of irritation from suffered at time of day so a to keep nice hot for benefit of officer men for colonel colquhoun in presence of lady be one person colonel colquhoun in own orderly room on parade be quite while in barrack be in habit of swearing with same ease a unaffectedly a made response in church probably did from sense of duty because have be brought up in school of colonel in course of year must naturally come to consider that volley of oath on parade although not laid down in drill book be a much part of profession of arm a good lord deliver be of church service at event did punctually at right time place never mixed week day oath with sunday response be creditable in fact seemed to have power of changing frame of mind completely for different occasion must be prepared in advance a be evident from fact that if glove went wrong just a be starting for church must send up for pair amiably if similar accident happened when be on way to parade must swear at man till surprised man not being soldier servant what very nearly made evadne smile be distinct recollection have of having asked earnestly to join party in switzerland when went on leave of answering must not care about suggesting that must meet at monaco instead fancied must have bad memory of course said nothing what be use of saying anything thought however that have be under order invitation to go to monaco must have be command present implied reproach direct accusation be most anxious that must understand perfectly that quite shrank from interfering with in way one night not knowing if be at home not have occasion to go downstairs for book have forgotten there be noise in house consequently when opened drawing room door be startled to find that room be brilliantly lighted that there be party assembled there consisting of three strange lady loud in appearance one two men knew have not seen before majority be seated at card table playing while rest stood round looking on must have reached momentous point in game for evadne have not heard sound to warn of presence before saw colonel colquhoun be one of looking on at game one of first to see changed countenance came forward hastily conscious of strange contrast presented to woman flushed with wine horrid excitement gambling at table a stood there rooted to spot with surprise in gold embroidered ivory white drapery with half inquiring half bewildered look on sweet grave face be vision of holiness breaking in upon scene of sin one thought be to get away there be always that saving grace of fallen angel about never depreciated what have lost sometimes sighed for sorrowfully beg pardon for intrusion evadne said looking at pointedly so a to ignore rest of party did not even know that be at home have forgotten book came for will kindly give to be called hesitated doe not matter added quickly will read something else good night turned smiling without seeming to have seen anyone colonel colquhoun calmly swept from room st monica complacent must say one of men suggested vengeance smiling with murder in mind said saint for certain jeered one of woman why not say angel at once cried must have thought colquhoun must keep upon premise laughed third lady be pleased to criticise be wife gentleman said colonel colquhoun lashing out at suddenly face blazing with rage woman tried not to be abashed men apologised game be over for night party broke up abruptly when have gone colonel colquhoun looked about for evadne book found not difficult matter for have bad habit of leaving book be reading open face downward on piece of furniture not intended to hold book by preference chair where somebody might sit down upon one happened to be upon piano stool colonel colquhoun glanced at title a picked up reading vision of sin understood why have shrunk from naming appreciated delicacy feared discernment have shown necessity for determined to disarm resentment next day by making proper apology at once went down late to breakfast expecting black look at least be surprised to find calm equable a usual busy keeping breakfast hot for wish to apologise to for scene witnessed last night began ceremoniously think owe apology for taking unawares like interrupted cheerfully giving best attention to very full cup of coffee be carefully carrying round table to hope understand be accident quite understood answered sullenly want to explain that people be also here by accident at least be not altogether responsible for presence be party from one of yacht in harbour met here at door just a be coming in last night forced in uninvited hope believe must not willingly bring anyone to house whom must not introduce to oh quite believe answered cordially be always most kind most considerate fear added with concern that being here must inconvenience at time pray pray let be case must regret infinitely if did when evadne left colonel colquhoun threw into chair sat chin on chest hand in pocket leg stretched out before giving way to fit of deep disgust have always have poor opinion of woman now began to despair of altogether come of letting have own way educating reflected first thing do when begin to know anything be to turn round upon say be good enough by jove if be be fault be business to keep right when fellow have too good time in youth suffered for be to become of if ca find innocent girl to believe in marry there soon wo be innocent girl here be now most utter bad lot evadne know what doe do apologizes for appearing at inopportune time now beston wife must have brought house about ear if 'd caught with precious party have here last night be what woman ought to do ought to care ought to be jealous cry eye out ought to go down on knee take trouble to save fellow soul may be mentioned by way that if evadne have done so colonel colquhoun must certainly have sworn at for meddling with thing 'd business to know anything about be however not what must what must have done that be considering just then be proper thing to do concluded see what be to be gained by cursed cold blooded indifference articulation ceased here because startling theory that vicious dissipated man be not fallen angel easily picked up frightful source of crime disease recurred to with charitable suggestion that repentant woman of own class must be proper person to reform idea settled upon soul silenced being full fraught for with cruel certainty that end of true womanliness be at hand chapter xiii colonel colquhoun first interest in evadne lasted longer than might have be expected pleasure of hanging about palled on at last then fell off in kind attention did not happen however a soon a must have done by many month have relation be other than be began in usual way little act to have become accustomed be omitted resumed again once more omitted intermittently then finally allowed to drop altogether when change have set in for certain evadne regretted kindly feeling for other have come to exist between be largely due to appreciation of numberless little attention have pleased to pay at first have not palled upon missed not a wife must have done however that knew so that when fact that there be to be falling off became apparent found in yet cause for self congratulation one be great enough to remove sting from regret what be prepared to resent however be renewal of gush after have once ceased required to be held in higher estimation than toy must be dropped taken up again upon occasion colonel colquhoun gave opportunity what be worse provoked into saying so to intense mortification when came to reflect there be to be ball at palace one night grand affair given in honour of same fat foreign prince who have stayed with people at fraylingay just before came out have be struck by promise of appearance in early day of acquaintance colonel colquhoun have given very beautiful antique ornament of egyptian design determined to wear on occasion for first time when came to try with modern ball dress found that made latter look detestably vulgar therefore determined to design costume to adapt one must be more in keeping with artistic beauty of jewel idea with help of excellent maid managed to carry out to perfection by way be accident led finally to adopt distinctive style of dress always dangerous experiment in case fortunately so admirably successful that be never remarked upon a strange by people of taste only a appropriate colonel colquhoun dined at mess on night of ball did not trouble to come back to escort said must meet at palace if missed in crowd there be sure to be plenty of other men only too glad to offer arm have be most particular never to allow to go anywhere alone at first rather inconveniently so sometimes that have endured be reflecting upon change a sat at solitary dinner that evening concluded by cheerfully assuring that really be beginning to feel quite a if be married afterward when found in drawing room seemed big bare more so for being brilliantly lighted suddenly felt very little body alone there be bitterness in feeling however because there be one neglecting whose duty be to keep heart up threatened to grow upon same in order to

that be inclined to be effusive returned to lunch hung about whole afternoon much to inconvenience because have not be included in arrangement for month now must not easily alter at once just to humour whim of wherefore whim very little reflection explained look tone word of partner of previous night not heeded at time recurred to now made thoughtful must not feel flattered for be obviously

altogether air of man just recovering from serious illness that be gentleman one must have doubted for moment must have be surprised to hear that be great man in sense of being peer something of kind for there be that indefinable something in look bearing people call aristocratic manner be calm assured like of well bred man of world accustomed to good society people who flocked to afternoon service day regarded with much curiosity be certainly unlike anyone whom have hitherto seen in choir surplice have be found for dead white contrasted well with brightness of hair made refined beauty of face even more remarkable than have be in morning dress sitting with lay clerk behind chorister looked like representative of higher race even of whose personal attraction have hitherto be considered more than merely passable when appeared beside be suddenly seen to be hopelessly commonplace although interest excited be evident enough be equally evident that remained quite unaware of in whole bearing there be not slightest assumption entered with choir might have be in habit of doing so life so perfectly unconscious did seem of anything new strange in position a soon a be seated without even glancing at people have taken up music continued lost in study of until service opened then sang part with ease precision however attracted le attention at moment than appearance rest of

delicious spell have be cast upon congregation held bound until last note of exquisite voice even last reverberation of organ accompaniment have trembled into silence then there be movement flutter great sigh of relief heaved so to speak a if pleasure have be too great nerve sens be glad to be released from tension of tenor be slightly flushed when resumed seat otherwise face be a serenely impassive a ever be great singer from abroad people whispered to other be used to kind of success doe not even trouble to see if be pleased have sung doubtless to gratify whim of own such artist be capricious folk to answer be long may such whim continue after service dean hastened to thank stranger shook hand with emotion congratulated upon marvellous gift may ask if be professional singer old gentleman said not yet be answer wish to offer for vacant post of tenor in choir if be satisfied with attainment dean stared at oh ah stammered in surprise then added something apologetically about reference being obliged to ask few question if have time to spare think can satisfy now stranger answered dean perceiving that wished to speak to alone bowed courteously requested applicant to accompany to deanery precentor who have assisted at interview up to point now watched depart a did so pursed up lip significantly stranger have sunk in estimation from possible rank of russian prince to of simple singer considerable drop precentor be musician asserted that voice be of finest quality trained to perfection wanted to know however what must bring man with fortune like in throat to bury alive in morningquest ventured to predict that must be something fishy stranger have long private interview with dean what transpired thereat be never made public be known however that when left deanery dean accompanied to door there shook hand with cordially be immediately afterward announced that mr jones be to be new tenor mr jones indeed said morningquest sarcastically a much jones a bishop precentor be sure that dean have be taken in by clever impostor must not have be case asserted if matter have be referred to a ought to have be morningquest declared that there be imposition about voice a to antecedent why be absurd to be too particular when everything else be so entirely satisfactory there happened to be tiny tenement in close vacant when new lay clerk began duty a tenor in choir took be detached house one of row faced apse on south side of cathedral one step led down from road into little front garden from into house be thus two step below road in front be level with garden at back passage ran right through house garden door being front door kitchen be behind little sitting room on right a entered on left be two other room when tenor took house one looking into back garden other into front two room immediately turned into one by having dividing wall removed together made long low comfortably proportioned apartment with french window at end tenor spent spare time when first arrived in decorating room making work for a people said indeed be just what seemed to be doing for worked a man doe who feel that ought to be occupied take pleasure find relief in occupation frescoed wall ceiling of room with admirable taste skill making look twice size by cunning division of pattern on wall by well devised proportion of dado cornice dean often went to watch at work sat on packing case only article room contained at time by hour together talking to circumstance taken with fact that other gentleman in neighbourhood also called upon lingered long on premise greatly exercised inquisitive mind of multitude especially when be perceived that tenor instead of being elated by condescension accepted a matter of course continued always same sad preoccupied impassive seldom smiling never surprised taking healthy interest in anything when painting be finished furniture began to arrive be surprise for close where house be not adorned with design of one period be filled with heterogeneous collection of article generally aged remarkably uncouth everything in tenor long low room on contrary even down to shape of brass coal scuttle including case of grand piano be in harmony with colour design of fresco on wall ceiling floor be polished being adorned here there with rug suggested dim reflection of tint tone above be luxurious apartment not effeminate luxury be masculine luxury refined significant there be meaningless feminine frippery about be there evidence of sensuous self indulgence be abode of cultivated man of one who be essentially manly withal fame of apartment having be noised abroad precentor came one day to inspect there be need to describe precentor one know exactly what man must be who call thing fishy be ordained clergyman not at benevolent be christian for did not love neighbour a visit on occasion be anything friendly in intention be determined to know something more about tenor said meant to question theory be that tenor have be public singer have disgraced be unable to appear again in consequence on supposition intended to proceed found tenor with hat in hand on point of leaving house precentor be not delicate about detaining walked into sitting room without waiting to be asked pried impertinently into everything then sat down tenor meantime have remained standing with hat in hand patiently waiting still stood precentor did not take hint be opera singer think said remarked a soon a be seated tenor looked at inquiringly be concert suggested trifle disconcerted tenor looked gravely amused be not music hall of course precentor persuasively insinuated well hardly said tenor fixing steady eye upon man in way made wince have business to attend to in town added pray make at home so long a plea to remain with brushed hand back over glossy hair put on hat sauntered out leaving gentle guest to ruminate interest tenor have begun by exciting in breast of quiet inhabitant of morningquest did not diminish at once a might have be expected be only lay clerk to be sure then be so utterly unlike other lay clerk be always so carefully dressed for one thing maintained so successfully that suggestion of good breeding have be first impression of be altogether so distinguished in appearance that be pleasure to hear stranger exclaim who be to be able to surprise with off hand rejoinder oh be only tenor then be stranger from nobody knew where went by name of jones be not believed to be have magnificent voice remained in morningquest in obscure position making nothing of true must have mean what after be mean appeared to posse compared with mean might be enjoying further be considered most extraordinary circumstance of there be attitude in cathedral followed service devoutly such thing a attention let alone devotion on part of lay clerk have never be heard of in morningquest there be not even remote tradition in existence to prepare anybody mind for contingency so that altogether man be mystery mystery however toward kindly people be well disposed wonder for tenor manner be a attractive a appearance way be not at mysterious when considered apart from point already indicated on contrary simple in extreme way of one who be kindly courteous considerate on occasion paying proper respect to man also rigorously exacting from respect be due to must always see people who called upon though be believed that must rather not have be disturbed be too much of gentleman to show in fact be agreed that be gentleman before everything not at like jones therefore acting on instinctive perception of fitness of thing citizen dropped offensive appellation altogether called tenor simply a might have called duke there be at first good deal of wonder a to where money came from with furnished little house in close how did manage to buy so many book picture how must afford to give so much away in charity for be known beyond doubt that have on more than one occasion relieved family of other singer have relieved too in most substantial way be evident that have mean if have mean why did sing in choir question be alpha omega of ail concerned be asked everywhere by everybody one must answer save dean who be not to be approached upon subject finally however people grew tired of forming conjecture be denied affirmed becoming accustomed to tenor presence amongst ceased a regular thing to discus affair be not case until story have be circulated about be generally believed although nobody knew from whence emanated be according to story illegitimate son of actress great in sense of having title man from whom inherited aristocratic appearance small income mother be said have be opera singer accounted for voice shame declared on discovery of birth have driven into present retirement caused to renounce world a story accounted in most satisfactory manner for be strange about be regarded in respect a authentic after wickedness of titled men frailty of acting woman have be freely commented upon with much sage shaking of head a if only titled men be wicked acting woman frail morningquest be saintly city innocent of deed not strictly in accordance with word matter be allowed to drop tenor be left to gang ain gait must have done in case probably continued to do in quiet earnest regular way that won friendly feeling from most men more than share of sympathy attention from good woman who have not self love enough to be wounded by indifference unsophisticated little maiden just budding into womanhood must peep after shyly from old fashioned house sometimes must feel in tender little heart gentle pity for one who be so handsome so unfortunate like true hero of romance be believed by to be supremely unhappy asked be to be allowed to comfort noticed none of so little maiden blushed at first for having thought of at then forgot for somebody else if somebody else did not come quickly began to regard tenor with totally different feeling almost a if have wronged in way tenor continued to gang ain gait be alike indifferent to pity spite little house like most of in close have old walled garden behind large garden for size of house so sheltered that many thing grew there must not grow elsewhere in open house be picturesque on side having bright south aspect favourable to growth of creeper with be thickly covered jasmine clematis honeysuckle rose succeeding other in regular order garden be always full of flower be here that tenor spent much of time hard at work have evidently passion for flower be most successful gardener conservatory orchid house have have built soon after arrival being always lovely even in winter building of two house be considered extravagance have caused close to point finger at for while when someone declared that unfortunate tenor have probably inherited much of mother recklessness be not therefore responsible a other people be suggestion be considered reasonable enough from time forward tenor expensive taste be held to be separate matter for commiseration truth being that morningquest must not bear to be on bad term with tenor must have found excuse for have outraged best preserved prejudice ever held be only necessary to glance at tenor book to perceive that be student many valuable work in many language be scattered about house be well known fact that spent much of leisure in poring over to what end study might be directed one of course must tell be assumed that have acquired respectable amount of knowledge from fact that dean learned man delighted not little in conversation when fact have be fully ascertained by careful observation smouldering curiosity blazed up afresh surmise be once more busy with tenor name did write for magazine wondered seemed likely enough for be notorious in morningquest that people who did that kind of thing be not like rest of world soon came to pas certain article relating to various thing such a drainage deep sea fishery coinage of greece competitive examination in china essay on other subject likely to interest artistic man be confidently assumed to be shy little girl in old fashioned house who never looked at anything in magazine picture poetry be wont to credit with certain passionate lay from got quite new idea of eye dy sigh other striking rhyme to musical metre made little heart throb pleasurably nothing more definite be known of tenor labour than be known of anything else concerning fortunately for there be that in bearing preserved from being personally annoyed by impertinent curiosity so that be most probably pretty nearly only person in city who have idea of interest excited two year have glided by in great apparent tranquillity since day tenor entered choir two year during have trodden path of life so uprightly so purely that not even suspicion of wrong doing be ever breathed against by gentle simple good bad be calm passionless existence that led life of ascetic of cultivated ascetic devoted to highest intellectual pursuit actuated by belief that value consisted not in market price in amount of attention called fame might attract to in pleasure gave in good did many weary man whose life have be wasted in toil of bringing before world when have reached summit of ambition might well have envied tenor placid countenance untroubled lot might even have perceived that there be more of poetry than of commonplace in quiet life glided on so evenly soothed by cathedral service cheered by chime guarded by shadow of gray protecting wall tenor cheek have be haggard worn when first settled in morningquest dark circle round eye have betokened sleepless night ceaseless gnawing ache of great grief have passed a day wore on giving place to settled expression of peace peace tinged with certain sadness dignified by resignation gradually too although remained slender ceased to be emaciated cheek assumed healthy hue very well became chapter ii be thought at first that dean intimacy with new tenor arose from sense of duty sharpened by feeling of self reproach with have regarded fancied neglect of old one however that might have be be continued from genuine liking for man one in morningquest knew tenor half so well a dean did one must have have truer regard for watched passing of trouble with more affectionate interest noted change for better have be wrought by regular occupation of peaceful day with greater satisfaction dean knew tenor story so that relation might be called confidential for two year allusion have be made by of to past neither have plan be formed for future at end of time however dean noticed sign of awakening energy in friend tenor performed duty le mechanically apathy be broken by fit of restlessness have found morning long lately have thought afternoon objectless when evening came lamp be lighted wearied of book music chafed little for something not change exactly be conscious of desire only felt at time desire for trifling human interest must make life be leading fuller have awakened in fact from long lethargy found alone dean of morningquest be remarkable man have fine physique high breeding scholarly reputation common to order of divine who keep up dignity of church without doing much for christianity in person be tall stooped from shoulder have white hair fine intellectual face fresh with young look in have be called saint like be only seen on face of in whom passion have not died natural death a vital power decay have be brought into subjection made to do good work instead of evil man consorted more habitually with equal seldomer entertained notion that there be such people in world a inferior practised religion to last letter of church law worshipped christ son of god there be doubt that must have turned exclusive back on christ carpenter son have prosecuted for impostor have presented with better pedigree must tell story of saviour suffering with infinite pathos because knew who saviour be must not have told same story with same power have hero of be merely one common man sacrificing life for others affected dean be enormous condescension be greatness of man not greatness of deed appealed to poor tradesman might sacrifice life nobly also then what be life of tradesman comparatively speaking people called dean proud worldly wise be not true of may have believed that people of palestine belonged to county family be therefore called chosen people never said so certain gentle humility of demeanour always distinguished matter to whom spoke be without doubt thoroughly good nineteenth century churchman living at own level of course true to caste toward weakness of exercised much charity forbearance while expressed condemnation of sin by rigorously excluding from family circle member of who have be openly convicted of disgraceful conduct just a excluded professional men other common citizen when held official position be obliged to recognize be not connected with landed gentry be characteristic of position for a dean be required to be slave of precedent a man however be known to be just generous excellent good friend to who have claim upon from bishop who governed down to humblest chorister in cathedral governed be in early spring when dean first noticed what took to be change for better in tenor attitude toward life at large dean be susceptible to kindly change in season so much so indeed contrary to precedent allowed to be tempted out after dark one night into close by balmy mildness of weather mind have be running day upon tenor noticing a passed little house that blind be up sitting room window wide open showing lamplit interior object of thought pacing restlessly to fro determined to go in have chat tenor received cordially manner be somewhat absent for wonder conversation flagged be well dean asked at last look somewhat fatigued think pale yes be well thank tenor answered brushing hand back over forehead hair gesture be habitual fancy added smiling that be beginning to be little did not know what ah said dean looking at with grave critical air of anxious physician ruminating before pronounced diagnosis have shown most extraordinary perseverance in course of life marked out for finally observed trust resolution be well recompensed by having obtained for peace of mind sought there be one thing must like to be permitted to point out to venture to advise because in first place be always difficult matter to decide on must be best for man welfare in second dean always spoke with great deliberation man who have proved so capable of acting with prudence determination so competent to judge so firm in carrying out conviction a have be might well consider advice from anyone presumptuous therefore be merely going to observe lately have seemed to to be pity that life must continue much longer to be life of inaction hope indeed think that year have spent so well in quiet way have be even more beneficial than imagine that have not only reconciled to life have given back confidence energy must belong to character ability ambition to succeed in world must belong to age for time past have seemed to that be more restless than used to be have fancied indeed may say have hoped that be at last beginning to long for change tenor sat silent thoughtful for while no began at last even yet long for change a must understand longing have begun to feel want though scarcely know of what of companionship perhaps of new interest have inclination for change must take away from here after storm passed through place have be for perfect haven of rest now that peace of mind have returned to do think must be wise by voluntary act to alter present course of life seeing that be so well with a be when man be content doe not seem to that change can be for better trifle apart really be content god grant may last dean responded earnestly only must warn to be ready for change in case come to in spite of must warn not to feel too secure for have noticed for mysterious reason mortal can fathom appears to be will of heaven when man be able to say sincerely be happy when be most confident believing happiness to be a firmly placed a earthly happiness can be then be time for to be most watchful for then be change most likely to be at hand indeed have seemed to that feeling of security rather of content with thing a be be in indication of coming change a finished speaking cathedral clock above began to strike hour slowly mellow note followed other filling night with sound dying away in long reverberation when twelfth have struck then came silence then chime voicelike clear resonant illustration musical notation lyric watch ing o ver be ra el slumber not sleep after be so still that tenor looking up through open window at moonlit cathedral towering above gray shadowy mysterious felt a if world have stopped life in have be resolved into moment of intense self consciousness of illimitable passionate yearning for something not to be expressed next day be saturday in afternoon tenor have to sing chapter iii there be human nature literally figuratively speaking in wagner method of setting character to tune of own for although life can hardly be said to order to one consistent measure day often do for month now when orb of day departs schubert song have accompanied

that saturday morning however when awoke mind be set to measure schubert song have gone a have come without conscious effort on part have left substitute for tenor a lingered over morning work found continually murmuring whole phrase of chant have heard once upon time when be staying in old town in france be litany of blessed virgin sung at benediction by unseen singer with wonderfully sympathetic mezzo soprano voice tenor have gone again again to hear in chant music of suited a well a did theme word of adoration sanctum maria sanctum dei genetrix sanctum virgo virginum be uttered evenly on note that admitted of tenderest expression while supplication os pro nobis rose to full compass of singer voice be delivered in tone of passionate entreaty at end in agnus dei music changed dropping into minor with impressive effect effect of earnestness wearied by effort still unshaken be final appeal in pathetic beauty now recurred to tenor have not thought of chant for year have there be anything apparently to recall now day possessed at interval caught involuntarily singing aloud agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi parce nobis domine agnus dei qui tollis peccata mimdi exaudi no

saturday there be good attendance even at early service stranger from distance came in to see cathedral people in place came in to see stranger so that there be plenty to observe especially for one who unlike tenor be little behind scene have peeped beneath surface beheld various incident of life drama be constantly being enacted in sacred edifice from service to service in midst with help of psalm hymn spiritual song prayer sermon under dean very nose often in presence of bishop world at worship be worldly sight there be certain appropriateness in tenor miserere failed to apply although kept company to end be still faithful when sallied forth from gloom of cathedral went on way with rest in sunshine freshness of glad new day a time for afternoon service approached people began again to flock to cathedral in crowd now for have be rumoured that tenor be to sing choir from lateral position on side of aisle be able to look up down church having on one hand opposite distinguished visitor who be accommodated with seat in stall canon dean pew on other officiating clergy congregation generally be advantageous position for who came to observe tenor have not hitherto be one of music when be interesting absorbed when be dull monotony soothed so that noticed nothing have done so afternoon during first part of service saw heard did work mechanically like one in dream in pause of old chant recurred to filling heart with separate undercurrent of solemn supplication now in french agneau de dieu qui effacez le pchs du monde ayez piti de nous now in latin agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis dean preached sermonette on saturday afternoon took precaution to deliver before anthem so that people might still have something to look forward to keep seat sermonette

murmur on agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi parce nobis domine while rapt silence fell upon congregation not ribbon rustled expression of expectation be most intense one must scarcely have expected tenor to take up note at right moment mind being preoccupied by strain did lady in canon pew held music of anthem before have be following that when first clear note of tenor voice rang through building looked up a if in surprise eye met with shock tenor awoke from lethargy faltered for moment then stopped organ played on however quickly recovered pause have be quite perceptible people be amazed be first time that thing have happened with tenor made matter of moment wonder of grew party being formed one to excuse slip call nothing other to blame for carelessness a people who never disappoint be blamed with bitterness if for once by chance err night tenor restlessness grew to head be engaged upon piece of work wished to finish must not settle to after making ineffectual effort to concentrate attention upon took up hat strolled out be lovely moonlight night line of tree in close be in flower sweetness be overpowering did not stay there however wandered out into city with hat

coelis deus miserere nobis fili redemptor mundi deus miserere nobis spiritus sancte deus miserere nobis sancte trinitas unus deus miserere nobis tenor sang softly to a slowly pursued way have sort of vague idea that must like to go look at quaint old market place by moonlight when reached stopped at corner interrupting song to gaze in artistic appreciation at silent scene before at heavy mass of shade interspersed with interval of mellow moonlight angle of roof spire ornament cut clean a cameo against dark radiant clarity of beautiful night sky market place be irregular square picturesquely enclosed by tall house of different height most original construction among east end of church part of public building of ancient date be crowded in without incongruous effect however moonlight crisp cool clear having melted hue form of alike into one harmonious whole to charm of even covered stall used in day dealing now packed in middle of square deserted footways added something tall slender lad of sixteen seventeen be standing on edge of pathway just in front of tenor be only other person about on account tenor have looked at second time a did so young woman came suddenly round corner accosted boy qu'il est beau exclaimed laying hand on arm smiling up into face admiringly boy stepped back to avoid with unmistakable gesture of disgust in doing so accidentally stumbled up against tenor turned round apologised confusedly tenor raised hat answered courteously be standing together side by side now remained so for second silently surveying scene then tenor unconsciously began again to sing sanctum maria entreated sanctum dei genetrix sanctum virgo virginum os pro nobis girl have be wandering off again at first note of supplication stopped chord of memory stirred knew word knew tune have sung often often at home in france be child of mary then now a tenor finished last note of phrase paused clasped hand convulsively gasped o mon dieu mon dieu ayez piti de moi half inarticulate cry did not reach tenor boy have observed distress for just at moment city clock struck one have raised head involuntarily in expectation of chime presently out upon night rolled great wave of sound swelling spreading muffled by distance somewhat still distinctly sweet insistent illustration musical notation lyric watch ing o ver be ra el slumber not sleep do believe said boy glancing toward girl repeating gesture of disgust with have shrunk from when accosted tenor lifted hat brushed hand back over hair do believe in spite of that must say answered considering girl with quiet eye yes believe declared in spite of have puzzled older head than yours with turned to retrace step taking up litany of blessed virgin once more a went supplication agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis being audible long after be out of sight boy remained a have left for time apparently lost in thought girl still stood little way off in dejected attitude hand clasped before eye fixed on ground looked ill spiritless boy glancing at carelessly wondered at intent expression of face did not perceive that be praying be midnight stillness deepened about two there be not living creature to be seen irregular old building on side looked ruinous in shadowy moonlight whole market place presented to boy picture of desolation chilled be about to turn away with last cursory glance at other solitary figure when something suddenly occurred arrested attention seemed to startle too for sprang back with prompt agility into dark doorway behind from whence watched what followed with keenest interest being careful however to conceal while have not felt movement of pity kindly compassion for girl perfect indifference have succeeded first sensation of repugnance must have left there to fate might await must have expected right minded people to do same be therefore with unmitigated astonishment that beheld scene be now being enacted before be no longer alone tall graceful lady of most dignified bearing with countenance of peculiar serenity sweetness have approached from opposite direction be standing beside girl speaking to evidently boy be too far off to hear what be said must see however that girl whole attitude have changed be no longer dejected eager gazed in lady face a listened to word with expression of admiration wonder one have almost said of adoration upon own a though be heavenly visitant who have hailed lady a spoke pointed to street opposite girl cast quick glance in direction seemed to be measuring distance be impatient to traverse moved step forward at same time uttering short sentence with rapid gesticulation pantomime be perfectly intelligible to boy who understood that be feverishly anxious to carry out intention on instant lady seemed to hesitate then laying beautiful white ungloved hand on girl shoulder looking into face spoke again earnestly girl answered with passionate protestation then lady smiled satisfied apparently led way in direction to have pointed girl following in haste hat have fallen back hair be loosened countenance beamed with enthusiasm a boy observed be stealing softly after skipping from shadow to shadow in great enjoyment of whole adventure lady took girl to long low rambling house beside church at door of knocked be opened immediately by singularly venerable looking old man evidently priest with fine

fright finally bolted leaving tenor alone in road that young rascal be out without leave be afraid of being recognized concluded be week before met again during interval tenor often thought of boy with curiosity interest there be something unusual in manner appearance must have attracted attention even if conversation have not be significant that be significant tenor discovered by continual recurrence to mind of one other of boy observation have not tried to find out who boy be interest not having stirred characteristic apathy in such matter to extent looked for continually by day night

on way out however so that did not notice distance on way back manner changed so far have be brightness animation now became lugubrious took morbid view of thing talked of men of middle age who have died lately of what have died of showing that most of be taken off suddenly when in perfect health apparently usually without premonitory symptom of disease be result of change of habit said be always dangerous in case of men of middle age mr kilroy began to feel uneasy in spite of for have be obliged to alter own habit considerably when married be apt to be little nervous about health consequently be much depressed when returned finding that have missed post did not tend to raise spirit angelica came down to dinner dressed in pale green with something yellow on head mr kilroy admired immensely

whether have money not if amused to obtain more never must be quite sure that must not carry out dreadful threat try to make knew must be only too glad of excuse knew too that if ever tried must be certain to succeed what with talent presence family prestige interest ill used young wife of elderly curmudgeon be character meant to assume said be sure to excite did not care for money be pleasure of chase delighted fun of extorting if mr kilroy have given asked for without trouble must have soon left off asking felt duty to refuse by way of discipline seeing that be so young did not think

with horrid discord drew from crowed like cock twenty five time running with interval of minute between crow brayed like two ass on common one answering other from considerable distance then became ten cat quarreling crescendo with pause after violent outburst broken at well judged interval by occasional howl mr kilroy endured nuisance up to point heroically at last felt compelled to send servant to tell angelica that be writing oh observed perversely choosing to misinterpret purport of tactful message then need not wait for longer suppose bring coffee please man withdrew proceeded with torture mr kilroy good naturedly shut door window hoping to exclude sound when found hint have be lost upon in vain library be near drawing room note be audible angelica be stumbling over air now dismal minor thing must have be quite bad enough have played properly a be being apparently too difficult for made distracting working way up painfully to one particular part where always broke down then going back beginning over again twenty time at least till mr kilroy got thing on brain found forced to wait for catastrophe time approached place where stumbled presently appeared at drawing room door with pen in hand deprecating air suspected malice only came to remonstrate mildly angelica dear began be sorry to disturb really can not write have be overworked lately be tired with journey down

not do for in proof of sent butler little later by way of breaking length of absence agreeably with what looked like letter on silver salver angelica opened found cheque for hundred pound when be alone again beamed round upon silent company of chair table much pleased then conscience smote be really very good said to herself far too good for think ever must have married anybody else there be something dubious resembled question in last phrase next day be hopelessly miserable out of door raining gusty cold mr kilroy be not sorry have good deal of business connected with property to attend to did not want to go out angelica be not sorry have little plan of own to carry out wet day rather favoured than otherwise having finished accustomed morning work being obliged to stay in be natural that must try to amuse also natural that must try something in way of exercise so collected dozen cur kept about place demonstrative mongrel for most part intelligent brought into hall where made run race for biscuit modus operandi being to place biscuit on top step of broad flight of stair there be at one end of hall then to collect dog at other make stand in row difficult task to begin with easy enough when understood be very soon although not without much shrieking of order from angelica responsive barking on part then start with whip first to arrive at top of stair took biscuit a matter of course others fought for be indescribably funny to see whole pack tear up eagerness then come down again helter skelter tumbling over other in excitement of scrimmage of losing temper of enjoying game returning of own accord to starting point waiting with yelp of excitement eye brightly intent ear pricked jaw open tongue hanging tail wagging side panting till biscuit be placed then off once more sometimes after false start two caused by impetuosity of little yapping terrier must rush before signal be given have to be brought back with whip other dog looking disgusted meanwhile like honourable gentleman at cad who wo play fair angelica shouting laughing made a much noise in way a dog did in theirs din be deafening exasperating kind of din too not incessant intermittent now swelling to climax now lulling until there seemed hope that must cease altogether then bursting out again whip cracking dog howling barking foot scampering angelica shrieking worse than ever presently mr kilroy appeared with remonstrance written on line of countenance dear angelica said unable to conceal quite justifiable annoyance can hing if racket continues deprecatingly be be quite seemly for used to do at home angelica answered be not at home now quick a light turned looked at with great grieved eye mean grew confused in haste to correct of course be at home very much so indeed know what want to say be a mistress of large establishment dignity setting example sort of thing see none of servant be about at hour angelica answered be dinner time apologize for thoughtlessness if have disturbed smiled up at a spoke poor mr kilroy retired to library quite disarmed by gentleness blaming for selfish brute to have interfered with innocent amusement in future determined must make more allowance for youth angelica meanwhile have collected dog disappeared presently returned followed mr kilroy to library be busy writing went stood in window looking idly out at rain drumming absently a seemed on pane with ten strong finger till must bear no longer dear child exclaimed at last ca get something to do angelica stopped instantly if thoughtlessness be exasperating docility be exemplary seemed disheartened then seemed to consider then brightened little then got letter sat down began to write scratch scratch scratch squeak squeak squeak on rough paper with quill pen writing in furious haste at table just behind husband why did choose library own private sanctum for purpose when there be dozen other room at least where might have be quite a comfortable mr kilroy fidgeted uneasily bore new infliction silently though with ever increasing sense of irritation for time finally however exclamation of impatience slipped from unawares do worry with scribbling angelica demanded with hypocritical concern be sorry have just done went away with half dozen note for post when met again at lunch told triumphantly that have refused invitation have come for since arrival on account of health have told everybody that have come home for perfect rest quiet much needed after strain of parliamentary duty a one of note at least must be read at public meeting to explain absence therefrom must afterward appear in paper probably have made impossible for to go anywhere during stay mr kilroy must not complain however for have not said only last night that be suffering from effect of overwork so alarmed must not have complained in case when saw so joyfully triumphant in belief that have cleverly eased from oppressing number of duty determined to pick excuse more carefully time for prospect of prolonged tte tte with angelica in present humour somewhat appalled peace loving soul thought of did just stir sufficiently for moment to cause to venture to suggest that in future might be a well for to consult before answered for in matter angelica replied with intelligent nod smile be altogether charming in day in spite of perverseness mr kilroy while groaning inwardly at irritating trick be also touched flattered by anxiety displayed for comfort welfare hoped to enjoy quiet cigar book after luncheon angelica have notion in head went to drawing room opened door window sat down to piano began to sing shake scale interval whole exercise book through apparently from beginning to end with such good will that voice resounded throughout house have eaten nothing since breakfast so a to be able to produce with desired effect there be escape from sound poor mr kilroy did not like to interfere with industry a have done with idleness be afraid have shown too much impatience already for one day so endured further trial without exhibiting sign of suffering after hour two of found sighing for undisturbed repose of house in town in way must have satisfied angelica have known at dinner looked very nice did not talk much conversation be not mr kilroy strong point be good at anecdote now racked brain for something new to tell listened however without seeming to see point of others caused to stare at in wide eyed astonishment a if shocked made pause awkwardly to consider half fearing to find impropriety coarser masculine mind have hitherto failed to detect caused flow of reminiscence to languish presently to cease then angelica began to make bread pill set in row flipped off table one by one deliberately when servant left room amusement ended pulled flower to piece between course hummed little tune mr kilroy fidgeted felt a if have be saying ever since came home must not now repeat self repression disagreed with so did dinner dyspepsia having waited on appetite in lieu of digestion after dinner angelica induced to go with to drawing room when have got comfortably seated have given coffee paper just peace enough to let fall into pleasurably drowsy state accompanied by strong disinclination to move began to pick out dead march in saul kindred melody with one finger on piano mr kilroy bore infliction also when brought cookery book insisted on reading recipe aloud went to bed in self defence chapter ii if first second day at home be failure so far a mr kilroy comfort be concerned third be a bad if not worse be continual case of please from morning till night angelica be touched at last by kindly nature must repeat remonstrance so often so patiently same did not forbear day however mr kilroy made allowance for angelica be thoughtless very thoughtless be only natural that must be so considering youth on next day however did occur to that be far too exacting for must not let leave for moment if must help on next be sufficiently depressed to acknowledge angelica be trying if did not actually sigh for solitude felt at event that must cost effort to resign to if must again prove refractory refuse to go back with angelica knew that have arrived at state just a well a if have told still be far from content wanted to go wanted to stay did not know what wanted teased with a much zeal a at first amusement have ceased to distract in least degree have become quite business now only kept up because must think of nothing else to do be conscious of change in conscious of racking spirit of discontent tormented of fact that in spite of superabundant vitality have lost zest for anything outwardly also a matter of habit when be with anybody who might have noticed change maintained dignity of demeanour have begun to cultivate in society upon marriage inwardly raged raged at at everybody at everything mood again be varied by two others one of unnatural quiescence other of feverish restlessness in one must sit for hour at time doing nothing not even pretending to occupy in other must wander aimlessly up down must walk about room look at picture without seeing go upstairs for nothing come down again without perceiving folly of be forever thinking diavolo be at sandhurst if only have be at ilverthorpe might have talked to tried effect of letter full of allusion must have aroused curiosity if not sympathetic interest made remark about in reply only wrote about prank seemed intolerably childish stupid to angelica in present mood about objection to early rising regular hour of knew so that repetition only irritated considered mr kilroy obtuse thought bitterly that anyone with scrap of intelligent interest in must have noticed that have something on mind won confidence reflection occurred to in drawing room one night after dinner immediately afterward caught looking at with grave intensity must have puzzled if did not strike a significant of deeper feeling than to carnal admiration for person expected despised must have given rise be too self absorbed to be more observant than gave credit of being result of mr kilroy observation be effort to take out of herself began by asking to play to not very graciously got out violin remarking that be sorry be not best one where be best one asked be not at home answered left with israfil fair haired friend know spoke slowly holding end of violin tightening string a did so effort causing to compress lip so that word be uttered disjointedly a finished speaking raised instrument to shoulder eye to mr kilroy face into gazed intently a drew bow across string testing a to whether be in tune not seeming rather to listen than to look a did so mr kilroy still quietly observing noticed that equanimity have be suddenly restored whether be mellow tone of violin happy thought have released tension must not tell be a much relief however to to see brighten a be to to feel when answered that great weight have be lifted from mind must now be able to talk out trouble oppressed unrestrainedly a be natural to when mr kilroy accepted term upon proposed to marry namely that must let do a liked have voluntarily promised to tell everything did have kept word a be wont telling exact truth a on occasion mixing up with so many romance that never knew be be in town when first met tenor when returned told have happened continued story from time to time a various episode occurred making extremely interesting also almost picturesque mr kilroy knew tenor by reputation of course be much entertained by what believed to be romance angelica be weaving about interesting personality suggested that must write just a told have not seen anything like anywhere said nothing half so lifelike oh then see be true gravely insisted oh of course answered smiling now when answered that have left best violin with tenor reminded by by yes said how doe story progress be thinking about in train on way home forgot to ask other thing have put out of head since arrived out of mine too said angelica thoughtfully at least forgot to tell be extraordinary by way for matter be now so complicated between can think of nothing else will be quite relief to discus subject with drew up little chair sat down opposite to with violin across knee began immediately with great earnestness looking up at a spoke described have happened on last sad occasion minutely row down river moonrise music accident rescue discovery effect upon tenor with accustomed picturesqueness speaking in first person singular with such force fluency mr kilroy be completely carried away declared a on previous occasion that set whole thing before so vividly found impossible not to believe word of what be going to do now asked with indulgent smile when have told that there be to tell at present can not end there know must be such lame conclusion be just what thought answered wanted to ask a man of world what must advise to do well began then rose held out hand to help up from little chair will come out sit on terrace said allow to smoke night be warm angelica nodded preceded through one of open window well mr kilroy resumed when have lit cigar settled in cane chair comfortably with angelica in opposite what lovely night be after rain yesterday by way of parenthesis rather close though observed then returned to subject suppose mean that want to be over between between tenor boy corrected whole charm of acquaintance see for consisted in footing know how to express perhaps can grasp what mean mr kilroy reflected be afraid said at last that footing can not be resumed influence of sex once difference be recognized be involuntary if have objection see why must not be friend intimate friend too with sort of man might make advance especially a be entirely in wrong be not saying know that must be proper thing to do a rule here be exceptional circumstance here be exceptional man now be significant said angelica jeering society be so demoralized that if man be caught conducting with decency honour on occasion when woman be in question involuntarily exclaim that be exceptional man mr kilroy smoked on in silence for time with eye

height of folly for to presume to express opinion upon subject understand now can anything be more absurd be dangerous besides absolutely dangerous yet hear that be very good woman girl ventured angelica thought that detected note of derision levelled at clerical exponent of reprehensible idea beneath demure remark oh saintlike answered cordially still to blame misguided know so venture to warn how can presume to reject proper direction pride be excessive church will receive extend benefit to still if only will humble conversation over room entered upon crescendo passage at moment angelica lost rest of sentence in general outburst new voice presently claimed attention speaker be young man addressing young man have back turned to be looking hard at portrait of herself hung so

bothering about by jove act a if meant be beastly unnatural know well must say like woman to be woman other rejoined surveying portrait from new point of view be way with guthrie lot know dawne be pi so what can expect of rest tone implied suddenly angelica felt face flush one of ungovernable fit of fury be upon sprang to foot upsetting chair with crash turned upon two young men who recognizing changed colour countenance shrank back apologetically uncle seeing something wrong have hurried across room to with anxious eye who be people asked indicating two young men lord dawne always courtesy consideration be shocked by tone think have met captain leicester before gravely reminded let introduce for heaven sake angelica broke forth glaring angrily at offender walked away abruptly with word on lip leaving lord dawne to settle with delinquent a thought fit mother who be seated at farther end of room talking to charming looking old lady angelica did not know stretched out hand to a approached drew to seat beside instantly angelica felt in moral atmosphere be daughter mr kilroy of ilverthorpe lady adeline said to old lady then added smiling there be so many mr kilroy in neighbourhood one be obliged to specify angelica dear mr power angelica bowed then leaned back in chair so that might not have to join in conversation listened in absent sort of way feeling soothed while by tone of refinement of earnestness sincerity in word be uttered be sure lady adeline be saying be sure one who can judge must mistake that lineless calm for device to cover emotion never have done so mr power rejoined although know history must say judging merely from observation that fineness of countenance consists more in expression of than in form feature though be good be result of long self repression denial stern discipline evidence of true beautiful soul of noble mind at rest after heavy sorrow great temptation being resisted have proved blessing source of strength angelica wondered of whom be speaking following direction of eye met of ideala fixed little sadly little wistfully upon young people a grow up find own life history so absorbingly interesting that think little of what may have happened may be happening to whom have always known a grown up have never occurred to angelica that one of placid gentle mannered woman among whom have always lived in contrast to a comet be to fixed star have ever experienced extreme of emotion now however felt a if eye have be suddenly opened looked with new interest at old familiar friend wondered mind busy for moment with what have just heard must not keep there however involuntarily slipped away back back to that first attempt of hers to see hidden wheel of life go round market place tenor suddenly felt a if must suffocate if did not get out into air rising quickly stole from room out of house unobserved babble of voice seemed to pursue stood for moment on step felt a if people be preparing to stream out of drawing room after to surround keep up distracting buzz in ear by idle inconsequent talk horse be prancing about drive empty carriage with cushion awry wrap flung untidily down on seat even hanging over door grazing dusty wheel gave sense of disorder discomfort from felt must fly where to ma'be please footman asked touching hat when have closed door fountain tower angelica answered must go see dr galbraith when carriage drew up under porch at fountain tower sat time a if unaware of fact footman patient face a waited with hand on handle of door ready to help to descend recalled walked into house a have always be accustomed to do instantly thought of diavolo came crowding why have diavolo ceased to be in to asked question through mist of tear gathered in eye did not fall at same moment busy mind took note of singular appearance of statue on staircase a beheld in blurred outline through bedimmed vision found dr galbraith in library sitting at writing table door be half open so entered without knocking walked up to turned at sound of step rose smiling held out hand when saw who be have be thinking about afternoon remarked sit down before have settled practised eye have detected something wrong what be asked nerve answered give something went to inner room returned presently with colourless draught in medicine glass took from drank mechanically then placed cushion for leant back in deep armchair closed eye dr galbraith looked at for few second seriously then returned to writing presently lord dawne came in raised eyebrow inquiringly when saw angelica who seemed to be asleep overwrought dr galbraith replied to silent inquiry there be fracas at hamilton house just now uncle observed how be going to end well of course have better leave to lord dawne quietly withdrew oh blessed rest peace of place angelica exclaimed shortly afterward dr galbraith who have resumed writing put down pen again turned to talk to said have lost self respect have lost heart be good for nothing worthless person how be to get out of dreadful groove live for others live openly answered slowly looking up beyond into futurity with kindly light in deep gray eye something of hope of confidence of encouragement expressed in strong plain face angelica bowed head familiar phrase have new significance now diverted stream of reflection into channel folded hand on lap sat motionless once more with eye fixed on ground dr galbraith be specialist in mental malady knew exactly how much to say when to say if text be a much a patient required must bear never made mistake of preaching sermon upon in addition so for third time took up pen returned to work leaving angelica engaged in sober thought happily quiescent chapter iii be late when at last went home drive of many mile in fresh evening air helped to revive have dreaded return place seemed empty to imagination strange chill a south room in have sat be glad with friend bright morning doe if by chance return alone when sun have departed place be dismal there be one to welcome even well trained servant be out of way for once felt heart sink a crossed deserted hall to go upstairs saw long line of door shut for most part if open showing big room beyond silent tenantless a passed library have noticed husband chair half turned from writing table just a have left probably that very morning seemed long time since then must have come to journey end age ago wondered if have felt a dreary on arriving a did now unaccustomed wish to be with in order to make thing pleasanter for here obtruded be one of least selfish thought have have lately be also one of very few occasion on leaving have not occasioned sense of liberty restored be one unmixed delight have hitherto experienced mind be racked by inconsistency did not perceive otherwise must also have observed that be running up whole gamut of past mood experience only to find how unsatisfactory in unstableness futility be might still further have perceived how fatal habit of living from day to day without settled purpose mere cork of creature on water of life at mercy of current of impulse be to permanent content to steady effort to do right at event else may not do right only happens alone give rise making thereof sure foundation of quiet happiness out of countless pleasure known only to who posse spring perceptibly to come like butterfly to summer flower enriching with beauty vitality while stay leaving none poorer when depart rather may be gainer by fertilizing memory remain angelica have gone to room to dress for evening a usual have idea of shirking ordinary routine of daily life because mind be perturbed that duty over descended to drawing room to wait until dinner must be announced so found alone with own thought once more went to one of fireplace stood with hand folded on edge of mantelpiece forehead resting on looking down at flower foliage plant concealed grate can not go on like know mentally ejaculated apostrophising then became conscious of great sense of loneliness kind of loneliness of heart from there be escape except in presence of one who know what trouble be can sympathize have be half inclined to confide in dr galbraith now regretted have not presently passing into contrary mood be glad what good must have done a for husband empty house be better than bad tenant be before dinner be announced afterward at dinner sitting in solitary state with servant behind book to keep in countenance made grievance of absence then sighed for such company a seven more who be entertained in house be swept garnished for purpose fancied must not recollect what be too much trouble to try so thought rambled on uncontrolled only believed be merry be what be not must be very soon in spite of everything in pursuance of resolve wrote several note after dinner asking people knew well enough to kindly dispense with ceremony of long invitation come lunch with to morrow dispatched groom on horseback with note that there might be delay even thought of making up house party here interest energy flagged left execution of project till next day then relapsed into regretful discontented mood if only if only that wretched accident have never occurred how different must feeling have be at moment be one of reflection a sat alone on terrace outside great deserted reception room must have be waiting now till house be quiet then must have dashed up to room to dress with exquisite sense of freedom made whole delight of thing in hour might have be boy with israfil can not go on like know angelica repeated to herself must do something what involuntarily mind returned to tenor if must win respect felt must start afresh with clear conscience steadfast determination to what be dr galbraith have suggested live openly live for others how to win tenor back to tolerate if must make friend knew that must be entirely true in thought word deed to duty to principle of right how must be that if there be truth in theory of hereditary predisposition coming a did of race foredoomed apparently to opposite course be folly to contend with fate when fate took form of long line of ancestor who have made family commandment for be be decent to seeming sin same to heart content have kept courageously at least men have then woman have be worthy in thought suddenly perceived that there be food for reflection for be not contradictious fact proof that be good deal matter of choice after here tenor parting word recurred to with came recollection of impression made at moment by deep yet diffident tone of earnest conviction in have uttered that last assurance will do good in world will be good woman yet know know will must be question now asked be word prophetic wondered from moment thought took new departure be able a be to stand aloof look back at herself a have be forward to a might yet become in quiet hour of retrospect be quite ready to confess sin be sincerely sorry have deceived tenor why be sorry why simply because have found out simply because there be end of charming adventure though le on account than on others for of course knew that end be near that must have parted soon in case be manner of parting caused such regret have lost affection lost confidence lost pleasure of acquaintance supposed be more than must bear if met in street must probably look other way must oh very notion stung sprang to foot threw up hand then a if goaded by lash without distinct idea ran down step headlong into garden so on through park till came to river when got there stopped at landing place not knowing why have come a stood there trying to collect thought absence of familiar object forced upon attention boat must have be lost night of accident did not know whether have sunk not there be name on so that even if have be found must not have be restored to unless have claimed while thought be conscious of pang of regret knew have boat be there next impulse must have be to go to tenor just a be bareheaded in thin evening dress with what object though to beg for honour of acquaintance supposed ala must not sneer in earnest laugh in earnest at absurdity chose to think there be in idea for acknowledged in heart of heart knew that acquaintance of such man be honour especially to a humbly insisted although have not broken of commandment never must never must slowly returned to house servant met on terrace asked if must require anything more that night then discovered lateness of hour ordered household to bed retired to own room there extinguished light threw window wider open sat looking out into dim mysterious night angelica loved night matter what mood might be felt charm something also of pride subduing hallowed influence be peculiarly own now a leant looking out beauty of heavenly purity began to steal into heart to soften slowly a tide go out when sea be tempestuous wave returning again again with angry burst flow to cover same spot a if loath to leave receding inevitably till in further distance harsh impetuous roar sink to babble when heard from place where lately raged seems safer for contrast between now of quiet firmness then of shifting sand watery fury so be with angelica turmoil of mind foaming discontent battling project by slow degree subsided after storm of uncertainty there came something like calm of settled purpose to be good to ascend to higher life if meant to feel like always must be good if in lay such power must not be wholly without religion because found in reverence for what be religion in others what after be religion attitude of mind develops in power to love reverence practise constitutes moral probity how to attain to by trying trusting faith be faith in power of goodness upon recognition of simple truth spirit wing unfurled slowly a sens ceased to be importunate became possessed by idea of deathless love longing fired soul with heroism filled heart with pathos until mind hand together unconsciously assumed attitude of prayer did not go to bed at night just sat there by open window patiently waiting for dawn did feel time long whole being thrilled to new sensation be subdued by so that remained motionless rapturously absorbed might only last till daybreak while did last be certainly intense lasted longer than however even survived day luncheon party to have in rash moment invited friend have determined to go to tenor very afternoon in way husband have suggested at first thought must drive be long way round by road much longer than by river so decided to walk although weather be inclined to be tempestuous crossed by ferry thinking must if possible meet tenor a came away from afternoon service in hope however be disappointed for when got to cathedral found service over congregation dispersed door locked there be nothing for then to go to own house with fast beating heart crossed road paused at little gate felt now that have made mistake must have taken husband advice come in state must not have felt half so frightened awkward if must have sat in carriage sent footman to inquire if tenor must do favour to allow to speak to for moment what must say to now what must say suppose refused to see at must ever survive must take by storm a boy must have done demand friendship kind consideration a right oh for of unblushing assurance have distinguished boy must have be part of costume surely confidence must return at right moment then must be able to face boldly having to knock at door ask for be like first plunge into cold water just to think of took breath away window be doubtless unfastened a usual must go in by be absurd though how hesitated especially after have happened be deterred by most novel uncomfortable shyness must not have come so far must not be for nothing must not go back until now at last with smile at qualm nervous tremor knocked resolutely there be little interval before knock be answered filled with hope knew just how radiant must feel a came away successful experienced something of relief pleasure must follow upon pain then door be opened by tenor elderly housekeeper woman have that worn worried look upon face be common among woman of class be master at home angelica asked not recollecting for moment by what name be known woman looked at curiously a if to determine social status before committed question seemed to surprise be gone answered dolefully did know gone angelica echoed blankly where gone home woman answered gone home angelica exclaimed unable to conceal dismay have home where be home woman gave curious look took moment to choose word then blurted out be dead miss did know buried yesterday chapter iv lonely man after leaving angelica night have returned to close walking like one hath aweary dream when entered little house sitting room where lamp be still burning yellow light in sickly contrast to pale twilight of summer dawn be beginning to brighten by time discomfort consequent on disorder struck chill to

death consequence of disease one persistent thought beset same thing over over again exhausting by dint of forced reiteration girl have be idolizing well there be such person there never have be that be yet what in first moment of terrible calamity have befallen seemed now that there must have be nothing like misery of home returning barren black despair of be hopeless difference between pain paralysis then have suffered at least must feel now felt nothing except that feeling be over when have finished simple arrangement of room still paced restlessly up down shaking back yellow hair brushing hand up over a if gesture eased trouble of mind if even boy have be left thought be one distinct regret formulated after while housekeeper arrived pleasant elderly woman who have attended ever since came to morningquest be not in nature to let personal matter whether be pain pleasure affect temper of intercourse with about force of habit helped now again to rouse greet woman in usual kindly courteous way so that being unobservant noticed change in except that be up earlier than usual then be always early riser therefore set about work unsuspiciously presently drove out of sitting room with dust pan brush went upstairs there happening to catch glimpse of own haggard face discreditable flannel in mirror began to change mechanically dressed with habitual neatness precision then little choir boy came to be helped with music be one who sang soprano solo in cathedral boy with lovely voice much general a well a musical ability of tenor laboured to help to develop came morning for lesson tenor gave breakfast also a small boy love little fellow to do justice cared more for tenor than breakfast there be three service in cathedral day tenor went to did not sing seemed to have

occurs in middle of summer making everything indoors humid unwholesome causing cold sore throat other unseasonable complaint tenor taught little choir boy a usual in morning went to three service getting more le wet time then came home tried to do work be not equal to head ached then tried to smoke pipe nauseated finally resigned to idleness just sat still in lonely room lonely of heart yet with hand patiently folded dreamily watching rain a beat upon old cathedral opposite streamed from eave gargoyle splashed from narrow spouting under roof making spreading pathway of dark moisture for on gray stone wall wherever overflowed be will to tenor for sake there be nothing must not have borne heroically illustration musical notation lyric watch ing o ver be ra el slumber not sleep cough be

view always after startling event who have be present a spectator taken part in repeat experience make remark upon again again in exactly same word mind working upon subject like heat upon water boil forming into bubble burst re form incessantly began time with remark of angelica about change mere dress effect went on to wonder at transformation of strong young woman into slender delicate looking boy by then went on to accept conclusion that be natural must have be deceived seeing that in first place have not slightest suspicion in second have never seen boy except in own dimly lighted room out of door at night besides be not first time that boy have be successfully personated by girl man by woman here found obliged to rehearse instance angelica have quoted then must reconsider fact that

show way child seemed unconscious of presence stepped into boat before stood side by side during crossing eye be fixed on water took notice of on other side of landing when reached be narrow lane mere pathway between high wall on one hand high hedge on other led up steep hill to road on other side of be cemetery child followed path then angelica knew that have be right in conjecture have only to follow led quite across cemetery to quiet corner where be open grassy space away from other graf two side of be sheltered by great horse chestnut old umbrageous from where stood caught glimpse of city

of tender pleasure loving act of child must have be to tenor yet eye be dry boy pressed flower on grave a if must nestle closer to friend then at once a patted cold clay lip trembled chest heaved with sob eye overflowed with tear face be puckered with grief having accomplished errand got up from ground slapped knee to knock clay off still sniffing sobbing walked back way have come in sturdy dejection be womanly in angelica went out to poor little fellow must like to have comforted what must say do ala ala woman who can not comfort child what sort of woman be presently found standing beside river looking up to iron bridge crossed with one long span there be tree on one side of bridge old house piled up on other picturesquely israfil have noticed last time rowed down river evening be closing in sky be deepening from gray to indigo there be one bright star above bridge why have come here have not come to see bridge with one great star above to watch sullen river slipping by unless indeed bent over water peering into remembered that after first plunge there have be no great pain even if there have be what be physical pain compared to terrible heartache dreadful remorse incurable malady of mind must make life burden to forevermore if have patience to live patience angelica what impossible association of idea face relaxed at humour of be with smile that turned to gather summer drapery about bending sideways to reach back to train of dress a insane fashion of tight skirt be then in vogue necessitated in act however became aware of someone hastening after next moment soft white hand grasped arm drew back angelica how can stand so near edge in uncertain light really thought must lose balance fall in be lady fulda who spoke uttering word in irritated almost angry tone a mother do when relieve own feeling by scolding shaking child have escaped with bruise from danger to life limb be ever said on subject consequently angelica never knew if have guessed intention only be startled by seeming carelessness a professed to be sudden impulse passed from angelica a be way with morbid impulse moment ceased to be alone first word be sufficient to take out of herself to recall to normal state to readjust view of life setting back to proper focus still looked out at world from low level if healthy dull dead level mean temperature of be chilly while atmosphere threatened to vary only from stagnant apathy to boisterous discontent positive hopeless unconcealed moved by common consent two lady turned from river walked on slowly together in silence feeling uppermost in angelica mind be one of resentment aunt have appeared in same unexpected manner at outset of acquaintance with tenor objected to reappearance now at conclusion be like incident in melodrama arrival of good influence be absurd if have done on purpose must have be impertinent entrance to ilverthorpe be only few hundred yard from where have met have now reached postern led into ground angelica opened with latchkey then stood to let aunt pas through before suppose will come in said ungraciously lady fulda forgave discourtesy two walked on together up to house passing while road lay through park under old forest tree that swayed continually in rising gale somewhat buffeted by wind till came to narrow path sheltered by row of tall shrub on thick foliage of rain have fallen at interval during day have collected now splashed in face fell in wetting drop upon dress a bush struck by heavy gust swayed to fro angelica whose nervous system be peculiarly susceptible to discomfort of kind felt more wretched than ever thought of desolate grave with mud splashed bedraggled flower upon of golden head beautiful calm face beneath thought of a be apt to think of dead at first imagining still sentient aware of horror of position crushed into narrow bed with terrible weight of earth upon left out alone in cold uncomforted uncared for while loved trusted most recline in easy chair round blazing fire talking forgetfully something like flashed through angelica mind cry a of acute pain escaped from unawares companion feature contracted for moment otherwise made sign of having heard have not exchanged word since have entered ground now gentle lady fulda began again with trepidation however for angelica manner continued to be chilling not to say repellent must not tell how advance must be received be looking for said for raising eyebrow yes went to house afternoon heard from housekeeper that young lady have be there felt sure from description likelihood that must be said have be wholly unprepared for dreadful news have be great shock to thought must probably go to see grave be always one first impulse be going to look for there when saw in distance on towing path angelica preserved ungracious silence attention be attracted by way in aunt spoke of tenor in regard to herself apparently a if have known of intimacy lady fulda resumed however before angelica have asked how must be be afraid will think very meddling person said speaking to young niece with respect unassuming diffidence of high breeding good feeling perhaps know how one fancy that one can do something say something that one ought to try to believe be comfort to one self to be allowed to try yes angelica assented thinking of desire to help child thawing with interest at expression of experience similar to own felt something of while ago have reached house by time angelica ushered aunt in then led to drawing room where usually sat one opened onto terrace be sheltered side of house that day window stood wide open making room a fresh a outer air sat down at one of from must see top of tree swaying immediately beneath further off river then green upland terminating in distance of wooded hill always think be prettier than view from morne although not so fine lady fulda remarked tentatively be little afraid of way in angelica in present mood might receive observation of hers however inoffensive have be looking out of window when spoke silence followed caused to turn look at latter have risen for purpose must not remember what now stood staring before in dazed way be afraid be not well dear lady fulda said taking hand affectionately oh be well enough angelica answered almost snatching hand away making great effort to control tempest of tear threatened to overwhelm expect to be polite anything to day know took turn up down room then trouble of mind betrayed o aunt fulda exclaimed clasping hand wringing have done dreadful thing know be unexpected rejoinder angelica hand dropped stared at aunt thought taking new departure under shock of surprise did tell demanded lady fulda stammered saw with several time at first thought be diavolo did not wonder be so naughty rather used to be when asked with whom be staying everybody be amazed maintained that have not be in neighbourhood at so wrote to at sandhurst reply convinced that must have be mistaken then began to suspect in fact be sure lady fulda spoke nervously with accustomed simplicity angelica felt fascination of singular womanly power aunt exercised resented be that said defiantly why did interfere for one thing because did not like to why on account did know be deceiving yes must not have be with under such circumstance lady fulda rejoined then thought upon whole be better not to interfere broke off recurring once more to angelica question be sure must find out sooner later then knew must do what be right in meantime companionship of such man under circumstance be good for seem to know very well yes lady fulda answered be at university with uncle dawne george galbraith be great friend used to come to castle good deal at time eventually julian visit have to

disappointment of aunt made tale complete have heard that never maiden glow 'd be in earlier maidenhood with fervent flame of human love being rudely blunted glanced shot only to holy thing to prayer praise gave to fast alms must have be about same age angelica reflected a examined lineless perfection of lady fulda face then there glanced through mind vision of what might have be ought to have be a seemed to why must have be banished from castle because cared for asked point blank lady fulda confusion increased be not reason faltered making brave effort to confide in angelica in hope of winning latter confidence in return there be dreadful mistake grandfather thought be paying attention to spoke to about telling must not be allowed to marry beneath julian said not meaning affront to
