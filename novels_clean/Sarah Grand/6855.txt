see cousin lorrimer be adviser in general at great hospital responsible position be sure if go will be glad to do honour of place be most interesting ideala have felt from first that must rather consult stranger who must be disinterested unprejudiced gentleman name promised well for for belonged to people whose integrity be well known position vouched for ability also for age to ideala whose imagination have pictured learned old gentleman bald spectacled benevolent full of knowledge of world wise saw modern instance one thought must be better suited for purpose accordingly next day after attending to household duty went by early train to consult chapter xiv great hospital have be founded by eccentric old gentleman of enormous wealth for entirely original purpose observed that great building be erected everywhere to receive patient suffering from imaginable bodily ill chronic mania of course when brain be diseased being one of one have thought of making provision for such trouble mental moral religious a affect mind held that such suffering be a real without proper treatment a incurable disastrous a form of physical ailment therefore determined to found hospital for unhappy one must contain requisite divine revelation have suggested human ingenuity must devise for promotion of peace of mind idea have grown out of great mental trouble with have be afflicted in early life for world a be must offer relief first thing did towards carrying out of plan be to buy site for hospital near growing town on bank of big river building be to be surrounded by green field for colour be refreshing within sight of great volume of calmly flowing water silent power of be solemn tranquillising to spirit human society be to be within easy reach for many people find beneficial a soon a have found site be entirely satisfactory set about maturing plan for building scheme must not be carried out in moment spent thirty year in travelling to study human nature architecture else must help to bring work to perfection at end of thirty year have finished plan for building to own entire satisfaction mr ruskin have be growing up in meantime have begun to write founder happening to come across work by accident one day discovered own idea to be wrong from beginning to end however a be truth be aiming at not justification of calmly burnt plan put finger in ear figuratively speaking that might not hear rest of world bray for ten year more devoted to study of mr ruskin at end of time knew something about proportion about mass interval of light shade about grandeur sublimity of size grace beauty of ornament about depth harmony of colour other wonder make one sick with longing to behold when have mastered determined to begin at very beginning be to say with wall be to enclose vast experiment everything be to be real everything be to be solid everything have to be endowed with power of expression must not fail of effect a soon a felt might safely begin hastened away to inspect long neglected site for wonderful building here unexpected check awaited while have be so hard at work future neighbour have not be idle town have grown to city river bank be crowded with wharf human habitation river cradled fleet on bosom water once so sublimely clear still be turbid yellow befouled by city sewer useful only remained to remind of what have once be be few acre of weed enclosed by iron railing eyesore to inhabitant of region a corporation told with polite hope that must either build on soon leave alone be diplomatic way of requesting to hand lot over to might have done have said please when found young city so ignorant thought duty to teach manner so took year two more to consider matter then perceived that if built house on site a be now must do even more good than have intended for constant contemplation of such stately pile must help to elevate citizen outside building while within might find comfort in seeing surrounded by even greater misery than own so building rose grew to perfection found after that better site must have be chosen for for from side a approached be seen to advantage majesty power of be made manifest outside design be so evident in grandeur that mind be not wearied perplexed by effort to understand be simply elevated to state of enjoyment bordering on exaltation exaltation without excitement near akin to peace interior of building a entered maintained first impression such ornament a there be touched a cloud do with sense of suitability left nothing to be desired art be so perfectly hidden that there seemed to have be striving for effect in decoration construction looked like work of nature accomplished without effort beautiful without design mind brought under influence left free of conjecture be gently compelled to revel in peace harmonious surroundings insensibly produce disturbing thought vanished a being too common mean too human for place spirit be soothed with sense of repose of sensuous restfulness really for pleasure a intended affected sens more than intellect must here make holiday work wearied brain be thus eased from pressure mind prey to doubt other disturbing thought impaired strength if did not render useless be at once relieved be beginning of treatment be afterwards continued in other part of building by other mean until cure be complete arrangement being made for removal of case proved to be hopeless to older establishment have long existed at expense of country a outcome of private enterprise of course staff of place have to be formed of men of high order of have be patient have be chosen on account being thought that who have suffered from certain ill must be apt to detect symptom in others able to devise remedy for proved to be case establishment be munificently endowed liberally supported master a be reverently called lived just long enough to see that be success have not thought of extending charity to woman being under impression that such provision be necessary for acknowledged that have large share of physical suffering to endure asserted that nature to preserve balance must have arranged mind so a to render incapable of suffering in other way sentimentality hysteria silliness said be at bottom of mental trouble did not therefore merit serious attention chapter xv of ideala knew little nothing when went there except that great hospital existed for learned purpose felt power of place however preoccupied a be stopped involuntarily when saw building ceasing for moment to be conscious of anything awe admiration inspired then passed up broad step beneath massive pillar of portico entered hall man servant took card to mr lorrimer returning presently requested to follow left great hall by flight of low step at end of turning to right passed through glass door into quite part of building long dimly lighted gallery led away into distance few door opened on to at one of servant stopped knocked tall gentleman opened door begging ideala to enter bade be seated at writing table stood in middle of room took chair in front of looked at ideala card lay before gentleman whom lorrimer introduced a brother julian lounged on high backed chair at other side of table room be good size so crowded with thing that there be scarcely space to turn round light fell full upon lorrimer a sat facing window ideala saw fair man of about thirty not at sort of man have imagined quite impossible for purpose awkward pause followed entrance be unable to tell real reason of visit at loss to invent fictitious one suppose know in least who be said seeing that glanced at card again then explained telling what cousin have written to must like to see hospital asked please rose took down bunch of key requested to follow felt interest in place knew be bore to to show to thing have to be done led through hall lecture room place of recreation place for work showed picture gallery statuary library museum told plan of clearly like one reciting lesson indifferently like one performing task must be got through somehow making most interesting nevertheless ideala began to be taken out of what delightful place said when came to library there be whole row of book want to consult how must like to come read oh pray do answered whenever like lady frequently do so have only to write tell when wish to come will see that be properly attended to thank ideala rejoined be just very thing for for be writing little book can not get on till have consulted authority on subject in museum stopped to look at mummy oh happy mummy burst from ideala involuntarily why asked lorrimer aroused from apathy have done with know answered then turned looked at saw that be something more than cold pale faced indifferent have be first idea of eye be large dark grey penetrating must have called face fine rather than handsome upper part be certainly beautiful in spite of hard line on there be something in expression more than in formation of mouth chin however did not satisfy head throat be former narrowed little at back forehead made up for defect be not striking made ideala think of tito melema of bayard that remark of hers having broken ice began to talk like human being with something in common ideala mood be not calculated to produce good impression failure of enterprise brought on fit of recklessness such a understood said thing must have made stranger think peculiar lorrimer have begun to be amused before returned to great entrance hall once twice looked at curiously what sort of person be wonder be thinking be dying of dulness said telling about place came from so came to see left for moment presently returned with brother have better come have luncheon before go back said went a left building lorrimer asked where on earth did cousin meet with slightest possible emphasis ideala understood laughed upon word know who introduced answered standing on dignity nevertheless ca remember went to refreshment room at station be crowded managed to get table to there be vacant seat at old gentleman begged to be allowed to occupy a there be other in room three chatted while waited hiding self beneath light froth of easy conversation people not accustomed to look on surface for sign of what be working beneath must have thought merry enough a began to know companion better ideala be more more drawn to lorrimer brother who be dark man very different in character did not attract old gentleman meanwhile be absorbed in newspaper marked enjoyment of by inhaling breath exhaling again in particular way be called blowing like porpoise lorrimer by intelligent glance expressed what thought of peculiarity to ideala who remarked be next gale developing dangerous energy on way to north british norwegian coast laugh followed caused old gentleman to fold up paper look benignly at young people over pince nez be early in season pea be rare forced vegetable small dish of be brought handed to dangerous gale who absently took have taken pea sir allow to give pepper said lorrimer dexterously suiting action to word dangerous gale though disconcerted at first be finally moved to mirth ah young people young people said sighed being merry wise old gentleman found pleasure in pleasure entered into mood little suspecting black care be one of party that black bruise must have aroused pity indignation of honest old heart have seen be almost under eye loved presently rose to go before departed observed looking kindly at ideala lorrimer be handsome pair dear let congratulate may child have mother sweetness father strength may love have for other last for ever there be nothing like thank god for remember always keep yourselves unspotted from world so saying went way in peace dear embarrassing old man said lorrimer regretfully wish have spilt pepper on plate be there chance for lorrimer brother asked ideala only stared at there be something in tone made feel ill at ease brought back recollection of misery in moment then at once became depressed young men noticed be afraid be rather down about something julian said 'd better tell what be perhaps must cheer up be lawyer know might be able to help lorrimer be looking at seemed to wait for to speak only showed by change of expression that fact of brother being lawyer possessed special interest for if will trust said at last

ideala looked better younger day in summer dress than have done in heavy winter wrap on occasion of first meeting when found face to face with lorrimer began to tremble be overcome with nervousness in way be new to saw change in appearance manner at glance smiling slightly begged to follow led way through long passage many door passing number of people to own room spoke to once twice on way be only

must rather knew truth than think mad mean to try for separation ca leave entirely to own device if did must certainly go from bad to worse if will become of think much more of life must make reckless be silent for little then exclaimed help not to grow reckless be so alone took hand looked down into eye sudden deep flush spread over face smoothing out line a have seen do once before transforming be like walking on edge of precipice in dark said in low voice grasp tightened a spoke there be something mesmeric in touch that overpowered ideala felt change in herself at moment be never same woman again will help if can said after pause then let go after talked for time tried to persuade to reconsider decision leave husband honestly believed be best thing must do told why thought so acknowledged wisdom of advice declined to follow be somewhat puzzled for reason gave be hardly enough to account for determination wandered away from subject at last however talked of many other thing told ideala of first coming to great hospital a patient gave of detail of own case told enough of private history to arouse sympathy interest of nature of confidence know nothing ideala felt in honour bound not to repeat a be made to in course of private conversation be always scrupulously faithful to such trust know however that be man who have suffered acutely from unhappy circumstance from trouble of mind beset clever men at outset of career sometimes never leave entirely at peace man be something more than clever man be man in thousand have in strong degree be worst best in man highest most spiritual aspiration warred in with most carnal impulse spent day in fighting to attain to one subdue other ideala have never known man like man talent rapid change of mood a sense conscience got

following in footstep though know led to ruin once because way be pleasant being surprised to find that must end again in disaster be abandonment of hope of finding new efficacious remedy for old disease of society have checked progress for hundred of year will keep world in respect just a be at time of crucifixion for own part can not see that history doe repeat except in trifling detail in

improve society to make self indulgence possible without shame think own marriage law might be improved people be trying to improve said with slight laugh friend of mine have just married girl who objected to take oath of obedience how absurd be for girl of nineteen to imagine know better than age think said ideala that be more absurd for age to subscribe to oath something stronger than make impossible for half of to keep strength of character must decide question of place in household a doe elsewhere be surely folly to require useless to insist on submission of strong to weak marriage oath be farcical woman be made to swear to love man who will probably prove unlovable to honour man who be a likely a not to be undeserving of honour to obey man who may be incapable of judging what be best either for have respect for age uphold such nonsense there be never need to bind with oath if men be ought to be must obey gladly to be able to do so be ask well be difficult question answered

than what have be that old institution revised be that world want faith in future development of good idea further discovery never yet imagined for one thing lorrimer considered famine war inevitable scourge of human race necessary for removal of surplus population useless to contend against because destined to recur so long a there be human race must have limited intellectual pursuit for woman because culture be held to prevent trouble for elder expedient only provided cure point upon ideala did not agree with at nothing be more disastrous to social prosperity held more likely to add to criminal class than family be too large for parent to bring up educate comfortably in own station if higher education of woman be natural check on over production of kind then encourage thankfully a merciful dispensation of providence for prevention of much misery can see reason in nature ethic for teeming population only brought into existence to be removed by famine war why old green ball of earth must roll on just a merrily without of lorrimer wrote to at last have be obliged to acquiesce took ideala letter womanlike though nothing must have altered decision be not at first satisfied with compliance seemed to too ready that made doubt if might not have be to blame after wrote to other once again when received last letter spoke to about must have seen a do from first for have said

something left to in common though something be only grief tried to comfort by speaking of many way in might still find happiness listened patiently until be obliged to stop for want of word then said be very well know be talking nonsense what be use of offering people everything one thing needful what say to be well have have turn have be raised from darkness of clod for glorious moment seen brightness of skirt of god try to think have right to complain still be not better satisfied than child have eaten cake want to have too suppose there be many who must call wretched say that life with

ah blessing of rest not long after cruel rumour reached on good authority that lorrimer be engaged to be married confess that feeling about be one of unmitigated contempt for man trembled for effect of news upon ideala made sign however when first heard be surprised fear showed be in spite of myself for spoke about understand said one event in career be not of more consequence to than because be of greatest consequence have none of dog in manger spirit think there must be something almost maternal in feeling for be why doe not change be le constant must prove that affection be of lower kind

to meet yet more glad for then end will have come for must have still to wait rumour of lorrimer engagement however proved to be false be lorrimer cousin of lorrimer be restored to good grace now suppose claudia said in half sarcastic way when mistake be explained have not told what be in mind have read thought think that man whom ideala have loved must consider sacred added did not answer hold that men who have felt inspired great love will be sanctified by if there be true nobility in nature knew that one man whom ideala did not love have be so sanctified by love for held sacred always be relief to mind to know lorrimer be not unworthy be distinguished man then felt sure that must become still more distinguished eventually be not one of many who come go be forgotten one of destined to live for ever in mind made better by presence good in nature be certainly a far above average a be splendid ability ideala be right when declared that must answer for principle be impulse be beyond calculation for own impulse wise man will answer ideala continued to droop will never get over said to claudia one day when be alone together indeed will claudia answered confidently out of depth of profound ignorance of natural history do speak brother dread reaction though when come will be overwhelmed with shame will come be only phase be in state of transition now be pride that make nurse grief will not let give up can not bear to think that of woman in world must have be victim of anything so trivial a passing fancy not that must have be passing fancy if have not be separated a be why fire can burn without fuel claudia have evidently changed mind might be right own fear be that first impression must be justified that ideala must never be able to take healthy interest in anything again can not care be constant complaint nothing ever touch painfully pleasurably nothing will ever make glad again said one evening when be sitting alone with claudia there be long silence after have finished speaking during sat in dejected attitude face buried in hand at once looked up be very strange said that feeling seems to have gone with expression of think claudia decided in common sense tone that be nursing unholy passion ideala be afraid to give up lest there must be nothing left to can not free mind from trammel of grasp something higher better nobler can not become mistress of yourself again enter on larger life will be full of love not narrow selfish passion be cherishing for one pure holy love only best such woman a may always be of best can feel for if must get fume of evil feeling out of must see a see what common thing be must recognise a recognise that very expression of be just such a be given to by hysterical man woman have ever experienced be physical condition caused by contact kept up by own perverse pleasure in nothing more one grows out of in time one with proper self control must conquer be wavering see now that have crystallised feeling into word that be pitiful thing after that object be not worth such expenditure of strength certainly not worth sacrifice of power to enjoy anything else such devotion to memory of dead husband have be thought grand by although for part can see nothing grand in form of self indulgence whether be indulgence of sorrow joy narrow sphere of usefulness cause to neglect claim of who love upon affection claim of fellow creature generally upon consideration in case be simply claudia paused for want of word must say be simply degrading ideala interposed feel so glory in know said claudia pitilessly do then got up laid hand on ideala shoulder be time said earnestly be time o passionate heart morbid eye old hysterical mock disease must die chapter xxviii hoped claudia plain speaking have made impression for long time after that seemed a if ideala interest in life have really ended that sphere of usefulness have contracted that must become like rest doer of unconnected trifle have meaning only a straw have meaning show way current set one can not help thinking how many of significant straw must go down to ocean be lost little use unrecognised little labour unavailing because doe so little good merely to know way stream be setting what ocean will receive at last if have power to profit by knowledge at time ideala own life be not unlike one of hapless straw seemed wretched failure of early promise ending a straw on common stream when so little might have made influence in own sphere like river strong beautiful who loved watched in trouble with eager hope that good might yet come of hope diminished always a day wore on at first mind have raged stormed one must see though said so little renunciation be perfect nevertheless must not reconcile to must not go back must not go on so remained midway between past be hateful to future be blank raging at gradually storm subsided then came period of calm whether be calm of apathy calm of resignation be hard to say meantime lost health again became so fragile that sister only expressed what felt when be speaking of one day said sadly cheek be so waxenly thin a if deathward 'twere whitening in cloud of flesh still more white be clearing till soul be in sight large eye too liquidly glister mouth be too red have kissed angel bend down to pull bud of beautiful whispered own little sister be anxious to take abroad must not accompany talked of going alone did not go after time gave up thinking about then one day quite suddenly said be time old hysterical mock disease must die told that have at last decided to travel somewhere nothing more definite than for said have fixed plan concluded however that meant to be away time for said something about peril of deep uncertainty of life generally confided private paper to care telling to look at if must interest make what use of pleased be how from have gathered much of story came into possession then left for whole year heard nothing of not one word claudia chafed little complained a woman will when thing arrange exactly a must have ordered be content to wait because expected nothing time did not seem so long a perhaps might have done lived usual life part of year in one of eastern county part in london then came north again be winter weather frosty clear bright be tempted out great deal taking long ride begun before sunset ending

total eclipse without hope of day where be now be learning to see again own sometimes have presumption to think that if have stayed with might have helped seemed hardly credible that must be able to stand alone at time not to speak of strength required to take out of herself be not loneliness added misery never must bear to be alone always thought worst trial of married life be mental solitude to have reduced by making feel necessity for reserve even with best friend of course have chosen to go alone be quite own doing must not help thinking uneasily at time that must not have gone at if have not noticed how anxious be about fancied must relieve of trouble by relieving of presence must have be so like ideala then thought must wander off recalling numberless little deed of love perfect selflessness depth beauty of great tender nature a do recall such thing of one who have gone will nevermore return a in old day to make glad there be day have seen from club window stoop to pick up little ragged barefooted child be cry in street wrap fur about carry off smiling happy in arm with more thought of attention action must attract than if have be alone with waif in desert many many

if be quite sure oh ideala be not sort of woman right business that be going in for be woman can do good in own sphere only ideala laughed own sphere ' be very indefinite phrase observed be nonsense really woman may do anything can do in womanly way say that brain be lighter that therefore must not be taught too much why not educate to limit of capacity leave there why if be inferior must there be fear of making superior must stop when can not go further old womanish cackle on subject everlasting trying to prove what be already said to be proved looking for square in space after laying down a law only circle exists be curious way of showing how to control 'exuberance of own verbosity say will not be content when get what want there be right for a soon a own education ' be secure will begin to clamour for higher education of men for prayer of woman worth name be not beake superior to husband ' 'lord make husband superior to ' be there more pitiful position in world than of right

have be taught to expect to find guide philosopher friend in husband be to be head of house lord of life liberty sole arbiter on occasion be right convenient to have so world requires to fill position wife prefers that must probability be about equal that being morally inferior will not be fit for that therefore will find in false position there will then be interval of intense misery for wife education prejudice will make try to submit at first to what sense know to be impossible eventually be forced out of unnatural position by circumstance to save house family must rebel take rein of government into own hand face life disappointed lonely woman heaven help said claudia one know that future of woman in state of mind be only question of circumstance temperament may rise ideala looked up quickly may fall be going to say yes know if doe be own fault must know better may not be quite mistress of herself at time may be fascinated may be led on interposed quickly claudia seemed to have forgotten one thing be certain if have real good in will always stop before be too late think said claudia must be better after if woman be taught to expect to find husband equal disappointment must not be so great if husband proved inferior when woman have be led to look for so much imagination be full of dream in figure a infallible being expects to be refuge support comfort at time when man have height to fall from in one estimation there can be little of left if doe fall ideala sighed after short pause said have be wondering what make possible for woman to love man not flesh that see can touch though may attract a colour of flower attracts must be mind be in scent of flower a be if find eventually that mind be corrupt must shrink from a from other form of corruption finally abandon on account of a must abandon flower if found odour fetid indeed have already abandoned husband when acknowledges that be not what thought paused moment then went on passionately can not tell what be battling day by day with power be irresistible because have to put forth strength to accomplish work simply be by being lowered can not tell what be to feel going down not to be able to help try a must to feel gradual change in mind a grew to harbour thought be reflection of thought low thought to be filled with idea recollection of conversation have caused infinite disgust at time remained with like taste of nauseous drug until almost acquired morbid liking for oh if must save other woman from claudia hastily interposed to divert be good idea higher education of men said know whether have abandoned hope whether think already perfect certain be idea of improving doe not seem to occur to often want good men in society if clergy priest be good be only what be required of what everybody expects therefore goodness be accepted a matter of course be viewed a indifferently a other matter of course one good man in society have more effect a example than ten priest have not told what propose to do ideala said hope be nothing unwomanly claudia interposed anxiously ideala looked at laughed claudia laughed too moment after have spoken fear of ideala doing anything unwomanly be absurd even to herself unwomanly woman be such dreadful creature claudia added apologetically yes said ideala must pity in nine case out of ten there be great wrong great grief at bottom of unwomanliness perhaps if shriek may be sure that be suffering ease pain will be quiet enough average woman who be happy in marriage doe not care to know more of world than can learn in own nursery to see more of a rule than can see from own garden gate be great power unfortunately there be so very little of what want to do be to make woman discontented have heard of noble spirit of discontent thought for long time that everything have be done must be done to make world better now see that there be still one thing more to be tried woman have never yet united to use influence steadily together against of disapprove work too much for trying to make own life happier have yet to learn to take wider view of thing to be shown that only way to gain end be by working for everybody else with intent to make whole world better mean happier in order to accomplish must be taught that have only to will in own family amongst own friend that after having agreed with rest about what mean to put down have only to go home use influence to end quietly consistently without wavering thing will be done influence be like strong current run beneath surface of ocean without disturbing yet with irresistible force at rate may be calculated be to help in direction of force be going to devote life imagine went on hurriedly that think fit for work have have conscientious scruple be sorely troubled about own unworthiness seemed to unfit for good work now see thing differently one may be made instrument for good without merit of one own so long a deceive ourselves by thinking be worthy so long a be trying best to become so think may hope think may even know that will eventually stopped looked at be made worthy said claudia kissing if be not so ideala if everybody have to begin by being a good a want others to be there must be no good worker left in world at at moment noisy party burst in upon grave debate carried ideala off for ride saw leave house watched ride away until last

time a soon a be restored to health saw thing clearly enough be great good woman pure hearted full of charity god bless for tenderness for wonderful power to love alone can count number who have reason to wish well be true answered be merely going to remark when interrupted that will never think 'none worse see what difference make claudia again interposed always did think least of least when thought of herself at be not often be dwelling too long on past really making too much of men when be saint be twice a bad a woman pointed out to sister something confusing in way of expressing fact kindness seemed to exasperate know what mean quite well said tartly yes know rejoined wanted to help to make intelligible to other people claudia made gesture of impatience laughed left remained for long time thinking over ideala have said also thinking of a looked at time subject be so inspiring that although strong point be landscape in ambitious mood began to paint allegorical picture of a
