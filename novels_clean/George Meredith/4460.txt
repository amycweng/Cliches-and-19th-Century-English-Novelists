ordinarily from infirmity of sight truth be that man nature counteracted spirit intenser eagerness restlessness by alternating state of repose resembled dormancy so preserved rosamund be obliged to give credit for straightforward eye when did look out flash filmy blue overflown with grey by age be poignant while fire in lasted antipathy attributed something electrical to light shot dr shrapnel account of nevil stated to have gone to call on colonel halkett new resident at mount laurel on otley river offered welcome of house to lady who be captain beauchamps friend saying with extraordinary fatuity so sounded in rosamunds ear captain beauchamp must certainly not let evening pas without coming to rosamund suggested that might stay late at mount laurel then will arrive here after nightfall said doctor bed be at service maam offer be declined must like to have seen to day will be home shortly will not quit bevisham till election decided unless to hunt stray borough vote maam go to mount

magical power too must otherwise have won mastery over nevil of course must have shot rejoinder to confute with force of indignation save that word be tumbling about in head like world in disruption made feel weakness at same time that gloated on capacity a though have enormous army quite overwhelming if must be got to move in advance very common condition of silent stricken unused in dialectic heightened rosamunds disgust by causing to suppose that nevil have be similarly silenced in case vanquished captured ruined dwindled in estimation for moment two felt that among sisterhood of gossip must soon have found voice struck down demagogue audacious sophism not that affected in slightest degree for own sake shrapnel might think what liked say what liked a far a be concerned apart from man

world anything well meaning moderately ridiculous young candidate fact that one so experienced a seymour austin deemed adversary to be grappled with in earnest created small revolution in mind entirely altering view of probable pliability of radicalism under pressure of time circumstance many of remark that have previously half smiled at came across memory hard a metal began to feel terror of said to reassure captain beauchamp be not likely to be champion with very large following be too much of political mystic think many young men be before have written out fair copy of meaning said
