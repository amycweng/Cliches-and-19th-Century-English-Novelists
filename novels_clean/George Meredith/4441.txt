sent devoured thought written expressly for with hagar communed during long hour sang on to verge of imagined desert beyond mountain shadowed lake last view of beloved motterone hagar face of tear in brerawas known to hagar in 'addio ' gave living voice to dumb one vittoria revelled in delicious vocal misery expanded with sorrow of poor hagar whose tear refreshed parted from recent narrowing self consciousness great green mountain fronted like living presence motterone supplied place of robust venerable patriarch whom reproached worshipped with fathomless burdensome sense of cruel injustice deeper than tear voice spoke of feeling of subjected love be like mother giving suck to detested child countess ammiani saw abrupt alteration of step look with dim surprise what do conceal from asked supplied answer by charitably attributing to news that signora piaveni be coming when laura came countess thanked saying be wretched companion for boiling head laura soon proved to that have be best for after very few hour vittoria be looking like hagar on canvas woman such a violetta d'isorella be of sort from laura shrank with feminine power of loathing spoke of with effort at personal tolerance until heard of violetta stipulation for deferring of carlo marriage contrived to guess that carlo be reserved unfamiliar with betrothed then cried out fool that be be ever possible to come to end of folly of men have inflamed vanity met when be holding waiting doubt commenced with lamentation over country followed by sigh fixed look cheerful air assurance to that knew uttered a if through keyhole of royal cabinet knew that sardinia must break salasco armistice in mouth if only if king must be sure of support from youth of lombardy do suspect unhappy king vittoria interposed

amalia observation to bear upon anna violetta by turning pointedly from one to other a said a for reason perhaps have chosen word if count ammiani attended appointment time must be unreasonable startled why leaped from anna lip reddened at impulsive clumsiness laura raised shoulder slightly do not know expression of face reproved violetta a for remissness in transmitting secret intelligence can answer why countess addressed latter eager to exercise native love of conflict with doubtfully faithful countrywoman austrian must feel that have beaten on essential point afford to give number of dialectical victory really can not answer why violetta said unless count ammiani be a venture to hope better employed answer be charming perfect said laura enigmatical answer be declared to be so when
