large leaved water flower catching mirrored moon of aklis in whirl breaking in lance then waded into water knee deep two genius seized hold of great slab of marble in middle of water under be hollow brimmed with brook that brook partly filled flowed over then genius said to abarak 'plunge said same to shibli bagarag swayer of sword replied a have be simple occasion common matter thing for
