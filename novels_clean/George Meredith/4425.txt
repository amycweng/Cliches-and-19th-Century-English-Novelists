there be sort of hero sort of villain to story be instrument hero villain be combined in person of edward who be now here to abase before old man family have injured to kneel penitently at foot of woman who have just reason to spurn have sold a slave be sold have seen plunged into blackest pit yet be miraculously kept pure for if must give pardon might still be grief for must ask compassion have at least purified to meet embrace great agony have passed through of late have killed meaner pride stood there ready to come forward ask forgiveness from unfriendly face beg that might be in dahlia eye once that might see once have grown to love with fullest force of selfish though not common nature rather have always loved much of selfishness have fallen away from love be not highest form of love love be highest development have heard that dahlia lost to be free something like mortal yearning to look upon dead risen to life made impossible for to remain absent in doubt be ready to

major waring mr boulby to farm exalted woman be relating to mr sumfit in part of house farmer percy robert be in family sitting room when after interval william fleming said aloud come in sir edward stepped in among rhoda be above seeking admittance to sister door heard father utter welcome froze limb for still hated evil doer hatred of be passion crouched over stair listening to low long toned voice monotonously telling what seemed to be one sole thing over over without variation in room where men be word be indistinguishable thrice after calling to dahlia getting response listened again awe took soul at last for abhorred a be by power be felt comprehended something of earnestness made offender speak of wrongful deed shame remorse before fellow men straight out calmly like one who have be plunged up to middle in fire of abyss be thereafter insensible to meaner pain voice ended be then aware that have put charm upon ear other voice following sounded dull have can have confessed in word wicked baseness thought in soul magnitude of crime threw gleam of splendour on courage even at bare thought that might have done feeling that dahlia be saved thenceforth at liberty to despise torture rhoda more readily acknowledged that might be true love for sister animating from height of possible vengeance be perceptible turned to sister door knocked at calling to safe safe there came answer be half glad for have fear that in quick revulsion of sister feeling mere earthly love must act like heavenly charity edward must find forgiven only too instantly heartily in small musk scented guest parlour mr boulby be giving mr sumfit poor old sleepy anthony account of miraculous discovery of sedgett wickedness have vindicated one hoped for from above a also narration of stabbing of boy heroism great heartedness of robert rhoda listened to for space went to sister door again when stood outside kitchen found voice silent within be in truth not only very difficult for william fleming to change view of complexion of circumstance a rapidly a circumstance changed be very bitter for to look upon edward to see in place of sedgett have be struck dumb by sudden revolution of affair in house have be deferentially convinced by major waring tone that ought rightly to give hearing to unknown young gentleman against whom anger be due have listened to edward without one particle of comprehension except of fact that behaviour be extraordinary understood that admission made by edward with such grave strange directness must justly have condemned to punishment culprit odd upright even toned denunciation rendered impossible to think of inflicting knew likewise that whole history be being narrated to that although other two listener manifestly did not approve expected to show tolerance to speaker said once robert do favour to look about outside for t ' other robert answered that man be far away by time farmer suggested that might be waiting to say word presently know have be dealing with villain sir cried robert throw ever so little light upon one of breed skulk in hurry mr fleming for sake of honour mention again what be asked to do now be to bury thought of righted daughter when there be shame on farmer replied be idea printed simply on understanding for edward to hear be worse than scourging with rod bore telling last vitality of pride to sleep comforting with drowsy sensuous expectation that be soon to press hand of lost one beloved who be in house breathing same air with be perhaps in room above perhaps sitting impatiently with clasped finger waiting for signal to unlock fling open must imagine damp touch of very expectant finger dying look of life drinking eye oh helplessness of limb a sat buoying heart drowned in bliss be unknown to that peril of uttermost misery have be so imminent picture conjured of in mind be that of gentle troubled face soul afflicted yet hoping because have be told to hope half conscious that rescue almost divine in suddenness unexpectedness perfect clearing away of shadow approached manifestly by pallid cast of visage have tasted shrewd wasting grief of late robert heart melted a beheld change in edward believe mr blancove be little to blame said perhaps when behaved so badly down at fairly may have thought sent set heart against for time can just understand how might edward thought for moment conscientiously accepted suggestion for standing under roof with whom loved near be absolutely out of power for to comprehend that wish to break from dahlia measure have taken consented to have sprung from own unassisted temporary baseness then robert spoke to farmer rhoda must hear robert word fear be that dahlia might hear too pleading for edward be so hearty yet why must always think differently from robert asked with excuse for changeing partially thawed be very anxious for father reply be late in coming felt that be unconvinced suddenly door opened farmer called into darkness dahlia down here previously emotionless emotion be started in rhoda bosom by command be gladness ran up knocked found cry out be here edward there came answer edward be here come come see still not one faint reply dahlia dahlia call of dahlia name seemed to travel endlessly on rhoda knelt putting mouth to door said darling know will reply to know doubt now listen be to come down to happiness silence grew
