notwithstanding that have seen indication of not too absolute devotion towards have let become aware have broken with captain gambier whose income be eight hundred year merely for sake of higher attachment now since catastrophe can with ease make appear to world be choice from first seeing that cornelia will assuredly make manner of objection if with foolish sentimental persistence assumes garb of sorrow then sir twickenham ear will tingle will retire altogether will not dare to place in position will lend colour to gossip jilted by one sister flew for consolation to other jilted too
