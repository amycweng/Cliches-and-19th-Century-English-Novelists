conceiving of folly to be displayed made ridiculous invents person situation best to accomplish purpose be therefore mere realist examining confused detail of actual life by watchmaker eye in luminous ring eruptive of infinitesimal be rather idealist who hold to be business of art to render life in quintessence artist must simplify elaborate first must simplify experience into typical deed person eliminating from scheme merely accidental particular second must elaborate simplification presenting through representative concrete instance that may lose aspect of abstract formula acquire emotional significance meredith be thus intellectualist engaged in playing game of literary chess have made pattern on board designed piece move according to pre arranged plan just a sir austin seek to enact

instantaneously upon trait mental experience otherwise not to be revealed when egoist must affectionately approach shrinking clara nothing must better deliver situation than meredith simile gulf of caress hove in view like enormous billow hollowing under curled ridge stooped to buttercup monster swept by be felicity in use of rhetorical figure enables meredith to characterize style of carlyle a resembling early architecture utter dilapidation so loose rough seemed wind in orchard style tumbled down here there appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster sentence without commencement running to

remark be whether fiction demand perfectly smooth surface undoubtedly scientific work doe philosophical work must when ask for fact simply feel intrusion of style of fiction be part in one case classical robe in other medieval phantasy of clothing difficulty with style so artificial intellectualized be obvious meredith according to brownell flatters one cleverness at first in end fatigue perpetual crackle of aphorism metaphor surprise gratifies then wearies for writer who will never say plain thing plainly not only keep reader under strain soon seems to be straining nowhere be more evident than in meredith predilection for repeating single happy phrase such a epithet rogue in porcelain applied to heroine since phrase tickle fancy play with drop pick up mumble over over a dog might bone through chapter after chapter be ready at pretext to run round round with barking despite assiduous striving for novelty therefore meredith be often tedious effect induced not merely by style whether repetitious gasping after eccentricity also by method be so intent upon weaving commentary upon speech action that occasion of commentary be smothered phrase becomes text of sermon gesture excuse for paragraph of oblique reflection thus forfeit advantage of downright sincerity of forthright progress tease interest out of patience v since meredith be intellectualist naturally ask

hypocrisy be fair game for comedy a intellectualist dislike distrust excess of emotion feeling indulged for own sake sentimentalist declares be who seek to enjoy without incurring immense debtorship for thing done well might mr carlyle complain that meredith work lacked tear that doe so must be first to admit for question worth of pathos for true captain of soul pathos be tide often carry awakener of off foot meredith writes can not quite preserve dignity when stoop to work of calling forth tear moses have probably to take nimble jump away from rock after venerable lawgiver have knocked water out of so meredith sacrifice passion to analysis hero heroine rarely love so simply so ardently a do richard lucy affection of even delectable pair be modified in presentation by playful cynicism of narrator of story on other hand be futile to cavil at meredith other artist for lacking such quality a be incompatible with most notably posse can not expect abandon of passion in character of novelist whose forte be detachment sublimated common sense intellectualist be not to be blamed if fails to write a sentimentalist meredith positive philosophy have be formulated by elmer j bailey in term may be briefly paraphrased meredith think of man a torn between nature circumstance by nature be meant world of instinct of healthy normal impulse by circumstance be meant world of artificial law erected by society a machinery for conduct control nature be spontaneous circumstance be traditional man may err by allowing to undue dominance only safety lie in use of reason will enable to keep nature circumstance in proper equipoise most serviceable instrument of reason for detecting folly of convention of feeling be comic spirit without spirit be not truly intellectual for a meredith have said not to have sympathy with playful mind be not to have mind let posse mind seems to urge through mind cultivate soul in tragic comedian remark be soul doe thing in life rest be vapor action mean life to soul a to body compromise be virtual death be pact between cowardice comfort under title of expediency so do gather dead matter about so be gradually stifled corrupt war with evil in form must be incessant can not have peace serious note here sounded may be heard again in letter to friend mr gilman there meredith say have written always with perception that there be life of spirit that concrete be shadowy yet that way to spiritual life lie in complete unfolding of creature not in nipping of passion outrage to nature help to extinguish light vi just outrage to nature perpetrated with best intention in blind folly be subject of meredith novel ordeal of richard feverel dogmatic conventional father endeavor to determine son life according to infallible system of

accepted by complacent sir austin received with child at house since richard have at length achieved self mastery have resolved to return confess to wife plead for grace general reconciliation seems imminent novelist will not allow tale to end happily lest moral be frustrate accordingly although richard return for hour to be freely forgiven by lucy dash away forthwith despite entreaty to duel with persecutor joy even yet might emerge from disaster since richard escape from duel with only wound author continues implacable heroine in nursing husband succumbs to strain long protracted richard though recovered in body be left wreck of former self such be desolating outcome of attempting to regulate healthy human love by worldly system what be tragic for hero heroine be gravely comic to eye of intellectualist surveying folly of men from height far above troubled wave of passion for meredith sir austin incarnates comic error story be comedy of one who theorizes at length upon life utterly
