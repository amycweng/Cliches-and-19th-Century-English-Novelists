army began on morning of th ie three day after bloody fait d'armes of th narrated commented on in different manner according to interest passion of narrator still remains for many people mystery at end of letter will see that quote short phrase with austrian major now prisoner of war portrayed result of fierce struggle fought beyond mincio officer be one of few survivor of regiment of austrian volunteer uhlans two squadron of commanded declaration made by officer be thoroughly explicit conveys exact idea of valour displayed by italian in terrible fight who incline to overrate advantage obtained by austrian on sunday last must not forget that if lamarmora have thought proper to persist in holding position of valeggio volta goito austrian must not have prevented seems austrian general in chief shared opinion for after army have carried with terrible sacrifice position of monte vento custozza did not appear indeed did austrian then give sign that intended to adopt more active system of warfare be business of commander to see that after victory fruit of must not be lost for reason enemy be pursued molested time be not left for reorganization nothing of happened after th nothing have be done by austrian to secure such result frontier separate two dominion be now same a be on eve of declaration of war at goito at monzambano in other village of extreme frontier italian authority be still discharging duty nothing be changed in place be to except now then austrian cavalry party suddenly make appearance with only object of watching movement of italian army one of party formed by four squadron of wurtemberg hussar regiment having advanced at six o'clock morning on right bank of mincio met fourth squadron of italian lancer of foggia be beaten back compelled to retire in disorder towards goito rivolta in unequal encounter italian lancer distinguished very much made austrian hussar prisoner killed few more amongst whom be officer same state of thing prevails at rivottella small village on shore of lake of garda about four mile distant from most advanced fortification of peschiera there a elsewhere austrian party advanced with object of watching movement of garibaldians who occupy hilly ground from castiglione eseuta cartel venzago stretch to lonato salo desenzano to mountain pass of caffaro in last named place garibaldians came to blow with austrian on morning of th former got best of fray have fait d'armes of th battle of custozza a archduke albrecht call be great victory for austrian why must imperial army remain in such inaction only conclusion must come to be simply that austrian loss have be such a to induce commander in chief of army to act prudently on defensive be now informed that charge of cavalry austrian lancer hungarian hussar have to sustain near villafranca on th with italian horseman of aorta alessandria regiment have be so fatal to former that whole division of kaiser cavalry must be reorganised before can be brought into field main regiment of haller hussar two of volunteer uhlans be almost destroyed in terrible charge to give idea of cavalry encounter be sufficient to say that colonel vandoni at head of aorta regiment command charged fourteen time during short period of four hour volunteer uhlans of kaiser regiment have already given up idea of breaking through square formed by battalion in centre of stood prince humbert of savoy when be suddenly charged literally cut to piece by alessandria light cavalry in spite of long lance carried weapon loose uniform wear make resemble cossack of don there be one circumstance if be not mistaken have not a yet be published by newspaper be there be fight on th on place at north of roverbella between italian regiment of novara cavalry regiment of hungarian hussar whose name be not known regiment be so thoroughly routed by italian that be pursued a far a villafranca have two squadron put hors de combat whilst novara regiment only lost twenty four mounted men think right to mention for prof that day after bloody affair of th italian army have still regiment of cavalry operating at villafranca village lay at distance of fifteen kilometre from italian frontier report be much accredited here explains how italian army did not derive advantage might have derived from action of th appears that order issued from italian headquarters during previous night especially verbal instruction given by lamarmora pettiti to staff officer of different army corp be either forgotten misunderstood by officer sent to durando commander of first corp seem to have be a follows that must have marched in direction of castelnuovo without however taking part in action durando be generally stated have strictly adhered to order sent from headquarters seems that general cerale understood too literally having be ordered to march on castelnuovo finding village strongly held by austrian who received division with tremendous fire at once engaged in action instead of falling back on reserve of first corp waiting new instruction if such be really case be evident that cerale thought that order to march have received implied that be to attack get possession of castelnuovo have village a really be already be occupied by enemy in mentioning fact feel bound to observe write under most complete reserve for must be sorry indeed to charge general cerale with having misunderstood important order see that one of leading contemporary belief that must be impossible for king lamarmora to say what result expected from ill conceived worse executed attempt result expected be think clear enough wanted to break through quadrilateral make junction with cialdini who be ready to cross po during night of th that attempt be ill conceived worse executed contemporary public at large have for present right to conclude for one know a yet imperfectly detail of terrible fight what be certain however be that general durando perceiving that cerale division be lost did that must to help failing in turned to two aide de camp coolly said to gentleman be time for to retire for have duty to perform be strictly personal one duty of dying ' on saying word galloped to front placed at about twenty pace from battalion of austrian sharp shooter be ascending hill in le than five minute horse be killed under be wounded in right hand scarcely need add that aide de camp did not flinch from sharing durando fate bravely followed general one marquis corbetta be wounded in leg other count esengrini have horse shot under called on durando who be now at milan day before yesterday though stranger to received at once speaking of action of th only said ' have satisfaction of having done duty wait tranquilly judgement of history assuming for argument sake that general cerale misunderstood order have received that by precipitating movement dragged into same mistake whole of durando corp assuming say to be right version can easily explain fact that of two contending party be a yet in position clearly to describe action of th why did one other display bring into action whole force must have have at disposal why so many partial engagement at great distance one from other in word why want of unity in opinion constituted paramount characteristic of bloody struggle may be greatly mistaken be of opinion that italian general in chief austrian archduke entertained on night of rd idea of delivering battle on th there only there lie whole mystery of affair total want of unity of action on part of italian assured to austrian not victory chance of rendering impossible lamarmora attempt to break through quadrilateral one can deny on other hand if italian army failed in attaining object failure owing to bravery displayed by soldier by general be far from being disastrous irreparable one italian fought from three o'clock in morning until nine in evening like lion showing to enemy to europe that know how to defend country that be worthy of noble enterprise have undertaken let now register one of striking episode of memorable day be five o'clock pm when general bixio whose division held elevated position not far from villafranca be attacked by three strong austrian brigade have debouched at same time from three different road supported with numerous artillery officer of austrian staff waving white handkerchief be seen galloping towards front of bixio position once in presence of general bade surrender who be not personally acquainted with bixio can not form idea of impression bold demand must have made on have be told that on hearing word beurrender ' face turned suddenly pale then flushed like purple darting at austrian messenger said if dare to pronounce once more word surrender in presence tell bixio always keep word will have shot at once ' austrian officer have scarcely reached general who have sent than bixio rapidly moving division fell with such impetuosity on austrian column be ascending hill that be thrown pellmell in valley causing greatest confusion amongst reserve bixio led men with aide de camp cavaliere filippo fermi count martini colonel malenchini tuscan actually charged enemy have be told that on hearing episode garibaldi said ' be not at surprised for bixio be best general have made ' once enemy be repulsed bixio be ordered to manoeuvre so a to cover backward movement of army be orderly slowly retiring on mincio assisted by co operation of heavy cavalry commanded by general count de sonnaz bixio covered retreat during night occupied goito position held till evening of th in consequence of concentrating movement of italian army have mentioned at beginning of letter fourth army corp cialdini still hold line of po if be rightly informed decree for formation of fourth army corp be signed by king yesterday corp be that of garibaldi be about strong officer who have just returned from milan told morning that have have opportunity of speaking with austrian prisoner sent from milan to fortress of finestrelle in piedmont amongst be officer of uhlan regiment who have appearance of belonging to aristocratic family of austrian poland having be asked if thought austria have really gained battle on th answered ' know if illusion of austrian army go so far a to induce to believe have obtained victory believe who love austria can not however wish must obtain such victory for be victory of pyrrhus there be at verona element in austrian council of war understand give to operation in present phase of campaign just a uncertain a vacillating character a possessed during campaign of on friday be still beyond mincio on saturday small fleet on lake of garda steam up to desenzano open fire against defenceless city railway station whilst two battalion of tyrolese sharp shooter occupy building on sunday retire early yesterday cross mincio at goito monzambano begin to throw two bridge over same river between last named place mill of volta at same time erect battery at goito torrione valeggio pushing reconnoitring party of hussar a far a medole castiglione delle stiviere montechiara last named place being only at distance of twenty mile from brescia before news reached here morning be rather inclined to believe that be playing at hide seek in hope that leader of italian army must be tempted by game repeat for second time too hasty attack on quadrilateral news have from reliable source have however changed former opinion begin to believe that austrian archduke have really made up mind to come out from stronghold of quadrilateral intends actually to begin war on very battlefield where imperial cousin be beaten on th june may be that partial disaster sustained by benedek in germany have determined austrian government to order more active system of war against italy a be generally believed here that organisation of commissariat be not perfect enough with army archduke albert command to afford more active offensive action be that a may fact be that news received here from several part of upper lombardy seems to indicate on part of austrian intention of attacking adversary yesterday whilst peaceable village of gazzoldo five italian mile from goito be still buried in silence of night be occupied by hussar to great consternation of people who be roused from sleep by galloping of unexpected visitor sindaco mayor of village who be chemist of place be hear forcibly taken from house compelled to escort austrian on road leading to piubega redondesco worthy magistrate who be not apparently endowed with sufficient courage to make at least hero be so much frightened that be taken ill still be in very precarious condition inroad be not always accomplished with impunity for last night not far from guidizzuolo two squadron of italian light cavalry cavalleggieri di lucca if be rightly informed at sudden turn of road leading from last named village to cerlongo found almost face to face with four squadron of uhlans italian without numbering foe set spur to horse fell like thunder on austrian who after fight lasted more than hour be put to flight leaving on ground fifteen men hors de combat besides twelve prisoner whilst skirmishing of kind be going on in flat ground of lombardy lie between mincio chiese more decisive action have be adopted by austrian corp be quartered in italian tyrol valtellina few day ago be generally believed that mission of corp be only to oppose garibaldi must try to force alpine pass now suddenly hear that austrian be already master of caffaro bagolino riccomassino turano point be fortifying fact explains last movement made by garibaldi towards direction whilst austrian be massing troop on tyrolese alp revolution be spreading fast in more southern mountain of friuli cadorre thus threatening flank rear of army in venetia revolutionary movement may not have a yet assumed great proportion a be effect of plan proposed beforehand might become really imposing more so a rank of italian patriot be daily swollen by numerous deserter refractory men of venetian regiment of austrian army although main body of austrian seems to be still concentrated between peschiera verona must not wonder if crossed mincio to day to morrow with object of occupying height of volta cavriana solferino by position by nature of ground be in so many fortress supposing that italian army must decide for action there be reason to believe such will be case be not unlikely that a have already second battle at custozza may have second one at solferino at italian headquarters something have be decided upon may hasten forward movement of army infer from fact that foreign military commissioner at italian headquarters who after th june have gone to pas leisure of camp life at cremona have suddenly made appearance at torre malamberti villa belonging to marquis araldi where lamarmora staff be quartered still more important event be presence of baron ricasoli whom met yesterday evening on coming here president of council be coming from florence after stopping few hour at villa of cicognolo where victor emmanuel royal household be staying drove to torre malamberti to confer with general lamarmora count pettiti presence of baron at headquarters be too important incident to be overlooked by people whose business be that of watching course of event in country must be borne in mind that on way to headquarters baron ricasoli stopped few hour at bologna where have long interview with cialdini be for most important fact have to report to day be that whilst be writing five o'clock be three corp of italian army be crossing oglio at different point three acting together ready for occurrence reconnaissance en force may a see be turned into regular battle must austrian have crossed mincio with main body of army during course of last night see that air around smell enough of powder to justify expectation of event be likely to exercise great influence over cause of right justice cause of italy marcaria july

told must not ascertain whether austrian have crossed mincio in force what part cialdini garibaldi will play in great struggle nobody can tell be certain however that two popular leader will not be idle that battle if fought will assume proportion of almost unheard of slaughter general headquarters of italian army torre malimberti july whilst austrian emperor throw at foot of ruler of france be almost going to write arbiter of europe italy brave army seem to reject disdainfully idea of getting venetia a gift of neutral power there can not be doubt a to feeling in existence since announcement of austrian proposal by moniteur being one of astonishment even indignation so far a italy be concerned one hears nothing expression of kind in italian town may be italian army be naturally anxious that must not be said to relinquish task when austrian speak of having beaten without proving that can beat too there be high consideration of honour soldier general must ever think of putting aside for humanitarian political reason with consideration italian army be fully in accord since th june way too in kaiser chose to give up long contested point by ignoring italy recognising france a party to venetian question created great indignation amongst italian whose paper declare one that fresh insult have be offered to country be state of public opinion here unless greatest advantage be obtained by premature armistice hurried treaty of peace be likely to continue same not to entire security of public order in italy a matter of course eye be turned towards villa pallavicini two mile from here where king be to decide upon accepting rejecting french emperor advice of decision be fraught with considerable difficulty little danger king will have sought advice of minister besides that of prussia will have be asked probably given matter may be decided one way other in very short time may linger on for day to give time for public anxiety fear to be allayed to calm down in meantime look a if king general have made up mind not to accept gift attack on borgoforte tete de pont on right side of po began on th at half past three in morning under immediate direction of general cialdini attacking corp be duke of mignano day yesterday gun be heard at torre malamberti a be also morning between ten eleven o'clock borgoforte be fortress on left side of po throwing bridge across

piece of artillery position be subsequently abandoned by enemy occupied by garibaldi volunteer in affair general received slight wound in left leg nature of however be so very trifling that few day will be enough to enable to resume active duty seems that arm of austrian proved to be much superior to of garibaldians whose gun did very bad service loss of latter amounted to about killed wounded figure in officer appear in great proportion owing to having be always at head of men fighting charging encouraging comrade throughout captain adjutant major battino formerly of regular army died struck by three bullet while rushing on austrian with first regiment on abandoning caffaro line have reoccupied after lodrone encounter in consequence of garibaldians have to fall back because of

baron ricasoli have be suddenly summoned by telegram from florence a hear have just arrived be undoubtedly brought about by new complication especially a at council of minister presided over by baron vote nature of be a yet unknown be taken on present state of affair a know very well in england italy have great confidence in ricasoli whose conduct always far from obsequious to french emperor have pleased nation be thought to be at moment right man in right place with great acquaintance posse of italy italian with co operation of such honest man a general lamarmora italy may be pronounced safe against friend enemy from what saw morning coming back from front presume that something that something new perhaps will be attempted to morrow so far proposed armistice have have effect upon disposition at general headquarters did not stay cannon voice in middle of rumour of hope fear italy wish to push on with war have a yet be adhered to by trusted leader headquarters of first army corp piadena july a begin writing doubt can be entertained that movement be not only in contemplation at headquarters be actually provided to take place to day that will probably prove to be against austrian position at borgoforte on left bank of po up to time tete de pout on right side of river have only be attacked by general duke of mignano gun must now on contrary be matter of cutting communication between borgoforte mantua by occupying lower part of country around latter fortress advancing upon valli veronesi getting round quadrilateral into venetia while then waiting for further news to tell whether plan have be carried into execution whether will be pursued mindless of existence of mantua borgoforte on flank one great fact be already ascertained that armistice proposed by emperor napoleon have not be accepted that war be to be continued austrian may shut up in stronghold may even be so obliging a to leave king uncontested possession of by retreating in same line a opponent advance pursuit if not struggle war if not battle will be carried on by italian at torre malamberti where general headquarters be end of general officer be to be seen yesterday hurrying in

information be to be obtained respecting intention of austrian be to be hoped for italian army for credit of general that more will be known about now than be known on eve of famous th of june on very morning heroism of italian on memorable day surpasses possible idea can be formed a did also surpass expectation of country let relate few out of many heroic fact only come to light when occasion be have of speaking with who have be eyewitness of a be object of magnified regimental order a yet of well deserved honour italian soldier seem to think that army only did duty that wherever italian may fight will always show equal valour firmness captain biraghi of milan belonging to general staff having in midst of battle received order from general lamarmora for general durando be proceeding with possible speed towards first army corp be slowly retreating before superior force of enemy before greatly superior number of gun when while under perfect shower of grape canister be of sudden confronted by austrian officer of cavalry who have be lying in wait for italian orderly austrian fire revolver at biraghi wound in arm nothing daunted biraghi assails make turn tail then following in pursuit unsaddles have own horse shot down under biraghi disentangles kill antagonist jump upon latter horse however be thrown down also in moment by cannon ball so that gallant captain have to go back on foot bleeding almost unable to walk talking of heroism of inimitable endurance strength of soul what do think of man who have arm entirely carried away by grenade yet keep on horse firm a rock still directs battery until hemorrhage hemorrhage alone strike down at last dead such be case with neapolitan major abate of artillery name be worth glory of whole army of whole war may only find fit companion in of officer of eighteenth battalion of bersaglieri who dashing at austrian flag bearer wrench standard out of hand with left one have clean cut away by austrian officer standing near immediately grapple with right until own soldier carry away with trophy doe not sound like greek history repeated doe not look a if brave men of old have be born again old fact renewed to tell of italian heroism bersagliere tuscan by name orlandi matteo belonging to heroic fifth battalion fought against entire brigade regiment battalion losing out of officer about out of men orlandi be wounded already when perceiving austrian flag make great effort dash at officer kill take flag almost dying give over to lieutenant be now in ward of san domenico hospital in brescia who have learnt of bravery will earnestly hope that may survive to be pointed out a one of many who covered with fame on day if be sad to read of death encountered in field by so many patriotic brave soldier be sadder still to learn that not few of be barbarously killed by enemy killed too when be harmless for lay wounded on ground sicilian colonel stalella son in law of senator castagnetto courageous man amongst most courageous of men be struck in leg by bullet thrown down from horse while exciting men to repulse austrian in great mass be pressing on thinned column although retreating regiment sent of men to

planted lance in body be not wanton cruelty cruelty even unheard of cruelty that savage posse still be fact one will ever dare to deny from verona vienna for be known a much a be known seen that uhlans many of austrian soldier be drunk when began fighting that alighting from train be provided with ration with rum that fought without haversack be truth nothing beyond have to honour of italian be asserted whether to disgrace credit of enemy so while denying that ill treat austrian prisoner be ready to state that theirs be well treated in verona without thinking of slandering calumniating a vienna paper have done morning prince amadeus arrived in cremona where most spontaneous hearty reception be given by population national guard proceeded at once by shortest way to headquarters so that wish to be again at front when something must be done have be accomplished brave young man worthy brother prince humbert have won applause of italy be justly proud of counting king prince amongst foremost in field have just learned from most reliable source that austrian have mined bridge of borghetto on mincio so must be blown up only two of goito borghetto must be destroyed italian obliged to make provisional one instead also hear that venetian town be without garrison that most probably force be massed on two line one from peschiera to custozza other behind adige will probably know by time that garrison of vienna have on rd be directed to prague news receive from prussia be on whole encouraging inasmuch a greatly feared armistice have be repulsed by king william people here think france will not be too hard upon italy for keeping word with ally that brunt of french anger disapproval will have to be borne by prussia be least can expect a know be probable that by to morrow will be able to write more about italo austrian war of gonzaga july write from villa only mile distant from gonzaga belonging to family of count arrivabene of mantua owner have never reentered since be only fortune of war have brought to see beautiful seat of aldegatta never be to be hoped for to be abandoned again be a see beutatum ab illo ' onward have gone then exiled patriot onward will go nation that owns wish of one who be compelled to remain behind be that army that volunteer that fleet must cooperate that must one land on venetian ground to seek for great battle to give army back fame deserves to country honour posse king be called upon to maintain word nobly given to avenge novara with new austrian insulting proposal be said be ready army have be said to be numerous if to be numerous brave mean to deserve victory let italian general prove what italian soldier be worthy of if will fight country will support with boldest of resolution country will accept discussion whenever government having dispersed fear will proclaim that war be to be continued till victory be inscribed on italy shield a be not far from borgoforte be able to learn more than mere cannon voice can tell so will give detail of action against tete de pont began a told in one of former letter on th in gorgoforte there be about austrian on night from th to th kept up from four fortified work sufficiently well sustained fire object of be to prevent enemy from posting gun fire however did not cause damage italian be able to plant battery early on th firing began along line italian pounder having be first to open fire italian right be commanded by colonel mattei left by colonel bangoni who did excellent work while other wing be not so successful heaviest gun have not yet arrived owing to one of incident always sure to happen when least expected so that pounder must not be brought to bear against fort until later in day damage done to work be not great for moment still advantage have be gained of feeling strength of enemy position finding right way to attack artilleryman worked with great vigour be only obliged to desist by unexpected order arrived about two pm from general cialdini attack be however resumed on following day condition of monteggiana rochetta fort may be pronounced precarious a sign of time more especially of just impatience prevails in italy about general direction of army movement may not be without importance to notice that italian press have begun to cry out against darkness in everything be enveloped while time already passed since th june tell plainly of inaction be remarked that bitter gift made by austria of venetian province suspicious offer of mediation by france ought to have found italy in greatly different condition a regard political military position italy be on contrary in exactly same state a when archduke albert telegraphed to vienna that great success have be obtained over italian army be fact however strong worthy of respect may be reason there be doubt that extraordinary delay in resumption of hostility have occurred at present moment operation projected be perfectly mysterious something be let out from time to time only serf to make subsequent absence of news more more puzzling for present first official relation of unhappy fight of th june be published be accordingly anxiously scanned closely studied be matter of general remark that great military knowledge be required to perceive that too great reliance be placed upon supposed fact that indulgence of speculation idea caused waste of so much precious blood prudence characterising subsequent move of austrian may have be caused by effect of opponent arrangement italian commander ought to have avoided responsibility of giving enemy option to move be clear that to mend thing utterance of generous patriotic cry be not sufficient that must be shown that vigour of body be not at surpassed by vigour of mind be also clear that many life might have be spared if there have be greater proof of intelligence on part of who directed movement situation be still very serious such armistice a general von gablenz must humiliate enough to ask from prussian have be refused emperor of french have advised to accept might ultimately become fact for italy purely venetian question must then also be settled while italian national question question of right honour army prize so much must still remain to be solved gonzaga july travelling be generally said to be troublesome travelling with through brigade division army corp can certify to be more so than be usually agreeable be not that italian officer italian soldier be in way disposed to throw obstacle in way unhappily for have with inevitable car with inevitable carmen of be enough to make blood

flag have carried to battle have not at price allowed to be taken may state here en passant that a many a six flag be taken from enemy in first part of day of custozza be subsequently abandoned in retreat while of italian only one be lost to regiment for few minute when be quickly retaken fact ought to be sufficient by to establish bravery with soldier fought on th bravery with will fight if a ardently wish new occasion be given to a long a have only met troop marching camping on road went well soon found mixed with interminable line of car like forming military civil train of moving army

thought free from further trouble soon found out mistake a enormous ammunition car went smack into path a one wheel got entangled with a imperturbable signor carrettiere evidently took delight at fresh opportunity for stoppage inaction indolence sleep soon came to conclusion that italy must not be free when austrian have be driven away for more formidable foe enemy to society comfort to men

from tree to tree instead of being stuck upon pole feel that romantic aspect of place be too beautiful to be encroached upon be peace beauty happiness reveals to that be in italy in gonzaga only few day ago belonged to austrian italian tricolour be out of window a former master retired new advanced when detachment of monferrato lancer entered old castle town joy of inhabitant seemed to be almost bordering on delirium lancer soon left however flag only remains july cialdini began passing po on th crossed at three point ie carbonara carbonarola follonica beginning at three o'clock in morning have finished crossing upon two first pontoon bridge towards midnight on th bridge thrown up at follonica be still intact up to seven in morning on th troop military civil train remained followed po without crossing to stellata in supposed direction of ponte lagoscura yesterday gun be heard here at seven o'clock in morning up to eleven o'clock in direction of legnano towards think adige firing be lively of such nature a to make one surmise battle have be given perhaps austrian have awaited cialdini under legnano have disputed crossing of adige rovigo be abandoned by austrian in night of th th have blown up rovigo boara fortress have destroyed tete de pont on adige burnt bridge may now seek to keep by left side of river up to legnano so a to get under protection of quadrilateral in case if cialdini can cross river in time shock must be almost inevitable must be reason for yesterday firing may also go by rail to padua when must have cialdini between quadrilateral in case if general be quick if be not too quick for according to possible instruction collision be difficult to be avoided baron ricasoli have left florence for camp sort of rumour be afloat a to present state of negotiation a appear unmistakably to exist opinion be think divided in high council of crown country be still anxious to know result of state of affair splendid victory by cialdini might at moment solve many difficulty a be war be prosecuted everywhere except by sea for garibaldi force be slowly advancing in italian tyrol while austrian wait for behind wall of landaro ampola garibaldians advanced post be by latest news near darso news from prussia be still contradictory while italian press be unanimous in asking with country cialdini must advance meet enemy fight rout if possible italy wish be entirely with noale near treviso july from lusia followed general medici division to motta where left not without regret however a better companion must not easily be found so kind be officer jovial men be now encamped around padua will to morrow march on treviso where italian light horse have already arrived if judge so from having left noale on th from right hear that advanced post have proceeded a far a mira on brenta twenty kilometre from venice that first army corp be to concentrate opposite chioggia corp have marched from ferrara straight on to rovigo forward movement of fourth cialdini corp d'armee have left empty of soldier general pianell have still charge of major general cadalini formerly at head of siena brigade replaces in command of former division general pianell have under gallant prince amadeus who have entirely recovered from chest wound of whom brigade of lombardian grenadier be a proud a ever must not wish for more skilled commander better superior officer more valiant soldier thus troop who fought on th june be kept in second line while still fresh division under cialdini march first a fast a can however be of avail italian outpost on piave have not yet crossed for reason that must keep distance with regiment will do so a soon a get nearer to river if be not that be always done in regular warfare must beat country beyond piave for good many mile without even seeing shadow of austrian to simple private who doe not know of diplomatic imbroglio of political consideration sudden retreat mean almost a sudden retracing of step because remembers that manoeuvre preceded attack on solferino on custozza by austrian to officer however mean nothing else than fixed desire not to face italian army more so be to source of disappointment despondency can not bear to think that battle be improbable may be excused if be not in best of humour when on subject be case not only with officer with volunteer who have left home comfort of domestic life not to be paraded at review to be sent against enemy there be hundred of in regular army in cavalry especially aosta lancer regiment of guide be composed of if listen to there ought not to be slightest doubt hesitation a to crossing isongo marching upon vienna may heaven see wish accomplished for unless crushed by sheer force italy be quite decided to carry war into enemy country decision of french government be looked for here with great anxiety not few men be found who predict to be unfavourable to italy still be hard for one to believe that french emperor will carry thing to extremity increase many difficulty europe have already to contend with to day there be rumour at mess table that austrian have abandoned legnano one of four fortress of quadrilateral put much faith in at present be not improbable a may expect many strange thing from vienna government must have be much better for since archduke albert spoke in eulogistic term of king of son of soldier while relating action of th to have treated with italy direct thus securing peace perhaps friendship from men who have ruled so despotically for year over italian subject can not reconcile to idea italy have at last risen to be nation even take slyly opportunity to throw new insult into face can easily see that old spirit be still struggling for empire that old contempt be still trying to make light of italian that old metternich idea be still fondly clung to doe not deserve lesson doe not need sadowa to quiet down for ever yes devolves upon italy to do if so let only cialdini army alone day may be nigh at hand when king may tell country that task have be accomplished talk on present state of political affair on peculiar position of italy be only subject worth notice in letter from camp everything else be at standstill movement of fine army cialdini now disposes of about men be no longer full of interest may perhaps have a regard attack on venice because austrian soldier be still garrisoning will be obliged to fight if be assailed be hoped if such be case that beautiful queen of adriatic will be spared scene of devastation that new haynau will be found to renew deed of brescia vicenza king have not yet arrived seems probable will not come for time until indeed day come for italian troop to make triumphal entry into city of doge heat continues intense explains slowness in advancing a yet sickness have appeared must be hoped that troop will be healthy a sickness try morale much more than dozen custozzas p have finished writing when officer came rushing into inn where be staying told that have just heard that italian patrol have met austrian one on road out of village routed may may not be true be must curious to see how delighted one be at idea that have found 'them at last did not care much about result of engagement a said be reported to have be favourable that cared about be that be close to enemy one can not despair of army be animated with such spirit must
