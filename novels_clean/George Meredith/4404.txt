drew sword from girdle in wrath flourishing karavejis veejravoosh felt might of sword prostrated to ground at foot abarak said 'arise bring swiftly to mountain of outer aklis ' then said beeek passage down yonder brook in moonbeam be sole passage for now ' abarak went with to brook be making watery music to between bank of splintered rock over broad slab of marble bubbling here there about root of large leaved water flower catching mirrored moon of aklis in whirl breaking in lance then waded into water knee deep two genius seized hold of great slab of marble in middle of water under be hollow brimmed with brook that brook partly filled flowed over then genius said to abarak 'plunge said same to shibli bagarag swayer of sword replied a have be simple occasion common matter thing for exercise of civility pleasure willingness thereupon tightened girth arrowing two hand flung up heel disappeared in depth abarak following surely two went diving downward till seemed to there be bottom in depth must not cease to feel rushing of water in ear till time anticipated by mortal bosom of noorna now while thousand spark of fire be bursting on sight of two diver speeded heel uppermost to destiny marked out for by premeditation of wise lo noorna be on mountain in outer aklis with koorookh waiting for appearance of betrothed sword in hand saw beam from blazing eye of aklis knew by redness of one mortal be peering on earth certain of created thing so waited awhile in patience for return of betrothed with head of koorookh in lap caressing bird teaching word of language bird fashioned bill to pronouncing of name such a 'noorna 'feshnavat 'goorelka said 'karaz stuck not at name ' learnt to say even behagpat will be shaved shagpat will be shaved effort of noorna must teach

bird answered imitating best behibberacavarack ' noorna be wroth with cry 'oh naughty bird be name of beloved hateful to thee chid koorookh angrily with heavy eye sulking keeping sullen feather close upon poll now thought 'there be in meaning will fathom ' so counted letter in name of betrothed be thirteen spelt backwards afterwards multiplying by equal number fashioning word from selection of third seventh letter then took leaf from tree bade koorookh fly with to base of mountain sloping from aklis to sea there wrote with pin point on leaf word fashioned dipping leaf in salt ripple by

be heavy sat on cold stone of beach among bright shell weeping in anguish loosing hair scattering wildly exclaiming woe on be ever man more tired than before entering aklis be in turn abased beloved exalted yet weakness clingeth to even in aklis with wondrous sword in grasp ' then thought betill have strength to wield sword for marked flashing of 't be that leaned forward blade to posse quality that bring one gloriously to fruit of enterprise thought surety if abarak be with single of three slave of sword released from tail of garraveen ravejoura karavejis veejravoosh will yet come through may revive in bosom for task ' so thinking upon that sweet crimson surprised cheek arose drew koorookh with along beach till came to rock piled ruggedly wave breaking over mounted stepped across to entrance of cavern where flowed full water swiftly to sea rolling smooth bulk over over with translucent light in showing precious pebble in bed of water below agate of size limpid cornelian plate of polished jet ruby diamond innumerable be smitten into sheen by slant ray of level sun sun just losing circle behind lustrous billow of enchanted sea turned to koorookh moment saying with coax of smile

paradise can turn perdition praise be to that planteth love worker of marvel within now sped in manner narrated through maze of cavern coming suddenly to point at entrance where perched koorookh gravely upon one leg like bird with angling beak caught at a be hurling toward sea drew to bank of rock burden on bosom be shibli bagarag betrothed eye closed whole countenance colourless behind like shadow streamed abarak noorna kneeled by waterside fetched little man from likewise be without change a if drawn from familiar element when have prostrated thrice called on prophet name in form of thanksgiving wrung beard of wet have wit to bless action of noorna saved then two raised shibli bagarag from rock reclined lengthwise under wing of koorookh noorna stretched there beside with one arm about neck fair head of youth on bosom said to abarak 'he hath dreamed many dream betrothed never one so sweet a give already see hue returneth to cheek dimple of pleasure ' so be said beount o thou of net bar stride koorookh across neck for be nigh setting of moon by dawn must be in middle flight seen of men cloud over ' said abarak 'to hear be to obey ' bestrode neck of koorookh sat with

koorookh beeize ' bird slanted beak closed wing two abarak noorna clinging to tightly be down like arrow between shibli bagarag ground spreading beneath like tent noorna caught youth gently to lap then pushed off again intercepting descent once more till be on level with one of mountain of earth from city of shagpat be visible among yellow sand like white spot in yolk of egg so by time eye of youth gave symptom of desire to look upon thing be peeping faintly beneath lash exclaimed joyfully raising white hand above head 'one plunge in lake life will be again below be green lake tinted by dawn with crimson yellow deep with high bank a crossed to middle slipped off youth from koorookh with great plunge be received into stillness of lake meanwhile koorookh quivered wing seized when arose bearing to end of lake where stood one dressed like dervish be vizier feshnavat father of noorna so when saw shouted shout of congratulation catching noorna to breast shibli bagarag stretched a doth heavy sleeper in last doze saying in yawning voice 'what trouble wot there be nought more for now that shagpat be shaved oh have have dream dream be among houri in paradise dreameth not dream like

awoke to reality of thing surely then prostrated repeated article of faith taking one hand of betrothed kissing embraced abarak feshnavat saying to father of noorna know o feshnavat that by folly through weakness have lost time in undertaking will be short work now with shagpat thy daughter eclipser of reason be ever such prize a will deserve wullahy be now new man sprung like fire from ash lo be revived by for great work ' said abarak ' o master of event secure now without delay two slave of sword lean blade toward aklis ' upon that ran up rapidly to summit of mountain drew sword from girdle leaned toward aklis lengthened out over land blade of beam of solid brilliance presently from forth invisible remoteness saw two genius karavejis veejravoosh be footing blade swiftly like star speeding up till be within reach of serpent of hilt when dropped to earth bowing head so commanded to rise cry ye earth confines bring hither tidings of genie karaz ' said 'to hear be to obey ' then began to circle round other circling more more sharply till beyond stretch of sight shibli bagarag said to feshnavat 'be not awake o feshnavat will know where be karaz ere seek to operate on shagpat for be well spoken of poet obstruction first remove ere thou thy cunning prove will encounter karaz be as ere try great shave then said turning quickly 'yonder be light from aklis striking on city mark shagpat even illumined by singled out where sitteth on roof of palace by market place ' so looked be a have spoken that shagpat be singled out in midst of city by wondrous beam of eye of aklis made prominent in effulgence said abarak climbing to level of observation 'he hath redness like inside of halved pomegranate ' feshnavat stroked chin exclaiming 'he may be likened to mountain goat in
