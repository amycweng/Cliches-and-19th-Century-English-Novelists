reconciliation unsatisfied doubt only retarded what must infer from not keeping appointment so ardently desired so solemnly promised that be unable to remove doubt to satisfaction perhaps must not credit reason must assign for breaking engagement perhaps piqued at doing so must not afford opportunity of accounting for apparent mystery of late conduct to retain doubt must be to lose tenderness at last perhaps expel from heart thought of sending ellen to acquaint with occasion of detention at home idea existed for moment appointment concealed from father must not bear to divulge to other person must be breach of duty delicacy thought said to herself will not from thoughtlessness impetuosity lead so many of sex astray overstep bound of propriety to reinstate in esteem of one person lose that of others above that of own heart if lord mortimer refuse to hear justification will act agreeably to candor justice pride must aid in repelling regret look strangely indeed dear said lady

occasioned supposed by disappointed avarice offended pride resolved however to relate heard to marchioness without betraying smallest doubt of veracity may appear strange that lady greystock after taking amanda unsolicited under protection must without cause for enmity seek to injure lady greystock be woman devoid of principle from selfish motif have taken amanda from selfish motif be ready to sacrifice ladyship have enjoyed so much happiness in matrimonial connection that have objection again to enter list of hymen lord cherbury be object at present wish pointed marchioness have hinted in

communication opened so charming prospect of separating lord mortimer from amanda by giving power of injuring character joy exultation deemed requisite for time to conceal considered measure must be more successful for being gradually brought about therefore resolved rather to undermine than directly strike at peace of amanda like lady greystock disbelieved mr jenning tale like ladyship confined disbelief to own bosom in manner appearance of amanda there be innocence mildness denoted something holy dwelt within breast forbade entrance of impure wayward passion besides from gentleman who have resided in devonshire learned distress fitzalan be reduced to by belgrave revenge for virtue of daughter gentleman be now however on continent have fear of allegation against amanda being contradicted

sir charles have informed of intention relative to amanda heart throbbed at mention of name have long endeavored to discover pride love revenge be concerned in accomplishment of design disappointment have only stimulated be one of determined character never relinquish purpose though heaven earth purpose crossed confidence sir charles reposed in joined to warm unsuspicious temper convinced must be credulous enough to believe imputation must cast on amanda therefore lost time in contriving execrable scheme without smallest compunction for destroying reputation of innocent girl injuring happiness of amiable man removed from protection of father believed destined victim must not escape snare must spread for a mean of expediting success under appearance of feeling urged sir charles return to ireland easy credit sir charles gave to vile allegation of belgrave can not be wondered at when long intimacy total ignorance of real character be considered knew belgrave to be gay man never imagined to be hardened libertine besides never must have supposed man must have be so audacious sufficiently base a to make such assertion a belgrave have done against amanda without truth for support error of friend though source of unspeakable anguish to be more pitied than condemned a rather believed proceeded from impetuosity of passion than deliberation of design that be long since sincerely repented of amanda must not be forgotten hold have on heart must not easily be shaken off like recording angel be often tempted to drop tear over fault obliterate forever from memory however be considered mere suggestion of weakness ordered immediate preparation to be made for return to ireland chapter xxviii oh how tyrant doubt torment breast thought like bird who frighted from rest around

circumstance relative to belgrave marchioness have informed of a lady greystock be near amanda when met lord mortimer be unhappy mind have once harbored suspicion will from most trivial circumstance be tempted again to give admission to unpleasing guest be trivial circumstance discomposed too susceptible heart of mortimer sudden illness of amanda extraordinary agitation eagerness to quit room close though silent attendance of belgrave say when recalled to recollection gave air of probability to miss malcolm insinuation that disorder be occasioned by seeing from residing more constantly in england than sir charles bingley have done have have more opportunity of learning belgrave real character knew to be that of professed libertine be strange thought that when amanda informed once resided in devonshire must conceal father being colonel tenant began to think reluctance to clandestine immediate marriage might have proceeded from secret attachment not from strict adherence to filial duty have exalted so much in opinion yet idea be scarcely formed ere endeavored to suppress started a if from uneasy dream wondered how must have conceived other idea injurious to amanda felt degree of remorse at having allowed for moment to be lessened in opinion tenderness purity said to must not be feigned be treasure greater than deserved to posse must like wayward son of error fling away happiness have so long desired to obtain calm resolution produced be transient doubt have be raised doubt must not be banished be inclined to think unjust yet have not power to dispel vainly applied to idea have heretofore be such consolatory resource of comfort to namely that father must consent to union with amanda through interference of aunt felicity must enjoy in union unusual heaviness clung to heart like gloomy sky cast shade of sadness over prospect thoughtful pensive reached home just a sir charles bingley be entering door who informed have just received note from lord cherbury desiring immediate presence lord mortimer attended to earl who acquainted that have received letter from mr fitzalan in expressed warm sense of honor sir charles did family by addressing miss fitzalan that to have united to character so truly estimable must give truest happiness from conviction that hers must be secured by union have written to daughter expressing sentiment continued lord cherbury have therefore doubt sir charles everything will succeed a wish be sorry lord cried sir charles with agitated voice cheek flushed with emotion that ever troubled lordship in affair a have now forever relinquished idea of union with miss fitzalan resolution be really somewhat extraordinary sudden replied earl after conversation so lately passed between adopted however lord from thorough conviction that happiness must never be attained in union with young lady sir charles tenderness for amanda be still undiminished wished to preserve from censure thus proceeded lordship must allow must have little chance of happiness in allying to woman who have resolutely uniformly treated with indifference passion blinded reason when addressed lordship relative to miss fitzalan mist be now dispersed sober reflection obliges to relinquish scheme whose accomplishment must not possibly give satisfaction be certainly best judge of own action sir charles replied earl acting in affair proceeded from wish to serve a well a from friendship for captain fitzalan must suppose conduct will never disparage own honor cast slight upon miss fitzalan that lord may be assured of said sir charles with warmth action motif have hitherto will ever trust bear strictest investigation can not retire without thanking lordship for interest took in favor have thing succeeded a then hoped expected can not deny must have be much happier than be at present then bowed retired lord mortimer have listened with astonishment to sir charles relinquishment of amanda like father thought sudden extraordinary resolution be before jealous of amanda love be now jealous of honor agitation of sir charles seemed to imply even cause more powerful than coldness for resigning recollected that baronet colonel be intimate friend distracted by apprehension rushed out of house overtook sir charles ere have quitted square why bingley cried with affected gayety thought too valiant knight to be easily overcome by despair that without first trying effort to win favor never must give up fair lady have set heart on leave such effort for lordship replied sir charles who have equal patience seriously bingley think sudden resignation of miss fitzalan somewhat strange why last night must have sworn be a much attached to a ever from lord cherbury friendship for captain fitzalan think in degree under protection mine a particularity of attention attracted observation think abruptly withdrawing requires explanation a lord cherbury be person applied to relative to miss fitzalan exclaimed sir charles a be satisfied with motive assigned for conduct be assured lord will never give to word retorted lord mortimer with warmth imply that there be motive for conduct than one avowed what horrid inference may not be drawn from such insinuation oh sir charles reputation be fragile flower slightest breath may injure lord if miss fitzalan reputation be never injured by mean will ever continue unsullied can not indeed resumed lord mortimer style guardian consider friend from feeling of friendship will ever evince interest in welfare resent conduct can possibly render object of censure to being allow to ask lordship one question cried sir charles promise on honor to answer do promise said lord mortimer then lord did ever really wish must succeeded with miss fitzalan lord mortimer colored expect

marriage must not bring to ask question besides upon reflection be convinced must have heard have be case with lord cherbury died hope of restoration of fame in opinion of son yet why asked must regret since thus separated be better perhaps have ceased to esteem a undoubtedly must lessen feeling on account why must part with tudor hall must not conceive except be to humor caprice of lady euphrasia who be probable imagined knew that attachment between lord mortimer have there commenced ah cried amanda never must have relished beauty beauty if lord mortimer think a do must if reviewed only have augmented sorrow sorrow propriety now demand repelling hastened to hall be time there ere must commence employment so much have be agitated landscape be finishing be taken from little valley

be short lived rapture started a if conscious have committed crime when reflected on situation in now stood with woman trembling hand hastened to atone for error by expunging dangerous likeness warm involuntary tear shed at moment aided design oh how unnecessary cried a made sacrifice to delicacy to sketch feature be indelibly engraven on heart a spoke deep long drawn sigh reached ear alarmed confounded at idea of being overheard of course feeling of heart discovered started with precipitation from seat looked round with kind of wild confusion gracious heaven who can describe emotion of soul when original of picture so fondly sketched so hastily obliterated met eye amazed unable to speak to move almost to breathe stood motionless aghast pale statue of surprise a if durst must believe evidence of eye well indeed might have doubted for in pale countenance of lord mortimer scarce vestige of former self except in benignancy of look remained faded complexion disorder of hair mourning habit heightened sad expression of feature expression declared that happiness be never so disunited a at present moment first violence of amanda feeling in little time abated somewhat recovered use of faculty hastily snatching up drawing moved with weak trembling step to door have nearly reached when soft tremulous voice of lord mortimer arrested course go then miss fitzalan cried without one adieu go never more will meet agonizing manner in word be pronounced death like chill upon heart of amanda stopped turned around involuntarily a if to receive last that sad adieu be half reproached for avoiding lord mortimer approached attempted to speak voice be inarticulate gust of sorrow burst from eye hastily covered face with handkerchief walked to window amanda unutterably affected be unable to stand sunk upon chair watched with bursting heart emotion of lord mortimer oh with what difficulty at moment did confine within cold rigid rule of propriety with what difficulty did prevent from flying to lord mortimer from mingling tear with lamenting cruel destiny have disunited forever lord mortimer in few minute be sufficiently recovered again to approach have long wished for opportunity of seeing said have not courage to desire interview how little did imagine morning when like sad exile came to take last farewell of favorite residence must behold fate in granting interview have for once befriended to express horror remorse anguish not only for error combination of event led into concerning for conduct error influenced to adopt will think little lighten heart to receive pardon will be sweet sad consolation yet continued after moment pause why do say will be consolation ala sweetness may lead to accord will only heighten wretchedness at eternal separation here paused amanda be unable to speak word seemed to imply be acquainted with injury have sustained through father mean waited in trembling expectation for explanation of purity of character exclaimed lord mortimer be at length fully revealed to good heaven under what afflicting circumstance by being to whom so generously made sacrifice of what then might have considered happiness did lord cherbury then said amanda with inexpressible eagerness did then at last justify yes cried lord mortimer proved be indeed most excellent most injured of human being that be fond heart have once believed to be oh be dreadful emotion of heart to know justification came too late to restore peace once there be happy period when after similar error being removed have hoped by life forever devoted to to have made reparation atonement for involuntary injustice ala reparation atonement can now be made amanda wept raised streaming eye to heaven again cast to earth weep cried lord mortimer in tone expressive of surprise after surveying minute in silence love amanda continued suddenly seizing hand while surveyed with most rapturous fondness crimson glow mantling cheek beam of wonted brilliancy darting from eye what be to imagine from tear be then indeed unaltered amanda started feared emotion betrayed have convinced lord mortimer of continuance unabated strength of affection felt shocked at imprudence have alone be convinced tempted lord mortimer to address in such manner know not lord cried in what sense ask whether be unchanged of be assured total alteration must have taken place in sentiment if must remain moment longer with person who seems at once forgetful of what be due to own situation mine go then madam exclaimed lord mortimer in accent of displeasure pardon having thus detained pardon involuntary offence excuse having disturbed retirement obtruded sorrow on amanda have now reached door heart recoiled at idea of parting in such manner from lord mortimer prudence bade hasten a fast a possible from yet slow lingering pursued way ere have gone many yard be overtaken by lord mortimer pride be inferior to tenderness drove to despair at idea of parting in displeasure from oh amanda cried seizing hand almost breathless with emotion add not by anger to bitterness of sad hour since must part oh let part in amity a friend that regard other have not yet if indeed be possible for to do so pronounced forgiveness of persecution underwent on account have not granted pardon for harshness cruelty with dreadful error tempted to treat oh lord said amanda again yielding to softness of soul while tear trickled down cheek why torture by speaking in manner how can pronounce forgiveness when never be offended when wretched deserted appeared to stand upon great theatre of life without one hand to offer assistance ready friendship came to relief poured balm of comfort over sorrow of heart when deprived by deceit cruelty of good opinion even then attention solicitude pursued wandering footstep strove to make path of comfort for to take be obligation that never can be forgotten demand that posse eternal gratitude warmer expression rose to lip be again buried in heart sighed after pause of minute thus went on for happiness warmest purest prayer be daily offered up oh may yet be equal to virtue greater can not wish lord mortimer groaned in excruciating agony of soul oh amanda said where where can receive consolation for loss never never in world took hand within raised to heaven a if supplicating choicest blessing on head for happiness pray ah love how unavailing be prayer amanda now saw more than ever necessity of hastening away gently withdrew hand hurried on a fast a trembling limb must carry still lord mortimer attended yet amanda cried little moment tell continued again seizing hand shade remind of departed hour oh what blissful one have not passed beneath foliage that foliage will never more behold expanding to breath of spring amanda trembled involuntary sad declaration of loss of seat so valued by overpowered respiration grew faint must not support herself made motion to sit down upon grass lord mortimer eagerly caught to bosom have not strength to resist effort head reclined upon shoulder who can speak feeling a felt beating heart of mortimer from violent palpitation seemed a if must burst bosom to find passage to foot in few minute be little recovered sensible of impropriety of situation be now resolutely determined to quit lord mortimer must part lord cried disengaging from arm notwithstanding gentle effort made to retain must part lord repeated part forever tell then exclaimed still impeding course tell whether may hope to live in remembrance whether may hope not to be obliterated from memory by happiness will shortly surround
