now when thought over inwardly shrunk from disagreeable investigation that involved if have not promised mr rushmere to follow advice path must have be to sea port town about two mile distant not over heath to west of hadstone be however of use drawing back now with heavy heart commenced journey a proceeded up lane paused at stile where gilbert have held last conversation fully expected to meet there lingered for minute under shade of ash tree looked anxiously up down road wondering how must let leave farm without intercepting to say last good bye poor dorothy how bitterly repented having sacrificed so much out of foolish sense of gratitude to father ought not gilbert happiness reasoned with to have be dearer to than world beside must heavier punishment have fallen upon by yielding to request to become wife than be now called upon to endure old man must only have turned out of door for disobeying have done that left friendless in world without gilbert love to console gilbert arm to
