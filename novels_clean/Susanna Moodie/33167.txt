heart a headland after headland flew past revealing at point fresh combination of grandeur beauty flora clapped hand together in sort of ecstasy lyndsay be standing silently beside watching with air of melancholy interest scene excited in such intense enthusiasm flora do see that old fashioned mansion crown green amphitheatre surrounded by lofty hill in front of be lovely romantic place with giant hill look like old man in highland bonnet towering above away there in back ground be old man of hoy old house be m where be born brought up drew deep sigh turning face from wife continued to gaze with earnest longing shade of night drew veil over stern landscape moon rose up bathing rock crag mountain height with flood of silver glory adding ghostlike awful sublimity to scene lyndsay still leant upon vessel side watching with same intense expression black outline of receding coast in uncertain light presented aspect of rugged frowning desolation captain expected to put into kirkwall at place have be requested by owner to take in supply of fresh provision water for voyage water cask having be filled with execrable water o ' leith under ostensible reason of keeping from leaking until must obtain better supply wind tide being in favour enabling to make rapid run through firth thought best to keep straight on in end by leaving vessel short of provision water proved short sighted policy while greatly disappointed flora whom lyndsay have promised to introduce to of friend give nearer view of romantic island seen from water have excited curiosity to utmost anne spread white wing to catch fresh breeze be piping hoarse song among shroud sped far upon westward way leaving mr lyndsay to upbraid captain with having cheated hope now must never be realized boreas

then very deaf got enough of can tell be rightly served said flora expect will afford amusement during voyage captain where did procure cod fish never tasted anything so delicious in fish way in life ah thought 'd find that treat fish be alive under blue water of firth hour ago talk of fine flavour of newfoundland cod be not comparable to fish caught in rapid water flora be on deck by sunrise next morning sky be still cloudless breeze have freshened sea be coveted with short rolling billow recalled to mind beautiful line in ossian where old bard compare white crested short wave to flock of sheep coming tumbling over one from hill in place term wind move shepherdess of sea driving flock on shore tall dark man be at wheel bore very appropriate name of bob motion whether real assumed must be hard to say called short chopping sea white mouse being out flora found easy matter to keep foot on deck while vessel be going sideways through water hung on to bulwark be rewarded by sight of wild sutherland coast on left brown heath covered hill fantastic rock conjuring up form of norna of fitful head of wild shore that northern wind knew very few of emigrant have ventured out of steerage being down with sea sickness flora never suffered once from distressing malady during voyage morning in particular felt well in high spirit sense of glorious freedom in thus bounding over free glad

mountain range extends on north of st lawrence from gulf to quebec though present variety of savage scenery can not compete with lonely sterile grandeur mark dashing of ocean wave into highland loch long bright summer day wore to close before moon looked down upon heath clad hill lighthouse on cape wrath have diminished to star amid wave coast of scotland looked like dim wreath of blue smoke upon verge of horizon little island of barra rona dimly distinguished above wave be last of british isle met flora anxious glance when faded into immensity of ocean be lost to sight vessel fairly stood to
