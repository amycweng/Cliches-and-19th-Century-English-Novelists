unfortunate fancying still under control of robert moncton resident beneath roof raved continually of wrong exhausted by threat of vengeance long before crisis of fever have passed george have gathered from impotent raving story of injury after fluctuating long time between life death youth naturally strong constitution conquered malady once more thought felt like rational creature indignation against uncle cousin subsided into sullen implacable hatred to overcome tried even prayed in vain ashamed of harbouring sinful passion yet wanted moral courage christian forbearance to overcome what reason conscience united to condemn degraded in own estimation longed yet dreaded to confide to harrison that man attended with such devotion be capable of such base degeneracy of entertaining sentiment only worthy of robert moncton son violence of disorder have reduced to such state of weakness imagined at point of death when be actually out of danger nervous system be so greatly affected that yielded to most childish fear contemplated dying with indescribable horror harrison who be unacquainted with state of mind attributed feeling to reaction produced by fever thinking that state of quiescence be necessary for recovery seldom spoke to at time when with tenderness almost feminine gave food medicine arranged pillow made affectionate inquiry about bodily state often pretended to be asleep while mind be actively employed in conjuring up host of ghastly phantom prevented recovery be effectually undermining reason one afternoon a lay in sort of dreamy state

taking hand in forgive enemy forgive wretch who have brought to state by cruel conduct placed life reason in jeopardy can not do though merciful who dying forgave enemy command to do so geoffrey said harrison soothingly can never recover health feel happy till can accomplish great moral victory over sin self can not do responded turning from burying face in bed clothes while hardened heart against conviction no not if perish for refusing feel a if be already with condemned wonder returned harrison sternly hatred concomitant passion revenge be feeling worthy of damned beseech geoffrey by dying prayer of blessed saviour whom profess to believe try to rise superior to soul debasing passion not only forgive learn to pity author of suffering have done best have even prayed to do so not in right spirit prayer must have be heard accepted what make dread death speak truth out boldly doe not hatred to uncle cousin stand between heaven confess harrison must forgive not under same provocation have done so under worse god in heaven how be that possible be true wo believe said turning angrily upon pillow be not in human nature few can rise above weakness of kind listen to geoffrey said harrison seating on side of bed wished very much at one time to learn from story of past life did not think prudent at time while under robert moncton roof to gratify curiosity will do so now in hope of beguiling out of present morbid state of feeling while may answer purpose of teaching good moral lesson trust will not easily forget man happiness depends in great measure on sympathy of others suffering by same rule be greatly alleviated when contrasted with misery of neighbour particularly if sorrow happen to exceed own much of history must remain in shade because time alone can unravel mystery by be surrounded many important passage in life prudence force to conceal dear fellow if trial suffering will in way reconcile to lot enable to bear with fortitude own friend will not have suffered sinned in vain george adjusted pillow gave medicine stirred fire to cheerful blaze commenced narrative that for so many month have so ardently longed to hear harrison story perhaps geoffrey be not aware that grandfather left sir robert moncton father of present baronet guardian trustee to two son until arrived at majority edward at time of death being eighteen year of age robert year half younger what tempted geoffrey moncton to leave son to guardianship of aristocratic father from whom have parted in anger many year before one must tell baronet be very old man be much respected
