sight of suffering of woman who possessed such power to move weaken must be untrue to holy office must let secret have to keep escape like timid vacillating temper sought refuge in procrastination unconscious of growth of public feeling against wrapped in absorption come from one dominant idea pursued routine of parochial life went through ceremonial of office hardly more conscious of what did

have for time lulled in 'of course be liar hypocrite thought savagely 'perhaps be murderer a well ' knew that idea be kind of madness don gesualdo have never be known to hurt fly indeed aversion to even see pain inflicted have made often laughing stock of child of marca when have rescued bird locust frog from tormenting finger forbade to throw stone at lamb kid drove to pasture 'they be not baptised ' child have often said with grin gesualdo have often answered 'the good god baptised ' be utter madness to suppose that man tender a woman timid a sheep gentle a spaniel must possibly have stabbed tasso tassilo to death within few rood of own church almost on holy ground yet idea grew grew in mind of generosa lover until acquired force of actual conviction welcome supposition so eagerly a do one accord with intensifies own prejudice neglected duty occupation to brood over one suspicion put together trifle must remember in confirmation of haunted wherever be at wine fair at horse

of time of school prejudice made ready to believe that priest be always fit food for galley scaffold mass of concealed iniquity covered by cloth ' believe know more than anyone ' said roughly one day when passed vicar on narrow field path while eye flashed suspiciously over downcast face of don gesualdo who shrank little a if have received blow be silent have spoken on unconsidered impulse must have be unable to say what own meaning really be a saw embarrassment observed silence of companion what have uttered at hazard seemed to curiously confirmed strengthened 'if know anything must save speak ' said passionately beay devil believe in torture through eternity don gesualdo still kept silent made sign of cross nervously went on way priest said young man bitterly looking after 'if one

own suspicion be truth only lacked time testimony to become a clear to eye a be to iv meantime don gesualdo be striving with utmost force be in to persuade real criminal to confess publicly what have told under seal of confession saw man secretly used argument with doctrine of church own intense desire must supply there be obstinacy so dogged egotism so impenetrable shield against persuasion so

in refusal to surrender to justice might a well have spoken to great millstone rest in river water why then have wretch cast burden of vile secret on innocent shoulder be most poignant anguish to that must awaken sense of guilt in conscience of criminal man have come to partly from vague superstitious impulse remnant of credulity instilled into in childhood partly from want to unburden mind to tell

bitterly incensed that have done deed for nothing beyond have other emotion except that be glad that generosa must suffer through for 'you will burn for ever if persist in such hideous wickedness ' said don gesualdo again again to ' will take chance of ' said man 'hell be far off galley be near 'but if believe in power to absolve leave accursed why did ever confess to ' cried don gesualdo 'because one must clear one breast to somebody when one have thing like on one mind ' answered carter know can not tell of again ' from position nothing moved entreaty threat argument denunciation

guilt with ruffian gone across sea lost in utter darkness swallow up life of poor obscure when once have left hamlet in name mean something to neighbour one hope be quenched vicar in agony reproached with not having prevailed in struggle for wretch soul with not having be eloquent enough wise enough stern enough to awe into declaration of ghastly secret to law failure seemed to sign of heaven
