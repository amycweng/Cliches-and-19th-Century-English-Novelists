a chasseurs indiens approach abattis at double quick when lord rosediamond died last year left a probably be aware daughter in sole care be great responsibility very great feel of course that will have to answer to for discharge of lady marabout did say whether rosediamond be accustomed to visit per medium hear account of stewardship nightly through table claw must suppose that be cheveley bowed again did inquire not being spiritually interested why wo answer thought lady marabout have not be blind to very marked attention to dear cecil think must be aware mr cheveley be on subject indeed that wished to speak to understand said cheveley a paused with faint smile half sad half proud that perplexed lady marabout be about to insinuate to gently that attention have be exceedingly distasteful to exceedingly unacceptable in must remind that lady cecil ormsby be beauty heiress that be fortune hunter whose design be seen through motif found out must hint to that intercourse must
