ferocious cruel instinct a arose in now don silverio seemed to tame lukewarm before monstrous conspiracy of stranger knew that priest must not give way to anger yet seemed to that even priest must be roused to fury here there be wrath be holy when be clothed stood looked down again at gliding stream feeble cracked voice called to from opposite bank adone lad what be tale speaker be old man of eighty odd year native of ruscino one patrizio cambi who be not yet too feeble to cut rush osier maintained widowed daughter young child by mean what tale said adone unwilling to be roused from own

innocent enough to believe that must suffice to prove that loss must be ruin to obtain redress at once whilst don silverio be still hesitating a to what seemed to momentous painful journey to rome mind be made up by second letter received from superior of certosa at san beda friend to whom have confided task of inquiring a to project for edera letter be long in latin be two classic who liked thus to refresh other with epistle such a st augustine tertullian might have penned letter be of elegant scholarship content be unwelcome said that most honourable syndic of san beda have enjoyed conference with prefect of province have therein transpired that project for work upon river edera have be long well known to prefect that such project be approved by existing government therefore by government official a be natural be not admitted that commune of san beda have local interest local right sufficiently strong to oppose project a such claim must amount to monopoly monopoly must exist in district through running river partially passed barely one fifth of course of stream lay through district known a valley of edera entire circondario except valley be believed to be in favour of project prefect informed syndic must not be otherwise than most favourable to general interest of country at large therefore most honoured revered friend wrote superior of cistercian most esteemed worship doe not see way to suggest opposition to course in town council in provincial council most worshipful assessor see theirs being a know equivocal onerous thing for council to express suggest in assembly view antagonistic to of prefecture so fear most honoured reverend friend will not be in power farther to press matter fear also that parish of ruscino being isolated sparsely populated chief area uncultivated will be possessed of one small voice in matter interest of greater number being always in such case preferred don silverio read letter twice stately correct latinity not serving to
