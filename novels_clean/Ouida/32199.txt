through function never knew be dead of night when still dressed unable even to think calmly clasping crucifix in hand pacing to fro narrow chamber with restless uneven step heard name called by voice of man in great agitation looking out of casement saw falko melegari on gray horse be covered with foam sweating a from hard gallop be true cried score of time yes be true said gesualdo voice be stern cold must not tell what share man might not have have in crime be innocent a bird in air screamed lover pointing to scops owl be sailing above cypress gesualdo bowed head spread out hand palm downward in gesture meant hopeless doubt went away at dark into town to buy cattle said steward with sob in throat rode out by opposite road knew naught of oh god why be not here must not have taken without costing hard must have done good said gesualdo coldly have done harm enough already added after pause falko did not resent word tear be falling like rain down cheek hand be clinched on saddle bow horse stretched foam flecked neck unheeded who did who must do have many enemy be hard man muttered gesualdo gave gesture of hopeless doubt ignorance looked down on lover handsome face head in moonlight there be strange expression in own eye curse for cold hearted priest thought young steward with bitterness then wheeled horse sharply round without other word rode off towards home in glistening white light to stable weary horse to saddle to ride into larger village of sant ' arturo be past midnight must do good must see one be relief to to be in movement felt that must choke to sit sup sleep smoke a usual in quiet house among magnolia myrtle whilst love of life lay alone in misery gladness must at natural death of tasso tassilo have filled soul be quenched in darkness of horror in fate be snatched from plunged into mystery blackness of imputed crime never actually suspected for moment knew that others must doubt do more than suspect perhaps brute killed thought that blame of crime might lie on part from then knew that thought be absurd tasso tassilo have loved life loved mill money petty power possession of beautiful wife besides what man must stab from behind between shoulder be just blow that strong yet timid woman must give a walked to fro on old terrace whilst saddled horse felt sickening shudder run through did not suspect not for instant yet there be dim unutterable horror upon veiled remembered beauty of face passing of day came after feast of two apostle be full of unspeakable horror to in brief space of grew haggard hollow cheeked almost aged despite youth dread formality tyranny of law seized on quiet village tortured soul in one who have seen heard known aught of dead man be questioned tormented harangued examined suspected don gesualdo be made subject to searching oft repeated interrogation severely reproved that have not let body lie untouched until arrival of officer of justice told exact truth a far a knew when questioned a to relation of murdered man wife hesitated prevaricated contradicted gave impression to judicial authority that knew much more against wife than must say what tried to do be to convey to others own

receiving confession of carter did not dare to seek interview with generosa did not dare to look on agonized eye feel that knew what must set free yet must never tell trembled lest in sight of suffering of woman who possessed such power to move weaken must be untrue to holy office must let secret have to keep escape like timid vacillating temper sought refuge in procrastination unconscious of growth of public feeling against wrapped in absorption come from one dominant idea pursued routine of parochial life went through ceremonial of office hardly more conscious of what did than candle

passage in emigrant ship then loading there green canebrake peaceful millet field of marca saw no more have left burden of blood guiltiness behind lay on guiltless soul with weight of world so long a man have remained in marca there have be always hope present with gesualdo that must persuade to confess in court of justice what have confessed to church that sequence of accident must lead up to discovery of guilt with ruffian gone across sea lost in utter darkness swallow up life of poor obscure when once have left hamlet in name mean something to neighbor one hope be quenched gesualdo in
