brother sank down on mound of freshly flung earth sinking head upon arm with low moan time have not changed greatly have merely made more intensely desirous of pleasure power of life more intensely abhorrent of pain of censure of contempt of world a to escape in boyhood have stooped to degradation so to escape in manhood be capable of descending to falsehood weakness be one of nature having love of evil for evil sake still embrace form of evil may save from penalty of own weakness now thus meeting one who for twelve year have believed must rise from tomb to reproach to accuse unstrung nerve left with only one consciousness desire at cost to be saved cecil eye rested on with strange melancholy pity have loved brother a youth loved well enough to take bear heavy burden of disgrace in stead old love be not dead stronger than be hatred of shame have touched race by wretched crime have driven into exile wondering scorn for feeble engrossed character have lived contentedly under false color with hidden blot screened by fictitious semblance of honor must not linger with did not know how to support intolerable pain oppressed in presence of only living creature of race must not answer for

across sky doubting whether voice have head face upon have looked be not vision of waking dream chapter xxxii venetia how night be spent cecil must never recall in full vague memory remained with of wandering over shadowy country of seeking by bodily fatigue to kill thought rising in of drinking at little water channel in rock a thirstily a driven deer of flinging down at length worn out to sleep under hanging brow of mighty wall of rock of waking when dawn be reddening east with brown plain around far away under knot of palm be goatherd with flock like idyl from old pastoral life of syria stood looking at light heralded sun with indefinite sense of heavy loss of fresh calamity upon be only slowly that remembered year seemed to have be pressed into three night day since have sat by bivouac fire listening to fiery word of little friend of flag full consciousness of that have surrendered in yielding up afresh heritage rolled in on memory like wave of heavy sea sweep down before when tear blotted miserable letter have reached in green alley of stephanien confessed to that brother have relied on personal likeness between similarity of handwriting to pas off a bill in own name that of friend be forged thought have crossed to take upon lad sin have only be when brought under charge must to clear have at once accused boy have betrayed woman whose reputation be in keeping that rather by generous impulse than by studied intention have taken up burden that have now carried for so long whether money lender have be in reality deceived must never tell have be certain that having avowed confident of guilt must never shift charge on to brother in face of own acceptance of so have saved youth without premeditation reckoning of cost now that full cost be known to have not shrunk back from payment yet payment be one gave greater anguish than if have laid down life in physical martyrdom to go back to old luxury ease careless peace to go back to old fresh fair english woodland to go back to power of command delight of free gift to go back to men honor reverence high esteem must have be sweet enough sweet a food after long famine far more than must have be to go back take hand of friend once more in old unclouded trust of youth to go back stand free blameless among peer know that man must do to win heart soul of woman must at will do to win hers whose mere glance of careless pity have sufficed to light life to passion have renounced be cost have paid paid because simple natural inflexible law of justice have demanded one whom have once chosen to save must not now
