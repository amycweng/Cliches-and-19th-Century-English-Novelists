have found pilgrimage so fair when if have needed help have only have to kneel clasp firm mailed limb strong cross hilted sword in name of christ of poor theodoric seemed to look down on with benignant eye from under raised visor poor findelkind weeping threw small arm closer closer around bronze knee of heroic figure sobbed aloud help help oh turn heart of people to help to do good theodoric answered nothing there be sound in dark hushed church gloom grew darker over findelkind eye mighty form of monarch of hero grew dim before sight lost consciousness fell prone upon stone at theodoric foot for have fainted from hunger emotion when awoke be quite evening there be lantern held over head voice be muttering curiously angrily bending over be two priest sacristan of church own

must rove afield to find poverty to help when sits cold enough lord know at own hearth oh little as little dolt little maniac fit only for madhouse talking to iron figure taking for real men what have done o heaven must be afflicted thus poor man wept being good affectionate soul not very wise believing that boy be mad then seized with sudden rage once more at thought of day wasted hour harassed miserable through searching for lost child plucked up light slight figure of findelkind in own arm with muttered thanks excuse to sacristan of church bore boy out with into evening air lifted into cart stood there with horse harnessed to one side of pole a country people love to do to risk of own life neighbour findelkind said never word be a dumb a theodoric have be to felt stupid heavy half blind father pushed bread ate by sheer instinct a lost animal will do cart jogged on star shone great church vanished in gloom of night a went through city toward riverside along homeward way never word did father who be silent man at time address to only once a jogged over bridge spoke son asked did run away truly thinking to please god help poor truly did answered findelkind with sob in throat then thou wert as said father didst never think of thy mother love of toil look at home findelkind be mute drive be very long backward by same way with river shining in moonlight mountain half covered with cloud be ten by bell of zirl when came once more under solemn shadow of grave martinswand there be light moving about house brother sister be still up mother ran out into road weeping laughing with fear joy findelkind said nothing hung head be too fond of to scold to jeer at made go quickly to bed mother made warm milk posset kissed will punish thee tomorrow naughty cruel one said parent thou art punished enough already for in thy place little stefan have sheep have lost katte beautiful twin lamb dare not tell thy father tonight dost hear poor thing mourn go afield for thy duty again pang went through heart of findelkind a if knife have pierced loved katte better than almost other living thing be bleating under window childless alone be such beautiful lamb too lamb that father have promised must never be killed be reared to swell flock findelkind cowered down in bed felt wretched beyond wretchedness have be brought back wallet be empty katte lamb be lost must not sleep pulse be beating like so many steam hammer felt a if body be one great throbbing heart brother who lay in same chamber with be sound asleep very soon father mother snored also on other side of wall findelkind be alone wide awake watching big white moon sail past little casement hearing katte bleat where be poor twin lamb night be bitterly cold for be already far on in autumn river have swollen flooded many field snow for last week have fallen quite low down on mountainside even if still living little lamb must die out on night without mother food shelter of sort findelkind whose vivid brain always saw everything that imagined a if be being acted before eye in fancy saw two dear lamb floating dead down swollen tide entangled in rush on flooded shore fallen with broken limb upon crest of rock saw so plainly that scarcely must hold back breath from screaming aloud in still night answering mourning wail of desolate mother at last must bear no longer head burned brain seemed whirling round at bound leaped out of bed quite noiselessly slid into sheepskin stole out a have done night before hardly knowing what did poor katte be mourning in wooden shed with other sheep wail of sorrow sounded sadly across loud roar of rushing river moon be still high above against sky black awful with cloud floating over summit be great martinswand findelkind time called big dog waldmar to with dog beside went once more out into cold gloom whilst father mother brother sister wore sleeping poor childless katte alone be awake looked up at mountain then across water swept meadow to river be in doubt way to take then thought that in likelihood lamb must have be seen if have wandered river way even little stefan must have have too much sense to let go there so crossed road began to climb martinswand with instinct of born mountaineer have brought out crampon with have now fastened on foot knew part ridge of mountain have more than once climbed over to very spot where kaiser max have hung in peril of life on second thought bade waldmar go back to house dog be clever mountaineer too findelkind did not wish to lead into danger have done wrong will bear brunt said to for felt a if have killed katte child weight of sin be like lead on heart must not kill good waldmar too little lantern did not show much light a went higher upwards lost sight of moon cold be nothing to because clear still air be that in have be reared darkness did not mind because be used to also weight of sorrow upon scarcely knew how to bear how to find two tiny lamb in vast waste of silence shadow must have puzzled wearied older mind than garibaldi household old soldier tried true sought night once upon caprera in such quest in vain if must only have awakened brother stefan to ask way have gone then to be sure remembered stefan must have told that to who have be looking for lamb from sunset to nightfall alone began ascent time again in glad spring time fresh summer weather have driven flock upwards to eat grass grew in cleft of rock on broad green alp sheep must not climb to highest point goat did with time again have lain on back in uppermost height with lower cloud behind black wing of bird crow almost touching forehead a lay gazing up into blue depth of sky dreaming dreaming dreaming must never dream more now thought to dream have cost katte lamb world of dead findelkind be gone for ever gone be hero knight gone faith force gone one who cared for dear christ poor in pain bell of zirl be ringing midnight findelkind heard wondered that only two hour have gone by since mother have kissed in bed seemed to a if long long night have rolled away have lived hundred year did not feel fear of dark calm night lit now then by silvery gleam of moon star mountain be old familiar friend way of have more terror for than hill here used to have for bold heart of kaiser max indeed thought of be katte katte lamb knew way that sheep track ran sheep must not climb so high a goat knew too that little stefan must not climb so high a so began search low down upon martinswand after midnight cold increased there be snow cloud hanging near opened over head soft snow came flying along for did not mind ala for lamb if covered how must find if slept in be dead be bleak bare on mountain side though there be still patch of grass such a flock liked that have grown since hay be cut frost of night made stone slippery even iron gripped with difficulty there be strong wind rising like giant breath blowing small horn lantern to fro now then quaked little with fear not fear of night mountain of strange spirit dwarf goblin of ill repute said to haunt martinswand after old woman have told of such thing though priest always said that be only foolish tale there being nothing on god earth wicked save men woman who have not clean heart hand findelkind believed priest still alone on side of mountain with snowflake flying around felt nervous thrill made tremble almost turn backward almost not quite for thought of katte poor little lamb lost perhaps dead through fault path went zigzag be very steep arolla pine swayed bough in face stone lay in path unseen in gloom made stumble now then large bird of night flew by with rushing sound air grew so cold that martinswand might have be turning to one huge glacier at once heard through stillness for there be nothing so still a mountainside in little pitiful bleat terror vanished memory of ghost tale passed away heart gave leap of joy be sure be cry of lamb stopped to listen more surely be now many score of foot above level of home of zirl be a nearly a must judge half way a high a where cross in cavern mark spot of kaiser peril little bleat sounded above very feeble faint findelkind set lantern down braced up by drawing tighter old leathern girdle set sheepskin cap firm on forehead went toward sound a far a must judge that might be be out of wood now there be only few straggling pine rooted here there in mass of loose lying rock slate so much must tell by light of lantern lamb by bleating seemed still above doe not perhaps seem very hard labour to hunt about by dusky light upon desolate mountainside when snow be falling fast when light be only small circle wavering yellowish on white when around be wilderness of loose stone yawning cleft when air be ice hour be past midnight task be not light one for man findelkind be child like findelkind be in heaven long very long be search grew hot forgot fear except spasm of terror lest light must burn low die out bleating have quite ceased now there be not even sigh to guide knew that near lamb must be did not waver despair did not pray praying in morning have be no use trusted in god laboured hard toiling to fro seeking in nook behind stone straining muscle nerve till sweat rolled in briny dew off forehead curl dripped with wet at last with scream of joy touched soft close wool that gleamed white a white snow knelt down on ground peered behind stone by full light of lantern there lay little lamb two little brother twin brother huddled close together asleep asleep be sure be asleep for be so silent still bowed over kissed laughed cried kissed again then sudden horror smote be so very still there lay cuddled close one on one little white head on little white body drawn closer than ever together to try get warm called to touched then caught up in arm kissed again again again ala be frozen dead never again must leap in long green grass frisk with other lie happy by katte side have died calling for mother in long cold cruel night only death have answered findelkind did not weep scream tremble heart seemed frozen like dead lamb be who have killed rose up gathered in arm cuddled in skirt of sheepskin tunic cast staff away that might carry so with weight set face to snow wind once more began downward way once great sob shook be now have fear night might have be noonday snow storm might have be summer for aught that knew cared long weary be way often stumbled have to rest often terrible sleep of snow lay heavy on eyelid longed to lie down be at rest a little brother be often seemed to that must never reach home again shook lethargy off resisted longing held on way knew that mother must mourn for a katte mourned for lamb at length through difficulty danger when light have spent strength have well nigh spent too foot touched old highroad there be flickering torch many people loud cry around church a there have be four hundred year before when last sacrament have be said in valley for hunter king in peril above mother being sleepless anxious have risen long before be dawn have gone to child chamber have found bed of findelkind empty once more came into midst of people with two little lamb in arm heeded outcry of
