have never looked on whose breast have never fed face changed did not speak gasped for breath lay silent eye trembled confused might be that in moment remorse be with vain regret of cruel year might be that dying thus knew that from hearth a from hell mother child have be driven whilst lip have talked of god little bell rang softly in orchard below casement clear voice of young boy singing canticle crossed voice of linnet there be gleam of silver in sun church bore host to dying man turned from chamber eye of one unsanctified might not gaze upon mystery of blest went out without resistance be oppressed stupefied went to stair there sat down again resting forehead on hand door of chamber be little open must hear murmur of priest word smell odor of sacred chrism great
