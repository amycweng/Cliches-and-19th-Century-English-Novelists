round on tip of toe under chandelier humming air of dream face very softly to so absorbed be in occupation did not notice entrance of person till suddenly voice sounded quite close to ear well be good floor stopped blushing deeply there before stood andrea looking very nice in evening clothes not very good quite fair answered recovering self possession before complete coolness smiled quietly guess be person of experience in such matter miss meredith have be to many ball be fond of dancing at home said andrea interrogatively sister brother have brother friend yes friend must not help laughing then thinking that looked rather offended added by way of general conversation how beautiful room look seems quite desecration to dance in looked round up down yes suppose be elegant think very gloomy again found smiling there be something so absurd in mixture of soft sweet italian tone very pronounced american accent not to speak of occasional flower of american idiom time however andrea did not appear offended smiled back at most charmingly then turned to greet mother who two girl in wake came sweeping across room in violet velvet diamond be down early miss meredith said to without moving muscle of face making feel that have committed breach of propriety in venturing alone downstairs look so nice cried bianca who in blue striped silk high tortoiseshell comb have made very worst of costanza shrugging shoulder turned rustled across room be surprised to see how handsome looked with gown of richest brocade made with long train elizabethan collar with ruby gleaming in dark hair in

throng be not success there be point of agreement in practice of waltzing after few turn subsided on to one of damask sofa exchanging commonplace watching dancer whose rapid twist bounding action filled heart with despair will never be able to dance like reflected be by mean ungraceful performance leapt high be true in vulgar fashion of mere jumping rather rose into air with something of ease elasticity of indiarubber ball maintaining throughout appearance of great seriousness dignity at end of dance partner bowed away withdrew rather forlornly to corner hoping to escape unnoticed here however romeo again espied led up to rather despondent young gentleman student at university of pisa afterwards learned whom have observed nursing tall silk hat in solitude throughout previous dance explained earnestly must not dance italian fashion preferred indeed to be spectator settled down into corner with philosophy dare say andrea can waltz way thought looking down at programme where initial ab stood out clearly on two of gilt line be rather disappointing to have to sit still look on while other people dance to delightful music be amusing enough in way must keep eye open remember thing to tell girl annoyed confess little to meet costanza glance of contemptuous pity a whirled by with tall officer mean spirited desire came over to explain to be sitting out from choice not from necessity flood of dancer rushed on many coloured ephemera on old dim wall looked down so gravely still sat there patiently enough though eye be beginning to ache brain to whirl annunziata apple green skirt bianca blue white stripe contessima brocade ruby be growing familiar to weariness so often did flash before sight be with genuine relief welcomed romeo who came up to claim fifth dance lancer

life can not happen often even in happiest career one of little bit of perfection start up now then to astonish plant of such delicate growth that only by unforeseen succession of accident be ever brought to birth with what ease partner skimmed about crowded hall how skilfully steered among bounding complex be ever such music heard out of heaven be ever such kind comfortable reassuring presence a of andrea moment ago have be bored wistful tired now have nothing left to wish for well said a music coming to end paused for first time be not so bad for italian be be so happy that must only smile partner apparently not disconcerted by stupidity led into inner room installed in chair seated in opposite at same moment romeo came sauntering up to throwing remark in rapid italian to brother latter with slight frown rose reluctantly two men went over to doorway where stood talking fell to observing with considerable interest handsome dark eyed gentleman with grace air of breeding who be at same time so curiously alike so curiously different in same simplicity ease be felt to cover certain inscrutability frankness considerable depth of reserve in be seen person to be thwarted with impunity whereas in romeo case quiet manner be unmistakable mark of genuine indolence indifference in andrea only served to bring out more clearly keen vitality alertness purpose with whole personality be instinct have not much time for observation in course of few minute annunziata rustled smilingly past threw green skirt into chair just vacated by brother in law latter shot quick glance at shrugged shoulder slightly resumed conversation with romeo made attempt to rejoin a for little cup of pleasure be dashed to ground annunziata fanning talking volubly made poor substitute for andrea began to be dimly aware of certain hostility towards in atmosphere next dance be played next still annunziata sat there smiling two gentleman have long disappeared into ball room have smaller apartment to ca
