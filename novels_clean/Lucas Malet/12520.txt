piece of furniture beside whereupon in pensive rain washed mid day light served to heighten rather than mitigate prevailing very unattractive rather stuffy disorder obtaining in room theresa bilson not without choking lamentation gave forth story of to herself quite spectacular deposition from command of hard household have sufficiently recovered normal attitude by time to pose to herself now a heroine of one of charlotte bronte novel now a milder more refined sample of injured innocence culled from page of charlotte yonge narrow purely personal view inevitably embodies order of logic calculated to carry conviction theresa even in defeat retained degree of self opinionated astuteness presented case effectively to be discharged that in disgrace to be rendered homeless cast upon world at moment notice for with trifling almost unconscious manipulation of fact must be made to appear a nothing worse than venial error of judgment did really sound seem most unduly drastic punishment miss verity first instinct be to fling into breech directly brother emerged from room demand for protegee redress reinstatement second instinct be did in truth quite know what for grew sadly perplexed a listened sympathy in fact split into three inconveniently distinct separate stream of theresa woe still claimed widest deepest since with theresa be in immediate intimate contact yet other two began to show quite respectable volume current a pictured damaris marooned on bar sir charles ravished away from seasonable obligation of partridge shooting to take place at daughter bedside young captain of whom speak presently said mind taking one of many inconsequent skippits who so providentially came to dearest child assistance must wonder be same really very interesting looking

have stopped expressed gratitude to mercy be at hand poor dearest damaris hope good office have already be acknowledged do know if brother have seen thanked expression of theresa round little face still puffy blotched from last night weeping held world of reproachful remindings ah other cried conscience stricken of course not how thoughtless of to ask mental skippit that must be forbidden sick room too not permitted to nurse damaris poor friend indeed do feel for so well understand must have caused more pain than anything remark hearer found not altogether easy to counter with advantage to own cause so wisely let pas in silence know know can hardly trust to speak of be so grieved so very grieved one must be practical think be wise to yield without further protest will sound brother just find out if show sign of relenting of course can understand ought to hear view of matter too not that question account dear friend for one instant meanwhile make arrangement village theresa put in with note of despair time perfectly genuine ah village if take away in fly mean will give position standing will go far to prevent unpleasant gossip miss verity soul looked out of candid eye with positive effulgence of charity oh can enter so fully into shrinking from that will treat going a temporary merely temporary in speaking of here at paulton lacy of course might stay with friend good miss minetts ca honestly counsel doing so be afraid sir charles might not quite like remaining in deadham directly after leaving house might be awkward give rise to tiresome enquiry comment one have to consider thing think must be far better plan that must spend week at stourmouth must give time to see way more clearly know of quite nice room kept by former maid of lady bulparc must be quite comfortable there a dinner at paulton lacy be till eight must quite well go into stourmouth with myself afternoon dear friend will wo forgive speaking of miss verity whose income be added be anything

mind will be more at rest do trust be afraid charles have be rather severe never think doe quite understand woman how must after only being married for three four year be very limited experience be pity did marry again while damaris be still quite small really nice woman who one know about suppose charles have never cared about side of thing public work have absorbed doubt if have ever really be in love miss verity sighed yes hordle thanks will wait in long sitting room please let sir charles know be there that came over to enquire for miss damaris be getting up yes will be here to luncheon thanks during course of luncheon that afore mentioned split in miss verity sympathy be fated to declare with ever growing distinctness stream consecrated to theresa woe theresa being no longer materially present declined in volume in force while commanded by felicia affection for brother soon rushed down in spate perhaps a told be partly owing to light if pensive upstairs in white walled schoolroom might without exaggeration be called quite dismally gloomy in low ceilinged dining room looking out on black mass of ilex tree over havoc of storm beaten flower bed sir charles struck a so worn so aged so singularly pathetically sad be still so evidently oppressed by anxiety concerning damaris to hint at harsh action on part plead theresa cause with convincing earnestness warmth became

monotonous trample of wave upon beach not until reached stage of homeward journey setting face eastward paced pale level asphalt of wide promenade did sustained effort of conversation arise thus far have proffered fugitive remark only lapsing speedily into somewhat constrained silence for coldness shyness might appear to have sprung up between oddly holding asunder in thought moral attitude after close association of dance reaction from contact so surprisingly more intimate than have yet experienced from harmonious rhythmic unity of purpose of movement in dancing alike excites emotion quasi physical so alluringly serf to soothe allay emotion excites aspect of association affected damaris dimly since speaking language of barely knew alphabet carteret took in different measure read

in bride like raiment fresh a opening flower vaguely fragrant must not easily be dispelled strive a might to put from impression remained recurrent therefore must not be held to carteret discredit if sens took part with nobler affection just now against considered judgment that fared badly at hand of sea born goddess worshipped hero in temple in ancient day with music with dance with nameless rite of sex when moon rode high heaven at full even a to night influence be still abroad in flesh carteret shrewdly suffered yet basely bestially being clean of life of spirit whipped even with rather sorry humour seeing in damaris ' willingness to entrust thus to sole care in midnight loneliness handsomer compliment to moral than to manhood how little bless knew what stuff men be made of therein underrating acquaintance with fact a conversation presently surprisingly proved to revelation began in apparent innocence for be not ungrateful to henrietta damaris said breaking silence softly yet abruptly a speaking to herself rather than addressing in apology argument be dreadfully sorry to have vexed for be vexed with for not staying at pavilion to night a promised be really quite cross will get over never fear carteret answered off surface still trouble to have vexed must have seemed so unreasonable making silly sounding excuse because must not explain to why really wanted so much to go home find limit to dear lady power of comprehension of sympathy asked again off surface suppose must do so because there be thing never occurs to one to speak of to henrietta whole cartload of carteret comprehensively agreed yet know why well think do perhaps know why knowing must confess to being not altogether sorry confidence be restricted dear witch in particular direction use of pet name though involuntary possibly on very account eased fever clearly must get back to former relation rejoice in beauty in sweet faith dependence love yes admitted word for god sake keep physical side out of business damaris easily aroused loyalty meanwhile caught alight oh have just be guest said with pretty mingling of appeal rebuke seems hardly kind doe to find fault in have be beautifully good

daylight because damaris began came nearer to expression strangely agitated oh colonel sahib if must only be sure be treacherous to tell tell what one of many thing must never occur to to confide to mr frayling said trying to treat evident emotion lightly to laugh off to henrietta of course not must be unpardonable hateful to tell henrietta flushed face looking for moment dark from excess of
