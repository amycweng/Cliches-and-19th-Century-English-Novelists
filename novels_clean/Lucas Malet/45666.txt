to church little peter woke up very early on sunday morning feeling excited glad sat up on end in bed have to rub eye very hard get sleep out of before must remember exactly what there be to be so very glad about when did remember be so much delighted that be compelled to express feeling in rather violent manner went on four burrowed very quick like rabbit head first down under clothes to bottom of bed then rushed up again with very red cheek puffing pushing curly hair out of eye really be not light yet only rushlight mother burnt at night glimmered feebly in corner peter must hear master lepage snoring peacefully in bed on other side of wooden partition divided big room into two unequal half small half for little peter little bed large half for father mother large bed must be long while yet before mother got up called to to help dress wash for gustavus cowherd have only just gone downstairs from attic clumpety clump with big heavy boot over stair always got up long before anybody else peter wondered what must do to amuse till be time to dress then struck a just possible that when gustavus went down into kitchen might have left door open in case cincinnatus cat might have stepped upstairs be waiting outside on landing have happened so once before on very delightful never to be forgotten occasion peter waited moment held breath listening for seemed to extremely adventurous to be on move so very early in morning be not quite sure whether little hairy house bogy hobgoblin who undoubtedly so eliza said at least wander about empty room chase other up down silent passage stairway night with impish frolic laughter when be safe in bed might not still be holding revel knew at least eliza said so that be extremely unlucky for person to see for like to be looked at by mortal eye will come sit on pillow tickle nose with feather out of bedding squat on chest till feel a though lay under weight of mountain treat in number of other odious disturbing way made cold shiver run down peter back a sat up there in little white night shirt even to think of coming face to face with hairy goblin bogy then on other hand society of cincinnatus must be so very delightful peter slipped one sturdy bare leg down over side of bed ah how cold smooth board of floor felt however other leg very soon followed then crept across room very quietly avoiding oak chest chair corner of high cupboard with mother initial date of wedding day carved on door of when reached door paused listening at keyhole oh dear there really be something outside on landing moving about stealthily on small soft foot little peter heart stood still be dear old cincinnatus dreadful roundabout hairy hobgoblin at last plucked up courage to put lip close to keyhole whisper in rather trembling voice pus cincinnatus oh please be that ' beiau answered cincinnatus quite composedly comfortably in great hurry little peter opened crack of door come in quick please cincinnatus ' said illustration oh come in quick please cincinnatus cat of quality never permit to be hurried cincinnatus came just half way through door then stopped rubbed very tall up against side post purred then stretching out fore leg a far a ever must sharpened claw crick crack crick crack on board of bedroom flooring 'oh do be quick cincinnatus ' said little boy under breath again to hasten matter gave cat poke in rib with cold bare toe ' cried cincinnatus quite sharply jumping on one side for be taken rather by surprise subsequently added in cat language beanners good child manner let before thing cultivate polite address calm unagitated exterior meanwhile peter have succeeded in shutting door quietly that to great relief without catching single glimpse of one of blobbety bodied spindle legged house bogy pattered across room a fast a ever must jumped into warm bed again 'he be young inexperienced ' murmured cincinnatus reflectively be magnanimous scorn to bear malice ' too jumped into warm bed now be really charming little peter pushed up bedclothes in front making into snug little dark cavern inside there be just room enough for cincinnatus beee said 'we will play at robber will be captain will be first lieutenant unfortunately cincinnatus did not seem to care very much about particular game have arrived at age temper of mind at material comfort be far more valuable than pleasure derived from lively exercise of imagination perhaps quite understand what mean well so much better for part hope never may understand there be number of thing in world that be very much best to be ignorant about if can possibly manage cincinnatus anyway understood well enough so tucked fore leg under chest until nothing be visible of just furry elbow laid tail neatly along soft side settled down on warm sheet with eye more than half shut purring while a loud a if have got small steam engine inside be not way to play at robber said little peter cincinnatus only purred trifle louder be rather provoking still peter be too glad of cat comfortable company be moreover really too sweet tempered boy to get cross angry so just lay down on stomach resting chin in one hand while with other gently rubbed cincinnatus about ear amused by thinking of nice new clothes lay folded up on chair at bottom of bed of representation of stable manger in infant saviour be cradled that hoped to see in great church

road so that must no longer see margin of covering wheel track mark of horse hoof filling up hollow under grey rock boulder blurring jagged outline of pine tree where rise against sky hundred of thousand of white hurrying flake soft silent multitude filling air a far a eye must see there be fun now in turning round to look at mark of nailed boot for peter found snow hid again almost a soon a be made be hard work too struggling up steep hill battling with wind still little fellow trudged along without making complaint for see have often heard father praise virtue of ancient roman courage endurance so peter have got notion into head that be rather grand thing not to mind what be uncomfortable disagreeable that be rather shameful unworthy thing to grumble make fuss cry when chilblain itch happen to bump head against table when leg ache a leg began to ache now with length steepness of hill more than once mother stopped called to told be good brave little man pulled collar of overcoat up about red little ear peter though must not have said so for three dozen baking apple washing basket full of sugar pig did find very comfortable to stand still in shelter of petticoat for minute two get breath town below be hidden in driving snow dark wall of pine tree loomed nearer nearer at last forest path be reached here be better walking snow be lighter there be shelter from force

snow forest open out in place into wide space of waste moorland across by daylight in fine weather be easy enough to find right road on such evening a be telling about be by mean easy on edge of moorland susan lepage called to antony to stop 'go slowly said pray be careful if once mistake path may find in sad plight wish father be with go on in front ' added turning to paul 'and will follow '

from shelter of pine tree into dim white waste beyond for time went well of sudden ground began to grow rough uneven under foot peter stumbled fell scrambled up again half smothered in snow poor little mouth eye full of hand scratched with harsh heath root stone beneath 'antony antony be wandering ' cried mother a wiped snow out of peter eye off clothes kissed little boy clung to for felt very desolate cheerless did not think in least amusing now to be out in storm longed for warm cosy kitchen for society of cincinnatus choked down tear a mother kissed tried to be very brave not to

quicker quicker still snow fell in hundred of thousand of soft white flake eliza groaned lamented poor little peter snow clogged boot began to chill foot through hand grew a cold a frog paw got more more hungry tired did not grumble about for knew mother brother be cold weary too so struggled on manfully through ankle deep snow at last got too tired even to feel hungry began to cry quite gently
