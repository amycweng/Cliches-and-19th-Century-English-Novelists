even cleverest of dominated by personal feeling what mattered future of morocco for instance though involving possibility of war to europe a against future of adrian savage that future did unquestionably present just now a lamentably parlous that might fail that madame st leger might eventually finally refuse to marry have never really seriously entered head before might have to

inability to concentrate attention upon subject of disagreeable country served to increase perturbation distress thanks to admirable physical health be accustomed to have faculty thoroughly immediately at command refusal of brain to work to order fairly infuriated there be critique of ren dax picture show to be written too adrian rose from table walked restlessly almost distractedly about room for where exactly in respect of resistance of beloved beleaguered city did ren come in oh that tadpole of perverted genius perniciously clever tadpole who from childhood have protected befriended whose fortune have so assiduously pushed again now a when staring forth blindly from high set window of la belle gabrielle thrice sacred drawing room at paris glittering in sharp edged sunshine adrian whole being cried aloud against blasphemy of certain conceivable yet inconceivable combination in passionate agonized god forbid verbal protest against combination however loud voiced vehement ranging ineffectually within narrow confines of office be transparently inadequate mode of self expression native impetuosity rendered uncertainty suspense intolerable to must act must make reconnaissance must discover mean of ascertaining whether anything have occurred during absence served to explain apparently existing situation here intrinsic delicacy of said situation asserted since precisely question to answer be most urgently needed be question person of fine feeling can not ask good breeding sensibility chivalrous regard for feeling of others be a reflected at time quite abominable handicap sat down once again at writing table what must do at elbow stood ebonized upright of telephone long green silk covered wire of trailing away across parquet floor to plug in

wit consequently once more fairly at command adrian resolutely turned attention to affair of neglected morocco a to ren dax exhibition well till to morrow at event must wait ever since must remember miss beauchamp have occupied same handsome second floor flat in quiet street just off parc monceau adrian recalled visit in company with mother made to there at period when still wore white frilled

be dimly lighted vacant place of silence shadow atmosphere of impregnated with scent of cedar sandal wood from third doorway of be masked by thick curtain of oriental embroidery came sound of grand piano played in masterly fashion by man hand adrian stopped abruptly turning to elderly maid miss beauchamp informed must be alone said mademoiselle be alone maid answered gave instruction one be to be admitted save monsieur thanks will not detain will announce adrian said crossed second larger room threading way in out of perfect archipelago of furniture held one curtain partially aside while purpose of visit smart of own distraction alike be merged in sensation of curiosity surprise miss beauchamp sat at grand piano placed in middle of bare polished floor at right angle to doorway adrian saw face high shouldered high waisted figure in profile wore cinnamon colored tea gown opening over under dress of copper sequin sewn net veritable pagoda of fiery curl crowned head yet though thin

conception fearless security of execution held young man captive raising whole attitude outlook to nobler plane music indeed carried imagination up to region heroic be in haste to have cease waited therefore when final chord be struck anastasia beauchamp raising hand from keyboard rested tip of finger upon edge of empty music desk sat motionless absorbed in thought then a second passed adrian position became in opinion equivocal courtesy demanding that must either make presence known withdraw chose former alternative taking step forward let curtain fall into place behind imperiously with lift of chin miss beauchamp turned head looked full at for moment young man be fairly taken aback for setting of flaming pagoda frisky tea gown notwithstanding beheld countenance no longer bizarre that of accredited jester sibylline that of woman who in respect of certain department of human knowledge have touched ultimate wisdom so that in respect of department life have further secret to reveal here be something outpacing province of adrian self confident young masculine attainment be to credit that instantly recognized accepting with quick witted intuitive sympathy forgive if have presumed upon indulgence dear lady said advancing with disarming air of admiration modesty by remaining here unannounced must not permit interruption of wonderful playing must have amounted to profanity art be sublime be so altogether impressively great oh why added a sibylline countenance softened somewhat have elected to let to let many friend remain in ignorance why have deprived of joy of superb musical gift because gift served turn very fully many year ago when dear savage be little more than baby answered since then have felt at liberty to regard playing a trifle of private property might keep to for a spoke miss beauchamp rose from seat at piano began replacing multiplicity of bracelet ring laid aside during performance a grow older most of be disposed to practise such reservation suppose whether openly acknowledged not continued may take rise in inclination of sentimental avaricious penitential nature however divergent cause object be identical namely to keep intact one individuality menaced by disintegrating wear tear of outward thing tendency of modern world be to render one invertebrate to pound one character opinion into pulp in self defense one be forced to reserve to cultivate hidden garden wherein one poor battered individual may walk in assuaging solitude recollection especially looked bravely at adrian through shaded light while long armed ungainly rusty gold figure strangely wise face surmounted by flaming top knot appeared to more than ever impressive especially perhaps be case if garden once represented a music possibly once did garden of paradise in one did not walk altogether solitary come want to speak to let go into drawing room have talk there let talk by mean adrian put in quickly let be here please room be sympathetic full of splendid echo good for soul anastasia expression softened yet more be charmingly said will stay here since wish sofa yes be corner thanks now to be quite frank with understand have lost count

now a one grows older one have to economize one emotion be too tiring liable to endanger one sleep afterward evening circumstance association be too strong for garden called to walked chapter v with deborah under oak in parc monceau miss beauchamp leaned back against piled up sofa cushion shading eye with left hand hand must have be little unsteady since adrian heard bracelet upon wrist rattle clink will tell what something be so moved asked unless be greatly mistaken be main cause of present interview so that to speak of may help to make interview easier for pray tell adrian felt curious a to what must follow curiosity be tempered by deepening respect come to then dear young man think said for who have once be acquainted with true love be not speaking of mere sexual passion still le of silly flirtation wanton amorettes who have once known that uniquely beautiful illuminating condition can forget mistake carry infallible touchstone in own eye ear heart be privilege to carry touchstone afternoon there there wince quite quite reverently gently put finger on fact beheld true love again true love tormented far from happy be so yes adrian replied with touch of bitterness be that brought certain event experience dear mother sympathy friendship among so vividly before must only come home here to practically deserted room make music a long ago when man true lover sat where now sit do follow adrian heart be somewhat full bowed head in silent assent ice be satisfactorily broken then be old woman now many people doubt describe a flighty prankish old spinster who ape departed youth in highly ridiculous manner no longer shaded eye with hand looked full at adrian through quiet light smiling half sibyl half jester a felt wholly wise wholly kind such criticism matter to rather le than nothing continued since hidden garden know why wherefore of more besides now dear boy have said enough think to show that can unburden without reserve hesitation will not speak to of undiscovered country just then adrian felt difficult to speak coming to woman have found so much more than have asked for expected namely finding of high romance of almost reckless generosity made feel humble feel indeed quite quaintly ignorant inexperienced followed that when did speak did so in child like fashion protesting innocence a though needing to disarm censure believe have not acted unworthily said from first be charmed be enthralled made effort to restrain even in thought be loyal to poor st leger did best to conceal admiration kept away a much a must without discourtesy see very perfection be in sense safeguard for how inconceivably vile to endanger peace of mind of so adorable creature by hint suggestion be only since st leger death that yes yes take for granted anastasia broke in doe stand to reason since be talking of true love adrian must not forbear to smile notwithstanding humbled condition touch be so deliciously feminine in assumption non logic unless by chance be laughing at out of larger wisdom possibly be well must hing right anyhow so did care whereupon proceeded to pour forth history of affection in phase from first inception to existing moment with dramatic fervor spreading abroad hand descriptively while sentence galloped with increasing velocity mellow baritone voice rose fell ah can not conceive after dismal time in england burying dead contending with manner of tiresomeness with narrow minded over strenuous over educated woman men ye god such men to come back to see be like coming from underground cavern into sunshine received exquisitely tasted ecstasy be transported by hope then abruptly manner changed that change did not appear to spontaneous calculated a though in obedience to alien influence unwillingly put constraint upon since then have reconstituted scene repeatedly poor dear boy anastasia murmured yes repeatedly repeatedly try to convince that change of manner be unwilling not result of caprice madame st leger be not capricious be sure of nature at bottom be serious reason obeys reason in case what reason not dislike of mind refuse such explanation of conduct must be too horrible too desolating be there rather obvious explanation of madame st leger attitude fear of liking little too much why must fear to like poor adrian cried be devouring monster have talent sufficient mean concealed vice there thought of ren dax invaded scorching with positively rampant jealousy repulsion for must have just asserted regarding be asserted with equal truth regarding tadpole of genius knew very well must not still even so shrank from rle of treacherous friend detractor can be gracious enough to others contented by saying gazing at hostess meanwhile expression altogether orphaned pathetic dangerously gracious be why did in power to delay departure afternoon although knew perfectly well be on rack dear god in heaven broke out incoherently burying face in hand can not imply can not intend to convey to belief that gabrielle st leger contemplates marrying that libelous little horror m dax never in life adrian got up walked unsteadily for indeed floor seemed to shift lurch beneath foot across room without faintest conception of what be looking at minutely examined landscape hanging upon opposite wall also blew nose wiped eye while anastasia beauchamp jaw set leaning back against sofa cushion very actually poignantly walked in hidden garden of hers once garden of eden not adamless one wrapped about by remembrance after time young man came back sat down beside face be white eye be luminous most dear kind friend forgive said very gently have climbed giddy pinnacle of rapture tumbled off plop into blackest morass of despair to day nerve have suffered ah have got returned be not bit sorry for on contrary congratulate for be very handsomely hopelessly in love adrian nodded assent pushing up end of mustache with twist of finger smiling yes yes indeed know said be thing for to be immeasurably thankful yet same have little hour of inconvenience a have to day discovered can hold field to exclusion of else that with quite demoralizing intensity making one feel murderous toward one oldest friend in respect of one work no better than driveling idiot such be inevitable symptom of blessed state still congratulate admit at least that be practically extremely impeding so dear mademoiselle whom mother loved who loved mother who have done so much to help comfort in last half hour will do something more suppose will anastasia answered with laugh be against rather than against seem to be pretty thoroughly committed to business for well for two people sake perhaps yes for sake also for hers a well a mine adrian cried impetuously few word be beautifully full of encouragement for see here went on in way be just simply obstinate pig headed englishman permit to speak quite freely loosing can not console elsewhere be not merely wife want having reached age when man must range well bred healthy generally unexceptionable mother for child imagine must not like to make subscription to humanity in form of charming baby of course must still small people however beguiling be not to point in connection be not in pursuit of suitable marriage of la belle gabrielle only solely la belle gabrielle must be conspicuously evident to meanest intelligence anastasia put in merrily there unfortunately run up against crux of whole situation for be only fair to tell exquisite young woman be even le in pursuit of suitable marriage than be have have intimate conversation imagine for instant name other name have be hinted at much le mentioned have be good enough to bestow confidence upon in a far a bestows upon one fundamentally be mysterious creature be exactly why suppose one find so endlessly interesting from conversation gather mind be set on thing quite other than marriage ah just heaven what thing then poor adrian exclaimed distraction again threatening must think have very great difficulty in telling here distraction did more than threaten jumped on so that in agitation positively bounced ball like upon seat of sofa knew cried be sure of almost immediately detected alien inimical influence intrude between a have already told battle against be more detestable to because felt powerless to combat being ignorant whence came what nature actually be miss beauchamp looked at indulgently distraction notwithstanding perceived that countenance once more have grown sibylline served sensibly to quiet steady fancy influence come from very deep very far said woman of so much temperament so much intelligence a gabrielle st leger must of necessity be child of age in life in touch with spirit of eye be turned toward future strange unrestful wind wind of modernity blow from out future be upon face be influence have to battle against dear young man be afraid nothing le than spirit of age spirit of modernity have work cut out for to combat successfully will be to put vulgarly mighty tough job like king david of old 'd rather fall into hand of god than into of man adrian returned with rather rueful humor be one so very sure be hand of almighty too often one have reason to suspect belong to exactly opposite person inspirer namely of so many of friend m ren dax unpardonable caricature there added want to give place to prejudice though whether modernity be veritably highroad to state of human earthly felicity exponent so confidently truculently predict not rather to appalling final catastrophe armageddon twilight of god appears to in existing stage of evolution open to liveliest question fortunately at time of life one be free to stand aside look on passively awaiting event without taking part in production of with madame st leger a with be different be on active list whether like not be bound to participate in production of event at least be by mean unwilling to do so how chre mademoiselle how adrian questioned after fashion can hardly be expected to indorse enthusiastically miss beauchamp shaded eye with left hand again while many bracelet slipping up thin wrist clinked rattled see here dear savage said among destruction reconstruction change many of nominal rather than real consequently superfluous of modernity be made up one change be very real have sincerely believe come to stay mean widespread change in thought attitude of sex toward yours feminism in short in short feminism little silence followed then take dose very nicely anastasia said perhaps take so nicely because be convinced be innocuous on other hand perhaps take at really be not certain shifted position planting elbow on knee chin in hollow of hand deuce deuce said softly tapping one long toed boot meditatively upon floor miss beauchamp watched amused observant making comment be sorry went on presently be moonshine of course nature too strong for in end must come into line moonshine have often

tradition asked in face of said exposure what to personally remained answered that adrian savage remained thereupon proceeded with intensity pent up passion of morbidly introspective nature to fling upon thought of delightful young man matrimonial intention hounding out doubt furiously repressing misgiving grappled to belief in adrian with hook of iron chained to with link of steel drank from well of splendid promise offered to verge of inebriety in hailed savior adrian must make good wasted year adrian must teach where have be mistaken where intelligence have gone astray adrian must instruct counsel must supply with rule of living at once just distinguished adrian must be gentle to error have not shown so already on more than one occasion must be sympathetic playful charming even

concluding portion of sister comprehensive argument in favor of projected espousal of joseph challoner only awoke from state of trance induced by access of adrian worship when repetition of margaret assertion of violent character of challoner affection slightly ambiguous laugh following that assertion struck ear then turned upon speaker with righteous wrath of one who hears sacred word put to unworthy us desperately in love said harshly do intend to understand margaret that be desperately in love with mr challoner in return oh dear lady addressed replied calmly enough though if be see occasion for scolding about nannie what doe make so restless cross to night however if be determined to be uncomfortable be not so will sit down here in chair did see lightning then be not least silly about challoner then must be very sorry to be silly about man think dignified for woman to be in wild state of mind about fianc be not nice like challoner well enough to marry well enough not to mind making love to that be quite sufficient think jealous curiosity pricked joanna stopped in agitated walk stood stretching out right hand gazing abstractedly at what what precisely do mean when speak of making love to margaret said in thin urgent whisper really for person who plume upon being particularly refined do say most singular thing joanna other exclaimed laughing can hardly expect to go into detail making love be making love kissing hand do mean joanna gasped in awestruck accent dry sob rising in throat one hand why anybody might kiss one hand challoner proceeding be afraid be considerably more unrestrained than positively ca go into detail how extraordinary be nannie doe occur to there be question one doe ask streak of pain shot across back of joanna right hand a though be struck again again with rod moaning just audibly thrust within open bosom of white nglig laid left hand upon fondling a one striving to soothe sorely wounded creature margaret leaned back in easy chair fingering little fan sleekness suggestion of almost animal content in expression attitude really ca explain further said laughing little be quite hot enough a be refuse to make hotter must wait

margaret be delicate meant that margaret knew just when to cry loud enough to excite pity just when to announce tiredness headache so a to escape unwelcome exertion have in short reduced practice of selfishness so joanna thought to fine art now finally to night not timidly with disarming apology with flaunting assurance margaret dared to infringe joanna copyright in wonder story of man love thereby capping climax of offense transcript of said story might be of grosser sort yet on very account showed more convincing misgiving agonized suspense tremulously anxious reading between line be demanded be printed in large type in language coarsely vigorous a joseph challoner morally repelled joanna although inflaming imagination with vague driving of desire whole poor being indeed be swept by conflicting half comprehended passion from amid tempest of one thing declared in rising scale of furious insistence namely that margaret must not once again best that marriage margaret might elect to make must endanger own marriage with adrian savage by mean mean fair foul margaret must be prevented tasting fullness of man love never mind how poor edition of love might be how unpoetic bow vulgar a long a joanna be denied love fullness yet so deeply be tradition system ingrained in that even at pas paid homage to ruling since instead of making direct attack owning anger a cause of tricked with fiction of moral obligation margaret began presently from station at door speaking with such self command a must muster dislike alluding to subject very much doubt will be annoyed will accuse of interference still there be something feel ought to say to if say now there may not be suitable opportunity later then pray say now a have told want to get whole thing thoroughly thrashed out to night so that may avoid odious discussion in future what be ca help observing that be only since papa death mr challoner have paid so much attention before then margaret rose faced round upon speaker manner remained composed blue eye held light of battle mean be not fortune challoner be in love with quite expected must tell that joanna sooner later be bound to say be not very elegant compliment to to did not intend to bring such accusation against joanna protested must be very dreadful to suppose one affection one choice must be seriously influenced by fact have money be afraid view be le romantic than yours seems to quite natural money must prove attraction particularly in case where other attraction be rather wanting for reason joanna felt stroke of rod across hand again pain excited came forward step two give time to explain margaret before papa death mr challoner name be very freely associated with of mr spencer marion chase spoke of engagement between a certain others spoke of also probability of marriage be accepted can not forget margaret laughed really be too funny that of people must champion wretched little mr spencer why joanna invariably intimated be quite beneath notice have lost opportunity of snubbing have have to be nice more than once simply because felt so awfully ashamed of rudeness to like be unladylike still think mr challoner change of attitude requires explanation do margaret retorted here be explanation then simply that challoner be too kind hearted to save at expense of woman even when have treated badly told about month ago felt have better hear from did best to excuse showed wonderfully nice feeling about be not prepared for being so scrupulous made admire for be sort of person who spends time in extracting money present

among chief reason for accepting then of course cousin adrian savage with sort of rush joanna came close violence of half starved creature in pale eye drawn face parted lip adrian cried adrian what possible connection can there be between cousin adrian engagement to mr challoner for second margaret smyrthwaite looked hard thoughtfully at sister then holding skirt of dress aside pressed upturned corner of rug into place again with pointed toe of slipper will be so thankful said when give up wearing that frightful old dressing gown nannie decidedly be not a clean a might be look so horridly stuffy never have understood craze for hoarding adrian joanna insisted adrian surely must have seen nannie be just one of thing be easy to put into word must have thought even must have grasped though be so different to most people sometimes have wondered lately though whether really be so different to other people whether be only extraordinarily secretive naturally having young man like cousin adrian staying so long in house winter put idea into one head made one think good deal about marriage so on took for granted papa have notion of kind when appointed adrian executor have great opinion of must have liked a son in law fancied must of course wanted to bring together be object of appointment think so joanna questioned joy anxious great arose in have doubt about same must out of respect for papa wish make advance to young man who showed quite clearly did care row of pin about be always kind civil to margaret joanna interrupted restrainingly jealousy folded beating wing betaking to most unaccustomed repose civil kind dare say well of course there be sign one ca mistake unless one blind wilfully to meaning tossed head eye hard bright joanna expression meanwhile became increasingly ecstatic yes there be sign one can not mistake sign must be weak faithless to mistake whispered deny felt rather enraged margaret continued too busy with own vexation to remark other singular aspect must have be very much upset about if have let go be sorry joanna murmured touched by unexpected pity indeed margaret be sorry oh be to blame in way nannie see did let go just turned attention to challoner there be nothing ambiguous about admiration now glanced curiously at sister now continued a thing have turned out be most uncommonly glad did allow to get into state of mind about adrian a thing have turned out understand be pleased blame margaret yes a thing have turned out joanna repeated excitedly for here a saw be hour of triumph of assured splendid victory room seemed too small to hold rapture hardly aware of did brushed past sister still standing fan in hand beside chair at window went out on to balcony required to be alone so a to savor to full heady sweetness of own emotion wanted to forget one everything save that only wanted to abandon without reserve to thought of adrian savage to gloat over incident of intercourse with project imagination onward to closer continuous exclusive intercourse of future for have not margaret confession more persuasive because reluctantly made amounted to admission that adrian affection belonged to to only did not supply reasonable confirmation of sorely tried faith in ratify hope by setting seal of witness upon fact of love for such be meaning read into recent conversation piecing evidence together into coherent whole never before have be absolutely certain now a told be certain must safely be so in margaret have admitted fact if not in so many word yet implicitly father wish purpose have be that young man must marry one of two daughter margaret have perceived joanna be one have chosen thereby justifying past effort labor rehabilitating poor cynically denuded family system into bargain be not whole habit conduct of life vindicated inasmuch a led to superb result year have not be wasted be on contrary patient seed time of welcome harvest have be right from first right in particular so that not upon method upon who differed from undervalued slighted rested onus of proof here intellectual moral arrogance latent in joanna smyrthwaite nature upheaved mightily stood aggressively erect overweening self esteem a on giant wing sustained for to such disastrous inflation of pride be introspective person liable when fail a do so frequently fail to discriminate between deed emotion between barren power to feel fertile life giving power to act of trap set by satan for catching of trap of feeling be perhaps wiliest worst into trap poor joanna walked head in air careless of consequence felt deified lifted above crawling common way of common men defiant of opposition criticism since being chosen desired of whom so dotingly worshiped became object worthy of worship in to herself night playing into devil hand somewhat a at time aspect of nature will in windless silence opaque hot darkness appeared queerly reflective of sympathetic to joanna mood of portentous self exaltation plane rather than form of composed scene be perceptible joanna eye detected slope of veranda roof immediately beneath balcony flat outspread of garden lawn vertical palisade of lofty tree encircling single object detached be fused by soaked in thick broth of thunder smoke heated obscurity welcomed because ministered to sense of solitude of aloofness craved nothing visible interfered to distract attention from herself thought of high destiny only once twice sky opened for distant storm have moved westward striking black canopy of fir stem many branch into vivid instantaneous relief while behind above midway to zenith lightning licked flickered like miracle of soundless sardonic laughter playing over livid feature of corpse nine day dead be in moment of one such disquieting celestial display margaret smyrthwaite stifling audible yawn strolled on to balcony have gathered up magazine paper again tucked under arm if intend to come in talk more nannie said rather irritably may a well go be getting frightfully sleepy have promised challoner to motor over to weymouth to morrow make early start too marion sure to be waiting to hear how talk with have gone off have conscience about keeping up longer now do quite understand that be going to marry challoner opposition be absolutely good must look ever so much better be so very much more comfortable for one concerned if must only make up mind to be nice about be always saying how hate people talking over affair why give occasion to talk then by being disagreeable contrary about thing be really business of yours be quite powerless to prevent contemptuously joanna turned from contemplation of strangely flickering sky contemplation of own subjective glory resented intrusion of margaret with perfume fashion paper complacent utilitarianism motor car underbred lover resented half pityingly a weakness of inferior being behaving according to manner of kind may be powerless to prevent marriage said still most deeply object to can not do otherwise consider unsuitable most unfortunate can not disguise from that will stand between in future render intercourse difficult there can be little sympathy between two person whose aim interest be a far apart a yours mine must inevitably be feel duty to mention to margaret although know have ceased to exercise influence over be very sad be painful to that must repudiate parent teaching more painful because never understood a fully a now do how noble that teaching be how much have done to form character taste thus preparing for position duty to be called drew breath sharply raising hand to forehead greatly moved by thought of high calling for be parting of way margaret added singular effect of dramatic tension in manner pale ungracious face figure against red brick background of house front momentarily illuminated by swift amazement of lightning rippling shuddering behind fir tree in west parting of way repeated go yours mine deplore choice can do otherwise seeing how different own prospect be a after due consideration have made that choice further argument must fear be wasted upon very well then there be end of matter a spoke margaret crossed balcony leaning upon balustrade looked down into gloom shrouded garden candle light streaming outward through open window touched shapely back shoulder bright curled folded auburn hair there be end of then repeated coldly rather bitterly agree to part might easily have be kinder nicer to bear ill will suppose ca help being disagreeable certainly be nothing new only nannie though want to upset make quarrel there be something must like to be quite clear about because own have be half afraid lately that be getting into silly state over adrian savage stood upright looking full at joanna know have corresponded with good deal so of course may know already colonel haig told met in paris on way to carlsbad be awfully smitten with have cousin adrian ever spoken to about madame st leger silence followed distinct menace be perceptible in joanna tone when at last answered have never attempted to force into adrian confidence to do so must be worst possible taste under existing circumstance must never dream of asking question regarding former friend then know about madame st leger nannie know have least wish to hear anything respecting acquaintance of adrian except what may choose to tell joanna spoke violently back against wall in literal figurative sense be very proper really think ought to hear in end may save everybody lot of misunderstanding worry be pretty sure colonel haig meant to pas information on to be why told joanna stretched arm out on side palm of hand toward wall a finger worked opening closing nail gritted upon rough surface of brick wish to hear anything margaret not anything repeated vehemently evidently there be secret about one so haig say know whole story in paris affair have be going on for ever so long only until madame st leger

doe explain adrian behavior when be with one see of course how improbable be that young man like must not have attachment joanna quitted sheltering wall came toward speaker holding up hand finger tip frayed reddened with threatening gesture go away margaret cried passionately go away leave alone have much better story be false be false tell forbid to repeat will not listen will not have said go may do something dreadful to go never speak to again about never dare to do so never never do hear really ought to be ashamed of nannie other protested half angry half frightened be positively astonished at making such exhibition of joanna laid hold of by shoulder pushed back forcibly through open window into center of quiet softly lighted room take candle go said face be terrible forbidding argument rebuke be wicked falsehood concocted by jealous person who be trying to alienate adrian affection from who that person be know have better not know be very cruel very dreadful want explanation question advice above want sympathy only want to be alone warn margaret if ever betray what have happened here to night will take own life will be certain to find out sooner later will not survive betrayal so death will lie at door remember that if be tempted to gossip about with mr challoner marion chase now pray go away leave to myself be ask of call isherwood send to want nothing
