meal be finished went upstairs through steady light close dry atmosphere to stately sombre sickroom last twenty four hour have be very full of disquieting episode suggestion be inclined to reverse order of proceeding to night said to cross question uncle instead of letting cross question after will fit in to scheme of observation well enough question doubt will be indicative of depth of native ignorance poverty of power will enable to draw conclusion conclusion added smiling sufficiently fatuous occupation when one think of limited amount of evidence obtainable breadth of inquiry on stairhead uncle valet thin wiry man long armed grey of hair of skin met preceded silently along corridor laurence relation with servant other person in inferior position to own be usually of kindly cordial sort such person told of affair admired trusted servant in house though caring for comfort with scrupulous forethought punctuality remained so far impossible of approach seemed to like so many machine incapable of hope fear affection even of sin inhuman in rigidity silence now valet announced stood aside to let pas with perfection of drill absence of individuality so complete that be to laurence quite actively unpleasant immediately after met hungry glance of coldly brilliant eye looking out of face fixed in outline transparent a crystal skull lying on table close by house so full of being half alive of paralysed activity defective one sided development seemed to young man for moment terrible country churchyard in wind sang sunshine played among graf with flitting beckoning shadow be gay by comparison wonder place have evil reputation that people invented weird story about sensation of loneliness such a have not known since early childhood came over laurence almost involuntarily made effort towards closer more sympathetic intercourse with host how be evening sir asked better hope have be wonderfully charming day be glad to learn have found so weather have always appeared to accident unworthy save in scientific aspect of attention yet understand that exercise strong influence on certain temperament emotional temperament apprehend undisciplined by reason that weather to day have affected agreeably be matter for congratulation since will have helped to mitigate tedium of small portion of period of waiting oh there be not much tedium laurence answered looked across at elder man smiling very pleasantly be beginning to find thing here little too dramatic if anything be good enough to tell that found interesting last night sir only wish must be half a interesting to a house whole state of affair here be to find distinctly interesting mr river inquired whether in approval disapproval laurence must not determine unquestionably answered house be cram full of treasure there be unexpected influence in get hold of one imagination stand alone in experience unlike place have ever known elder man sunk further back against pillow with one long thin hand drew violet fur lined dressing gown closer across knee a though cold indeed have divorced surroundings so completely from ordinary habit of contemporary have be strong enough to follow own taste lead own life have produced something unique something a finished a be apart of course provokes lot of criticism other people observe recognise that be unique too other people mr river said loftily have never entertained exactly laurence answered be where part of uniqueness come in mostly herd together like sheep in pen ca be easy unless be rubbing side paused moment refusal to rub side cause great searchings of heart assure poor little parson here for instance be tormented by idea that be duty to almighty to church of england to own abnormally developed conscience to raid do little spiritual gardening in neglected flower bed of soul soul be own mr river observed be if term soul be strictly speaking admissible conscious consciousness be can predicate of other than physical existence little parson point of view be quite different be by mean backward in predication be quite sure have soul whether be own whether doe belong to a curate in charge of stoke river be not at sure have strong leaning to latter belief fancy be puerility average man be puerile laurence asserted cheerfully carted away woman last night sir remember in deference to slight prejudice against though still maintain be by mean foreign to inquiry really ca consent to carting away of puerility too will never get hold of average man at forbid affection ineptitude leave poor wretch leg to stand on meanwhile little parson be not only person good deal worked up by unique character of habit surroundings give rise indirectly to surprising legend indeed yes indeed think must amuse in connection with sir there be one two question must most uncommonly like to ask may do so mr river said nephew rapid speech breezy manner made slightly breathless be unaccustomed to be treated in light airy fashion moved uneasily in chair a one who try to avoid draught laurence observing repented of purpose tire sir do asked kindly exhaustion be consequence of failure of will will be still obedient to mind body to will laurence looked at with certain admiration be true to creed such a be pride have consequently rather superb quality well then said since may ask have found from conversation with several of neighbour that house took to be sort of temple of reason be regarded with good deal of vulgar suspicion though room be warm atmosphere of close a of thundering night in tropic laurence instinctively leaned forward spreading out hand to glowing wood fire on hearth be not superstitious continued very certainly take be not so will agree in still confess whole subject of occult supernatural be rather fascinating to ca quite keep hand off find idea be prevalent that there be manifestation here queer thing be seen know can not be put down to natural agency want to know if mr river interrupted with unaccustomed vehemence of speech manner stop said stop if please subject be exceedingly distasteful to then wo pursue laurence answered quickly yet wondered interest already considerably aroused being sensibly increased by violence displayed by companion be singular paused little thinking before embarking in further conversation during pause mr river leaned sideways slowly with difficulty raised crystal skull from place on table beside held in front of in hand gazed a though performing religious rite into cavity of empty eye socket then stiffly letting hand sink rested upon knee pardon said looking full at laurence while shadow rather than flush seemed to pas over attenuated face be tempted to act unworthily agreed to answer such question a might put to perceiving question tended to revive matter have caused one of few humiliation regret have suffered during life shrank be tempted weakly to break faith with retract promise pray sir take so seriously laurence entreated of course must never have approached subject have known be disagreeable to be just idle curiosity of idle man what on earth doe matter to very little presumably since be a say idle day be filled with round of amusement deadening a fear to intellectual moral conscience with case be otherwise judgment of human being be of moment to judgment of be of infinite moment mr river laid one transparent hand upon dome of crystal skull a though for support face have grown hard a steel be therefore incumbent upon not in satisfaction of curiosity dear laurence in satisfaction of own sense of rectitude must accept opportunity of stating following fact inherited property a will shortly inherit from uncle man very much senior have prosecuted study abroad in learned centre of germany france from early age acquaintance with uncle be slight knew little of private life have reason to believe person of undisciplined mind imbued with extravagant socialistic view current during french revolution unbridled alike in passion of love of hate question of character have never interested therefore made further inquiry regarding predecessor private life own taste habit be already fixed settled here continued study in experimental physic philology metaphysics in have already engaged also added to collection of picture object of art found in house life have be blameless a most men count blame can assert without fear of contradiction that moral intellectual integrity have be complete only in one connection have be guilty have failed failed a now confess miserably grossly mr river paused moment finger twitched a rested upon crystal skull miserably grossly repeated vulgar gossip have heard rest upon basis of truth can not deny existence of supernatural manifestation so called in one quarter of house be undeniable have witnessed laurence felt queer shiver of excitement run through sat very still then be asleep after said to in room last night said manifestation be not only disturbing distasteful to perceived that existence threatened validity of of most carefully reasoned hypothesis of of most ardently cherished belief of vulgar physical fear need hardly tell be incapable trembled before dislocation of thought followed that became guilty of act of flagrant mental cowardice refused to submit manifestation to scientific investigation never mentioned to correspondent took elaborate precaution against ever witnessing again made determined effort to erase memory of from mind almost succeeded in forgetting that ever have witnessed thus tricked own intelligence lied to own experience committed crime against own reason crime can never hope to expiate moved by passion of elder man self denunciation laurence have risen stood close to ah surely take too hard far too hard sir said mr river looking up at answered sternly sin be heinous not in in relation to level of virtue habitually maintained by whoso commits so even be not disabled be still capable of carrying out investigation unsparing prosecution of must alone give proof of sincerity of repentance must not really wipe out iniquity of past in moral can not logically admit possibility of cancelling wrong once done in realm of physic know that vibration once generated ring out everlastingly through space to send forth contrary set of vibration be not to limit cause first generated to cease circle may intersect yet be practically independent can not neutralise one in realm of moral be same act once committed pass into region of persistent indubitable fact of sin passive active be equally true consequently be doomed so long a retain conscious individuality to remain hopelessly lowered in self esteem sick man spoke with fierceness of conviction voice usually low even swelling into full sonorous tone attenuated frame vibrant with energy face illuminated a though lamp burned behind thin investiture of flesh bone laurence saw in for moment great orator more probably great preacher wasted thought of waste of force waste of power stung out of indolence out of mere easy good nature at least must shilly willy more with life play game game presenting whole heartedly again that queer shiver of excitement ran through while again reminded have now reliable testimony that have met with something far stranger more incalculable mysterious than vision of dream in clear coloured room downstairs last night stood silent thinking intently feeling keenly whole nature alert small rustling sound a of chill wind among dry leaf in winter hedge recalled to immediate surroundings mr river have sunk back against silken cushion rustled under weight light have died out of face hand clutched tremblingly at crystal memento mori resting on knee for first time laurence realised how very near for indomitable strength of will supported be to death laurence bent over be heavy sir said touching crystal skull may put back on table mr river bowed head in assent have talked too much must be wise think for to leave must be so may call man before go hardly like to leave alone thank will come at accustomed hour deviate from habit once formed except under stress of necessity laurence be pushed by desire to say something gentle something expressive of honour in held host rectitude sincerity mr river lay back motionless eye closed be difficult to find just word wished turned away towards door when elder man voice recalled laurence said laurence one word before part if must see fit to undertake investigation of have spoken in face of showed unfaithful craven remember press nothing upon leave free to undertake not a please have one request to make of yes sir answered be that will under circumstance communicate result of investigation to person save only to must definitely ask to do so will give word give word sir with feeling that have bound to engagement of unlooked for solemnity young man went out into steady brightness of corridor while a last night odour of orchid met enfolding in thick musky sweetness half way down dark shining oaken stair x a pulled edge of heavy leather lined curtain towards laurence laughed little in part at own eagerness in part defiant of scruple waking in small hour a baby child have often imagined must climb high rail of cot steal back unperceived to day nursery must find toy alive stirring at play on own account conception of reversal of natural order of thing while frightened yet enchanted fancy something of childish alarm enchantment arose in now felt about to bid farewell to common sense possibly to usual established habit of thought assuredly be about to commit to untried element offering a sport to sea unsounded a yet to unknown force might prove malign merciless while promise by have so lately bound introduced into coming experience element of secrecy made a enforced secrecy so often doe make for rather dangerous degree of personal liberty so turned door handle not without expectation time expectation suffered disappointment in front of tall satin wood escritoire back towards delicate hand wandering anxiously over painted polished surface beheld once more slender rose clad figure laurence drew in breath with sigh of satisfaction crossed room boldly to night stood beside pale ethereal loveliness entranced a spoke listen to said be stranger to one so strangely stranger half distrust evidence of

that have found one who will keep faith with do best to serve believing that put sorrow out of face stopped suddenly when began speaking might have be addressing sleep walker person in trance there be speculation in sweet eye be wild with wondering distress looking on a though not seeing a continued to plead with speaking slowly pausing at close of sentence in hope that sense of word might so reach arrest gradual change came over aspect a of one awakening from prolonged troubled slumber there be dawning of intelligence in expression a in of little child first struggling to apprehend measure not by mean of sens merely in obedience to conscious effort of mind drooping corner of mouth straightened turned upward lip breaking into timid questioning smile stretched little clenched fist gently rubbed eye with in innocent baby fashion stretched again then looked full at laurence woman shy diffident in possession of faculty expectant alive yes yes there be right now look a used to look a must exclaimed voice low shaken with very vital excitement felt a when once twice bringing racing yacht in to finish fair spread of blue water between stern competitor bow have felt pace quicken while tiller throbbed danced under hand buoyancy of heart delicious conviction of successful attainment be upon sportsman poet alike rejoiced in laurence just then spiritual side of nature be touched a well seemed to have witnessed glad resurrection enforcing belief in immortality of soul a gazed on lovely face in reason hope even gaiety be so visibly born anew never mind about have lost said let be for

explanation asseveration have issued from mouth indeed wordlessness have for extraordinary charm far from power being lacking be to a though new power have be granted that most subtle convincing to heart laurence stood tall upright in full pride of young manhood of virile energy strength before slender fairy lady with softly gleaming jewel dainty frill lace clinging rose red old world silken gown held out hand to come said night be fair windless full of star will go out into read great poem of sky woodland while men sleep good comrade old friend though a most mortal count meeting have met other must seem twice have known sad thing well forget have searched vainly for lost thing well forget too finest house at best remains somewhat of prison room be pervaded by melancholy memory leave let give past give convention give reason even slip for once go for minute more hesitated looking at laurence profoundly a though trying to read inmost thought then laid hand in have weight substance touched palm a light summer wind might have touched cheek butterfly wing might have fluttered with just perceptible pulsation within hollow of hand so laurence threw open high french window together passed out onto grey semicircular flight of step immediately below lay italian garden formal flower border faintly dripping fountain black spire like cypress white balustrade statue vague mysterious in starlight great lawn stretched away beyond crossed by broad gravel walk showed pale for fifty yard then be lost in dusky shadow of grove of lime tree in north be wide white light travelling since march night now grew short along horizon through quiet hour from last death flush of sunset to first birth flush of dawn lawrence watched companion anxiously a little foot in diamond powdered slipper crossed window sill with impalpable hand in scarcely perceptible flutter a of captive butterfly against finger must not entertain fear that strong open air might work change in that might be drawn up absorbed by sharp glittering starlight that might be resolved into nothingness by keen breath of night that sturdy sea breeze might arise blow quite away such a be woman sprite visitant from beyond gate of grave remained by side together passed down garden alley lingered by dripping fountain watching sleepless fish moved silent a dainty lady through water of lichen encrusted stone basin stood together beneath dark cypress even on winter night smell dry warm of south talk in husky whispering accent of classic land of marble column mellow with age saffron plastered wall over great vine hang in hot crack of scorpion breed light footed lizard glance scamper still together went on unspoken sympathy between growing deepening down second flight of step along broad gravelled way here in open space whole panorama of heaven be disclosed then almost in spite of laurence broke into utterance talked a never even in most brilliant moment have talked before scene be so majestic moreover have so perfect listener movement of whose graceful body glance of whose profound gentle eye expressed comprehension accord a when violin string answer in exquisite melody to skilfully handled bow so forgetting ceasing to exercise reticence half humorous half reverent with a with cloak modern civilised man strives to hide noblest purest of thought laurence laid bare heart soul to sweet companion told tender trivial incident of youth childhood in of little moment yet such a leave indelible mark on imagination character told of splendid hope of opening manhood when with magnificent self confidence of inexperience whole world seemed to conquer if pleased told of play poem so full of promise must have realised fulness of own conception must have rendered name famous through coming year told too of brief fugitive moment of spiritual illumination when have felt draw very near to ultimate meaning purpose of thing when have apprehended god a eternal lover soul of man a eternal bride how in light of blessed apprehension confusion have ceased life death becoming at once very simple very holy guiltless alike of suffering of shame then a wandered yet further into thin shadow of still leafless lime tree sitting for while upon stone bench beside broad dim walk looked forth under down sweeping branch to vast expanse of distant country descended from discourse of high matter told of joy of manly sport pastime of still greater joy of travel adventure in far country among alien people by land sea thus did hour pas in glad fearless communion of heart with heart soul with soul while upon horizon white light walked slowly surely eastward then at last seemed a though disturbing thought invaded fairy lady mind causing attention to waver gentle gaiety to wane purport of thought laurence failed to read troubled with sensation of helplessness a though gulf be once again opening between state of being hers be powerless to cross rose from place beside moved restlessly to fro when pleaded with questioned moved yet further from stood with one hand raised a imploring silence appeared to listen for call summons quite other than welcome for must see corner of dear mouth droop once more while eye grew shy wild unwillingly a though constrained by force did not love yet must obey passed out on to clear smooth space of great lawn grass blade be touched with whiteness of frost laurence observed that footstep little frill bordering gown a swept left track upon spangled turf sheep bell sounded plaintively from far off fold rabbit slipped out timorously from edge of wood to take morning feed perceiving threatening presence waxed bold skipping gambolling upon frosty grass then with sullen roar breaking up gracious quiet of nature with hoarse voice of man business man necessity of labour unappeasable unrest train thundered along valley leaving long trail of pale smoke hanging among grey brown mass of indistinguishable tree roar died out a have come sullen imperative to last there followed pause a though for minute two nature living creature held breath then from near stable from distant homestead farm cock challenged one in tone high shrill faint low heralding sunrise telling world that day be once more born immediately to consternation laurence beheld lovely companion friend turn away without farewell without smallest apparent recollection of presence flit a bird rather a rose red rose leaf driven by storm wind across lawn past dripping fountain sighing cypress of italian garden back back up grey step in at open window of silent house followed rapidly sun ray shot up into eastern sky a crossed window sill within glory of sunrise struggled with unyielding glare of electric light object corner recess be clearly seen room be vacant once again fairy lady have vanished leaving trace sweet presence be removed laurence found alone xi something drummed drummed in obedience to sound appeared to laurence that returned whence knew not across most prodigious space ever traversed by spirit of man then matter explained be on board ship once again awakened to familiar pounding of engine drum of screw opening eye must rest on white iron wooden wall of state room alert figure of bedroom steward announcing fair morning sir bath ready sir impression be so distinct that took second to focus actual whereabouts stately serious bed chamber

must in probability never meet again abnormal situation in at present time found if one must grasp situation deal with at once justly sympathetically thought man must do so since appeared to have passed limit of denial scepticism reached that composure poise of mind wherein revolt cease capacity of acceptance belief becomes almost unlimited perhaps unfortunately laurence put inclination towards free speech from a temptation be not bound by promise to dead be bound still more perhaps by personal pride appeared to free speech must be yielding weakness so answered suavely yet with sufficient loftiness to leave room for further question behind curtain be that indirectly have procured great pleasure of receiving here to day a spoke turned led way in direction of hall again be

sense of harmony arose certain stirring of hope during day night of past week while great ship ploughed way eastward across mighty ridge furrow of atlantic have not be wholly unconscious of hope hope that even now might not be over that might once again be blessed by vision for however brief space of dear fairy lady yet have kept that hope under with stern hand be present at postern gate so to

clammy dank in place by water wreckage of pretty costly furniture lay scattered in formless heap upon blackened floor with here there shred of fine porcelain gilt handle of drawer page of book reduced to tinder unlovely remnant of carpet hanging be a place have suffered siege relentless foeman have sacked trodden underfoot so that came to laurence very surely that not here must find sweet fairy lady be indeed destined in life ever to find again gentle spirit must never be subjected to indignity of dwelling amid scene of destruction incongruity be inadmissible to imagination be too violent too gross therefore day of beloved companion pilgrimage be ended must not be otherwise in respect of once so comely place though convinced that here be useless to await presence there remained somewhat for laurence in tenderness reverence to see since electric light be now unavailable have ordered candle to be placed upon chimney piece though yellow disfigured still remained practically

vain endeavour to find key to little treasure chest be also key to love have so pathetically lost be here also to same hard narrow bed that have returned with quick innocently gladsome farewell in first flush of returning day when love by unprecedented circumstance circumstance trenching on actual miracle have be restored to viewing that harsh meagre resting place for better part of century

set apart by faith piety of age a be that pleasant plot of sun visited grass where little shadow danced beckoned in age old quiet of stoke river churchyard there must go watch for possible coming pay homage of devotion when small hour drew on towards to morrow dawn meanwhile there be time to be passed did not care to leave spot though present desolation tore at very vitals with memory of incalculable promise of unconsummated delight a awakening from dream of satisfied love long ago during strange former existence in summer noon under light sibilant shelter of lime grove so now hungered for completeness of possession for crowning of desire yet kept in hand even a have kept young brown thorough bred horse in hand when finding level must have broken pace run riot more than once on road up from station moved away sat down on defaced ragged sill of bay window moon have risen mild light be often obscured by softly moving float of thin opalescent vapour crossed face in

appalling vista of human life behind of be outcome result in have consciously unconsciously taken part there be certain splendour in thought though left little room for personal vanity yet even while watching pondering of personal note remained for pondered also not without profound discouragement of great adventure just now appeared so signally to have failed at half hour hour striking clock warned that night be far spent still that endless mystic procession passed before watching eye a once before in same room individuality seemed to sink away from while horrible sense of own nullity nothingness prevailed at last at last when first chill grey of dawn began just perceptibly to lighten horizon behind lime grove last of trailing vapour arose passed over disappeared moon declined towards setting yet though hung low whole field of heaven be at length own then laurence rose went away across quiet park up deep tree shadowed lane to churchyard on hillside across valley sheltered by bank of high lying wood grass be long starred with tall growing buttercup blue speedwell ox eye daisy heavy hanging with wet only plot beneath grey wall of little chancel be neatly mown while on

dissipated wherever light footstep might now tread must never in visible fashion tend earthwards again then on sudden from stable up at house came crowing of cock answered in gallant challenge from cottage from farmyard growing faint in far distance ringing out again close at hand lusty vigorous full of joy of living stung by merry sound laurence straightened up looked away from osier bound rose crowned grave over fertile peaceful landscape hop hung heavy upon pole corn warmed to ruddy yellow grass hedgerow a sun ray touched glittered with thousand diamond point even a lost love little embroidered slipper have glittered when first led forth along alley of italian garden glad wind swept up landward from great thoroughfare of nation highway of stately ship narrow channel sea raced
