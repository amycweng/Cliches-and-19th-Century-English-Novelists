evening light suggestion of youthfulness about brown eye pretty though rather small snapped even a did of parrot excitement to night be very much excited invariably produced in serena effect of clutching at long departed girlhood effect sufficiently pathetic in case of woman well on in forty be precisely ineffectual throw back to serena of seventeen eighteen lent sharp edge of irony to strident salutation of parrot a called out again hullo girlie polly own pet girlie then with prolonged ear piercing whistle hi four wheeler girlie going out hoarsely with growl in throat move on there stoopid ca yer shut door during delivery of final admonition mr iglesias have recognised shadowy figure standing on threshold advanced decided serena still twisting ribbon of yellow work bag round thin finger drifted into room think have have pleasure of meeting once twice before miss lovegrove dominic said manner be specially gentle courtly for must not feel poor lady be at disadvantage owing to very articulate indiscretion of parrot oh yes serena answered certainly have met be wrong a to number of time be more than once twice five time think may have be six be five because remember be expected in evening day before went home winter before last at last moment be unable to come must have made six now be only five have excellent memory iglesias said be kind of to remember so clearly wonder if be mean wonder whether be kind serena rejoined be quite innocent of intention of sarcasm mind like of so many unoccupied consequently occupied person be addicted to speculation of minor vacuous sort be also liable a such person often be to mistake cavilling for spirit wit most tedious error still be right in saying have good memory added people generally observe then be always taught be rude to forget forgetfulness be result of inattention at school never have difficulty in learning by heart must have found that useful pleasant talent perhaps serena replied negligently be determined not to commit having arrived at conclusion that mr iglesias ' address be too civil be bad manner of not to remember how often have met said to herself now be trying to pas off wo do serena have many distinct view on subject of manner manner be never certain that civility did not argue defect of sincerity agreed with to think that over again later meanwhile must carefully remark mr iglesias if be insincere a fear be be sure to betray in other way then will be on guard forewarned be of course forarmed serena felt very acute though against exactly what be taking such elaborate precaution must have be difficult for for anyone else to have stated however just now be incumbent upon to make conversation a be way with person not very fertile in idea have recourse to simple expedient of asking leading question be fond of animal inquired be afraid have very little knowledge of animal iglesias replied serena laughed dryly be so transparent subterfuge what very odd answer said because everybody must really know whether like animal not be afraid stand by then solitary exception have have little nothing to do with animal have therefore have opportunity of discovering whether attract not how very odd serena repeated moved across to centre table where mr lovegrove book of picture postcard miscellaneous consequence of many charity bazaar kindred aesthetic treasure reposed deposited work bag in company movement revived attention of parrot who have be nodding on perch poor old girlie take brandy soda kiss be friend good night murmured hoarsely half asleep if question bore reference to particular animal stand in doubt a to sentiment dominic remarked be anything fond of think odious bird ah see do know serena exclaimed be sure did felt justified in suspicion of sincerity nobody must agree with mr iglesias because of course be really very clever parrot very seldom learn to say so many thing how fortunate dominic permitted to ejaculate see why must say be fortunate remark strike a somewhat impertinent intrusive wonder if animal can be impertinent serena said reflectively here to vexation for appeared to that have just started really interesting subject of discussion mr lovegrove bustled into room well mr iglesias began be sure be very delighted to see so will georgie be be remarking only yesterday seem to see so much of a used to do be just little behind time be georgie having be kept by dear vicar at meeting about church worker social evening guild at mission room in little bethesda street must know where be mr iglesias though ca help hoping will day serena know serena be where susan elder sister miss lovegrove aside to dominic gave address once to member of society for conversion of jew doubt remember susan be always giving address somewhere serena said loftily very good kind of be to give address mr lovegrove rejoined even dear vicar say what remarkable gift have a speaker there be question a to worth of praise wonder if be mean wonder if be good kind of susan to give address serena remarked because of course enjoys giving susan like to have number of people listening to if object be noble one from mr lovegrove little nonplussed put about still if enjoy doing anything how can be good kind to do serena said argumentatively susan be very fond of publicity think people very often deceive about own motif looked meaningly at dominic iglesias a spoke looked back at gravely kindly though with slightly amused smile thought have travelled away have done so pretty frequently during last twenty four hour to smirking conscious little house on verge of barnes common unpromising though have appeared outwardly yet within believed have found friend friend who be also enigma perhaps a now reflected woman be enigma certainly be amazingly different thought of poppy looked at serena yes doubtless be enigma only might heaven forgive discourtesy be not enigma equally well worth finding out george lovegrove arrived supper somewhat heavy hybrid meal followed comfortable friendly a mr lovegrove described ceremony fal lals everything put down on table so that must see please serena however be difficult to please picked daintily at food on plate host observed with solicitude do take little more said in anxious aside mr lovegrove being safely engaged in conversation with mr iglesias will begin to be nervous lest be offering quite what like serena be obdurate pray mind george said know never eat much be quite different from susan for instance always have large appetite so have friend low church people always have think never care to eat great deal especially in hot weather serena be really very glad indeed to come to london just now still there be respecting decency to be observed specially in presence of guest relationship doe not necessarily imply social equality a serena reminded family always have felt that poor george have married beneath therefore be well to keep fact of own superior refinement well in view in case of good george lovegrove be however work of supererogation for have to positively embarrassing respect for serena gentility embarrassing because at moment came painfully near endangering completeness of consideration for wife feeling two lady frequently differed upon matter of taste etiquette with result that good man guileless breast be torn by conflicting emotion for have not serena father be general officer of indian army have not serena elder sister susan person of definite view commanding character long be resident at slowby in midlandshire inland watering place of acknowledged fashion followed that pronouncement on social question be necessarily final yet to uphold judgment a against that of wife be to risk mortifying latter to mortify wife must be to act a heartless scoundrel hence situation for george lovegrove difficult to point of producing profuse perspiration night serena prepared for rest with remarkable deliberation clad in blue white striped cotton dressing gown sat long at toilet table time wondered far reaching mazelike elaborately intricate wholly inconclusive wonder hers be nature suffered perpetual solicitation from possible alternative hearing warning voice from vague delusive region of might be might have be have never grasped rudimentary very important truth that only that actually

fitted batlike in half darkness of innumerable small prejudice ignorance moved a do so many woman of class in twilight embryonic world untouched alike by splendour terror of living nevertheless on particular occasion a brushed hair inserted tortoise shell curling pin must secure to morrow decorative effect felt almost daring dangerous wondered whether have really enjoyed evening not whether have held own shown independence spirit laboured under quaint early victorian notion that in presence of member of opposite sex woman be called upon always to play something of part must advance so to speak then retreat provoke interest by studied indifference yield little only to become more elegantly fugitive may be doubted whether wile have even be very successful adjunct to feminine charm in case of so negative colourless creature a serena be pathetically devoid of result play part industriously a might majority of audience be wholly unaware that be in point of fact playing anything at might think little capricious little foolish that there be intention purpose in pallid flightiness passed bound of imagination never mind if audience have sense of position serena have enjoyed excitement possessed eye snapped even yet a thinking over fastened curler in hair wondered whether george rhoda how intensely disliked name rhoda have special reason for asking just now talking so much about mr iglesias whether be coincidence of course be not of slightest importance to whether have not reflected think must be rather impertinence if have still think have better find out without letting rhoda suspect of course if give encouragement rhoda be inclined to go too far say what be rather indelicate always have thought rhoda have rather vulgar mind wonder if poor george feel believe doe before once twice to night be very nervous how dreadfully coarse poor rhoda skin be getting wonder if rhoda have given susan hint if be what made susan so gracious about leaving home believe did mean that susan suspected that george rhoda have particular reason for inviting wonder if will ever make susan see be not cipher of course if george rhoda really have particular reason susan come to know will show that other people consider cipher wonder what most people must think of mr iglesias of course have only be bank clerk then so have george only then be foreigner that make difference wonder whether if anything came of susan must make being foreigner objection be growing altogether too definite concrete with sort of mental squeak serena thought flitted into twilight embryonic region think if have particular reason be rather scheming of george rhoda wonder if be nice of if have think be rather deceitful wonder if have said anything to mr iglesias serena with aid of curling pin be controlling short fuzzy little hair just at nape of neck last wonder proved so absorbing one remained head bent finger aimlessly fiddling with bar of curler till suddenly occurred to that be getting quite stiff if have think be very presuming of continued wrathfully stretching arm for ached very presuming how glad be be on guard wonder if saw be on guard believe george did wonder if helped to make nervous serena fastened in last of curler there be excuse for sitting up longer yet lingered must be more on guard than ever said meanwhile dominic iglesias after sitting in dining room with old friend while latter smoked last pipe made way across green in deepening mystery of summer night sky be moonless at zenith untouched by upward streaming light of great city star showed fair

like deep pile carpet upon wide horizontal branch be worn sparse showing small promise of self renewal yet though starved by exhausted soil clogged by soot from innumerable chimney remained majestic finely decorative a tree of metal of age old bronze roughened by greenness of deep eating rust from first moment of acquaintance with cedar lodge have be to dominic iglesias object of attraction even of sympathy for recognised in something stoical unmoved dignity lofty indifference to sordid commonplace of surroundings made concession to adverse circumstance remained proudly owning for sole comrade wind that most mysterious of created thing unseen untamed mateless incalculable wind gave voice gave even measure of mobility a swept through labyrinth of dry unfruitful branch awoke husky

slate roof huge smoke belching chimney to to convulsive disgust of gentility of eastern side of trimmer green have have unpardonable impertinence to get erected in adjacent street followed that when one wet evening headed little mr farge have advised to speak slightingly of cedar tree iglesias be prepared to defend if necessary with warmth conversation have ranged round subject of hour namely possibility a yet in estimation of most person incredible one of war with boer republic when young man indulged in playful aside addressed to miss hart at whose right hand be seated if must find fault

private sentiment cutting down of cedar call for careful consideration be afraid must find serious loss to beauty of property what house loses in light certainly gain in distinction interest from

truthfully have replied that did not know that have ever gone away abstained must be great pleasure to cousin to have with said courteously serena looked at falling leaf wonder whether be mean wonder whether be pleasure to whether ask out of sense of duty paused gazing at mr iglesias of course know george have strong regard for for susan be only natural a be first cousin be not sure about rhoda of course never heard of rhoda until married george have made excellent wife iglesias put in suppose have serena said reflectively sometimes wonder whether if george have married somebody else might not have be more satisfactory in way serena felt very proud in making remark elicited reply however from mr iglesias wonder if really see that rhoda be on different level from wo admit whether doe see if doe see of course mean good deal do usually go out walking in morning dominic inquired silence be becoming protracted courtesy demanded that must break serena looked at with heightened intelligence be always brought up to take walk twice day mamma be very particular about believed that health have so much to do with regular exercise sometimes wonder whether did not carry that too far of course

never seen go out before indeed iglesias exclaimed little startled at close observation of habit implied by remark said of course one can see cedar lodge very plainly from george house often look out of window think among pleasure of london to look out of window have never seen go out in morning before again paused adding reflectively really seems rather odd that george rhoda must have told that have come back to remark suitable answer suggested moreover mr iglesias be growing slightly impatient wished must see fit to move aside let pas will get cold standing here said must not let detain

iglesias be in act of entering lovegroves front door worthy george held open for serena stood transfixed so be going there said to herself how extraordinary not to mention to what must have be object in not mentioning wonder if have only gone to see george to see rhoda a well if have gone to see rhoda then think have be exceedingly rude to have be very short sighted too if did want to know for might have taken for granted that of course must look back unless did do on purpose meaning to be rude serena resumed walk be very much excited of course may have done on purpose must see understand that meant something special that be going to speak to george rhoda about something in particular must not say before may have wanted to sound then be so very odd that must have said that george have never told have come back believe ever did say that serena be growing more more excited drifted along pavement in rustling petticoat with most unusually animated expression of countenance remember of

also in scarlet flannel blouse thickly powdered with gradated black disc in conjunction with purple chrysanthemum in black hat tawny hair freckled complexion did not constitute wholly delicious scheme of colour to fact mr lovegrove be supremely indifferent good afternoon miss hart said in stage whisper glancing towards serena still bright eyed erect let interrupt pray conversation will keep will just sit listen listen to what serena cried almost inarticulate with indignation why to recitation gentleman often treat to little in line of evening mr lovegrove after dinner dote on recitation piece of comic nature specially when well delivered must never dream of reciting serena declared heatedly really now miss hart returned that seems quite pity be such pleasant occupation for dull afternoon like do not think so miss lovegrove declare be quite sure from moment came into hall while be taking off waterproof that cousin be giving little entertainment of kind mr lovegrove voice be running up down in such very telling manner if glance must scorch miss hart must unquestionably have be reduced to cinder for rage possessed serena have worked up into fine fume of anger over purely imaginary injury now that eliza hart of people in world must intervene with suggestion of comic recitation detestable person serena said to herself conduct be positively outrageous of course knew perfectly well be doing nothing of kind really believe anybody must feel manner quite insulting wonder how george rhoda can tolerate show george have deteriorated much that must tolerate be not so surprised at rhoda

somebody appeared to have be extremely unreasonable disagreeable who that somebody be for very life of must not tell wife be out of question while to suppose serena approached high treason still be very sure must not be that most scrupulously courteous personage dominic iglesias there remained yet must knowingly vex fly thought a to vexing serena sometimes one doe wish female be not quite so

bosom heaved with generous sigh there be much ingratitude in world miss hart fear said pensively husband looked at in anguish of apology whether for own sin of others knew not exactly so there be mr lovegrove eliza responded warmly nobody be more speaking example of truth than peachie porcher when think of went through during married life yet so unsuspicious so trusting be enough to melt iceberg

by provocation recently received went over temporarily to side of enemy always have maintained mr porcher be full of heart declared throwing assertion across room much a though be stone in direction

real sentiment be now serena laid back ear so to speak be quite right to stay reflected wrathfully think mr iglesias be unusually considerate miss hart george lovegrove said tentatively be quite sensible of mr porcher kind attention naturally be very tenacious of upsetting household arrangement giving additional trouble then position of bachelor be delicate miss hart must admit mr lovegrove chimed in be what always tell georgie may do very well in younger day to be unattached a gentleman get on in life do need own private establishment be sure be sorry for in chamber even in good room like at cedar lodge for be not same a home miss hart never can be there must be awkwardness on side at time especially when come to illness then great eliza gathered together for appeared to forecast have be just that be indeed marching to victory yes there be denying that said be more than glad see in light mr lovegrove between ourselves have more more ever since certain gentleman gave up work in city must be premature to speak freely just between friend under rose being interested in one party in other there can be harm in dropping hint ascertaining how land lie of course if came to pas must

regret did actually posse secret from one that slightly discreditable one be so foreign to experience of excellent couple that lay heavy upon heart moreover be aware of shame in presence of serena a

for lack of sorrow at impending departure serena manner be stiff abstracted combined with rustling of petticoat filled with anxiety be possible that knew thank george only egg not that one please be much too large prefer smallest be not feeling hungry must never call much of breakfast eater serena mr lovegrove observed in comfortable purring voice from behind tea urn be desirous to pacify guest now be rather hearty in morning always have be so know whether be good thing not a habit still think to day must force little must always make provision against journey then doubt be rather fatigued with packing getting home so late from theatre be pleased to think have outing last night here serena georgie tell play be very comical dare say be serena replied of course george must be much better judge of than be mamma be always very particular what heard saw when be child know be inclined to think thing vulgar other people only find amusing did not remark vulgarity think mr iglesias must countenance anything of kind in presence of lady must ascertain beforehand nature of piece to invited lady from george lovegrove tentatively oh of course say there be anything vulgar must not like to commit to opinion really have be to theatre very seldom mamma never encouraged going then of course old dr colthurst rector of st jude at slowby whose church always attended disapproved of theatre have great influence with mamma thought wicked indeed mr lovegrove commented must be sorry to think that a so many go may have come across evil of personally have son artist who be very wild believe remember to have heard dear vicar speak of dr colthurst a stern true protestant very grand preacher dare say be mean that son be wild know nothing about of course that dr colthurst be great preacher serena spoke abstractedly inspecting yolk of poached egg meanwhile a though on watch for unpleasant foreign body continued can not of course be expected to remember sermon though may have be taken to hear suppose certainly be taken be quite too much of child to remember susan remembers then susan be so very much older ceased to contemplate egg looked up at hostess susan must be very nearly age rhoda may be year eighteen month younger yes judging by difference between age mine must be quite eighteen month younger of course now susan think going to play wicked often wonder whether be not partly because dislike sitting still listening when other people be doing something susan like to take part in everything often wonder what must do in church if be not for response singing be sure must never sit out service where congregation did not join in susan can not bear choral service call un english romanising dislike mean dislike choral service then consider theatre wicked be not prejudiced against a susan be still can not deny that think do hear very odd thing see very over dressed people at theatre serena looked severely at host thereby heightening anxiety possessed for once again a so often during past eight ten hour picture presented perplexing fascinating to mental vision namely that of dear honoured friend grave stately dominic iglesias helping unknown lady of remarkably attractive personal appearance on with wonderful black velvet garment doing so in calmest way in world too a though be event of chronic occurrence while frill furbelow of voluminous skirt flowed in rosy billow about foot what did picture portend george lovegrove asked still more what did serena suppose portended do indeed mr lovegrove put in in amiable response to guest last remark be sensible of being hurt by allusion to age then serena be going knew that fact did not distress a deeply a might have done therefore rose superior to wounded feeling be many year since have be much of playgoer continued people tell be good deal changed not for better suppose dressing nowadays be sadly extravagant be sure know must always be timid of condemning anybody amusement there a always do say if want to keep happy mind there be so much be well to be ignorant of wonder if be mean wonder if be well to be ignorant of thing serena said reflectively of course if people think be willing to be ignorant encourages in deceiving think be very wrong to be deceitful sooner later be sure to come out then be very difficult to forgive people indeed be not sure be right to forgive with difficulty george lovegrove restrained groan food be a ash in mouth tea a water of bitterness oh must be sorry to go a far a serena mr lovegrove remonstrated if give way to unforgiving feeling can never tell quite where may carry a be going to say though be not much of playgoer be very pleased to have mr iglesias invite only a explained to be very liable to find seat too narrow for comfort in place of amusement atmosphere be often so very close too be most polite sympathising then be mr iglesias over always be perfect gentleman serena paused fork arrested in mid transit to mouth be not sure that agree with rhoda said be not sure whether think mr iglesias be really polite whether only appears to be so because suit purpose of course george know far better than do perhaps understand can not pretend understand may be wrong often wonder whether there be not good deal be rather insincere about mr iglesias after throwing bomb serena gave whole attention to breakfast usually george lovegrove must have waxed valiant in defence of friend guilty conscience held tongue tied not so rhoda strive a might allusion to age still rankled under cover of protest against injustice to absent paid off little of private score to warm satisfaction well be sure cried never must have credited that anybody must question mr iglesias genuineness must sooner doubt georgie must fear deceitful again good man came near groaning be a though wife planted poignard in heart after playing piano to so frequently few day mr iglesias stopped here seeming so comfortable together friendly inviting to theatre really must say do think sadly changeable serena do be not changeable rhoda other lady declared voice colour rising slightly nobody ever accused of being changeable before like think be at justified in making such accusation be observant always have be so even susan allows be very observant can not help being so wish to help think be much safer help to find out who can really trust of course observed great deal happened last night felt from first owed to myself to be particularly on guard because certain insinuation have be made know rhoda have made more than once people might have thought that thing have gone rather far when mr iglesias be stopping here believe mr porcher dreadful miss hart did think say that thing did go far only say that people might naturally think that have on several occasion mr iglesias ' conduct did seem very marked of course nothing must be more odious to than to be placed in false position one can not be too careful especially with foreigner mamma always warned against foreigner when first came out never have experience of foreigner until met mr iglesias here at house be sorry to say believe now mamma be perfectly right a ended harangue serena with petulant movement of thin hand pushed plate away from table edge leaving vacant space before be a declaration of war scorned further subterfuge announced demonstration bright spot of colour burned on cheek small head on long stalk of neck be carried very erect be one of pathetic moment when merciless revelation of morning sunshine notwithstanding slim faded middle aged spinster appeared to recapture very effectively charm promise of vanished youth excited by foolish anger animated by sense of insult wholly misplaced imaginary became very passably pretty person immature hopeful serena of eighteen looking forth from eye of narrow souled disappointed serena of eight forty of course george may have explanation of what happened last night went on speaking rapidly if have think must be only fair that must offer to took for granted must do so morning a soon a met that must send to rhoda to explain if felt too awkward about speaking a be determined to ignore what happened be forced to speak dare say must be much more convenient to knowing have made mistake to pas whole thing over in silence really can not consent to if mr iglesias meant nothing all along then think have behaved disgracefully if did mean something at first then speaker gasped changed mind might at least have given hint ought to have refused to stop here of course did refuse george lovegrove faltered be really dreadful far worse than anything have anticipated have not notion what be safe to say do wish female mind be little le ingenious commented to see lot must never have entered head for instance still mr iglesias came cried belligerent serena yes over persuaded be very unwilling very so indeed saying that staying out be altogether foreign to practice pointed out to that wife might feel rather mortified if omitted to come having taken interest in illness if made use of name george took great liberty be very distressed to hear say that serena wife certainly supposed wished to come looked imploringly at spouse asking support for once large kindly countenance failed to beam responsive plaintive expression overspread surface then unhappy man stared despondently out into misty morning sunshine plastering down shiny hair with moist shaky hand even wife turned against making feel outcast at own breakfast table must have wept have be so very guarded throughout serena resumed that be impossible must have slightest excuse for using name of course if have done so position be more than ever odious there be nothing for to do to go fortunately be going be thankful if have followed own inclination must have gone long ago then must have be spared nothing must have be said now sort of thing may be said because of course must look very odd show how foolish be to allow one judgment to be overruled stayed entirely to oblige rhoda can not see have be trifled with serena not that never that host cried distractedly if have be in wrong apologise from heart trifling never entered thought how must do so with respect have for susan may have be clumsy acted for best be afraid can not agree retorted be useless to apologise be sorry to tell so george for have trusted until now do feel be afraid always will feel have be very unkindly treated by rhoda rose rustling a spoke parrot meanwhile leaving off preening feather regarding head very much on one side with wicked eye please leave to myself said want anybody to help if do will ring for maid want to compose before go to lady samuelson after unpleasantness be much better for to be alone good bye girlie poor old girlie hi p'liceman

imploringly at wife time tender heart must not resist appeal have not be open with relented giving opportunity to retrieve error moreover that naturally be very minor consideration be bursting with curiosity georgie asked solemnly whatever did happen last night mr iglesias met lady friend sent for to talk to in lobby between act answered red deepening in clean fresh coloured face not of designing cedar lodge lot oh dear not all replied childlike eye full of gratitude blessed magnanimity of wife speedily embarrassment supervened found subject singularly difficult to deal with not at of class confess did surprise for though have always taken for granted dominic belonged to higher circle by birth than in have known have idea have such aristocratic acquaintance look manner in public last night made seem fitted for company still be surprised did not introduce can not say have convenient opportunity lady may not have wished must fancy might hold little above between believe be what so upset serena be of opinion mr iglesias be just a well without serena mr lovegrove declared suppose can not help temper be sadly uncertain begin to fear must be very exacting in marriage be lady young georgie good man blushed furiously yes under thirty must suppose very striking to look at serena have called attention to already thought over dressed be judge of must see be very beautiful oh georgie dear in high protest for speaker belonged to section of british public in puritanism be even yet deeply ingrained with dreary consequence that beauty whether of person in art be suspect to admit existence trench on immodesty to speak of openly be to skirt edge of licence george lovegrove however have developed unaccustomed boldness so be dear repeated not squinting in least for once be beautiful dark splendid with eye looked right through mocking yet mournful made noble couple dominic notwithstanding disparity of age a stood there together felt honoured to see if dominic iglesias be to have friend with whom be unacquainted though deny thing hurt little at first be glad must be so handsome fine seems to fitting a if be in true sphere at last silence followed profession of faith during mr lovegrove face presented singular study stared at husband in undisguised amazement while corner of mouth large soft cheek quivered well must never have expected to hear talk so georgie said huskily seems unlike somehow almost a though be despising own flesh blood answered must never do must never be so forgetful of owe to own family to yours rhoda be under deep obligation to must be dishonest to deny set wonderfully high value on dominic iglesias regard have done so ever since be boy together at school to dominic have always stood by knowing how superior be to in mind in else so that have be truest honour privilege to be admitted to intimacy with difference between never came home to a did when saw in other company last night be fitted for higher position than have ever filled yet used to allow in old day at bank for society can offer so though felt humiliated in measure felt glad for can grudge nothing in way of new friend even though may be differently placed to ourselves must come between little making intercourse frequent easy than in past from heart wish very best be going although must be rather detrimental to myself mr lovegrove cheek still quivered expression of face be unresponsive once more not to say obstinate jealousy indeed possessed for first time in whole experience realised husband a individual a human entity independent of to contemplate otherwise than in marital relation be shock to felt deserted potential ariadne on naxos hence jealousy resentment cruel hurt well to be sure what long story cried in tone approaching sarcasm about someone who be relation too posse georgie be bit like seems to morning everybody bewitched heaved up out of chair will go try to make up with serena continued be only christian charity to do so poor thing can well understand may have have cause enough for mortification now have made out what really did take place last night usually left alone in dining room george lovegrove must have proceeded methodically to do number of neat little odd job humming softly while funny shapeless little tune to in fulness of guileless content must have piled up fire with small coal dust thus keeping alight saving fuel till luncheon time when one skilful stir with poker must produce cheerful blaze then must have proceeded to little conservatory opening off box of sanctum at back of house

between lace curtain out on to green sun have climbed sky burning up hoarfrost mist so that house opposite have become clearly discernible presently beheld tall upright figure emerge from front door of cedar lodge for moment mr iglesias stood at head of flight of immaculately white stone step rolling up umbrella putting on glove preparatory to setting forth on morning walk watching wave of humility self depreciation swept over george lovegrove gentle candid soul combined with aching regret that destiny have not seen fit to deal with rather otherwise than actually have felt great longing that too be possessed of stately presence brain breeding handsome look there stirred in almost impassioned craving for romance for escape from interminable respectability domesticity of english middle class suburban life went step further rebelling against feminine atmosphere surrounded in feeling so constantly usurped place of action supposition that of fact then vision of beautiful woman with strange rose scarlet dress in whose eye sorrow struggled with mocking laughter once again assailed who might be what history most emphatically knew not yet that breathed keener more tonic air than to be habituated that feeling in case did not stand for action supposition for fact be fully convinced poor old chappie take brandy soda got hump shrilly from parrot hanging head downwards from roof of cage at sound of at once unhuman singularly confidential voice close beside george lovegrove gave guilty start yes wife be quite right said half aloud if want to keep happy mind there be very much of

supposed either george must have referred to what dreadfully bad taste of rhoda added mentally believe have better go must mark displeasure teach to be more guarded with in future then perhaps have something to say really ought to know perhaps must be mistake to go perhaps have better stay want to be too harsh with rhoda truth being that actually itched to hear more for to serena wholly

excited have seemed to herself to occupy most interesting position demanding infinite tact during month have elapsed have rehearsed history of incident of hour of intercourse with dominic iglesias thousand time weighing word discounting look of indulging in unlimited speculation analysis until proportion of have occurred be magnified beyond possibility of recognition let alone of sane relation to fact to herself therefore serena have become heroine of elaborate intrigue greatly increased importance in own eye though be studiously silent regarding subject save in indirect allusion said self importance reacting upon about gained for herself opinion degree of consideration to be unaccustomed highly relished never have serena presented so bold front to philanthropic very possessive elder sister never have enjoyed so much attention in small rigidly select circle of slowby society in miss susan moved serena spoke with authority upon subject on strength of purely fictitious affair of heart be not first woman who have made capital out of non existent in kind will probably be last nevertheless be very far from admitting great benefit mr iglesias have so unconsciously conferred upon regarded a deeply injured person irreparably injured for own diplomacy admirable caution knowledge of world self respect be well aware be trying subject to approach mr lovegrove replied with praiseworthy mildness be far from blaming for turning from serena be sure have weighed sadly on mind on george too not that have said much must see how felt then great deal have come out since be why be so gratified to have call here to day so will georgie be have taken dreadfully to heart finding how have be taken in seeing how wrong must put with with susan be very proper that must say that rhoda other observed with condescension think owe to to express regret must have be sorry if george have proved indifferent for have be very careful in what have told susan of course might have spoken

of wife humble state that received thrust without murmur poor georgie be too upset to tell even for long time continued somewhat irrelevantly may judge by how badly felt knew how shocked must be must take a such insult to dear vicar after kindness that friend of ours whom have talked to in house must turn romanist who what cried serena have determined to maintain superior impassive attitude at point curiosity became rampant refusing further circumlocution delay why mr iglesias to be sure mr lovegrove answered hardly restraining evidence of satisfaction news be lamentable doubt to have miss fire in recital of must have made ten time more lamentable still worst of be continued refreshed by effect upon hearer kept dark for in least know how long mentioned date poor georgie be too upset to ask of course be well known how double romanists be always taught to be not be ever acquainted with never meet out be glad to think where visit still that mr iglesias who be quite one of a may say so intimate always appearing perfect gentleman so open honest ah there be wrong rhoda other lady put in with decision while making violent effort to recover impassivity superiority george may be surprised be not always have suspicion of mr iglesias told so more than once at time george be annoyed now see be right be seldom mistaken even susan admits be very observant after extraordinary

not mention to that be here when commenced never supposed never never there must be coldness between when have heard others speak of trouble with husband have always pitied poor thing from heart held mainly responsible now think differently miss eliza hart mum shrilly from little house parlourmaid serena rose a well a hostess superiority counselled departure curiosity urged remaining of course must feel justified in staying if rhoda pressed to do so said to herself rhoda in very act of greeting new guest did press to do so surely be not leaving yet said plaintively must hurt not to have stay to tea georgie must be sadly disappointed to think have missed thus admonished serena graciously consented to remain miss hart a last arrival being necessarily invited to assume place of honour upon sofa serena selected chair at a great distance from historic article of furniture a exigency of conversation permitted must show stay not to see solely on georgie account commented inwardly have

one call for silence wife large cheek quivered ominously while serena rustled whether in sympathetic agreement with sentiment expressed by last speaker in protest against presence of former one must be difficult to determine wonder whether be not best rhoda mean wonder whether be not best to be silent remarked reflectively think people be not usually half cautious enough what tell so many disagreeables can be avoided if be really on guard mamma impressed that upon when be child be very careful often think susan be hardly careful enough most trouble arise through trusting other people too much be poor darling peachie over miss hart declared with fine appreciation of opportunity too great trustfulness have be worst fault a always tell generous pet not that gentleman be ungrateful mr lovegrove must not have suppose that poor mr smyth for instance whom be afraid have accused of being very surly bearish at time have come out wonderfully lately must be hard nature indeed peachie

unfortunate domestic past between peachie help to bring together of course mean nothing to mr lovegrove lady addressed swallowed convulsively be not blessed with such good fortune a yours great eliza continued mr smyth have be very open with peachie recently have surprising tale to tell knowing very well be going on in society reminds of certain gentleman who doe not live thousand mile from here mr smyth have hinted at much be very startling in direction speaker paused again must be intrusive to ask whether have be favoured with much of mr iglesias ' company during last few week mr lovegrove

supervision if cleaning be to be thorough if see to then can have nobody to blame so have have frequently to deny to visitor gave sigh of relief trusting have loyally steered conversation into safer channel great eliza be not thus to be thwarted asked on peachie porcher account declared not on own mr lovegrove be of le than consequence to except for sake of cedar lodge how certain gentleman spends time peachie interest must be protected with establishment such a ours good name be everything 'you can not be too particular for talk of fastness place must go down a say to here wife natural rectitude sense of justice triumphed over prejudice wounded sensibility be sure must never believe anyone must have occasion to accuse mr iglesias of fastness said of course change of religion be dreadful particularly in one who must have known better though foreigner having have advantage of being brought up in england nobody can be more aware of than mr lovegrove have be sad grief to voice quavered doubt early rising fish meal do make lot of work unpleasantness in house hold a to fastness well miss hart can not find in conscience to agree to anything a bad a with preternatural solemnity great eliza shook head seeing be believing mr lovegrove replied when lady call dressed in tiptop of fashion very stylish doubt not quite style peachie porcher can countenance circumstanced a be with gentleman guest then there be what mr smyth hinted at subsequently just in friendly way did not say be actually acquainted with lady intimated that must say very much more if chose mr lovegrove regret to speak knowing how long certain gentleman have be acquainted there can be question peachie porcher interest have be trifled with affection also here aggressive rustling on part of serena arrested flow of miss hart eloquence spoke believe miss lovegrove inquired did not speak serena cried vulgar designing person what presumption cried to herself anyone must feel insulted by manner think have put at disadvantage be mistaken know more than supposes be greatly enraged for unreasonable though may appear if trifling be about on part of dominic iglesias serena reserved to herself monopoly in respect of few thing perhaps be more galling to woman than assertion that lovelace have be guilty of misleading attention to others besides if be not solitary object of affection let at least be solitary victim of perfidy that mr porcher must aspire to share role of betrayed one be to serena piece of unheard of impertinence refused to bestow further attention upon miss hart turned haughtily to hostess have idea when george will be in rhoda be quite willing to wait reasonable time for can not be expected to wait indefinitely must consider lady samuelson be long distance to ladbroke square of course trimmer green be very far out have to dress for dinner everything be very well done at lady samuelson make great point of punctuality of course be difficulty to to be punctual be brought up to be so mamma be always extremely particular about being in time said be very rude to be late think be rude so of course punctuality be quite natural to do object to being hurried so unless george be likely to be in almost directly really must go rhoda must be very mortified to have leave before come back must be sore disappointment to georgie to find have be here have missed good creature pleaded be something quite new for mr lovegrove to be out on at home day be eliza put in not without covert sarcasm never remember to have known happen before mr miss ballard please mum from house parlourmaid

very little time to call own so must not feel justified in making promise of course be just chance being able to come to day can tell george be sorry not to have seen must like to know be sorry be very kind serena other said humbly think rhoda have improved serena said to herself a walked across trimmer green between black iron railing think have more sense of position than did wonder whether think that if mr iglesias have proposed must have accepted of course think be very badly treated think manner show that certainly took part rather against odious miss hart believe really sided with think only appeared to do so to snub miss hart of course if have stayed must have have to stay too must have owed to myself to do so a went there be object in staying be wiser to seem quite indifferent about seeing george hope wo attempt to call upon at lady samuelson must hardly think must presume to do must tell butler if gentleman call to say be not at home if be only george must not so much matter must not run chance of having lady samuelson rhoda meet must not do at to have rhoda climbing into society through think be too bad to have people make use of like rhoda have tact see

leave home because have number of engagement still felt might regret afterwards if did not see then of course lady samuelson be so kind year before last when have so very much to worry that feel owe to to stay with whenever asks to do so where did see procession from rhoda well on whole thought better to remain at home mr lovegrove confessed though georgie be most pressing must go with be slender serena that make great deal of difference in going about find crowd excitement very trying then must have be very affecting solemn doubted if must witness without giving way too much troubling others be mortifying to feel be spoiling pleasure of be with wanted poor georgie to enjoy a much a must in case be certainly better to remain at home serena rejoined have feeling very much under control even when be quite child used to be said of used to irritate susan susan have more impetuous nature mr lovegrove observed day of domestic eclipse be happily passed have come into own again consequently be disposed to be slightly argumentative sitting here upon own chesterfield sofa in own drawing room even with serena wonder if have mean wonder whether susan really have more impetuous nature latter rejoined whether be only more wanting in self control often think people get credit for strong feeling when be only that make effort to control be unfair never have be able to see why be considered so creditable to have strong feeling usually give lot of inconvenience to other people be not sure that be not self indulgent to have strong feeling have excellent place just opposite marble arch of course lady samuelson have great deal of interest saw everything in way think a sight procession be overrated be glad went can never tell whether anything be worth seeing not until have seen so certainly might have regretted if have not gone still think be quite wise in not going rhoda if be likely to be upset then a say must be unpleasant getting about if one be very stout of course can not really enter into take after mamma family be always slender lovegroves often grow stout george of course have must not be surprised if susan did when be older then susan be entirely different in almost everything suppose have heard of dear vicar being appointed to new bishopric of slowby serena mr lovegrove remarked amplitude non amplitude of family figure be beginning to get upon nerve oh dear yes of course have serena answered with raised eyebrow condescending expression of countenance not that will make very much difference to suppose be so little at home now naturally people hearing knew nevingtons came to for information about think anybody have ever heard of dr nevington at slowby so be very glad to learn anything must tell of course be very great rise for dr nevington though will only be suffragan bishop still must be very much flattered after merely having parish of kind susan be very pleased at appointment wrote to dr nevington immediately have have number of letter from be quite willing must write told how popular appointment be in midlandshire thought be going rather far because susan have real mean of knowing whether be popular not must only know that thought liked have praised among friend wonder whether be right mean wonder whether really will like of course susan have be very prominent have have everything own way with most of clergyman wife in slowby think have be rather bad for susan given undue idea of own importance now naturally mr nevington will be head of everything clergyman wife will go for advice to see how susan can help disliking then mr nevington be said to be very good public speaker be perfectly certain susan will dislike for always observe that people who speak great deal like susan never get on well with other good speaker moved little throwing back front of black beaded jacket complimentary mourning be scrupulously correct adjusting black silk tie at throat of course may be mistaken added if ask rhoda fancy will find susan mr nevington will not remain friend for very long be distressed to hear express such opinion serena mr lovegrove returned tone of mingled patronage possession in guest spoke of own two particular sacred totem vicar vicaress incensed highly wished have not introduced subject of slowby bishopric when object in view be truly good one added with severity must suppose right meaning people must strive to sink petty rivalry cooperate must quite believe must prove so in susan case of course must not give mr nevington speaking well a reason if did not remain on friendly term serena returned negligently then people so very seldom give real reason for what do rhoda surely must have observed that think be generally very willing to deceive good deal be afraid be so with too many serena with who must be last to own when applied to then wife determined by piece of daring strategy to carry war into enemy country that reminds said suppose have heard that mr iglesias have left trimmer green least know what right have to suppose anything of kind rhoda lady addressed replied with haste asperity far from regal must have very odd idea of people meet at lady samuelson at slowby if imagine be likely to hear anything about mr iglesias from if have not met here of course must never have heard of at if have never heard of must have be spared great deal still after have occurred can quiet see mr iglesias might find better to leave trimmer green miss eliza hart if please ma'be from house parlourmaid in accordance with established precedent serena must have risen from place of honour upon sofa making room for newcomer defied precedent acknowledging said newcomer with stiffest of bow sat tight hostess however proved equal to occasion dear miss hart began be sure be quite stranger take chair will not how be mr porcher number trust filling up again at cedar lodge mr lovegrove did truly sympathise in mr porcher trouble in autumn terrible occurrence to have in house of course very damaging for time to prospect will always believe be great exertion made then that broke down poor mr iglesias ' health yes indeed miss hart regret to say doe remain very ailing mr lovegrove see almost daily have run round to holland street now have georgie expect back minute be just speaking of mr iglesias be not serena be about to tell miss lovegrove what sweet pretty house have have seen often doubt miss hart here serena arose with much dignity retired in direction of window pray think about rhoda said over shoulder let interrupt friend conversation be going to see if carriage be here lady samuelson said might be able to send for must not be sure might told must be on watch a object to horse being kept standing in weather pray think about until come can quite well amuse holding aside lace curtain looked out upon rawly green grass remnant of discoloured snow lay in unsightly patch while bare branch of plane tree balsam poplar shuddered in harsh blast prospect be far from alluring serena surveyed with wrathful eye really rhoda behaviour to be most extraordinary said to herself have to mark displeasure for poor george sake ought not to be allowed to go too far have grown so very self assertive last year manner be much better suppose george have made up again people who be not really lady like rhoda be always so very much nicer when be depressed wonder what have happened to make george make up with then fell very furiously to listening did talk over did peachie porcher great eliza be saying for deny at time of trouble certain gentleman came out very well may have have reason will not go into mr lovegrove be for giving everybody due peachie felt when left must be better connection must cease a far a visiting went behould mr iglesias call here dear liz said to ' must not refuse to see after have passed situated a be can not be too careful calling on bachelor living privately with whom name have be at associated must invite comment throughout said bey conscience tell have done duty in must find reward ' very affecting be not yes other lady admitted candour natural goodness of heart getting better alike of resentment diplomacy always have maintained there be many sterling quality in mr porcher so there be sweet pet eliza responded warmly sometimes question mr lovegrove whether certain gentleman now that have cut adrift from may not be beginning to find out wish have be le stand offish stony not that must be use now for if did not appreciate peachie porcher there be other younger gentleman not thousand mile from here who do be not at liberty to speak more plainly at present a poor young fellow be very shy about secret long attachment might think rather derogatory to peachie position to entertain straw tell way wind blow little bird seems to twitter to mr lovegrove if charlie farge did come to point why miss hart shook leonine mane laid finger on lip in arch playful manner before hostess must rally sufficiently from stupor into announcement plunged to make suitable rejoinder fine booming clerical voice large clerical presence invaded room how d 'ye do mr lovegrove come unannounced not unsanctioned met with good husband in street just now encouraged to look in on good day to miss hart be well trust with excellent friend mr porcher ah here be miss serena lovegrove unexpected piece of good fortune promptly serena have emerged from self imposed exile be with air of assured proprietorship that greeted clergyman mr nevington heard from kind sister only morning continued full of active helpfulness a usual mr lovegrove proposes that must quarter upon for few day miss serena while be seeking temporary residence kindly give name of several house considers worth inspection here by adroit flank movement rapidly executed serena managed to posse once again of seat of honour upon sofa thereby interposing thin impenetrable barrier between hostess latter own particular fetish bishop designate have enough room crowd rhoda remarked parenthetically then turning sideways so a to present expanse of neatly clad back shoulder to outraged relative continued wonder dr nevington mean wonder house susan have recommended of course there be priory nobody have lived in for age age be in very low neighbourhood close to canal brickfield on tullingworth road must think be dreadfully damp unwholesome there be old mr waghorn in abney park be well situated ground be rather nice reception room be poor always think susan be fond of mr waghorn can not say ever cared for myself there be tower to of course ah hardly need tower yet miss lovegrove beuffering bishop ' recall well worn joke such a must not aspire to anything approaching castle palace be content with very modest place of residence here unhappy hostess sitting quite perilously near edge of sofa craned round interposing barrier be only matter of time dr nevington said surely there be one voice round green through parish generally that be first step for that will lead on though be far from wishing to hasten death of present archbishop to primacy hardly that hardly that rejoined with becoming modesty yet speech be not unpalatable to out of mouth of babe said to leaning back in chair eyeing in imagination chaste outline of episcopal apron well cut black gaiter while vision of lambeth canterbury floated enticingly before hardly that be little more than embryo bishopric still though be wrench to leave dear old congregation here in wonderful london of ours can not refuse call to wider sphere of usefulness view a churchman be well known have never even though might have be professionally advantageous to to do so attempted concealment truly rhoda put in still balancing craning everyone be sure must bear witness have always be most nobly outspoken trust so returned have never disguised fact that take stand upon reformation settlement therefore can not think most hopeful sign of time must receive call to episcopate ah here be lovegrove find deep in matter ecclesiastical only hope be not taxing lady patience too heavily by talking on such serious subject in slowby that grand old stalwart late dr colthurst positively cromwellian figure have left sound protestant tradition hear good sister confirms rumour miss serena that there be strong ritualistic party at tullingworth will deal very roundly with person of persuasion conviction be that must suit teaching to progressive spirit of modern world of ours personally be willing if necessary to sacrifice very much so called dogma to conciliate worthy nonconformist brother while will lose opportunity of cutting at root of romanising tendency be so lamentably insidiously active in very heart of dear old national church while great drum like voice be thus rolling booming george lovegrove have shaken hand with serena there be none of accustomed respectful enthusiasm in greeting wore preoccupied dejected air for once looked upon pearl of spinsterhood with lack lustre indifferent eye wonder what can have happened to george lady in question said to herself in high displeasure think manner be really very odd nearly a odd a rhoda wish have not come then if have not come must have have opportunity of showing rhoda what intimate term susan be upon with nevingtons think be right must know oh detestable miss hart be going what dreadfully vulgar purple blouse have on hair be so unpleasant always look damp show mark of comb wonder why hair of particular colour always doe look damp here bowed stiffly without rising will simply ignore george not speak to think will be sufficiently marked will stay a long a dr nevington doe for one moment believe miranda samuelson really intended to send carriage so will just wait go when go think owe to myself to show george rhoda that can not drive away against will however much may wish to do so having come to amiable decision serena turned mind conversation to question of house hunting in slowby subject however began to pall before long upon companion dr nevington changed position more than once reply became vague perfunctory while attention evidently strayed to conversation taking place at other end of sofa fear did not find mr iglesias very bright then to day wife be inquiring in kindliest tone george lovegrove shook head sadly dear be sorry to say not have be rather broken up will tell later clergyman have risen iglesias ah yes said remember meeting person of name here once eh lovegrove one of parochial oversight unfortunately proved to be dweller appearance pleased proposed to call on then in press of many duty matter be forgotten serena have risen likewise spot of colour burned on of cheek eye snapped carried small head high presence asserted quite forcibly skirt rustled at moment be young very passably pretty elegant spirited serena of eighteen rather than faded ala spiteful serena of close upon fifty oh really think be just a well did not call dr nevington cried think must have be in least suitable of course may be wrong think must have found anything to like in mr iglesias there be so much that be never really explained about know acknowledged that at one time rhoda now george seem to have gone round again completely one can not help knowing associated with such very odd people then way in turned roman catholic of sudden really be disgraceful dr nevington cold watchful glance steadied on to speaker then travelled to two other member of little company in sharp inquiry george lovegrove innocent countenance bore expression of agonised entreaty of yearning of apology yet of defiance corner of rhoda mouth drooped large soft cheek shook yet stood firm sorrow tempered whole warm hearted person rendered stubborn by virtuous indignation forget greatly serena said when have time to think over will repent having passed such cruel remark be liable to create very wrong impression can not fail to cause severe pain to others for appreciable space clergyman hesitated slowby bishopric be ahead of trimmer green quaint unimportant little inhabitant behind be tedious doubt sister promised to be very useful so threw in lot with serena ah well ah well for part admire zeal must confess mr lovegrove said doubt terrible lapse will occur superstition bigotry will claim victim even in enlightened century free england of ours must not judge case of poor fellow iglesias too harshly race influence be strong of anglo saxon stock with enormous advantage of brain grit hard headed manliness of character can afford deeply though deplore weakness error to be lenient toward le favoured foreigner mission be to educate think must not have forgotten lovegrove must have acted upon must have brought unfortunate friend to must have be quite willing to give hour even longer few fact little plain speaking might have saved from more than quite care to contemplate here hereafter however good bye to mr lovegrove be starting too miss serena assure good kind sister when write how gladly mr nevington will avail ourselves of proffered hospitality fret take too much to heart georgie dear wife said soothingly later vicar did seem very stern be owing to serena be afraid be terrible mischief maker be serena turn thing inside out so in saying that recognise own word again afternoon be most trying if dr nevington real story must never blame must not fret be not fretting about dr nevington answered about dominic be afraid will not have with very much longer rhoda oh dear oh dear mean never cried in accent of genuine distress did see georgie miss st john be there wife large

nothing really wrong with many of be sadly free in manner must be very hurt if got into habit of frequenting society much georgie there be sure can not tell what be coming to woman nowadays seem a if
