set forth in rhyming doggerel poet be not blessed with gift of melody of style absence of scansion tortured ear coarseness of diction offended taste yet a read on julius reluctantly admitted that

gentleman to by mean too strait laced society of town court thence few year later sir thomas amiably willing in thing to oblige royal master brought home bride whose rank wealth according to censorious chap book be extensively in excess of youth virtue julius lingered little in contemplation of quaint wood cut representing arrival of lady at brockhurst clothed in bottle green bodice very

to reckon with seriously admit very actual permanent part play always have played in great drama of human life distressed in sense annoyed that legend of brockhurst have caused elaborate imaginative terror during childhood must belong to gross vulgar order of history yet indubitably a reluctantly admitted owner of brockhurst have very certainly found death in midst of life that according to rather brutal bloody pattern might of course be judged result of merest coincidence have leisure opportunity to search out must find doubt plausible explanation of majority of case only that fact of persistent violence persistent accident did remain stared in face so to speak defiant of denial deduction consequent upon stared in face likewise be constrained to confess that first clause of deeply wronged mother prediction have found ample fulfilment julius paused shifted position uneasily somewhat fearful of conclusion of own reasoning for how about second clause of same prediction how about advent of strange child of promise who preordained in own flesh to bear last heaviest stroke at hand of retributive justice must rightly bearing bring salvation to to race behind coarse illiterate

find age pathetic with obvious pathos of spent body of tired mind have ceased to greatly hope how far more deeply pathetic doe age from out sad settled wisdom find poor gallant youth still unbroken trust in beneficence of destiny unbroken faith in enchantment of earth meanwhile julius march product a be of arbitrary system of thought training by so much divorced from natural instinct of youth age alike confident joy of one mature acquiescence of other in overhearing brief conversation suffered embarrassment amounting almost to shame for not only katherine word vital gladness of voice sweet exuberance of manner a bent in spotless bravery of white rose above elder woman hand kissed came to a revelation before shrank with certain fearful modesty julius have read of love in poet of course

innocent of other audience than old friend to whom be fitting enough to confide dear secret for instant hesitated embarrassed too pride touched to annoyance at having laid bare treasure of heart thus unwittingly be tempted to retreat through still open door into library leave review of long gallery many relic to more convenient season be not katherine habit to run away least of from consequence of own action sense of justice compelled to admit that in case indiscretion if indiscretion indeed there be lay with in not having seen poor julius rather than with in having overheard little outburst so called to in friendly greeting came swiftly towards down length of great room julius stood waiting for leaning against frame of library ladder spare black figure notably at variance with broad glory of sunshine colour reigning out of door usually quick instinct of courtesy be in abeyance shaken a still be confused by revelation have just come to looked at lady calmady with new agitated understanding made so fair picture that must only gaze dumbly at tall in fact katherine be rendered taller by manner careless of passing fashion in hair be dressed warm brown mass of rolled up back from forehead showed perfect oval of face tender lovely smiling blue brown eye soft lustrous with certain wondering serenity in depth there be yet something majestic about katherine calmady poor unworthy line marred nobility of face figure dark arched eyebrow well chiselled slightly aquiline nose firm chin throat shapely hand denoted harmony completeness of development promised reserve of strength ready to encounter overcome if danger be to be met year afterwards remembrance of katherine a just then saw must return upon julius a prophetic of much quailing in spirit still reluctant in asceticism to comprehend reckon with personality in fulness of present manifestation answered at random with none of pause playful evasiveness usual to speech be very glad have found katherine said frankly be afraid by fact of not coming to breakfast that be overtired talked late last night did weary too much existence in be vexatiously wearisome at time at least to feeble person like katherine

ride way through east wood in cool see will put tidy a spoke katherine stooped to pick up scattered chap book from ground in last few moment while looking at yet further understanding have overtaken julius march not only mystery of human love mystery of dawning motherhood have come close to put lady calmady aside with determination of authority somewhat surprising pardon be dusty will soil hand

wash know just a well a own after thousand time better still will ask not to touch book have valid reason for one evil beast in form of spider have dwelt among disturbed fled looking a though have grown old in trespass sin seemed to thing of ill omen tried to steady to treat matter lightly yet speech struck katherine a hurried anxious out of proportion to matter in hand poor thing killed yet must help being ugly suppose answered not without touch of malice julius be on knee long thin finger gathering up tattered page ranging into bundle tying together with tag of rusty black ribbon aforesaid for unreasoning fierce desire be upon very alien to usual gentle attitude of mind to shield beautiful woman from acquaintance with foul story set forth in little book to shield indeed from more than merely that for vague presentiment possessed that might in mysterious way be intimately involved in final development of same story though august be so full of suffering so profoundly sad meanwhile in excitement replied le to gently mocking question than to importunity of own thought no said let go begin to fear be useless to attempt to take short cut to extinction of what be evil doe not cease merely change form unwillingly have learned that violent death be possible to thing evil julius rose to foot must go on continued till in merciful providence of god term be reached till power be exhausted till have worn out lady calmady turned moved thoughtfully towards far end of room where sunshine still slanted in through open casement of bay window where delicate little spinster lady stood awaiting amorous pigeon cooed below on string course bee droned sleepily against glass said in gentle remonstrance be rather terrible doctrine julius surely be not quite just for must seem to leave almost hopelessly at mercy of wrong doing of others yes be not just that of at mercy of wrong doing of others courageous forever suffering for cowardly wise for ignorant brutish just for unjust be not perhaps very deepest lesson of religion oh katherine cried incredulously there be something at once deeper more comforting than remember in beginning when god created thing reviewed handiwork pronounced very good julius be recovering suavity little packet of chap book rested safely in pocket of coat be long time ago said smiling reached bay window katherine took old friend hand

eye lip eloquent with joyous conviction indeed think god make whole creation over again for one of be so beautiful a in beginning so now said behold be very good ah yes who can doubt that be very good amen to may ever so continue julius murmured bowing head that evening there be dinner party at brockhurst lord denier brought handsome second wife be hellard took judge faute de mieux so said wicked

quentin invalided home to own immense chagrin in midst of afghan war on terrace after dinner for night be warm enough for whole company to take coffee out of door lady calmady incited thereunto by brother have persuaded mary cathcart to sing accompanying on guitar girl musical gift be of extraordinary order young contralto be true sweet charm of hour place moreover be calculated to heighten effect of jacobite song old world love ditty selected roger ormiston unquestionably found performance sufficiently moving then girl frank manner warm gipsy like colouring way in must sit horse moved also have done so indeed ever since first saw a quite child eight nine year ago on one of earliest visit to brockhurst fighting half broken welsh pony refused at grip by roadside little maiden face pale for once from concentration of purpose have forced pony over grip then slipping out of saddle coaxed kissed rough unruly little beast with tear of apology for hard usage to have be obliged to subject so stout yet so tender heart struck roger a excellent thing in woman now listening to full rounded note thrumming of guitar string in evening quiet under star wished remorsefully that have never be guilty of pleasant sin that record be cleaner taste le expensive that be better fellow round in short than be because then perhaps julius march too found singing somewhat agitating though to personality of singer be of small account personality train of feeling evoked by certain new aspect of have pursued day long katherine mindful of somewhat outspoken divergence of opinion from in

beneath severe scanty fold of cassock there be small space for remembrance of pomp glory of perishing world at least hoped so to night importuned a have be by scene emotion quite other than ecclesiastical julius literally sought refuge in cassock represented port after stormy sea home after travel in land altogether foreign took st augustine de civitate dei from place in book shelf lining one side of room there must be peace in soul surely emancipation from questioning of transitory thing in reading of city of god ala attention strayed that sense of subdued excitement be upon

ditty city of god be far off be thing very near at hand notwithstanding scanty fold of cassock importuned still pained at own lack of poise seriousness julius returned volume of st augustine to place

of many window strangely transmuted colour of range of pot flower massed beneath along base of house be fairy world upon julius looked forth did need suitable inhabitant pacing slowly down centre of terrace came richard katherine calmady hand in hand tall graceful strong in perfection of youth great devotion amid ethereal brightness seemed a two heroic figure immortal fairy lover moving through lovely wonder of fairy land a drew near katherine stopped leant with superb abandon back against husband resting hand on shoulder drew arm around waist for support drew face down to upturned face until lip met while moonlight played upon jewel on bare arm neck gleamed softly on surface of white satin dress to true lover longest kiss be too sadly short thing brief almost in proportion to sweetness to julius march watching from blackness of doorway seemed whole eternity before richard calmady raised head then julius turned fled down passage back into chill study where candle burned on side image of virgin mother cradling dead christ upon knee gentle person breaking from line of self restraint run to curious violence in emotion day long shrink from ignore a might moral storm have be brewing now broke not from two lover did julius turn thus in amazement terror from just that from be impossible for one to turn in actual fact namely from be appalled by narrowness of own past outlook appalled by splendour of heritage by own act have forfeited cassock ceased indeed to be refuge welcome livery of home rest have become prison suit badge of slavery against whole being rebelled for moment happily violence be short lived only for very little while do even gentlest person see red asceticism appeared to a blasphemy against order of nature of nature god vow of perpetual chastity made with so passionate enthusiasm for moment appeared to act of absolutely monstrous vanity self conceit in stupid ignorance have tried to be wiser than maker preferring ordinance of man to glad merciful purpose of god in so doing have not only too possibly committed unpardonable sin sin against holy ghost poor julius thought have indeed run almost humorously mad yet be characteristic of man that breaking of self imposed bond never occurred to made in ignorance unwitnessed though vow might be remained inviolable never even in most heated hour of trial doubted that stretching out arm clenched hand in anguish of spirit sacerdotal pride subjective joy of self consecration mental luxury of feeling different from others singled out set apart pharisee in short in julius march be sick

be right eternal purpose be joy not sorrow youth health not age decay thankful acceptance not fastidious rejection fear katherine yes katherine there young man wild tirade stopped flung down in front of writing table leaning elbow on pressing face upon folded arm for in good truth what did amount to not outraged law of nature not sin against holy ghost just simply that common fate have overtaken loved woman in so loving have at last found most vital experience be beyond language when julius looked up eye rested upon bronze pieta age old witness to sanctity of motherhood of suffering alike face be wet with tear be faint weak yet certain calm have come to no longer quarreled though attitude towards be greatly changed either with priestly calling rashly made vow not a source of pride did

lady calmady must give birth to son heir be after matter of small moment locally considered at event brockhurst house rejoiced also yet did so not without measure of trembling for there have be twenty four hour of acute anxiety regarding katherine calmady even now on evening of second day although dr knott declared satisfied a to condition that of baby air of mystery surrounded large state bedroom

be denying be far from obnoxious to to spend trifle of time in society of roger mr ormiston carried point may be stated in passing that sprightly young matron be brilliantly pretty though facial angle might be deemed too acute leaving somewhat to be desired in matter of forehead of chin be plump graceful neat waisted skin be exquisitely white fine charming colour flushed cheek under excitement hair be always untidy hairpin displaying abnormal activity in respect of escape independent action eye be round very prominent suggestive of highly polished brown agate be not least shy averse to attracting attention laughed much practised a prelude to laughter impudently coquettish little stare finally a sat on right at dinner rattling talk lightness of calibre generally struck john knott a rather cynically inadequate to demand made by present position not that underrated good nature be insensible to personal attraction doctor be in search of able coadjutor just then blessed with steady brain tongue skilled in tender diplomacy for there be trying thing to be said done needed woman of fine spirit to do say aright head like eft said to a course followed course while bandying compliment

southeasterly wind breaking in gust against house front sobbed at casement made loose pane here there click rattle be in midst of notably heavy gust when dessert have be served servant have left room captain ormiston leaned across table addressed sister in law young soldier have be somewhat gloomy silent during dinner be vaguely anxious about lady calmady news of mr st quentin be critical

pertinacity regarding payment for good supplied be burdened too by prospective sense of own uncommon righteousness for during past five month while have be on leave at brockhurst assisting katherine to master detail of very various business of estate ormiston have revised position decided on heroic measure of reform must rid of debt forswear expensive london habit many pleasant iniquity great city offer liberally to such handsome fine gentleman a actually proposed just so soon a katherine must conveniently spare to decline from splendid inactivity of guard upon hard work of line regiment under order for foreign service ormiston be quite affected by contemplation of own good resolution appeared to in really pathetic light must like to have told mary cathcart about have claimed sympathy admiration then be just precisely person must not tell until said resolution have in degree at event passed into accomplished fact for a not infrequently happens be not so much case of being off with old love before being on with new a being off with intermediate love before being on with old one again to announce estimable future be by implication at event to confess not wholly estimable past so roger ormiston sitting that night at dinner beside object of best most honest affection proved poor company roused not without effort to say to sister in law be about time to perform ceremony of evening be ella drink that small boy health by manner of mean be for observance of ancient form ceremony can never be sure how much may lie at bottom of be best to be on safe side of unseen power will agree to now mr march wo took grape skin from between neat teeth flicked out on to plate so for myself went on curtsy nine time to new moon though repeated genuflexion be perniciously likely to give backache touch hat in passing to magpie wish when behold piebald bless neighbour devoutly if sneeze at commencement of harangue met brother in law rather depreciative scrutiny with bold little stare in present mood ormiston found vivacity tedious though be usually willing enough to laugh at extravagancy then whipped julius in with side glance concluded with round eye set on dr knott rough hewn weather beaten countenance be afraid be disgracefully superstitious mr ormiston latter remarked be feather headed chatterbox reflected chatter served to occupy time doctor be by mean anxious time must pas too rapidly felt slightly self contemptuous in good truth must be glad to put away few glass of sound port before administering aforementioned facer to captain ormiston superstitious returned well trust superstition be not chronic nicely intermittent like rest of many virtue charity begin at home know must not like to keep of poor dear creature on guard too long for fear of tiring out give one of turn dr knott assure be more than most of do said smiling rather savagely majority of acquaintance have handsome power of self restraint in practice of virtue be happy exception well now be altogether pretty speech mr ormiston cried laughing to return to matter in hand to hero of baby dote on baby dr knott have one of own of six month old be charming child assure doubt that for instant

plump bare arm a pushed in couple of hairpin ah be real jewel of child said audaciously be comfort of social existence for doe resemble in least therefore reputation everlastingly safe thanks to why before calumniating thought have have time to arise in mind one look in child face will dissipate be so entirely image of father there be momentary silence for sobbing of gale rattling of casement then captain ormiston broke into rather loud laugh even if sail near wind must stand by woman of family come will do think ella said wo beat triumphant bull in hurry dear boy so be even at present tender age be living picture of brother william oh poor william roger said hastily turned to mary cathcart girl have blushed up to root of crisp black hair did not clearly understand other woman speech did wish to do so be admirably pure minded like truly pure minded person carried touchstone made recoil directly instinctively from be of doubtful quality twinkle in dr knott gray eye a sipped port still more tone of roger ormiston laugh did understand somehow last jarred upon cruelly opened flood gate of doubt mary like so many woman in respect of man love have striven very valiantly to keep shut manner of hint a to indiscretion manner of half told tale a to debt extravagance rumour have conveyed to unwilling ear seemed suddenly to gather weight probability viewed in moral light so to speak of laugh great love mature deepen under action of sorrow necessity to forgive yet be shrewdly bitter moment when heart of man woman first admits that god of idolatry have after foot of very common clay head erect eye moist mary turned to julius march asked of welfare of certain labourer family have lately migrated from newlands to sandyfield be voice broke in upon inquiry with determination to claim attention miss cathcart said forgive interrupting can tell more about spratleys than march can be right iles have taken man on a carter at home farm given eldest boy job with woodman told to do what must for a said be interested in now please want to drink small nephew health girl pushed forward wine glass without speaking a filled ormiston added in lower tone at event unlike of relation be guiltless of foolish word foolish action pretend to share ella superstition people good wish be very well worth having unwillingly mary cathcart raised eye head be still carried little high cheek be still glowing god might not be of pure gold throughout such god rarely be unfortunately yet be aware still found very worshipful kind of deity very well worth having repeated so must like poor little chap to have good wish miss cathcart wish manner of nice thing for mother sake a well a own there be be pretty bad run of luck here lately be time changed wish better fortune than forefather be not superstitious a say richard calmady death scared one little five minute beforehand seemed so utterly improbable then one began to wonder if there must be truth in old legend be ugly know dr knott glanced at speaker sharply oh that occurred to did said bless why occurred to everybody ormiston answered impatiently idiot raked story up be canvassed from one end of county to other last autumn till made fairly sick poor boy cried mr ormiston what be wonderful story so nauseates dr knott be afraid ca tell doctor answered slowly nervous movement on part of julius march have attracted attention have never managed to get hold of story a whole must like to do so uncommonly julius pushed back chair groped hurriedly for dinner napkin have slipped to ground from knee subject of conversation agitated untidy little chap book tied together with tag of rusty ribbon have lain undisturbed in drawer of library table ever since to very memorable evening when kneeling before image of stricken mother dead christ have found man heart under priest cassock awakened to newness of life much have happened since then julius have ranged accepting open eyed sorrow alleviation of fate have created for to night be tired mental emotional strain of last few day have be considerable moreover john knott presence always affected two men stood indeed at opposing pole of thought one spiritual ideal other material realistic though struggled against influence doctor rather brutal common sense large knowledge of physical cause gained painful ascendency over mind at close quarter knott must be owned be slightly merciless to clerical acquaintance loved to bait to impale on horn of moral theological dilemma be partly with purpose of harrying worrying that continued now yes mr ormiston must like to hear story just a much a must strike if pleased mr march must tell to suppose ask to promptly young lady fell upon julius regardless of ormiston hardly concealed displeasure oh bad man what be doing cried trying to conceal thrilling family legend from nearest relative tell about if know a dr knott declares do dote on terrifying story mary that send cold shiver down back if deal with history of nearest dearest why there be added charm to now mr march be attention stand deliver make just a bad a can be afraid be not effective improvisatore replied subject if will pardon saying so seems to too intimate for mirth curse be supposed to rest on place owner of brockhurst die young by violent mean know already look to to tell something more mr march dr knott said dryly julius be slightly nettled at elder man tone manner answered with accentuation of usual refinement of enunciation suavity of manner there be term to curse saviour who according to old prediction have power must also have will to remove altogether oh really be that so when doe saviour put in appearance doctor asked again be not revealed julius must very gladly have said nothing further dr knott expression be curiously intent compelling a sat fingering stem of wine glass ideality of julius nature rose in protest against half sneering rationalism seemed to read in expression mr ormiston who have hereditary racial appreciation of anything approaching fight turned round eye first on one speaker then on other provokingly inciting to more declared hostility while bit lip in effort to avoid spoiling sport by untimely laughter speech unhappily julius proceeded yielding under protest to opposing force saviour come in so questionable shape that fear whenever appointed time may be appearance will only be welcomed by discerning few be pity dr knott said paused minute passed hand across mouth still if be to believe bible other so called sacred history be be way of saviour from beginning to try faith of ordinary mortal by presenting under rather queer disguise paused again drawing in wide lip moistening with tongue since evidently know about mr march may make bold to inquire in what special form of fancy dress saviour in question be reported a likely to present come a child of house julius answered with dignity child who in person if understand wording of prophecy aright be half angel half monster john knott opened mouth a though to give passage to very forcible exclamation thought better of brought jaw together with kind of grind heavy figure seemed to hunch up a in recoil from blow curious said quietly yet julius looking at must have fancied that weather beaten face went trifle pale mr ormiston in interest of possible fight have contained herself just a long a be possible now clapped hand broke into little scream of laughter be just most magnificently romantic thing ever heard cried come now requires further investigation what be baby like dr knott have seen nothing indistinguishable mass of shawl flannel have by chance got angelic monstrosity up stair without being aware of charlotte roger ormiston called out sternly young man looked positively dangerous conversation have gone quite far enough agree with march may all be stuff nonsense not worth second thought still be thing to joke about very well dear boy be soothed then returned making little grimace putting head on one side coquettishly will be a solemn a nine owl must excuse momentary excitement be news to know 'd notion katherine have married into such remarkable family be bound to learn little more do believe be possible at dr knott now tell fulfilment of prophecy be rather wide burning question to embark on said with captain ormiston leave think 'd better go back to point started from drink little gentleman health have patient to see again be getting rather late lady addressed laughed held up glass stared round table with fine air of bravado looking remarkably pretty fire away roger dear fellow said be loaded ready thus admonished ormiston raised glass too temper be not of sweetest just then spoke forcedly here be to boy said good luck good health added hastily please god will be comfort to mother amen julius said softly dr knott contemplated content of glass for moment whether critically absently must have be difficult to decide harshness have gone out of face loose lip worked into smile pathetic in quality to baby venture to add clause to invocation of heartless jade dame fortune may never lack good courage good friend will need julius march set down wine untasted have received very disagreeable impression come come appears to be paying honour in most lugubrious spirit mr ormiston broke in wish baby long life merry one in defiance of prophecy tradition belonging to paternal ancestry go on mr march be shamefully neglecting duty heel tap threw back head showing whole of white throat drained glass then flung over shoulder fell on black polished board beyond edge of carpet shivered into hundred piece lay glittering like scattered diamond in lamplight for day have died altogether fleet of dark straggling cloud chased other across space of pallid sky against earthward edge of dusky tree top strained writhed in force of tearing gale ella ormiston rose laughing from place at table be correct form said ensures fulfilment of wish ought to have cast away glass regardless of expense come mary will remove ourselves mind bid good bye before go dr knott report on lady calmady be probably last time will have felicity of seeing be off at cockcrow to morrow morning chapter viii enter child of promise after closing door behind two lady ormiston paused by near window gazed out into night dinner have be in opinion far from success feared relation to mary cathcart have retrograded rather than progressed wished sister in law must be more correct in speech behaviour then held conversation have be in bad taste doctor must have abstained from pressing julius with question assured again that story be not worth moment serious consideration yet resented discussion such discussion seemed to to tread hard on heel of impertinence to sister to husband memory to boy born to so excellent position so great wealth worst of be that like fool have started subject wind rising remarked at last will have rough drive home knott wo be first one beauty of kind take lot of spoiling answer did not please young man sauntered across room dropped into chair with slightly insolent demeanour same let detain said if prefer seeing lady calmady at once getting off detain dr knott answered be afraid that be just other way about must detain captain ormiston on rather unpleasant business julius march have risen to foot have fresh cause for anxiety about lady calmady said hurriedly doctor glanced up at tall spare black figure dark sensitive face with half sneering half pitying smile oh replied lady calmady going on splendidly be to guard just a far a can against cause for anxiety later want to speak to captain ormiston now have got to be prepared for certain contingency go mr march may a well hear what have to say will interest particularly fancy after one two thing have told to night sit down julius please ormiston must have liked to maintain that same insolence of demeanour gave before apprehension of serious issue looked hard at doctor cudgeling brain a to what latter enigmatic speech might mean divined put idea away a inadmissible returned to then said angrily there be nothing wrong with child of course dr knott turned chair sideways to table shaded face with thick square hand well that depends on what call wrong slowly replied be not ill ormiston said baby a well a better in fact than be for be confoundedly touched up with gout bear that in mind captain ormiston that child be well mean not that be gouty want to definitely remember that mr march well then what on earth be matter ormiston asked sharply mean to imply be injured in way deformed dr knott let hand drop on table nodded head ormiston perceived moved strangely that doctor eye be wet not deformed answered technically can hardly call that maimed badly well that be matter of opinion must think bad enough fancy if found in same boat settled back in chair have better understand quite clearly continued at least a clearly a can put to there come point where can not explain fact only state have heard of spontaneous amputation across ormiston mind came remembrance of litter of puppy have seen in sanctum of veterinary surgeon of regiment lump rose in throat yes go on said be thing doe not happen once in most men experience have only seen one case before in practice be nothing very serious be extraordinary example need not remind of sir richard calmady accident subsequent operation of course not go on ormiston repeated in case leg be gone from here doctor continued laying edge of palm across thigh immediately above knee foot be

sinking of heart that window seat in solitary mood dickie most frequented be precisely that one of eastern bay commanded beyond smooth green expanse red wall of troco ground good view of grass ride

difficulty in sense for pain secondly natural excitement of brother homecoming disturbing monotony of daily life bringing along with very actual joy memory of past well beloved yet gone beyond recall lastly practical immediate fear that dickie have come uncommonly near tumbling incontinently out of window so being moved held boy tightly answered rather at random thereby provoking fate yes dearest

unconscious arrogance of childhood richard have so far taken mother devotion very much a matter of course have never doubted that be always have be inevitable centre of interest so now word bearing bringing in a far a grasped revelation of aspect of life quite independent of important little self staggered for first time poor dickie realised that even one own mother be never so devoted be not child exclusive wholly private property have separate existence joy sorrow apart instinctively took arm from about neck backed away into angle of window seat regarding with serious somewhat startled

mere freshness of youth of physical health must seem indeed to be peculiar dowry of woman who having once known love in completeness strength of choice live ever afterwards in perfect chastity of act thought perception not only of grace of person a sat sideways on window seat in close fitting gray gown with frilled lace collar ruffle at wrist came to richard now perceived something of more intimate subtle charm belonged to be enthralled by clear sweetness a of dewy grass newly turned by scythe always clung about by whispering of silken garment when moved sudden reverence for came upon a though behind gracious so familiar figure apprehended that belonged to region superior almost divine then be seized be too often fate of worshipper with jealousy of past of hers of have be until now ignorant yet emotion shook for in thus realising differentiating personality have grown vividly almost painfully conscious of own turned away laying cheek against stone window ledge while drop of passing scud of rain beat in on hot face then then father never saw exclaimed vehemently after moment pause added be glad of very glad ah dearest lady calmady cried bewildered aghast know what be saying think richard kept face to splashing rain want to say anything wrong repeated be glad turned to lip quivering little desolate expression in eye told katherine with only too bitter assurance that childhood repose of be indeed over gone held out arm to in silent invitation drew dear curly head on to bosom be not displeased with mummy doe seem a if be displeased asked then sat silent once more katherine swaying little a held soothing almost a in baby day wo lean out of window again said presently with sigh of comfort promise that there be darling be afraid must go uncle roger will be here soon boy raised head mother said quickly will send clara please to put away book may have winter to fetch be tired if mind care to walk yet since happily at thirteen richard mood be still a many changeful a aspect of same april day enjoyed royally unclouded hour before most unwillingly retired to bed night for on close acquaintance great ulysses proved very satisfactory hero roger ormiston character have consolidated be to purpose that have put away pleasant folly of youth looked out now with coolness patience born of wide experience upon men upon affair have ceased to lose temper head acquiescing with undismayed cheerful common sense in fact life a know be sorry business that rough thing must of necessity be done suffered day have developed active though far from morbidly sentimental compassion for individual man beast alike not that colonel ormiston formulated still le held forth upon be content a be so many englishman to be dumb practical philosopher for who have lived with philosopher of eloquent sort will unquestionably give thanks knowing to sorrow how often handsome speech be cloak to hide incapacity of honest doing so after dinner under plea of imperative need of cigar have borne dickie off to gun room there in interval of questioning little about taste occupation have told story many great for wanted to get hold of boy judge of what stuff be made like sound healthy minded men have inherent suspicion of abnormal must not fear that person unusually constituted in body must be victim of corresponding crookedness of spirit a evening drew on became easy on point richard physical infirmity nature be wholesome enough therefore when at close upon ten o'clock lady calmady arrived in person to insist that dickie must go there then straight to bed found pleasant scene awaiting square room be gay with lamplight firelight brought into strong relief picture of famous horse trophy of old time weapon matchlock basket handled sword neat silver hilted rapier prettiest of toy with to pink man decorated white paneled wall ormiston stood with back to fire one heel on fender broad shoulder resting against high chimneypiece head bent forward a looked down in steady yet kindly scrutiny at boy face be tanned by sun wind of long sea voyage people still came home from india by cape till hair moustache showed pale against bronzed skin to richard listening watching from deep armchair drawn up at right angle to hearth appeared a veritable demigod master of secret of life death beheld moreover through atmosphere of fragrant tobacco smoke curiously intoxicating to unaccustomed nostril dickie have tucked into a small space a possible to make room for young camp who lay outstretched beside bull dog great underhung jaw pendulous wrinkled cheek rested on arm of chair a stared blinked rather sullenly at fire moved choked little slipping off unwillingly to sleep to wake with start to stare blink once more embroidered couvre pieds dickie have spread across gathering top edge of up under front of eton jacket offered luxurious bedding camp be typical conservative slow witted stubborn against ingres of new idea tall somewhat masterful stranger must prove good man true according to bull dog understanding of term before must hope to gain entrance to faithful though narrow heart ormiston meanwhile finely contemptuous of canine criticism greeted sister cheerily be bound to give little law to night kitty said holding out hand to wo break rule indulge in unbridled license a to late hour again will dick see have be doing good deal one way since last met there be arrears of conversation to make up smiled very charmingly at lady calmady finger closed firmly on hand have be getting on famously notwithstanding long separation looked down at richard again fast friend already mean to remain so old chap thereupon lady calmady soul received much comfort pride be always on alert fiercely sensitive concerning richard joy of meeting have till now edge of jealous anxiety to if roger did not take to boy then deeply though loved roger must go for same element be constant in katherine calmady not discipline of thirteen year have tamed hot blood in made order out clown for execution a ormiston spoke face softened eye grew luminous smiled back at with exquisite gladness soft gloom of black velvet dress emphasised warm golden whiteness of bare shoulder arm ormiston seeing just then understanding something of drama of thought be moved from habitual cool indifference of bearing katherine said do know take one rather by surprise upon word be more beautiful than ever richard clear voice rang out eagerly from depth of big chair yes be uncle roger be delicious man smile broadened almost to laughter young monkey said very gently so have discovered that fact already have well so much better be safe basis to start from think so kitty lady calmady drew away hand blood have rushed into face neck beauty now for so long have seemed negligible quantity thing have outlasted need use since who have so rejoiced in be dead what be value of ever so royal crown when throne represents have fallen to ruin yet being very much woman word of praise came altogether sweetly to katherine from lip of brother son moved away embarrassed not quite mistress of herself sat down on arm of richard chair leaned across patted bull dog who raised heavy head with grunt slapped dickie smartly in stomach with tail by way of welcome dear foolish creature said pray talk of something more profitable be growing old in way be rather thankful for same dickie darling positively must will go to bed colonel ormiston interrupted spoke with trace of hesitation turning to fireplace flicking ash off end of cigar by bye katherine how mary cathcart have seen lately yes last week then be not gone way of flesh married lady calmady answered bent little lower tracing out line on dog wrinkled forehead with finger several men have asked to marry there be only one man in world fancy whom mary must ever care to marry poor camp did tickle believe have not asked yet ah there ormiston exclaimed quickly be mistaken be katherine said have great faith in mary suppose be too wise to accept even being not wholly convinced of love lady calmady raised eye ormiston looked very keenly at richard watching felt breath come rather short with excitement for understood that mother be speaking in riddle observed moreover that colonel ormiston face have grown pale for sunburn so katherine went on think man in question have better be quite sure of own heart before offer to mary cathcart again ormiston flung half smoked cigar into fire came stood in front of richard look here old chap said what do say to driving over to newlands to morrow can set right if have forgotten of turn in road know miss cathcart be great chum be mother may go boy asked lady calmady kissed forehead yes dearest said will trust uncle roger to take care of other for once may go immediate consequence of be that richard went to bed that night with brain rather dangerously active eye rather dangerously bright so that when sleep at last visited came burdened with dream in many impression emotion of day took altogether too lively part causing to turn restlessly to fro throw arm out wide over cool linen sheet pillow for there be new element in dickie dream to night namely recurrent distress of helplessness incapacity of movement therefore of escape in presence of on coming multitudinous terror be haunted moreover by certain stanza of ballad of chevy chase have given peculiar feeling sickening yet fascinating ever since must remember first to have read feeling caused to dread reading beforehand yet made turn back to again again to night sometimes richard be sometimes personality seemed merged in of witherington crippled fighting man of whose maiming deadly courage stanza tell battle be long fierce a from out background of steeple

square above board silence followed appeared to richard protracted to point of agitation became almost distressingly conscious of man still bronzed resolute face on one hand of woman mobile vivid yet equally resolute face on other divining far more to be at stake than have clear knowledge of tired excited impatience touched on anger say yes mary cried impulsively say yes see how anybody can want

seemed to boyish thought aspect of born conqueror of man who can serve wait long for good desire who winning lay hold of with fearless might while causing richard exquisite delight of admiration caused also longing to share splendid power so passionate that amounted to actual pain mary cathcart hand slid from under hand too rose to foot then have actually cared for along year ormiston

manhood cried aloud in julius march covered face with hand carefully restrained imagination ran riot presenting enchantment katherine watching found strangely moved for be very startling to see so familiar figure under so unfamiliar aspect to see julius march everyday companion assistant reticence priestly aloofness mild courtly calm swept under by tide of personal emotion lady calmady be drawn to by deepened sympathy yet regret arose in that man proved to be after a other men be vaguely disappointed having derived more security than have quite realised from apparent detachment impassibility a indirect consequence revolt against god suffered access of bitterness for not only be to seeing callous regarding fate of many failed to support few most devoted to cause in hour of trial be careless even of own elect ah think be indeed by mean too late exclaimed julius march let hand drop at side gazed at expression be of wistful mockery compassionate rather than ironical then looked away down length of chapel in warm afternoon light solid rich brown of arcaded stall on hand emphasised harmonious radiance of great east window radiance a of clear jewel rank of kneeling saint gold

mother entered turned face towards open window there be vigour distinction in profile in straight nose full chin strong line of lower jaw in round firm throat small ear set close against head muscle of neck arm be well developed seen thus lying in quiet glow of afternoon sunshine possibility of physical disgrace seemed far enough from richard calmady might indeed not unfitly have be compared to one of nobly graceful lad who upon frieze of greek temple set forth forever perfect pattern of temperance high courage of youth health a katherine sat down beside bed richard thrust out left hand took in hers held stroked palm of for time must not trust to speak for saw that notwithstanding resolute set of lip breath caught in short quick sob that eyelash be glued in point by late shed tear seeing katherine motherhood arose confronted with something of reproach seemed to have be guilty of disloyalty in permitting thought to be beguiled even for brief space of conversation with julius march felt humbled little in dickie debt since have not realised to uttermost separate moment of trial a of moment passed darling be afraid dr knott have hurt very much said at last oh know suppose did hurt

almost violently upon mouth oh stop mother stop cried be too dreadful to think of flung away lay at a far distance a width of bed must allow gazing at in angry protest ca do suppose 'd let do even if must said fiercely then turned face to sunny western window again like to know that be beautiful anyhow mother over said there followed long silence between lady calmady still knelt by bedside drew up rested elbow on bed clasped hand under chin a knelt there something of proud comfort came to for so long have sickened fearing hour when richard must begin clearly to gauge extent of own ill luck yet now first shock of plain speech over experienced relief for future must be honest so thought speak heart to heart moreover in so bitter distress be to not to mary good comrade not to roger ormiston ulysses of fancy that boy have turned be given back to be greatly gladdened by be gladdened too by richard last speech by angry immediate repudiation of bare mention of personal gain must touch with loss katherine eye kindled a knelt there watching son for be very much to find chivalrous hotly sensitive of beauty claim of womanhood in instinct in thought in word have shown very gallant high bred gentleman child though be gave katherine not only proud comfort in present cheered future with hope look here dickie darling said softly at last tell little more about talk with dr knott oh be awfully

knott settle anything else richard waited then turned on elbow looked full very earnestly at yes mother did settle something more something be afraid wo like must make happier than anything else must make difference that can be made know paused expression very firm though lip quivered dr knott want to ride katherine drew back stood up straight threw out hand a though to keep off actual tangible object of offense not that richard cried anything in world rather than that looked at imploringly yet with certain determination for child be dying fast in forceful desire intention of youth growing say must mother pray pray because left sentence unfinished overtaken by old habit of obedience yet did not lower eye lady calmady made response for moment be outraged to point of standing apart even from child for moment even motherhood went down before purely personal feeling by irony of circumstance immediately after motherhood have made supreme confession of immutability remembering husband death remembering source of child misfortune appeared to indecent wanton insult to past suffering that proposition must be made to in flash of cruelly vivid perception knew how boy must look on horse grotesque to vulgar wholly absurd spectacle must notwithstanding beauty necessarily present for moment completeness of love failed before pride touched to very quick how can ride said poor child think how be possible richard sat upright pressing hand down on bedclothes on side to steady colour rushed over face throat be possible mother answered resolutely dr knott must never have talked about must

richard will hers be in conflict richard will must eventually obtain since must eventually be master already courtier bowed to will all be in mind wounding of feeling far deeper more intimate than since katherine nobility of character be great worldly aspect greed of personal power undisputed rule must not affect for long wounded a slight upon memory of man have so wholly loved that first conflict between richard must turn on question of horse racing stable irony of position appeared unpardonable then vision of poor richard darling whom have striven so jealously to shield ever since day over thirteen year ago when undressing baby have first looked upon malformed limb richard riding forth for staring mocking world to see again arose before thinking of katherine gazed out over stately home scene grass plot garden woodland distant landscape rich in golden splendour of steady sunshine with smarting eye sense of impotent misery wrapped about a burning garment boy be beginning

forgive boy be amazed speechless at first seeing broken thus shamed in turn by humility of attitude to young chivalry be a impiety to look upon tear please cry mother entreated tremulously childlike simplicity of manner taking cry be dreadful never saw cry before then after pause added never mind about riding so very much care about really believe do after at dear lie katherine raised bowed head wonderful sweetness in tear stained face tender laughter upon lip drew boy hand on to shoulder clasped hand across extended arm kissed upon mouth beloved will ride said will have saddle twenty thousand saddle if want will talk to uncle roger chifney to night will be a wish be not angry mother more asked little bewildered by change of tone by passion of lovely look speech katherine shook head still that tender laughter curved lip be never going to be angry more with at least dick must learn to be plucky too pair of dickie trying to keep up one pluck only let go forward hand in hand

episode whereupon dickie looking down at still enchanted notwithstanding so sinister discovery being first always gentleman secondly though a yet unconsciously lover proceeded to lie roundly lied too with notable cheerfulness born a cheerfulness need must be of act of faith high generosity remember of course not said so let legend be abolished henceforth forevermore here once for cousin helen

elder brother unlooked for advent have awakened strangely from reserve stately monotony of daily existence have shaken even for moment completeness of dominion of fixed idea ceased for moment to sink whole of personality in maternal relationship memory of youth passed amid varied interest of society of literary political world of paris london assailed other katherines in short whom might have be who have seemed to drop away from vanishing phantom like before uncompromising reality of husband death child birth crowded about importuning with vague desire vague regret confines of brockhurst grew narrow while lay beyond called to craved almost unconsciously wider sphere of action longed to obtain to lend hand in shaping of event making of history even purest most devoted among woman possessing doubtful blessing of measure of intellect be subject to such vagrant heat such uprising of personal ambition specially during dangerous decade when nine thirtieth year be past meanwhile richard answer to question be unfortunately somewhat over long in coming for young man be sunk in meditation apparently oblivious of presence leaned back in long low armchair hand clasped behind head embroidered rug drawn about waist venerable yellow edged calf bound volume lying face downwards on lap while young camp young no longer full of year indeed beyond allotted portion of kind reposed outstretched snoring on too wide space of rug chair seat at foot indifference of man dog grew irksome to lady calmady moved across shining yellow black surface of tiger skin straightened bronze of vinedresser lazy lad standing on high chimneypiece dear grows late said let settle matter if uncle cousin be to come must send note over to newlands to morrow before breakfast remember have choice in matter leave entirely to tell seriously what wish richard stretched turning head in hollow of hand shrugged shoulder slightly be exactly what must thank so heartily to tell answered do seriously wish give word mother know oh dearest be folly must have inclination enough one way other to come to decision be careful not to commit be still easy not to ask without being guilty of discourtesy be richard said be simply that being anything heroic be trying of two evil to choose least must like to have uncle helen here immensely if visit be success must be proportionately disappointed vexed so be worth risk disappointment be sufficiently abundant anyhow be slightly imbecile to run wholly gratuitous risk of adding to number then fixed idea began stealthily yet surely to reassert dominion for there be perceptible flavour of discouragement in young man speech dickie there be nothing wrong be there nothing matter to night oh dear of course not answered half closing eye nothing in world matter unclasped hand leaned forward patted bulldog lying across rug at foot at least nothing more than usual nothing more than abiding something always have be always will be matter ah dear katherine cried softly have just be

fainter then for measurable time richard fell silent again while waited verily there be sharper discipline for woman proud spirit than administered often quite unconsciously by man whom love gave wretched girl six week to day for robbing mistress remarked at last be flagrant case so suppose be justified in fact see how must have done otherwise went against awfully same have child to support jim gould got into trouble deserted like cowardly young blackguard however be easy to be righteous at person expense perhaps must have done same in place wonder if must dear need hardly discus point think lady calmady said richard turned head smiled at poor dear mother do bore be so comfortable to grumble know be selfish be horrid bad habit ought to blow up for then mother take round really grumble much do katherine said quickly indeed dickie have be awfully afraid though lately do grumble more than imagine went on straightening head while handsome profile showed clear cut against dancing brightness of firelight be almost impossible always to carry something about with hate not let infect attitude of mind in degree speech twenty thirty year hence may prove altogether sufficient satisfactory to know lip worked obliging to enunciate word carefully that bodily imperfection whit blemish soul hinder operation be in short added mean of grace think of be nice neat little arrangement sort of spiritual consolation stake only be afraid be two three decade on near side of comfortable conclusion yet find richard shifted position letting arm drop along chair arm with little

last word be conscious of singular pleasure in pronouncing perfectly finished figure of cousin outstanding against wide misty brightness of sunset scent of wood moorland haunting suggestion of glad secret even that upcurling of blue cigarette smoke rising a smoke of incense with difference upon clear evening air above silent flattery of intimate fearless glance gay welcoming gesture merry calling a of bird in tree top from spirit of youth within to spirit of youth so visibly radiantly resident in rose up before richard grew reckless though reckless of precisely what innocent a be in fact although mature in learning knew not a yet only turned on mother face at once eager shy coaxing a when in long ago baby day have implored petty indulgence gift of coveted toy on little heart be set yes let have said know helen be very charming will admire mother be a clever a can stick one see that at glance be very much grande dame too oh well be whole lot of charming thing coming must be wholesome breaking up of ordinary way of going on be usually very contented at least think so dear julius perhaps be getting into bit of rut helen society might prove even more efficacious method of driving out blue devil than knott lancet jolly good spanking laughed quietly patting katherine hand looking away there be denying must be vastly more graceful one think so thus be smouldering fire of personal ambition quenched in lady calmady a so often before richard tenderness brought to knee hugged with almost voluptuous movement of passion that half rejected burden of maternity gathering close against heart once more along with rapture of self surrender came thousand familiar fear anxiety for have looked into dickie mind a spoke out grumble have there perceived existence of much have dreaded to existence of have striven to blind darling said with certain hesitation will gladly have if wish only remember what happened long ago when helen be here last yes know be afraid must think

distrust of vague spiritual alarm have beset on first entering room returned on with tenfold force superstitious terror of convent bred girl mastered light hearted scepticism of woman of world region of sinister possibility seemed disclosing around oh how horrible what doe mean cried richard answered cheerily somewhat astonished at agitation trying to reassure mean nothing except be abominably awkward crystal abominably slippery what doe matter can find again directly then forgetful in fulness of longing to pacify richard have pushed chair back from table intending to go in search of vagrant jewel chair be high make not of most solid sort so paused instinctively calculating amount of support must be trusted to render in descent during pause helen have felt heart stand still set little teeth now recalling for extent of deformity be fully apparent for once apprehending that proposed to do be smitten by immense curiosity to realise ultimate of grotesque in respect of appearance

gratified curiosity thus further helen de vallorbes became quite wonderfully prudent humane bother about move dear richard cried let find please saw exactly direction in went to emphasise speech keep young man in place laid hand persuasively upon shoulder brought charming face so pure in outline set in aureole of honey coloured hair very near to looking down up in position two remained longer than be absolutely necessary silent quite still while air grew thick with push of unspoken a yet unspeakable matter helen hand resting upon shoulder grew heavy a second passed with languorous weight there be better thing than crystal to read in after richard said at last then lifted hand almost brusquely stepped back same be stupid must have to go away continued speaking more to herself than to be happy here when be happy be easy to be good like to be good crossed room passed behind bronze pompeian antinous under shadow of curtain in angle of bay against wainscot queen mary magic ball showed softly luminous helen must have believed that watched hesitated before stooping to pick up looked over shoulder at richard calmady back be towards chair close against table again leaned forward on elbow face buried in hand something in bowed head in set of almost crouching figure reassured madame de vallorbes picked up crystal without more ado with indeed certain flippancy of gesture for have received pleasing assurance that have be frightened in wrong place that eternal laughter be very completely on side after just then bell have rung in distant quarter of great house powell incarnation

woman uncommonly tactful woman lady calmady said to gratefully meanwhile lady louisa barking at other end of table addressed discourse to richard julius on side of in high penetrating key affected by certain lady of distinguished social pretension whether manner of speech implies fine conviction of superiority on part of speaker conviction that utterance be replete with intrinsic interest be difficult to determine certain be that lady louisa practically addressed table attendant men servant creation in point of fact a well a two immediate neighbour like father be large handsome expression lacked amiability attitude pleasing distrust in age be about six thirty decidedly mature for possessed remarkable power of concentrating mind upon own affair also laboured under impression that be truly religious listening weekly to sermon of fashionable preacher on convenient text that worldliness be next to godliness entertaining prejudice finely unqualified by accurate knowledge against abominable error of rome be getting so terribly fagged with canvassing that doctor told really must go to whitney recruit of course mr barking be perfectly secure of seat be in real anxiety be thankful to say doe not speak much in house always feel speaking be quite minor matter doubtless julius said remark appearing to be delivered at in particular great point be that party must be able to depend absolutely upon loyalty being rather behind scene a ca help being know do feel that more more party depends absolutely upon mr barking have so much moral stamen know be what feel be ready at moment to sacrifice private conviction to party interest so few member of real position be willing to do so of course leader do depend on member of government consult in private be very flattering richard remarked still helen tarried while again glancing in direction of door encountered lady constance mild ruminant stare can one pronounce anything flattering when one see to be so completely deserved ludovic quayle inquired in most urbane manner prompt perpetual sacrifice of private conviction to party interest for example how can such devotion receive recognition beyond desert do have more partridge lady louisa richard put in hastily in case such recognition be very satisfactory more thank sir richard lady replied not without touch of acerbity ludovic be very clever doubt comment often struck a being in equivocal taste gave turn to word did not expect so broke thread of conversation in rather exasperating fashion very satisfactory repeated of course constituency be fully informed of attitude of government towards mr barking so that serious opposition be out of question oh of course richard echoed still feel duty to canvas one can point out many thing to constituent in own home might not come quite so well know from platform of course enjoy seeing one so much of course make great change for richard echoed dutifully exactly so on account quite putting aside chance of securing stray vote here there feel duty not to spare to go through with just for sake know sister be nothing if not altruistic will find calmady mr quayle here put in in most exquisitely amiable manner now encouraged thereto by lady calmady lord fallowfeild have recovered accustomed serenity discoursed with renewed cheerfulness great loss to side of county poor friend denier remarked good fellow denier always liked denier stood by from first so did son pardon yes to be sure excellent claret never tasted better luncheon claret there be little prejudice little narrowness of feeling about denier when first bought grimshott settled down here made man see denier entirely made father be clergyman believe be told grandfather kept umbrella shop in strand very able right minded man denier

laid hold of country life wonderfully understood obligation of land owner always found fox in grimshott gorse of eh knott fox that sometimes be very certain of country doctor rejoined hailed from neighbourhood of umbrella shop perhaps wanted to get home to lord fallowfeild chuckled capital said very good capital still be great relief to know of sure find like keep field in good temper yes few men whose death have regretted more than poor denier miss denier not old man must have let slip through finger so early knott eh oh be question of forestry john knott answered grimly if one kept old wood standing where must sapling chance come in oh ah yes never thought of before thinking of now noble lord became slightly pensive wonder if be unfair keeping shotover so long out of property said to amusing fellow shotover very fond of shotover extravagant fellow monstrously extravagant lord denier death gave host here seat on local bench just at right moment doctor went on one man loss be man opportunity rather rough perhaps on outgoing man then thing usually be pretty rough on outgoing man in experience suppose be lord fallowfeild said rather ruefully face becoming preternaturally solemn not doubt of individual may get justice hope doe mercy be kept for special occasion few far between one must take thing on large scale then find dovetail very neatly knott continued with somewhat sardonic mirthfulness simplicity perplexity of handsome kindly gentleman amused hugely to return to lord denier let alone skill that of whole medical faculty put together must have saved must though said lord fallowfeild be just bother with self made man make true spends physically in making vitality go in climbing ladder be none left over by time reach top lord denier have worked too hard a youngster to make old bone be long journey from shop in strand to woolsack see took sick at two thirty believe oh yes early death premature decay be price most outsider pay for great professional success be that so mr ormiston at juncture conversation suffered interruption by throwing open of door entrance of madame de vallorbes pray let one move said rather a issuing order than preferring request for father lord fallowfeild gentleman have risen on appearance save richard richard blue eye ablaze corner of mouth tremble heart going forth tumultuously to meet yet alone of present denied little obvious act of outward courtesy from man to woman pinned to chair like specimen beetle to collector card john knott said grimly to poor dear lad with face on too hoped might have be spared taking fire little longer however here be conflagration question about now let have look at lady lady must be conceded manifested under new somewhat agitating aspect a swept up room into vacant place at richard right hand with rush of silken skirt produced singular effect at once of energy self concentration lip thin unsmiling ominous vertical furrow between spring of arched eyebrow eye narrow unresponsive severe with thought under delicate lid be sorry to be late be unavoidable be kept by letter forwarded from newlands said without giving trouble of looking at richard a spoke what doe matter luncheon admittedly movable feast be madame de vallorbes made response noticeable hush have descended upon whole company while men servant moved to fro serving newcomer even lady louisa barking ceased to hold high discourse political other looked disapprovingly across table hour earlier have resented younger woman merry wit now resented sublime indifference then now found perfect finish of appearance unpardonable lord fallowfeild disjointed conversation also suffered check fidgeted vaguely conscious that atmosphere have become somewhat electric monstrously pretty woman effective woman very effective rather dangerous though changeable too made laugh little too much before luncheon louisa did like very correct view daughter louisa now seems in very odd temper grand air reminds of somebody have seen on stage somehow suppose come of living so much in france said to for life of must not think of anything to say aloud though felt must be eminently tactful to throw in casual remark at juncture little lady constance be disquieted likewise for girl like have fallen dumbly adoringly in love with beautiful stranger few year senior now stranger appeared a embodiment of unknown emotion energy altogether beyond scope of small imagination innocent stare lost ruminant quality became alarmed tearful even while instinctively edged chair closer to father there be great bond of sympathy between simple hearted gentleman youngest child mr quayle looked on with lifted eyebrow air of amused forbearance dr knott looked on also that saw pleased moderately grace of movement distinction of face figure charm of finely poised honey coloured head showing up against background of gray blue tapestried wall be enough owned having very pretty taste in woman a well a in horse to drive many man crazy if mother baggage daughter vixen said to upon soul if have to choose between god almighty forbid 'd take chance with baggage a climax lady calmady expression be severe sat very upright made effort at conversation nerve be little on edge there have be awkward moment during meal now niece entrance struck a unfortunately accentuated while there be that in richard aspect startled quick fear jealousy of motherhood to richard must be owned meeting so hotly desired against danger of have so wisely guarded came in fashion altogether different to have pictured helen manner be cold to point far from flattering to self esteem subtle intimacy of scene in long gallery became a though have never be dickie thinking over restless night fierce effort at self conquest long hour in saddle designed for reduction of perfervid imagination wrote down as indeed yet yet charm of helen presence be great surely be quite herself just now there be something wrong with anybody must see that everybody did see in fact feared commented upon in charitable spirit hostility towards declared on side detected that imagined did so in lady louisa expression in ludovic quayle extra superfine smile in doctor close rather cynical attitude of observation last not least in reserve of mother bearing manner hostility real imagined begot in richard new sensation one of tenderness wholly unselfish protective while fighting blood stirred in grew slightly reckless what have happened appear to have fallen most unaccountably silent said looking round table with air of gallant challenge pretty to see so have though exclaimed lord fallowfeild half in relief half in apology very true be just thinking same thing while mr ouayle leaning forward inquired with much sweetness to whom will talk madame de vallorbes be far more profitably engaged in discussing luncheon than must be in discussing conceivable topic of conversation with such a dr knott be so evidently diagnosing interesting case have not effrontery to interrupt disregarding comment richard turned to neighbour on left beg pardon lady louisa said before singular dumbness overtook be saying lady addressed electing to accept a tribute to knowledge weight distinction of discourse thawed became condescending gracious again believe be discussing prospect of party replied be saying that know of course there must be large liberal majority yes of course consider that assured julius put in civilly be not matter of personal opinion be thankful to say because of course one must feel be just everything for country there be doubt at about majority among who really know mr barking for instance nobody can be in better position to judge than be then be speaking other night to augustus tremiloe at lord combmartin not william know augustus tremiloe man in treasury uncommonly fine chrysanthemum lord fallowfeild have broken forth cheerfully finding sufficient if tardy inspiration in table decoration remarkably perfect blossom charming colour nothing nearly so good at whitney autumn excellent fellow head gardener rather past work enterprise ca make go in for new idea mr ormiston leaning across dr knott addressed to ludovic while casting occasional rather anxious glance upon daughter thus did voice rise mingle talk get fairly upon leg again then richard permitted to say quietly have bad news hope in letter helen why must suppose have have bad news demanded teeth meeting viciously in morsel of kissing crust held in rosy tipped finger be a pretty a game to see eat dickie laughed little charmed even with naughtiness embarrassed too by directness of question oh exactly know why thought perhaps seemed do know quite exactly why young lady asserted looking full at saw be in detestable diabolic temper well perhaps did think saw something of sort richard answered audaciously yet very gently helen continued to look at a did so cheek rounded mouth grew soft vertical line faded out from forehead be very assuaging cousin richard said too laughed softly understands vinery very well though lord fallowfeild be saying doe grow bad peach not at bad peach be stupid about flower ought to retire never will have really satisfactory garden till doe retire yet have heart to tell to go good fellow know good honest hard working fellow have lot of trouble wife ailing for year always ailing youngest child got hip disease nasty thing hip disease very nasty quite cripple poor little creature be hopeless cripple terrible anxiety burden for parent in rank of life know can hardly be otherwise in rank of life lady calmady said slowly bitterly immense weariness be upon weariness of actual present weariness of possible future courage ebbed longed to go away to be alone for while to shut eye ear to deaden alike perception memory to have cease then be a though two beautiful now laughing face of man woman in glory of youth seen over perspective of fair white damask glittering glass silver rich dish graceful profusion of flower fruit at far end of avenue of guest mocked at did not mock at essential condition of own life too katherine feared consciously unconsciously did that weariness dragged upon with almost despairing weight do get paper same day here sir richard lady louisa asked imperatively yes come with second post letter about five o'clock julius march answered lady louisa barking intended to be attended to by host sir richard paused be asking whether paper reach same day dickie replied knew not what for have just registered discovery that barrier be quite useless against certain sort of intimacy be crowd never so thick about in sense at least be always alone exquisitely delicately alone with person love chapter viii richard put hand to plough from there be turning back dearest mother look most deplorably tired richard sat before large study table piled up with letter paper county history racing calendar in gun room amid haze of cigar smoke wonder went on have have regular field day have be afraid lord fallowfeild bored atrociously at luncheon doe talk most admired foolishness time poor old boy same ludovic must show up a doe be not good form be afraid ludovic getting rather spoilt by london be growing altogether too finicking elaborate be pity lady louisa barking be rather exterminating person conversation be magnificently deficient in humour be to be hoped barking be not troubled by lively perception must suffer at time lady constance be pretty little girl think so not oppressed with brain dare say good little sort liked katherine said stood beside that mortal weariness upon yet oh yes well enough liked in passing a one like wild rose in hedge look regularly played out mother like in least richard twisted revolving chair half round held out arm in invitation a mother leaned over stretched upward clasped hand lightly about neck poor dear said coaxingly worn to fiddle string with wild dissipation declare be quite pathetic let go shrugging shoulder with sigh half laugh well dissipation will soon enough be over now will resume even tenor of way suppose will be glad of mother caress have be grateful to katherine cool cheek dear to lip clasp of strong arm reassuring yet in present state of depression be inclined to distrust even consoled there seemed lack in fervour of embrace be not just trifle perfunctory a of one who pay toll rather than of one who claim privilege will be glad too dearest trust said craving further encouragement richard twisted chair back into place again leaned forward to note hour of clock set in centre of gold enamel inkstand oh be not prophetic pretend to go before event register sensation until have fairly arrived be awfully bad economy to get ahead of live in day after to morrow to day enough more than enough for be afraid when have have large contingent of whitney people to luncheon do go rest mother uncle william be disposed of have started out for tramp with julius so need not have on mind in richard word in manner did lady calmady find fulness of assurance craved thanks dearest said be very thoughtful of will see helen find out oh trouble about richard put in again studied jewel rimmed dial of little clock found wanted to go to newlands to bid mr cathcart good bye seems miss st quentin be back there for day two so promised to drive over a soon a be quit of fallowfeild party be late for so long drive richard looked up quickly face wore that expression of challenge once again know be so be afraid ought to start at once expect carriage round immediately then repenting will take care of wo mother rest oh yes will take care of katherine said indeed appear to be only person have left to take care of thanks to forethought good go with dick followed perhaps unreasonably enough that richard five minute later drove round angle of house drew mail phaeton up at foot of gray griffin guarded flight of step whereon madame de vallorbes wrapped in fur cavalier hat trailing plume shadowing upper part of face bright hair awaited coming in rather defiant humour cousin be troubled worried met with scant sympathy aroused chivalry wished for that must give must very certainly have of after consequence to be contemptuous course of action have shown a wisdom couple of hour ago showed now a selfishness pusillanimity if wanted be there joyfully to do bidding at cost to in subsequent unrest of mind seemed small thing if heartache insidious provocation of flesh came later let come be strong enough to bear one crush out other hoped must give something to do told little bitterly have be idle of late so came about richard calmady held out hand to help cousin into place at side with more of meaning welcome in gesture than be quite aware forgot humiliation of broad strap about waist of high ingeniously contrived driving iron against foot rested steadying upon sharply sloping seat be detail objectionable one be true to day of very secondary importance in main be master of situation for once be to render rather than receive assistance helen be under care in measure dependent on gratified young masculine pride doomed too often to suffer sharp mortification fierce pleasure possessed be fine to bear thus away behind fast trotting horse through pensive autumn brightness boyish self consciousness self distrust died down in richard man self reliance instinct of possession of authority grew in tone be that of command for solicitude a said look here be sure have got enough on go catch cold under impression that there be meaning in sunshine be sure to be chilly driving home be easy to take more wrap helen shook head unsmiling serious must face polar snow richard let horse spring forward while little pebble rattled against body of phaeton groom running few step swung up on to back seat immediately becoming immovable a wooden image with rigidly folded arm oh cold wo quite amount to richard said observe woman rarely reckon with probability of return journey return journey be invariably too hot too cold too soon too late for woman so be better not to remember existence until be compelled to do so for confess to strongest prejudice against return journey madame de vallorbes speech be calm measured yet there be conviction in suggestive of considerable emotion sat well back in carriage head turned slightly to left so that richard looking down at saw little pure firm line of jaw contour of cheek ear small lovely soft hair curling away from above behind in most enticing fashion physical perfection of necessity provoked in peculiar envy delight nature appeared to have taken ingenious pleasure not only in conferring unusual degree of beauty upon companion in finishing detail of person with unstinted grace for while young man lost in contemplation of charming ear partially averted face then resolutely bestowed attention upon horse again finding such contemplation slightly enervating to moral sense yes return journey be generally rather nuisance suppose said though experience of particular form of nuisance be limited have not be outward bound often enough to know much of regret of being homeward bound yet own must not much mind driving on on everlastingly on dreamy afternoon like a find just now driving on seeking el dorado of spirit mean not of pocket seeking fortunate isle lie beyond sunset for must be not little fascinating to give one accustomed self go to make up one accepted identity slip to drive clean out of one old circumstance find new heaven new earth new personality elsewhere what do say helen will try helen sat immobile face averted listening intently revolving many thing in mind meditating how when most advantageously to speak must be such amiable graceful experiment to try on own people too must young man continued with sudden change of tone be so eminently fitted to lose in crowd without fear of recognition just person for case of mistaken identity say such thing richard please distress madame de vallorbes put in quickly believe have quarrel with return journey in case at brockhurst must fancy to have found fortunate isle of spoke just now have be very happy there too happy perhaps therefore to day whip have come down across back just to remind ah now say painful thing dick interrupted pray like madame de vallorbes turned head looked at with strangest expression metaphor be not out of place do imagine horse be only animal man drive mon beau cousin men drive woman who belongs to that not with lightest bit promise do forget to tie blood knot in whip lash when suit to do so what do mean asked abruptly merely that letter so stupidly endangered self control at luncheon contained example of kind of driving how how damnable young man said between teeth red purple trunk of great fir tree reeled away to right left a carriage swept forward down long avenue to richard seeing reeled away in disgust even a did thought from image companion word suggested while to seeing reeled smitten by eternal laughter echo of stimulated to hear drama develops said to herself half triumphant half abashed yet be telling truth be so hardly even doctor for have be angered genuinely miserably angered have found that odious to point of letting feeling override diplomacy there be subtle pleasure in now turning very lapse of self control to own advantage then young man heart be finest purest toned instrument upon have ever have chance to play a yet be ravished by quality range of music gave forth madame de vallorbes pressed hand together within warm comfort of sable muff averted face again lest must betray eager excitement gained on continued yes whip rein bit be hardly pretty in connection be if must willingly give identity slip at time dear cousin have considerably deeper cause to wish to part company with mine in case be morally materially free whole class of particularly irritating base care can never approach be in connection with just such care spoke of hatefulness of return journey helen paused a one making effort to maintain equanimity letter recall to paris said where detestable scene most ignoble anxiety await how soon must go be what asked said in same quiet even voice have not yet arrived at decision so asked to bring out dickie afternoon looked up at smiling lovely with certain wistful dignity wholly coercive can understand that orderly serenity of splendid house became little oppressive offered too glaring contrast to own state of mind outlook fancied brain must be clearer conclusion more just here out of door face to face with half savage nature ah know richard said have not blankness of fog brought help very morning know wish did not know too know many thing better not known helen replied conscience pricked thanked star confession have ceased with enlargement from convent school be thing of past see want to decide just how long dare stay if will keep will keep richard said be very charming to dick exclaimed impulsively sincerely again slightly abashed how long can stay wonder without making matter worse in end for father for be young after suppose be tough cuticle of soul if soul can have cuticle like of body thickens under repeated blow father be longer young be terribly sensitive where be concerned be inevitably drawn into whirlpool of wretched affair sooner later on account must be glad to defer return journey a long understand richard broke out pity deep concern for blind fury against person person unknown getting better of who on earth have power to plague make miserable father young man face be white eye full of pain full of great love burning down on a once long ago helen de vallorbes must have danced clapped hand in naughty glee for hunting have prospered above fondest hope have

famished world be will not always find sorrow misfortune seated at root of thing if disregarding overlaying prettiness of summer day of green leaf gay blossom dare draw near dig deep look close can nothing one escape blighting touch of canker stationed at very foundation of being certainly must seem not richard reasoned listening to word of radiant woman beside ordained in right of talent puissant grace to be queen idol of men for sadder than thin sunshine bare tree complaint of hungry flock be that assured declaration that loveless unlovely marriage of own be one exist by thousand be

attention first hard on heel of followed personal application for a be way of true lover universality of law under take rise mitigates by most uncommonly little joy sorrow of particular case poignant regret that suffered strong admiration that bore suffering so adherent with such lightness of demeanour then more dangerous than sense of added unlooked for nearness to resultant calling not merely of spirit of youth in to same spirit resident in deeper more compelling more sonorous call from knowledge of tragedy in to same terrible knowledge now first made evident in here richard heart in spite of pity in spite of tenderness must have borne hundred misery to save five minute discomfort sang te deum that lustily enough for by revelation of infelicity of state whole relation to duty towards changed took on greater freedom to pour forth worship offer of service at foot of happy woman be at once impertinence to shame to yourself to pour forth such worship such offer of service at foot of

chapter ix touch incidentally on matter of finance a richard have predicted fog reappeared towards sun sunset at first a frail mist through landscape looked colourless blurred later rose growing in

excessively exhilarating to deal thus with angelo luigi francesco have old score to settle have not very day received odiously disquieting letter from in not only made renewed complaint of poor little misery of debt flirtation once more threatened retaliation by cutting off of supply in common justice did not deserve villification therefore partly out of revenge partly in self justification

bare headed in clinging damp chill of fog give love to lady calmady said hope will see again day even if never have luck to do in way will make real difference have written name in private calendar will always remember paused moment got rather near other somehow think did dawdle beat about bush went straight along passed initial stage of acquaintance in few hour reached that point of friendship where forgetting becomes impossible mother never forgets richard asserted there be perhaps slight edge to tone looking down into girl pale finely moulded face meeting glance of steady strangely clear observant eye received impression of something uncompromisingly sincere in measure protective for cause unknown resented notwithstanding high breeding miss st quentin attitude appeared to trifle intrusive just then be very sure of that mother never forgets mean one know at once one can trust down to ground on to end of age again paused a though rallying against disinclination for further speech captivating woman be made on pattern unfortunately know sir richard good many of be wisest not to trust anything like down to ground longer than well day before yesterday without waiting for reply to cryptic utterance stepped swiftly round behind carriage again waved hand from door step then swung away with lazy long limbed grace past waiting men servant through to ruddy brightness of hall madame de vallorbes settled back rather languidly in place be pricked by sharp point of curiosity regarding tenor of miss st quentin mysterious colloquy with richard calmady have be able to catch word here there have be provokingly suggestive have well beloved honoria in moment of overscrupulous conscientiousness permitted to hoist danger signal wanted to know for be business to haul such down again with possible despatch intended barometer to register set fair whatever weather actually impending yet to institute direct inquiry might be to invite suspicion helen therefore declined upon diplomacy upon inverted sweetness calculated nicely to mask intention quite other than sweet really held friend in very warm affection madame de vallorbes never confused secondary primary issue when have really big deal on hand of bigness of present deal last quarter of hour have brought notably increased assurance even dearest friend must stand clear get very decidedly out of way so while muffled thud of horse hoof echoed up from hard gravel of carriage drive through thick atmosphere bare limb of tree clawed a with lean arm clothed in tattered drapery at passing carriage occupant contented by observing be grateful to for driving over richard honoria be very perfect in own way always doe good to see be quite unlike anybody else be richard eye be fixed upon blank wall of fog just ahead though always stable always receded before advancing carriage effect of be unpleasant somehow holding a did to mind suggestion of other thing still more baffling impending from though might keep at arm length there be permanent actual escape question of miss st quentin characteristic did not consequently greatly interest have arrived at conclusion there be matter of vital importance on desired to speak to cousin how to do richard be young excellently modest whole purpose be rather fiercely focused on speech be diffident fearing to approach subject have so much at heart clumsily in tactless tasteless manner miss st quentin oh yes replied rather absently really know next to nothing about seems merely to regard a vehicle of communication between herself mother sent message just now hope to goodness sha forget to deliver mother appear to have fallen pretty considerably in love with one probably madame de vallorbes said softly agreeable glow of relief passed over looked up at richard with delightful effect of pensiveness from beneath sweeping brim of cavalier hat can well believe aunt katherine must be attracted by continued honoria be quite woman woman men care very much about a rule there be good deal of latent vanity resident in member of sex know richard men be usually conscious that honoria doe not care so very much about be quite right doe not really believe when poor dreadful old lady tobermory left money honoria first thought be that now might embrace celibacy with good conscience st quentins be not precisely millionaire know wealth left free to espouse cause of womanhood at large be little bit quixotic dear thing given to tilting at windmill want to secure to working woman fair business basis be technical expression believe so start club form circle

must seem superfluous to encourage inculcate for surely wherever two three petticoat be gathered together there a far a experience go be agitation of necessity in midst of madame de vallorbes leaned back with little sigh air of exquisite resignation same majority of woman be unhappy enough heaven know if honoria other sweet feminine quixote can find mean to lighten burden of life have very sincere thanks well understood richard drew whip across back of trotting horse making plunge forward against blank impalpable wall of encircling ever receding ever present fog carriage have just

unreality gained upon richard imagination until now a last evening in stately solitude of long gallery became increasingly aware of personality of companion increasingly penetrated by feeling of being alone with personality a though world so strangely blotted out by dim obliterating vapour be indeed vacant of human interest human purpose human history save incarnate in fair woman own relation to

to close in in good earnest passing broad yellowish glare streaming out from rounded tap room window of calmady arm passing from end of village street on to open common light have become so uncertain that richard must no longer see companion face clearly be almost relief to so that mastering at once diffidence excitement spoke look here helen said have be thinking over that told want to dwell on

let thing go on just same be not angry with young man spoke very carefully calmly yet tone of voice be heavily charged with feeling madame de vallorbes clasped hand rather tightly within sable muff unconsciously began to sway little just very little a person will sway in time to strain of stirring music excitement not mental merely physical invaded for recognised that stood on threshold of development in very notable drama still answered quietly with touch even of weariness ah dear richard be so friendly charming of to take infelicity thus to heart to what end to what end ask condition

rapidly immediately practical merit ranged before in detail must play with little diplomacy good taste in last be by mean deficient required that ah forget dear richard said in friendly zeal forget that in rank of life there be one thing woman can not accept from man to take money be to lay open to slanderous tongue be to court scandal sooner later be known fact leak out however innocent

among prophet same luncheon party at brockhurst if not notably satisfactory to host afforded much subsequent food for meditation to one at least of guest during evening immediately following even in watch of night lady louisa barking thought be persistently engaged with subject of richard calmady look character temper rent roll acreage of estate prospect generally did interest remain hidden inarticulate for finding that in various particular knowledge be superficial clearly insufficient on journey from westchurch up to town next day in company with brother ludovic put so many question to accomplished young gentleman that shortly divined serious purpose in inquiry recognise dear louisa remarked presently laying aside day time of have vainly essayed study with air of gentle resignation crossing long leg leaning back in corner of railway carriage that be possessor of eminently practical mind have run family for year now not without numerous success among may be reckoned running of into arm if will pardon mentioning of estimable brother in law barking really ludovic sister protested let entreat not to turn restive louisa mr quayle rejoined with utmost suavity be paying high compliment to intelligence to have run into arm of mr barking indeed of anybody else casually involuntarily to have blundered into if may so express must have be stupidity to run into intentionally voluntarily argues considerable power of strategy intelligent direction of movement respect admire be really exceedingly provoking ludovic lady louisa pushed square leather covered dressing case on foot have be resting impatiently aside far from young man answered can put box anywhere else for like just where be yes assure be not provoking be merely complimentary conversation be art louisa none

little before setting battle actively in array be just have be striving to do during last five minute appear to appreciate commendable style of preliminary want to engage immediately there be usually first rate underlying reason for interest in anybody again lady shifted position of dressing case to right inquired mr quayle extending hand head little on one side long neck directed forward while regarded first sister then dressing case with infuriating urbanity let come to hecuba then let dissemble no longer put plainly what oh louisa what be driving at in respect of very dear friend dickie calmady now be unquestionably most desirable for to keep on fair weather side of mr quayle just then yet flesh be weak lady louisa barking must not control movement of self justification spoke with dignity severely be very well for to say sort of thing ludovic what sort of thing inquired mildly must be glad to know what must have become of family by now unless one have come forward taken matter in hand of course one get thanks for one never doe get thanks for doing one duty however wearing be to oneself however much others profit somebody have to sacrifice mama be unequal to exertion know what papa be do do murmured mr quayle raising gaze piously to roof of railway carriage if have one of boy to tramp over country with at whitney one of girl to ride with in london be perfectly happy

got berth in liverpool cotton broker business be sure alicia be very comfortably married know george winterbotham be not least interesting be perfectly gentlemanlike presentable so on make most devoted husband from what mr barking other day at club from somebody other forget who one connected with government know there be probability of george getting that permanent under secretaryship did not start by declaring have achieved numerous success ludovic inquired yet stray from point louisa for do not still remain ignorant of root of sudden interest in friend dickie calmady thirst to learn how propose to work into triumphant development of family fortune proportion of lady louisa small mouth contracted still further into expression of great decision while glanced at landscape reeling away from window of railway carriage in past twelve hour autumn have given place to winter bare hedge showed black while fallen leaf of hedgerow tree formed unsightly blotch of sodden brown purple upon dirty green of pasture over brooded opaque gray brown sky sullen impenetrable lady louisa saw be one of person happily for unaffected by such abstraction a aspect of nature purpose be immediate practical followed with praiseworthy persistence landscape merely engaged eye because preferred just now looking out of window to looking brother in face something must be done for younger girl announced feel pretty confident about emily future need not go into maggie if marries at really be very useful at home in looking after servant entertaining so on if marries at will marry late have particular attraction a girl go figure be too solid talk too much will make very presentable middle aged woman sensible dependable excellent menagere certainly have better marry late mature clergyman when be rising forty widowed bishop for instance yes approve that mr quayle rejoined reflectively be well conceived louisa must keep eye on bench carefully note episcopal matrimonial vacancy bishop have little turn observe for marrying somebody who be somebody specially en secondes noces good men yes be well thought of with careful steering may bring maggie to anchor in palace yet maggie be rather dogmatic must make not bad mr proudie so be disposed of then for few second lady held silent converse with herself at last addressed companion in tone of unwonted cordiality be by far most sensible of family ludovic began in family so renowned for intellect so conspicuous for 'parts learning ' a macaulay put be indeed distinction mr quayle bowed slightly in comfortable corner thousand thanks louisa murmured must not breathe syllable of to of others continued know how girl chatter alicia be sorry to say be a bad a of must discus question without intermission simply know talk whole thing to death poor thing yet after what thing young man inquired urbanely lady louisa bit lip be very irritating while be very much in earnest be misfortune usually to be good deal in earnest there be constance remarked somewhat abruptly precisely there be poor dear innocent rather foolish little connie occurred to might be coming to in turn mr quayle fell silent contemplated reeling landscape pasture have given place to wide stretch of dark moorland on side railway line with pallor of sour bog grass in hollow outlook be uncheerful perhaps be that caused young man to shake head recognize brilliancy of conception louisa reflects credit upon imagination daring said presently wo be able to work pray why not almost snapped lady louisa mr quayle settled back in corner again handsome face be sweetness indulgent though argumentative be nothing clearly unless reasonable personally be extremely fond of dickie calmady began permit honestly do moment of enthusiasm regarding must esteem woman lucky who married yet must imagine prejudice might exist in mind mind of le emancipated finely comprehensive order than yours own of course against such alliance take father mind for instance unhappily father dotes on connie be more obstinate than nineteen dozen well leave to fill in comparison mentally louisa might be slightly wanting in filial respect to put into word again shook head in pensive solemnity give credit for prodigious push tenacity for remarkable capacity of generalship in short yet can not disguise from certainty that must never square father suppose wish papa must deny connie nothing other objected be obliged to raise voice to point of shrillness hardly compatible with dignity of noble house of fallowfeild double with gold of barkings for train be banging over point roaring between platform of local junction mr quayle made deprecating gesture put hand over ear again gently shook head intimating that person possessed of nerve respect must be expected to carry on conversation under existing condition lady louisa desisted a soon a train passed into comparative quiet of open country took up parable again took up in tone of authority of course admit there be something to get over must be ridiculous not to admit be always determined to be perfectly straightforward detest humbug of kind so deny for moment that there be something still must be very good marriage for constance very good marriage indeed even papa must acknowledge that money position age everything of kind in favour one must not expect to have without make weight must not regret for feel might really be bad for connie to have so much without make weight remarked yesterday must not help remarking that be very much occupied about sir richard calmady connie be little goose mr quayle permitted to remark for once there be quite sour edge to sweetness connie be not quick be not sensitive sister continued really under circumstance that perhaps be just a well be good child must believe almost anything told have affectionate obedient disposition never attempt to think for believe must ever occur to to object to peculiarity unless mischievous person suggested to then a tell remarked be very much occupied about once again mr quayle sought counsel of landscape once again have changed in character for here civilisation began to trail skirt very visibly edge of skirt be torn frayed notably unhandsome open moorland have given place to flat market garden leafless orchard sloppy with wet innumerable cabbage innumerable stunted black branched apple pear tree avenue of dilapidated pea bean stick reeled away to right left semi suburban town stretched forth long rawly red arm of ugly little jerry built street terrace tall chimney unlovely gasometer last showing a

clearly enough atmosphere of be very far from being hazy now that atmosphere bore annoying resemblance to opacity obtaining overhead along eastern horizon young man sympathy be prejudice have convenient habit of ranging immediately on one side other of question presenting to in present case be mixed pulled way vexed for liked to suppose very ripe cynical disillusioned while in good truth sentiment have more than word to say in most of opinion decision now sentiment ruled strongly pushed unfortunately in diametrically opposite direction sentiment of friendship compelled hitherward while sentiment refused to define recognised a wholesome yet be trifle ashamed of compelled quite other where took refuge in adroit begging of question after be not committing fundamental error of reckoning without host louisa inquired connie may be good deal occupied about calmady thereby may only give further proof of own silliness certainly discovered particular sign of calmady being occupied about connie be very much more occupied about fair cousin helen de vallorbes than about one of illustrious self included a far a must see in secret soul hearer have to own statement just kept owning to herself with rapidity upon must not help congratulating instituted flanking movement hear gossip ludovic said of course be good asking mr barking about sort of thing even if heard must not remember mind be too much occupied if woman marries man with large political interest must just give to generously be very interesting one feel of course one be helping to make history still one have to sacrifice something hear next to nothing of what be going on gossip mean so tell what do hear about about madame de vallorbes at first hand only that must know perfectly well dear louisa did sit opposite to at luncheon yesterday that be vastly good looking attractive woman at second hand then at second hand oh at second hand know various amiable little odds end such a be commonly reported by uncharitable censorious ludovic answered mildly probably more than half of little treasure be pure fiction generated by envy conceived by malice pray ludovic sister exclaimed recovered added may a well tell same think under circumstance must be better for to hear really wish to hear well give for what be worth vouch for truth of single item for can tell nice kind friend may be recounting kindred anecdote of alicia blameless winterbotham even of louisa mr barking mr quayle fixed glance of surpassing graciousness upon sister a uttered agreeable suggestion fervid curiosity alone enabled to resist rejoinder to maintain dignified silence be said probably be true that never cared two straw for de vallorbes be jockeyed in marriage just a might jockey constance know louisa by mother who have reputation of being somewhat frisky matron with keen eye to main chance be not quite understand tender heart must desire in way of parent be further said that la belle helene make dollar fly even more freely than did de vallorbes in best day have credit of having be something of viveur knew not only paris baden baden naples various other warm corner where great good men do commonly congregate be added that la belle helene already give promise of being playful in other way beside of expenditure that de vallorbes have be heard to lament openly that be not native of enlightened country in divorce court charitably intervenes to sever overhard connubial knot in short be rumoured that de vallorbes be not conspicuous example of wildly happy husband in short be not respec young man held up hand cried out feelingly pray dear louisa let walk delicately a agag father morning ministration to maid again for how a pointed out just now do know what insidious little tale may not be in

be too happy too kindly treated here at brockhurst for to be other than sorrow to to depart turned to richard expression serious intimate appealing then shook back fair head a though in obedience to irresistible movement of tenderness stooped down swiftly over seeming to drown in shimmering wave of azure thin clear green royal blue purple sea while kissed full daringly upon mouth good night good

discerned figure blue gold against dim whiteness of high paneled wall moulded ceiling stairway long descending balustrade have arrived cried clear voice took strange inflection of mockery laughter have arrived be perfectly secure now safe let hope other inmate of brockhurst be equally so stormy night thousand thanks dear aunt katherine for guidance thousand apology for bringing so far now let trouble no longer gun room katherine found just a have left save camp stood on tiger skin before fire fore paw great grinning muzzle resting on arm of richard chair camp whined little mechanically young man raised hand pulled dog long drooping ear face be still dead white there be line under eye about corner of mouth a of one who try to subdue expression of physical pain looked straight at lady calmady ah said so have come back observe have changed partner again pulled dog ear while appeared to listener that voice curiously echoed that other voice have so lately addressed dismissed taking on inflection of mockery a nerved to answer continued hastily want nothing dear mother nothing in world pray concern more about to night have camp for company lamp oh can put out perfectly well be right of course perfectly right to come if be anxious about now surely be satisfied suddenly richard bowed head putting hand over eye only now mother if love go said with great sob in voice for god sake go leave to myself after sleepless hour in melancholy blear dawn of november day katherine lying face downwards within shelter of embroidered curtain of state bed made submission at last prayed be helpless oh father almighty have wit understanding strength have mercy lest reason depart from have sinned for year have sinned setting will judgment righteousness against thine take forgive teach bring nothing ask everything be empty fill with even a with water one fill empty cup give courage of patience instead of courage of battle give courage of meekness in place of courage of pride book iv slip betwixt cup lip chapter lady louisa barking trace finger of providence spirit of unrest have entered brockhurst in dim october weather along with certain guest did not lady calmady have foreseen a much leave with leaving remained constant quantity further engendered event very far away from at first sight wholly at variance with have accompanied advent for example lady louisa barking passing through lowndes square one bleak march morning on way from albert gate to do little quiet shopping in sloane street observed that calmadys house situated at corner of square of street be given over to small army of work people during richard minority have be let for term of year to sir reginald aldham of aldham revel in midlandshire since dickie coming of age have stood empty pending migration of brockhurst establishment migration have in point of fact never yet taken place now a lady louisa walking with firm distinguished tread along gray wind swept pavement remarked house be in process of redecoration of painting within without looking on thing lady louisa soul received very sensible comfort be extremely tenacious of purpose in respect of one purpose at least heaven have not seen fit during last four five month to smile upon superstitious person might have regarded fact a warning lady louisa however merely regarded a oversight now at last so appeared to heaven have awakened to consciousness of delinquency with satisfactory result that own commendable patience touched on reasonable hope of reward be more agreeable comforting to because quayle family affair be not must be owned at brightest best just at present cloud lowered on family horizon for week have felt situation called for effective action on part then how to act most effectively knew not now needed opportunity stared in face along with high ladder scaffolding pole surrounding calmady mansion decided there then to take field to take discreetly to effect turning movement not attempt front attack so on return to albert gate after completion of morning shopping employed half hour before luncheon in writing affectionate sisterly letter to ludovic quayle that accomplished young gentleman happened a be aware to be staying at brockhurst asked opinion in confidence on present very uncomfortable condition of family fortune declaring how implicitly trusted good sense respected judgment then passing adroitly to le burning question ended thus pray let lady calmady know how really delighted everybody be to hear sir richard will be up season do trust a be near neighbour that if there be anything can do for now later when be settling will not hesitate to let know must be such sincere pleasure to mr barking be too busy with tiresome parliamentary committee to be able to allow more than week at easter must be thankful for longer rest for be feeling dreadfully fagged know how conscientious always be of course one must pay certain price for confidence leader of one party repose in one so do tell lady calmady be quite sure to be back immediately after easter reading sentence mr quayle permitted fine smile on more than one count louisa reminds of sweet little poem of 'bruce spider said to display heroic persistence method be trifle crude though to provoke statement by making be primitive form of diplomacy yet why be hard upon louisa like poor dear father more often than not mean well followed that few day later on return to whitney ludovic indited voluminous letter to sister in very best style be rather waste reflected regretfully will miss neatest point happiest turn of phrase will be lost upon louisa to recoup for subjective loss young man amused by giving very alarmist account of certain matter though be constrained to admit pleasing fact that sir richard lady calmady really have in contemplation to go up to town somewhere about easter truth to tell main subject of mr quayle letter must hardly be otherwise than disquieting for be undeniable that lord shotover debt be causing others serious embarrassment at period there be nothing new in young nobleman indebtedness being permanent factor in family financial situation spring indebtedness have passed from chronic to acute stage be with consequence that became evident lord shotover debt must be paid relation must submit to annoyance of seeing pas through bankruptcy court of objectionable alternative be least objectionable lord fallowfeild still stood in doubt when in obedience to parental summons young man reached whitney lord fallowfeild have whipped up into laudable heat of righteous indignation before arrival of prodigal yet contrived to be out when dog cart conveying said prodigal mr decies of st lancer friend of guy quayle home on leave from india whence brought news of fellow subaltern actually drove up to door when pushed thereto by accusing conscience did at last come in lord fallowfeild easily persuaded that there really be not time before dinner for momentous conversation moreover being very full of milk of human kindness found infinitely more agreeable to hear praise of absent son guy than to fall foul of present son shotover so that be not till quite late that night by time be slightly sleepy while anger have sensibly evaporated that interview did actually take place now then shotover march off to place of execution ludovic quayle said sweetly a picked up bedroom candlestick be deep subtle thought that of bringing down decies only query did think of be just bit of usual luck lord shotover smiled rather ruefully upon prosperous may be added slightly parsimonious younger brother well deny did occur to might work admitted after know one mercy be there be real vice about dear old lordship lord fallowfeild fidgeted about library expression that of well nourished healthy rather fretful infant oh ah well so here be shotover said unpleasant business of yours uncommonly disagreeable business for of deuced unpleasant business younger man echoed heartily closely resembled father in look save that be clean shaven of lighter build father son have same slight lisp in speaking deuced unpleasant repeated nobody can feel that more than do ca though said lord fallowfeild with charmingly innocent air of surprise there sit down shotover wo be painful thing to do have got to talk over suppose well of course if be kind enough to give time know be rather what came down here for so did though elder man returned brightening a though making illuminating discovery then fearing be forgetting part becoming amiable too rapidly made gallant effort to whip up somnolent indignation be very distressing to to put so plainly in opinion be disgraceful business oh give word know lord shotover replied with most disarming candour father affected with difficulty not to hear remark doe do for man in position to be owing money over country brings aristocracy into contempt with shop keeping class be always on lookout for shortcoming of superior people do pay debt see have always got such thundering lot of money lord shotover put in know how 'd contrive to spend unless did pay debt oh ah yes father hesitated struck shotover be reasonable fellow very reasonable took whole matter in very proper spirit in short be not easy to blow up shotover lord fallowfeild thrust hand far down into trouser pocket turned sideways in great leather covered chair be not narrow minded prejudiced began always have kept on civil term with sort of people always will courtesy be obligation on part of gentleman christian a soon be rude to tailor a eat with knife man must respect own rank others wo respect especially in nasty radical leveling time must stand by class there be vulgar proverb about bird foul own nest know well never did that have always stood by own class helped poor brother archibald ca remember be born at time to run away with lady jane bateman low common fellow bateman never liked bateman left ludovic money know wish to goodness 'd left to murmured lord shotover eh inquired father then fell into moralising vein nasty disreputable thing elopement never did approve of elopement leave other men wife alone shotover younger man mouth worked little nuisance be sometimes wo leave alone lord fallowfeild gazed at moment very genially oh ah well suppose wo said chuckled anyhow stood by poor uncle archibald be brother of course be second cousin of mother so felt bound to saw across channel into paris train dreadfully bad crossing that night remember private cabin to be have lady jane be dreadfully ill never take wife to sea on honeymoon shotover be too great risk that business cost lot of money one way let in for most painful scene with bateman afterwards a say be bound to stand by own class will be only reason for helping understand shotover if do help be sure hope will young man rose stood with back to fire hand under coat tail stooped little looking down pensively at hearth rug between foot clothes not yet paid for likely to be claimed admiration so did length of leg neatness of narrow hip can only assure will be most awfully grateful if do help said quietly pretend to deserve doe lessen gratitude rather other way know will never forget wo though for life of lord fallowfeild must not help beaming upon handsome prodigal uncommonly highbred looking fellow shotover said to wonder woman run after uncommonly high bred show very nice feeling too then kindly simple gentleman drew up with mental jerk remembering that be there to curse rather than to bless fidgeted violently not have actually made up mind to help yet went on be very much inclined to cast adrift distress to put to so plainly be disgracefully extravagant know shotover oh know young man admitted be selfish fellow lord fallowfeild became relentless yes be extremely painful to to say to be downright selfish that in long run come uncommonly hard on sister good girl sister never given mother trouble sister money have to come from somewhere time pay debt have to cut down sister portion yes know be what be made so infernally unwilling to come to about affair lord shotover said in tone of perfectly genuine regret be though father commented good fellow at heart added to display very proper feeling always be good hearted fellow can only tell have be awfully wretched about for last three month have though said lord fallowfeild with sympathy got just about a low a well must felt be nothing nuisance encumbrance be beastly to think of fleecing girl know came precious near cutting throat only that seemed rather dirty way of getting out of so be poor boy quite right nasty mean way of shirking responsibility quite agree with have never have opinion of man who cut throat never mention such thing shotover blew nose resonantly never talk of such thing repeated poor boy will pay debt only tell really be last time there must be misunderstanding about must reform shotover if be only on account of sister want to take unfair advantage of in alluding to sister only must understand clearly be last time see be becoming too frequent want to press case unduly against recollect be sure do paid debt in fifty eight again in sixty two sixty three be yes must have be sixty three because be year poor friend tom henniker died good fellow henniker missed henniker wanted to take over hound nice fellow in hunting field henniker never saw lose temper once be when image rode over hound on edge of talepenny wood rather coarse sort of brute image put in lord shotover henniker have excellent manner with farmer genial cheery very cheery at time yet without loss of dignity great test of man breeding that being cheery without loss of dignity now poor friend henniker oh ah yes where be though debt now shotover yes must have be sixty three because wanted to succeed a master have to tell must not afford so must have be just after cleared looked at erring son with most engaging air of appeal remonstrance really wo do shotover repeated must reform be becoming too frequent 'd better travel for time be proper thing for man in position to do when be in low water not scuttle of course must on account have scuttle three week month hence when thing be getting into shape just travel for time will arrange for only never talk of cutting throat again quite understand be positively last time be very much in earnest dear boy nothing will move settlement be final will just run up quietly to town to morrow have talk with lawyer fox goteway very civil accommodating fellow goteway may be able to make suggestion very nice confidential mannered person goteway know how to hold tongue doe ask unnecessary question useful man goteway thing coming to knowledge of lady louisa barking moved at once to wrath to deepened conviction that moment for decisive action have arrived appeared to that father have put out of court weakness regarding eldest son have practically delivered into hand congratulated upon good be thus beneficently permitted to spring out of evil yet while recognising that just providence sometimes at event overrules human folly to production of happy result be by mean disposed to spare mortal whose individual foolishness have given divine wisdom opportunity therefore when few day later lord fallowfeild called on after third fourth interview with messrs fox goteway beaming expansive from sense of merciful action accomplished received in distinctly repressive manner great white gold drawing room in albert gate be not more frigid unbending than bearing of mistress a suffered father embrace that amiable nobleman notwithstanding large frame exalted social position felt shiver inwardly in presence of daughter even a must remember shivering when a small schoolboy have be summoned to dread presence of headmaster very good room of yours louisa began hastily always have admired room capital space for entertaining barking be quite right to secure house a soon a be in market told at time must never regret lady louisa did not answer called after retreating footman who have just brought in stately limited tea tray much silver little food be not at home william then a put small accurate measure of tea into massive teapot added severely what be hear about shotover papa oh ah yes poor shotover came up to town together again to day good hearted fellow brother shotover thoughtless however have have most satisfactory talk with men of business fox goteway know barking doe not think much of fox goteway wanted to go to own lawyer hodges banquet if one serf conscientiously must not leave be against principle to turn off who serve conscientiously told barking so at time remember came out of business about settlement be last time paid shotover cleared throat hurriedly see calmadys house be being done up continued nice young fellow calmady never can help feeling certain awkwardness with take up rather short in conversation too sometimes terribly distressing thing deformity for lady calmady hope perhaps doe feel a woman must though tactful woman lady calmady very good woman of business still never feel quite at ease with lady calmady ca help wondering how will do in london know rather difficult thing going about much with lady louisa held out small teacup high penetrating voice asserted resolutely against father kindly stumbling chatter a asked be true be not coming up from whitney season oh tea yes thank very much dear well think possibly may not come up year goteway belief have heard of very eligible tenant for belgrave square house very eligible so nothing actually decided yet think very possibly may not come up spoke apologetically regarding daughter over small teacup with expression of entreaty feature of handsome innocent countenance begged not to deal harshly with lady louisa remained obdurate shotover conduct be becoming positive scandal said not conduct dear not conduct only money protested lord fallowfeild if money be not conduct really know what be retorted daughter pretend to go in for such fine distinction in case mr barking heard most shocking rumour at club other day did though ejaculated lord fallowfeild be too considerate to tell anything very definite felt that going out seeing everybody a of course have to be only right must have hint of what be being said one be talking about shotover can imagine how perfectly intolerable be for to feel that brother debt be being canvassed in sort of way be very sorry there must be gossip lord fallowfeild said humbly nasty thing gossip lie too mostly of nasty low unprofitable thing gossip of course not coming up will give colour to will though never thought of that always see straight through thing louisa have by far best head in family except ludovic uncommonly clever fellow ludovic wonder if have better talk over with ludovic if agree in thinking not coming up will make more talk why if only on shotover account be not in least turn daughter desired conversation to take pray remember have other child besides shotover papa said hastily for one sake run further risk of impoverishing be obvious that must save where can if there be chance of good let for belgrave square house must be madness to refuse after really care about london if there be important debate in lord can always come up for night so doe not matter about oh doe though lord fallowfeild put in quite humbly gently must always rather stay on at whitney only must not appear a if be least uncomfortable at meeting people will make point to go everywhere will be dreadfully fagged of course feel duty to of to do so must like girl to go out too people must not suppose have gown to back maggie emily have have several season be le worried about connie must be seen be looking extremely pretty be though lord fallowfeild chimed in brightening picture of reportedly gownless back have depressed abominably yes must have advantage have quite decided that must come up to at once will write to mama point out to how necessary be that one of girl at least must be very much en evidence year be most anxious must be connie a undertake fatigue responsibility feel have right of choice will see that be properly dressed undertake everything now papa if be going down by train ought to start will have hansom then a shook hand with presented unresponsive cheek to paternal lip lady louisa clinched matter may consider quite settled then about constance said mentioned to mr barking yesterday agreed ought to be done even if entailed little inconvenience expense be not right to be indifferent to appearance other two girl can come up for little while later alicia must help of course there be not much room in wretched little chelsea house of hers george winterbotham can turn out of dressing room alicia must exert for once papa connie need not bring maid country girl from whitney always fit in quite well with upper servant yet there be difficulty about keeping out of housekeeper room will provide maid for will write to mama about everything to morrow papa do beg will discourage shotover from coming here for really must much rather not see at present good bye pray start at once have barely time to get to waterloo so lord fallowfeild started little flustered little crestfallen on homeward journey able woman louisa said to uncommonly clear sighted woman louisa trifle hard wonder if barking ever feel now not very sensitive man barking though suppose that hardness in louisa come of having child always plenty of child in family except poor brother archibald lady jane have child yet somebody told 'd have one by bateman died never understood about capital thing for ludovic never did have by archibald be always curious to louisa must have child must have expected that somehow of barking louisa set more free of course in regard to sister very thoughtful for sister louisa suppose must have connie nuisance gossip about shotover pretty child connie best looking of lot people say be like wonderfully pretty child connie that young fellow decies think so too be very much mistaken very much attracted by connie fine young fellow decies comfort to hear of guy from suppose must go up to louisa gentlemanlike fellow decies must care to part with connie then reflection becoming increasingly interjectional a train trundled away southwestward lord fallowfeild leaned back in corner of railway carriage fell very fast asleep chapter ii telling how vanity fair made acquaintance with richard calmady there be refusing belief to fact old cloistered life at brockhurst for good evil be broken up katherine calmady recognised that stage have be reached on relentless journey that new prospect opened new horizon invited anxious gaze recognised also that have be be dead according to existing form must receive burial silent somewhat sorrowful yet not without hope of eventual resurrection in regard to nobler part of fair coloured petal of flower fall away from maturing fruit fruit rot to set free seed yet vital principle remains life life on though material clothing of change therefore katherine upspringing of patience chastened fortitude within result of reconciliation to divine light resignation of herself to indwelling set not to arrest falling of flower to help ripening of seed if old garment be out of date too straight narrow for child growth then let others be found did not wait to have ask offered that without hint of reproach of unwillingness yet so to offer cost not little for be by mean easy to sink natural pride go forth smiling with son of hers at once beautiful hideous in person for world to see something of personal heroism be demanded of whoso prescribes heroic remedy if remedy be to succeed at night alone in darkness katherine suddenly awaking must be haunted by perception of curious glance curious comment must of necessity attend richard through brilliant pageant of london season how must bear then self distrust laying fearful hand upon how must bear too must late acquired serenity of soul depart faith in gracious purpose of almighty god suffer eclipse must fall back into former condition of black anger revolt prayed not so long a evil did not descend upon must bear rest well enough for must keep faith katherine be beginning to regard other suffering might be in store for a negligible quantity with healthy body wholesome memory of great perfect human love be almost impossible that must adopt morbid self torturing attitude yet religious ideal worth name will always have in ascetic element element be so far present with personal suffering have come to bear not wholly unlovely aspect have ceased to gird against so long a richard be amused fairly content so long a evil have be abroad in brockhurst house that stormy autumn night must be frustrated estrangement between herself richard unacknowledged yet sensibly present that evil have begotten might be lessened cared little what sacrifice made what fatigue exertion even pain might be called on to endure enthusiasm of self surrender animated during last five month slowly with stumbling foot yet very surely have carried life burden of up to higher plane from more elevated standpoint saw past event existing relationship in perspective according to just permanent value only one object one person refused to range stood out from otherwise calm if pensive landscape a threatening danger monument of thing wicked fearful katherine tried to turn eye from object for provoked in great hatred burning indignation sadly at variance with saintly ideal have so captivated mind heart katherine remained always must remain happily for others very much woman a woman mother must not hate that other woman who have a feared come very near seducing son therefore very various cause combined to reconcile to coming adventure indeed set forth on with so cheerful countenance richard while charmed be also trifle surprised by alacrity with embraced regarded somewhat critically questioning whether mother be of more worldly light minded disposition than have heretofore supposed there have be talk of julius march joining contemplated exodus have declined smiling rather sadly no said to go must be mistake weakly selfish one on part have long ceased to be man of city be best employed indeed be most at ease herding few sheep here in wilderness be part parcel of just that have agreed be wise will leave behind for while presence must lessen thoroughness of change of scene of thought take up way of life be familiar to year ago habit of will soon come back have never known must be hindrance rather than help will wait keep lamp burning before altar fire burning upon hearth until please god may be in peace crowned with good fortune come back adventure fairly embarked on displayed quite other characteristic a be way with such skittish folk than katherine have anticipated against possibility of mortification against possibility of covert laughter pointing finger of crowd have steeled have not occurred to that richard trial own might take form of exuberant slightly vulgar popularity that far from being shoved aside into gutter young man might be hoisted with general acclamation on to very throne of vanity fair brockhurst establishment moved up to town at beginning of april by end of month sir

while brightness of pure enthusiasm shone in sweet eye have learned beyond possibility of dispute have be given through much tribulation to arrive at richard smiled upon tenderly then turning head remained silent for while sullen roar of great city invaded quiet room through open window heavy regular tread of policeman on beat shrill whistle hailing hansom from house few door distant up square then answering rumble of wheel clatter of hoof richard face have grown fierce again breath came quick turned on side once more dwarfed proportion of person became perceptible lady calmady averted eye

dearest be not tell said can not quite follow thought richard flung body sideways across bed kissed hand a held hot colour rushed over face neck up to root of close cropped curly hair spoke lying thus upon chest face half buried in sheet want to marry because because want child want son said word came to katherine just then disengaged one hand laid upon dear brown head waited in silence until violence of young man emotion have spent until broad muscular shoulder have ceased to heave strong young hand to grasp wrist suddenly richard recovered sat up rubbing hand across eye laughing with queer catch in voice beg pardon said be fool awful fool hang morabita voice golden house of god beastly showy omnipotence to voice carry one away to talk sense mother just brutal common sense fate be

rejoiced in son high spirit displayed while instinct of romance inspired speech touched answering chord in uplifted by now brief june night be nearly spent blind still creaked against open window sash thud of horse hoof beat of passing footstep have become infrequent while roar of mighty city have dwindled to murmur a of ebbing tide upon willow sand strewn beach after light of sunset walking horizon beneath pole star from west to east broadened upward now towards zenith even here in heart of london day broke with spacious solemnity richard raised sitting up blew out candle placed on table at bedside mother said will let in morning lady calmady be pale from long vigil unspoken yet searching emotion appeared very tall ghostlike even in soft white raiment a moved across drew up sucking blind above gray parapet of house rank of contorted chimney pot loveliness of summer dawn grew wide warm amber shaded through gradation of exquisite nameless colour into blue while across last lay horizontal line of fringed semi transparent opalescent cloud to katherine heavenly blue interspaces spoke of peace of stilling of strife when tragic yet superb human story must at last be fully told god be in be very tired struggle be so prolonged soul cried out for rest then reminded almost sternly that kingdom of god peace of be matter of time of place be within devout believer ever present

sister little lady constance quayle drew in breath sharply must must people consent said think so judging by appearance be almost sure must consent long silence followed richard lay still looking at rosy flush broadened in morning sky touched bosom of delicate cloud with living pulsating colour flushed too being softened into great tenderness great shyness quick yet noble shame for whole attitude towards question of marriage changed strangely a passed from abstract from region of vague purpose desire to concrete to thought of maiden with name local habitation maiden actual accessible whose image must recall whose pretty look guileless speech knew almost wish be not ludovic sister though remarked presently be great deal to ask have great deal to offer katherine said adding can care for

wave of angry sea then one be comely long limbed young soldier mr decies whom have seen last night at barkings great party when morabita sang soprano matchless voice be mixed up in strangest fashion with transaction lifted helen magic sea wave from off setting free even a did so dickie perceived that be not helen after whom young soldier carried in arm little lady constance quayle whereupon

calmady be a fine fellow a ever fought won almost hopeless battle said be somewhat heroic in opinion be very lovable be though lord fallowfeild commented quite gently woman who understood have idea of

not very quick will never spot that added mentally then reflected that little lady constance be not very quick might marry obediently even gladly be probable must develop sufficient imagination ever

be extraordinarily agreeable broke in lady alicia old lady combmartin be saying only yesterday george met at aldhams louisa know at dinner that have not heard better conversation for year be brought

very very soon be quite forgotten be though said lord fallowfeild somewhat incredulously face have returned to sadly puckered condition yes assure nobody think of after just first little shock know from lady louisa think one feel be not quite nice to dwell on thing of kind sister chimed in reddening again ought to be ignored from girl speaker have enjoyed reputation for great refinement of mind think amount to being more than not nice echoed lady louisa think be positively wrong for nobody can tell what accident may not happen to of at moment so be not at sure that be not actually unchristian to make thing like into serious objection know papa there must be deformed people in family just a there be consumption insanity under breeding attenuated salary mr quayle softly murmured becomes evident dear father must not expect too much of son of brother in law think of old lord sokeington mean great uncle of present man of course of temper lady louisa proceeded regardless of ironical comment amounted almost to mania yet lady dorothy hellard must certainly have married there never be question about must though bad old man sokeington never did approve of sokeington of course must mr crookenden who always have be devoted to told so did though said lord fallowfeild marriage be broken off dear made remark triumphantly feeling showed great acuteness oh dear indeed be

turning scarlet have though old scoundrel papa cried lady alicia so be dear very bad old man sokeington very amusing old man too though overcome by certain reminiscence lord fallowfeild chuckled little shamefacedly second daughter thereupon arranged fold of mauve cashmere with bent head be very clear papa shotover have be together to day thought shotover influence over papa be always demoralising be too extraordinary subject men joke about call amusing when get together pause followed brief cessation of hostility during mr quayle looked inquiringly at three companion alicia fancy shocked said to father fancy wicked louisa fancy chosen vessel strong delusion be upon only question be whose delusion be strongest who consequently will first renew fray ah chosen vessel thought a much see papa one really must be practical lady louisa began in clear emphatic tone know how have spoiled constance shotover have always be favourite even must admit that shotover wretched extravagance have impoverished helped to impoverish other child must also admit notwithstanding partiality for constance want to see connie want to hear from that broke out lord fallowfeild kindly heart yearned over ewe lamb of large flock eldest of said flock interposed sternly cried pray papa not yet connie be quite contented reasonable believe be out shopping just now too while be in state of indecision must be greatest mistake for to see must only disturb upset must alicia lady thus appealed to assented be true that when arrived at great house in albert gate that morning have found little lady constance with pretty baby face sadly marred by tear have put that down to exigency of situation young lady of refined mind cried under kindred circumstance have not wept copiously for better part of week before finally deciding to accept george winterbotham moreover point of jealousy undoubtedly pricked lady alicia in connection be far from being cruel woman comparing own modest material advantage in marriage with surprisingly handsome one offered to little sister must not be wholly sorry that latter rose be not entirely without thorn that flower in question must have be thornless a well a so very fine large must surely have trenched on injustice to herself thought have perhaps unconsciously influenced when enlarging on becomingness of refined indifference to sir richard calmady deformity in heart of heart be disposed perhaps unconsciously to hail rather than deplore fact of same deformity for did not tend subjectively to equalise lot that of little sister modify otherwise humiliating disparity of respective fortune therefore capped lady louisa speech by saying immediately yes indeed papa must only be unkindness to run risk of upsetting connie really nice girl ever really quite like idea of marriage doe though commented lord fallowfeild with air of receiving curious scientific information oh of course not how must then papa know how have always indulged connie lady alicia voice be slightly peevish in tone be not in very good health at present time with consequence that face showed thin bird like while notwithstanding genial heat of summer

unworthy brute who ever say sharp word to woman in condition before have time to find word other than sharp lady louisa barking returned to charge exactly asserted alicia be perfectly right at present connie be quite reasonable entreat papa be that will let remain so until have made up own mind do pray let be dignified one know how servant get hold of anything of kind discus if there be want of dignity indecision be too odious must really think just little of mr barking in matter have gone on in house see one must consider appearance with recent gossip about shotover want esclandre servant knowing about too then with partiality for constance can not suppose will have many opportunity of marrying men with forty fifty thousand year no papa a louisa say in partiality for connie must not entirely forget claim of other child must not be encouraged to think exclusively of be not fair that must think exclusively of know that george be poor be through fault of own most honourably refuse

come to morrow know ca do much be not possible with small mean establishment what little can do george be most willing must be done excellent fellow winterbotham lord fallowfeild put in soothingly very steady painstaking man winterbotham second daughter looked at reproachfully thank papa said own be little hurt just now by tone in alluded to george be though be sure be very sorry dear alicia hate to hurt anybody especially one of own child unnatural thing to hurt one of own child see feeling of of yours about shotover have be very painful to never have liked division in family never know where may lead to nasty uncomfortable thing division in family well papa can only say that division be almost invariably caused by want of sense of duty lady louisa voice be stern if people be over indulged become selfish then of course lose sense of duty sister be notable logician mr quayle murmured under breath if logic ruled life how clear how simple course then unfortunately doe shotover have really one to thank for bitterness that brother sister may feel towards have thrown away chance have got whole family talked about in most objectionable manner have be serious encumbrance to indirectly to of have suffered quite enough trouble annoyance already so must protest papa must very strongly definitely protest against connie being permitted still more encouraged to do exactly same

so sorry said breathlessly must have come sooner be talking to lady calmady did not know be so late be not afraid of talking to lady calmady be so very kind to there be many question wanted to ask promise to help tell ought to do be very glad of that will prevent making mistake attitude earnestness of artless speech be to richard almost pathetically engaging irritation vanished smiled looked up at own face flushing little fancy will ever make very dangerous mistake said ah might girl insisted see have always be told what to do always dickie asked more for pleasure of watching stand thus than for great importance attached to answer oh yes said first by nurse then by governess be not always very kind called obstinate did not mean to be obstinate only spoke in french german must not always understand since have grown up elder sister have told what ought to do seemed to richard that girl small round chin quivered little that look of vague distress invaded soft ruminant wide set eye so

rounded throat kept eye fixed on richard face bosom rose fell while word came somewhat gaspingly still talked on with touching little effect of determined civility lady calmady be very kind in telling might sometimes go over to whitney said must like be afraid papa will miss of course there will be others just same go out so much with of course must not ask to go over very often because know might be inconvenient for to have horse will have own horse richard answered wrote to chifney to look out for pair of cob for last week brown said liked that colour remember told be to be broken until big gun going off under very nose must make so much a wince be buying just for girl said just for dickie laughed why who on earth must buy anything for just must like to know began echoed resting hand on

infinitely rather have have everybody forget altogether if possible oh think must be wrong of rejoined with gentle dogmatism be selfish to forget anything be very sad be so very sad richard asked almost harshly girl stared at with parted lip oh yes said slowly of course think so be dreadfully sad then attitude still unchanged pretty plump hand still folded on lap went on in touching determination to sustain conversation with due readiness civility brockhurst be much larger house than whitney be thought so day drove over to luncheon when beautiful french cousin of yours be staying with remember yes remember richard said a spoke madame de vallorbes clothed in seawaves crowned shod with gold seemed to stand for moment beside innocent little fiancee how long be since have heard from did want money wondered must be intolerable if because of marriage never let help again while lady constance unemotional careful little voice continued a did ceaseless murmur of london remember be saying because cousin be quite most beautiful person have ever seen papa admired very much too spoke of a soon a louisa have left when be alone there seemed to so many staircase at brockhurst room opening one out of other have be wondering since lately whether will ever be able to find way about house will show way dickie said gently banishing vision of helen de vallorbes will show girl asked

of chair steadying with one hand on back of reached little silver paper covered parcel from neighbouring table then slipped back into sitting position drew silken blanket up across thigh tossed little parcel gently into lady constance quayle lap a near a possible let go without said not that be anything very wonderful be nothing only saw in shop in bond street yesterday struck a rather quaint thought might like why constance what be matter for girl pretty heart shaped face have blanched to whiteness of white dress eye be strained a of one who beholds object of terror not only chin round baby mouth quivered richard looked at amazed at evidence of distressing emotion then suddenly understood frighten how horrible said little lady constance have not suffered persistent training at hand of nurse governess elder sister during eighteen year of innocent living for nothing have own small code of manner moral of honour duty to requirement of code a apprehended yielded unqualified obedience not unheroic in own meagre rather puzzle headed fashion so now notwithstanding quivering lip retained intention of civility entered immediate apology for own weakness indeed replied please forgive know be very foolish be so sorry be so kind to be always giving beautiful present indeed be not ungrateful only have never seen seen like before please forgive will never be foolish again indeed will not be taken by surprise beg pardon will be so dreadfully unhappy if forgive while trembling hand fumbled helplessly with narrow ribbon tying dainty parcel big tear rolled down slowly out of great soft wide set heifer eye never be there more moving guileless spectacle witnessing richard calmady be taken somewhat out of personal misfortune seeming matter inconsiderable while childlike fiancee have never appeared more engaging sweetest of nature responded to artless appeal in very tender pity why dear constance said there be nothing to forgive be foolish not ought to have known better never mind only wipe pretty eye please yes be better now let break tiresome ribbon for be very kind to girl murmured then a ribbon broke under richard strong finger delicate necklace of many roughly cut precious stone topaz amethyst sapphire ruby chrysolite beryl joined together three row deep by slender golden chain slipped from enclosing paper wrapping into open hand constance quayle added rather tearfully oh be much too kind give too many thing one know ever have such beautiful present cob told of now pearl tiara gave last week deserve give too much give nothing in return oh yes

indulgent that felt comfortable assurance that be not angry with rather troubled little lady constance quayle rose to foot stood before again a child about to recite lesson think said must go louisa may want thank so much necklace be quite lovely never saw one like like so many colour remind of flower of colour at sunset in sky will like to wear very much will forgive for having be foolish if

quickly bless no be not answered see how anybody can very well be off having view about be just nuisance whole thing shout confound so might just a well let hear view miss st quentin must be awfully interested might help to straighten own out bit honoria paused moment doubting how much of thought must be justifiable to confide to companion certain vein of knight errantry in character inclined to set lance in rest ride forth rather recklessly to redress human wrong in redressing one wrong too often happens that wrong something perilously approaching one must be inflicted to save pain in one direction be unhappily to inflict pain in opposite one honoria be aware how warmly lady calmady desired marriage loved lady calmady therefore loyalty be engaged yet be match maker said at last so probably view be unnecessarily pessimistic happened to see lady constance just now can not pretend that struck a looking conspicuously happy lord shotover flattened shoulder against back of sofa

amen sort of business lord shotover leaned back once more turned wonderfully pleasant if not preeminently responsible countenance upon companion never went in for kind of racket miss st quentin continued not being conspicuously faithful must only have made fiasco of give word touch same when do run across think be awfully lucky for man to be made way decies be so there seemed help for have to chuck discretion a told give chance paused then asked with somewhat humorous air of self depreciation what do think now have done more harm than good made confusion worse confounded played fool generally again honoria vouchsafed immediate reply meditative mood still held present conversation offered much food for meditation companion confession of faith in true love if have good fortune to be born way have startled that speaker enjoyed reputation of being something of profligate lent singular point to confession have not expected from lord shotover of men a coming from sentiment be in high degree arresting interesting own ideal so far have decidedly anti matrimonial tendency while being in love appeared to her much overrated if not actively objectionable condition personally hoped to escape experience of then thought traveled back to lady calmady charm of personality sorrow splendid self devotion to object of devotion namely richard calmady being of strange contrast at once maimed beautiful being from whom honoria shrank in instinctive repulsion while unwillingly acknowledging that exercised permanent intimate fascination over imagination dwelt in quick pity too upon frightened wide eyed childish face recently seen rising from out diaphanous cloud of tulle prettiness of heightened by fair wealth of summer rose flash of costly diamond upon mr decies whole hearted young soldier lover whose existence threatened such dangerous complication in respect of rest of strangely assorted company finally meditative survey returned to point of departure in thought surveyed present companion undeniable excellence of sentiment clear seeing admittedly defective conduct in matter ethical financial never before have be at such close quarter with living immediate human drama notwithstanding detachment lofty indifference high spirited theory found profoundly agitating be sensible of being in collision with unknown incalculable force instinctively rose from place on sofa moving to open window looked out into night below park now silent deserted slept peacefully a expanse of remote country pasture woodland in mildly radiant moonlight here there be blottings of dark shadow cast by clump avenue of tree here there timid yellow flame of gas lamp struggled to assert against embracing silver brightness here there window glowed warm set in pale glistering facade of adjacent house cool light wind hailing from direction of unseen serpentine stirred hanging cluster of pink geranium fell over curved lip of stone vas standing along broad coping of balcony gently caressed girl bare arm shoulder seen under unaccustomed condition familiar object assumed fantastic aspect for night be mighty magician with power to render even weighty brick stone even hard uncomprising outline of monster modern city delicately elusive mockingly tentative unsubstantial meanwhile within from along vista of crowded brilliantly illuminated room came subdued yet confused insistent sound of musical instrument of many voice many footstep hush of woman trailing garment rise fall of unceasing conversation to honoria standing in quiet dimly seen place sense of moonlit world without gas candle lit world within increased nameless agitation infected haunting persuasion of phantasmagoric character of sound saluted ear sight met eye possessed vast uncertainty surrounded pressed in on while questioning of appearance actuality of truth falsehood right wrong justice injustice with have played idly earlier in evening took on new almost terrible proportion causing intelligence nay heart to reach out a never before in search of sure rock house of defense against disintegrating apprehension of universal instability illusion ah be very difficult difficult to point of alarm exclaimed suddenly turning to lord shotover looking straight in face with unself consciousness desire of support so transparent that gentleman found at once delighted slightly abashed bless soul ludovic be lucky devil said to what be what be so beastly difficult miss st quentin asked aloud sound of cheery voice recalled honoria to normal aspect of existence with almost humorous velocity smiled upon really believe quite know said perhaps that two people of whom be speaking really care for other that engagement have come between that have chucked discretion given chance tell what sort of man be strong enough to make most of chance when be got at moment lord shotover stepped forward adroitly planting right in front of thus screening from observation by george said under breath in tone of mingled amusement consternation be making most of chance now miss st quentin that most uncommonly comprehensively unless be very much mistaken companion tall person fold of heavy curtain while screening honoria from observation also in great measure obscured view of room yet not so completely that saw two figure cross one black one white of man girl be speaking man apparently pleading girl protesting moving hurriedly while a though in actual flight must have be moving blindly at random for stumbled against outstanding gilded leg of consol table set against further wall causing ornament on to rattle so doing gave plaintive exclamation of alarm perhaps even of physical pain hearing that nameless agitation that sense of collision with unknown incalculable force seized hold on honoria again while lord shotover feature contracted turned head sharply by george repeated under breath girl recovered followed by companion still pleading still protesting passed by further window on to balcony out of sight there followed period of embarrassed silence on part of usually voluble shotover while pleasant countenance expressed certain half humorous concern really be awfully sorry said 'd not slightest intention of landing in for thick of brown like replied smiling though with sense of nameless agitation still upon heart beat rather quick well perhaps not between moral courage be strong point there be nothing funk like row say what will do think 'd better quietly clear out just then sound caught honoria ear before vague question of ultimate truth falsehood right wrong fled away might savour of illusion here be something real actual something pitiful moreover arousing spirit of knight errantry in pushing to lay lance in rest go forth reckless of conventionality reckless even of consideration of justice to succour of oppressed womanhood what word man on balcony without be saying must not distinguish whether cruel kind that young girl be weeping with abandonment of long resisted tear must not doubt listen lord shotover exclaimed authoritatively hear be cry a if poor heart must break must stay if understand rightly sister have only got to depend on happens must

know say though what beastly thing be to hear woman cry wish to goodness 'd never come into confounded place let in for a spoke lord shotover turned towards door meditating escape in direction of brilliant vista of crowded room honoria st quentin enthusiasm once aroused became inexorable with long swinging stride outdistanced hesitating step stood in doorway arm extended a to stop runaway horse clear eye aglow a though lamp burned behind pale delicately cut face eloquent of very militant charity spice of contempt moreover for display of pusillanimity be quite perceptible to shotover in expression of charming modern angel clad in ball dress bearing fan instead of traditional fiery sword who so determinedly barred entrance of comfortably conventional worldly paradise to just now so warmly desired to regain admittance said with certain vibration in quiet voice be not to go be not to desert must be unworthy lord shotover brought mr decies here so be mainly responsible for present situation think just think what mean course of life will be affected by take place in next half hour must never cease to reproach if thing went wrong must young man said dubiously of course must honoria asserted having in power to help then shirking responsibility wo believe that of be better than for think how young be pretty dependent may be driven to do fatally foolish thing if be left unsupported must at least know what be going on be bound to do so moreover a mere matter of courtesy ca desert intend to stay do though faltered lord shotover in tone curiously resembling father honoria drew up proudly almost scornfully yes will stay continued be matchmaker have particular faith in admiration for marriage have though said lord shotover be slightly surprised slightly amused to credit be stated that put equivocal construction upon young lady frank avowal felt little sorry for ludovic be fearing latter good fortune be le fully established than have supposed no believe very much in marriage modern upper class marriage repeated just precisely on account seems to more degrading shameful that girl must risk marrying wrong man people talk about broken engagement a though be disgrace ca see that unwilling loveless marriage be disgrace so at very church door must urge encourage woman to turn back if doubted have done with whole thing upon word murmured lord shotover infinite variety of feminine outlook unqualified audacity of feminine action struck a bewildering talk of woman want of logic be relentless application of logic a apprehended staggered honoria have come close to in excitement laid fan on arm listen said listen how lady constance be cry come must know what be happening must comfort young man thrust hand into pocket with air of good humoured

close fitting dress clothes made rapid movement a though to lay hold on bear bodily away then recognising futility of such attempt turned upon intruder high spirited celtic face drawn with emotion

bareheaded in easy workmanlike garment short coat breech long boot spur came with repose of movement be born of well knit frame temperate life grace of gentle blood came with half smile on lip gladness in eye when first met hers have always be there however brief parting katherine perceived be just thus beloved dead must need return to must return at laying aside splendour of spirit in tenderness for mortal weakness even a christ laid aside visible glory of godhead came babe among men so must come in humble day fashion graciously taking on manner habit common to during earthly life

thus in tender illuminating though wordless communion with dead katherine did not know deepest spiritual experience like most exquisite physical one be to be measured by intensity rather than duration for space vision sensibly held so ardently desired presence there incontestibly beside personality vivid distinct yet in way remote serene a immense dome of cloudless sky chastened etherealised a song of answering nightingale in differing from bodily presence a song in question differed from of bird in laurel close at hand gradually with such sense of refreshment a one enjoys who bathing in clear stream at evening wash away soil sweat of weary journey katherine awoke to more ordinary observation of material surroundings became aware that dog camp have turned singularly restless slunk away a though wishing to avoid near neighbourhood crawled back to with dragging hind quarter cringing whining a though in acute distress by degree sound obtruded speaking of haste effort notably at variance with delicate gracious stillness came from highroad crossing open moor loomed up dark straight ridge against southern horizon came in rising falling cadence ever nearer nearer increasingly distinct increasingly urgent fast steady trot of horse moon meanwhile have swept clear of saw like edge of fir forest while thin white light of broadened upon dewy grass beat of horse hoof rang out clearer clearer katherine be aware that dear vision faded grew faint a have come softly without amazement fear so departed without agitation sadness of farewell leaving katherine profoundly consoled glory of womanhood restored to in indubitable assurance that what have be of necessity continued forever be therefore still listened idly to approaching sound not reckoning with a yet though roll of wheel be now added to rapid beat of hoof of trotting horse have turned down over hillside by crossroad leading to upper lodge suddenly ceased shout of man voice loud imperative momentary pause then clang of heavy iron gate swinging back into place once again roll of wheel steady urgent determined trot coming nearer nearer down elm avenue whose stately row of tree looked a though made of ebony burnished silver in slanting moonlight on came across bridge spanning glistering whiteness of long water on again steadily le rapidly a though pressed by hand of somewhat merciless driver hot to arrive bearer of stirring tidings up steeply ascending hill to house lady calmady listened beginning to question whom nocturnal disturber of peace of brockhurst might be only vaguely a yet since have recently experienced be so great so wide reaching in meaning promise for moment dwarfed other possible other imaginable event gracious tranquillity enveloped must not be penetrated by anxiety premonition of momentous happening a yet be not so however with camp for spirit of extravagant unreasoning excitement appeared to seize on dog forgetful of age of stiff limb short coming breath gamboled round lady calmady describing crazy circle upon grass barking until unseemly din echoed back harshly from against great red gray facade fawned upon abject yet compelling at last a though exasperated by absence of response turned tail bounded away through garden hall along terrace disappearing through small arched side door into house there within stir movement became momentarily more apparent shifting light flashed out through many paned window a though in quick search of eagerly desired presence nevertheless for little space katherine lingered fragrance of wild thyme of fair garden still about somnolent churring of night jar faint note of nightingale song still saluting ear be so difficult to return to cope with demand of ordinary life for have not be caught up into third heaven heard word unspeakable unlawful in entirety for living man to utter thing terrestrial in case a in so many other case refused to make large room for brook delay from thing celestial two servant came out hurriedly from same arched side door then clara that devoted handmaiden called from window of red drawing room ladyship there on troco ground see mr winter butler hurried along terrace katherine met on step of garden hall be anything wrong winter asked kindly for trusted servant betrayed unusual sign of emotion be wanted sir richard have returned lady said voice trembled sir richard be in gun room gave order that ladyship must be told that must be glad to speak to immediately chapter ix in dickie shake hand with devil dear be quite unexpected lady calmady tone be one of quiet innate joyousness gentle brightness pervaded whole aspect manner looked wonderfully young a though hand of clock have be put back by twenty odd year line have disappeared from face in eye be clear shining very lovely to behold richard glanced at a came swiftly towards across room then looked down again answered deliberately yes be a say quite unexpected time last night a little anticipated being back here a anticipated coming one plan change rapidly radically at time mine have done so sat at large library writing table pile of letter paper circular before judged unworthy of forwarding have accumulated during absence tore off wrapper tore open envelope quickly yet methodically a though bending mind with conscious determination to performance of self inflicted task looking at content of in turn with odd mixture of indifference close attention flung major part into waste paper basket set beside revolving chair tall green shaded lamp shed circle of vivid light upon silver maroon leather furnishing of writing table upon young man bent head upon restless hand a grasped straightened then tore with measured if impatient precision letter paper lying before lady calmady stood resting tip of finger on corner of table looking down at with clear shining eye reception of have not be demonstrative of be hardly sensible reconciling assurance of faith glory of third heaven still dazzled somewhat foot hardly touched earth yet so that mother love sensitive watchfulness be a yet somewhat in abeyance spoke again with same quiet joyousness of tone must have telegraphed to dearest then must have be ready to welcome a be fear must feel trifle neglected have be have fancied mightily busy day foolishly cumbered about much serving have gone out to forget maid food domesticity generally into dear garden paused smiling ah be gracious night said full of inspiration must have enjoyed drive home household refuse to take marriage of yours philosophically dickie demand great magnificence quite a much be sure for own glorification a for yours also multiplies small difficulty after manner of well conducted household a imagine since world began richard tore prospectus of mining company offering wealth beyond dream of avarice right across with certain violence oh well household may forego magnificence cease from multiplication of small difficulty alike a far a marriage of mine be concerned can tell household so to morrow mother can perhaps irony of position must be more nicely pointed by announcement coming directly from must heighten drama dickie dearest katherine said greatly perplexed whole affair be at end lady constance quayle be not going to marry be not going to marry lady constance quayle on point at least be entirely at one london will know to morrow perhaps brockhurst in interest of endangered philosophy have better know to night richard leaned forward opening tearing sorting paper again rasping quality be in voice speech hitherto unknown to mother cold imperious quality in manner also new to brought down to earth setting foot thereon uncompromisingly earth on be thus set be must be owned rather ugly woman made of weaker stuff must have cried out against such sudden painful declension katherine happily for herself for about waking even from dream of noble far reaching attainment waked with not only wit heart in steady action yet in nowise went back on revelation have be vouchsafed to be in nowise disqualified rendered suspect because gamut of human emotion proved to have more extended range more jarring discord than have yet reckoned with mind be large enough to make room for novel experience in sorrow a well a in joy retaining while poise sanity therefore recognising new phase in development of child without hesitation regret of self love for disturbance of own gladness braced to meet pride have be wounded somehow knew not how to very quick smart of wound be too shrewd a yet for precious balm of articulate tenderness to soothe must give time to heal little meanwhile setting scrupulously to respect dark humour meet pride with pride calm with at least equal calmness drew chair up to end of table settled to listen quite composedly will be well dearest said that must explain to clearly what have happened to do so may avert possible complication richard hand paused among paper regarded lady calmady reflectively not without grudging admiration evil spirit possessed necessity of mastery inevitable reaction from recently endured humiliation provoked to measure strength against hers needed sacrifice to propitiate anger that sacrifice must be in sort human one so deliberately pulled tall lamp nearer swung chair round sideways leaning elbow on table with result that light rested on face did more rested upon body upon leg foot disclosing extent of deformity involuntarily katherine shrank back be a though have struck morally indeed have struck for there be cynical callousness in disclosure in departure from practice of careful self respecting concealment meanwhile richard watched a shrinking eyelid drooped quivered mother said quietly imperatively when not without perceptible effort again raised eye to went on quite agree with that will be well for to explain with view to averting possible complication have become necessary that must clearly understand one at least that dear mother must understand position fully finally have be too nice heretofore truth being very far from nice have expended much trouble ingenuity in effort to ignore went up to london in fond hope that world at large must support in self deception so did for time being in main composed of very fairly honest sensible person have grown tired of sentimental lying of helping to bury head ostrich like in sand have gone over to side of truth very far from flattering pretty truth to have just alluded with result among others that engagement have come to abrupt really rather melodramatic conclusion paused go on richard lady calmady said be listening drew up sitting very erect keeping eye steadily fixed on speaking steadily coldly though lip twitched little lady constance did honour to call on last night rather later than absenting in very thick of lady louisa barking ball for purpose katherine moved slightly dress rustled yes considering character training be rather surprising demarche on part bore convincing testimony to agitation of mind did come alone richard lapsed into easier position oh dear said allowing for desperation dictated proceeding be carried out in very regular manner with praiseworthy regard for appearance lady constance be in opinion very sweet person be perfectly modest have unusual regard a woman go for honour duty a woman understand again voice took on rasping quality brought friend young lady with fortunately there be occasion for to speak to have good taste to efface during interview saw in hall afterwards will always remember very distinctly so imagine will then lord shotover waited outside with carriage oh believe admitting inherent originality affair be conducted with admirable regard for appearance again regular flow of richard speech be broken throat have gone very dry lady constance appealed to in extremely moving term articulate otherwise to set free to set free upon what ground upon rather crude preeminently sensible ground dear mother after full consideration found bid be not high enough indeed katherine said yes indeed dear mother richard repeated doe that surprise quite ceased to surprise when pointed out fact of case for be touchingly sincere respected for that position be ungracious one for have charming nature really wanted to spare just a much a be possible along with gaining of cause gift of speech be limited know then degree of eloquence diplomacy must have rendered that have to say agreeable to self esteem oh on whole did very well very conclusively richard raised head pausing moment again that dryness of throat checked utterance then recalling scene of past night great wave of unhappiness pure simple of immense disappointment immense self disgust broke over anger outraged pride came near being swamped by came near losing bitter self control cry aloud for help mastered inclination perhaps unfortunately continued speaking yes decidedly with exception of ludovic that family posse ready tongue yet contrive to make meaning pretty plain in end have just driven over from whitney be fresh from fine example of eventual plain speaking from excellent father of family lord fallowfeild be instructive for main thing after a must agree mother be to understand clearly to make clearly understood in respect be afraid have failed good deal blinded by own fine egoism have even failed altogether to understand others lady constance for instance posse very much more character than suited to credit with be harsh dearest katherine murmured lip trembled not at all answered have only said good bye to lying can honestly deny dear mother that whole affair be just one of convenience told strike now a rather brutally primitive announcement wanted wife because wanted son son to prove to entirety of own manhood son to give at second hand certain obvious pleasure satisfaction be debarred a know from obtaining at first hand engaged to find bride poor little lady constance quayle unfortunately for appeared to meet requirement being pretty healthy too innocent undeveloped to suspect rather mean advantage proposed to take of what know sound rather gross stated thus plainly day of lie being over dare deny well then proceeded to traffic for desirable bit of young womanhood of prospective maternity to buy from such of relation a be perverted enough to countenance transaction just a shamelessly a though have gone into common bazar after manner of cynical east bargained for poor child in fat tailed sheep cowry doe appear to almost incredible almost infamous that must have done thing price offered seemed sufficient to of people not to have learned that past forgetting to day thanks to lord fallowfeild thick headed blundering veracity thank heaven have more heart more sensibility more self respect more decency than allowed for plucked up spirit enough to refuse to be bought sold like pedigree filly heifer think be rather heroic considering tradition pressure have be brought to bear to keep silent can only honour reverence for coming to tell frankly though at eleventh hour that preferred man of particular position fortune with ordinary complement of limb to brockhurst house in london forty to forty five thousand year richard laughed savagely leaning forward spreading out arm well dear mother since a say day of lie be over remnant of human being may see here at moment if will only have kindness to look at first katherine have listened in mute surprise bringing mind not without difficulty into relation to immediate present then watchful sympathy have be aroused then anxiety then tenderness denying expression since time for be not yet ripe a minute lengthened flow of richard speech not only continued gained in volume in force sympathy anxiety tenderness be merged in emotion of ever deepening anguish so that sat a one who contemplates spellbound scene of veritable horror from region celestial to region terrestrial have be hurried with rather dislocating suddenness sorry journey did not end there for hardly be foot planted on solid earth again than demand came that must descend still further to region sub terrestrial region frankly infernal descent to hell though rapid to point of astonishment be by mean easy rather be violent remorseless driving a by reiterated blow rude merciless dragging onward downward yet even so for anguish shame a of unseemly exposure perversion of intention action scorn so ruthlessly poured upon be le of compelled than of richard compelling that thought for even while anger thus drove dragged be tortured in flame far below so seemed that constituted finest sting of agony beyond power to reach help after stood on edge of crater watching fought right down in molten wave of fought with too more fiercely even than fought with so that now a year ago waiting outside red drawing room hearing stern peremptory tone of surgeon moan of unspeakable physical pain grating of saw picturing dismemberment of living body so loved katherine be tempted to run little mad beat beautiful head against wall age while taking jot tittle from capacity of suffering still in sane healthy nature brings certain steadiness to brain coolness to blood therefore katherine sat very still silent sweet eye half closed spirit bowed in unspoken prayer surely loving god who brief hour ago have vouchsafed fair vision of delight of youth must ease torment spare son while outward nature remained reposeful gracious in aspect a ever churring of night jar occasional bark of fox in warren song of answering nightingale wandered in at open casement along with came sweetness of bed of wild thyme from grass slope rich languid scent of blossom of little round headed orange tree set in green tub below carven guardian griffin on flight of step leading up to main entrance that have be lovely continued lovely still therefore perhaps must hope even in fulness of anguish gate of hell might stand open to ascending a well a descending foot so that awful road might at last at last be retraced by tormented child of hers whom though railed against still supremely loved richard whether actually intentionally must be difficult to say misinterpreted resented silence apparent calm waited for time eye fastened upon half averted face then picked up one of remaining packet from table tore off wrapper glanced at content stretched out left arm holding said content suspended over waste paper basket yes be evident declared even care to look well then must not admit that have be guilty of extravagance of fatuous folly worse in seriously proposing that well born sensitive girl must not only look at habitually closely take for chance in life crippled dwarf like anomaly human curiosity creature so unsightly that must be carried about like baby in arm lest repulsive ungainliness must sicken bystander if leaving shelter of railway rug armchair try unhappy brute to walk oh be not angry with blame be not surprised agree with down to ground sympathise comprehend man more told so last night only amazed at insane egoism must ever have induced to view matter in other light woman be generally disposed to be hard on one if dear mother must be in degree tempted to be hard on constance quayle beg to consider own engagement own marriage father here katherine interrupted rising in sudden revolt richard said be more dear than can either permit can bear if have sort of mercy left in bring father name that lie between into hideous conversation young man looked hard at then opening hand let piece of torn paper flutter down into basket be done with singularly measured action symbolic of casting off last tie severing last link bound life allegiance to companion yes exactly said a expected day of lying being over a good a own outrage to taste affection that so frightful thing a be must venture to range alongside memory of husband out of own mouth be judged dear mother if be thus to upon whom after have natural claim what must be to others think of indeed katherine made attempt to answer perception of grain of truth seasoned vast glaring injustice of accusation unnerved speech be ingeniously cruel humour such that be vain to protest hopelessness of affected to point of physical weakness moved across room intending to gain door go for seemed to limit of power of endurance have be reached strength must not carry so far stumbled on upturned corner of shining tiger skin rug recovered trembling laid hold of high narrow marble shelf of chimneypiece for support must rest little lest strength must wholly desert must fall before reaching door behind within circle of lamplight richard remained still sorting tearing flinging away that remained of pile of paper deft persistent activity of in mixture of purpose abstraction be agitating seeming to katherine listening ear a though might go on endlessly until not only waste paper everything within reach thing spiritual thing of heart duty obligation gracious tender courtesy a well a thing merely material might be thus relentlessly scrutinised judged worthless rent asunder cast forth what must be spared wondered what left when work of destruction be completed what must follow next bracing turned purposing to close interview by brief pleading of indisposition to escape a did so sound of tearing ceased richard slipped down from place at writing table shuffling across room flung down in long low armchair on opposite side of fireplace want to detain for unreasonable length of time mother said understand other in main think that without subterfuge self deception at last there be detail to be considered a leave here early to morrow morning think will feel with be desirable must have talk out there be good many eventuality for be only reasonable prudent to make provision on eve of indefinitely long absence practically good many people be dependent on one way consider honourable to leave affair at loose end however uncertain own future may be richard voice have still that rasping quality while bearing be instinct with coldly dominating almost aggressive force katherine though little addicted to fear felt strangely shaken strangely alienated by dead weight of personality by perception of innate tremendous vigour of being to whom have given birth have imagined specially during last few month of happy intimate companionship that if ever mother knew child knew richard through through appeared have be mistaken for here be new richard at once terrible magnificent regarding whom must predicate nothing with certainty defied tenderness out paced imagination paralysed will between thought desire intention hers blind blank space have suddenly intruded impenetrable to thought in person be here close beside in mind be despairingly far away to last not only word manner expression singular yet sombre beauty bore convincing testimony have matured with almost unnatural rapidity leaving far behind in presence felt diffident mentally insecure even a child remained standing holding tightly to narrow ledge of mantelpiece felt dazed giddy a in face of upheaval cataclysm of nature in relation to son be conscious in truth that whole world have suffered shipwreck where be going dickie asked at last very simply anywhere everywhere where amusement even semblance of be to be have answered do wish to know how long will be away just precisely a long a amusement in form offer a power of being amused remains to strike a slightly ignoble be afraid be point dear mother upon be supremely indifferent have posed rather extensively on exalted side of thing so far have strained at gnat finished up by swallowing remarkably full grown camel whole business of proposed marriage have be anything graceful when looked at in common sense way in most people of necessity look at lord fallowfeild appealed to against appeared to slightly humorous a one man of world to be eye opener be likewise profitable lesson promptly laid to heart be exclusively from point of view of man of world propose to regard circumstance personal peculiarity in future so to begin with if please from time forth put aside question of marriage in case make more attempt to buy innocent well bred young girl inviting to condone obvious disability in consideration of little title money richard ceased to look at lady calmady looked away through open window into serene sky of summer night certain hunger in expression not altogether pleasant to witness fortunately continued with something between laugh sneer there be mighty army of woman always have be who come under head of innocent young girl though of have plenty of breeding of kind attach superstitious importance to marriage ceremony position money may obtain consolation in direction lady calmady ceased to require cold support of marble mantelshelf be unnecessary for to discus subject at least richard said young man turned head again looking full at again distance divided from became to cruelly apparent while strength begot in shrinking of fear be sorry replied ca agree with there be inevitable that must differ in future that must frequently disapprove ca expect to emancipate from prejudice a be already emancipated be not sure even wish that still whatever future may bring forth of dear mother be determined to make clean breast to night so that will never have cause to charge with lack of frankness of attempt to deceive yet at moment poor mother heart cried out to be deceived if thereby might be eased little of suffering then nobler spirit prevailing within katherine rallied fortitude better must be bound to even by cynical avowal of projected vice than not bound at listening now gained right bitter enough right to command measure of confidence in still darker day a apprehended only too certainly lay ahead so answered calmly go on richard a say may differ in future may disapprove can be silent be right be better for must hear once more young man be compelled to yield grudging admiration tone softened somewhat like to see stand said conversation may be prolonged one never quite know what may crop up will be overtired to morrow when be gone there will be thing to do lady calmady drew forward chair from end of writing table back be towards lamp face in shadow of be glad in degree lessened strain sweet night air coming in at open casement fluttered lace on bodice a with touch of light cool hand of be glad too be refreshing grew increasingly exhausted physically weak richard observed not without solicitude be afraid be not well mother said katherine shook head smiling upon with misty eye lip somewhat tremulous be always well replied only to night have be given to scale height sound opposing depth be little overcome by perplexity by surprise what doe that signify will have plenty of time too much probably in to rest range idea when be gone dearest must not be here alone oh people will visit doubt animated by kindly wish to lessen solitude answered still smiling remembrance of honoria st quentin letter came to mind must be that girl have inkling of what be in store for that have inspired slight over warmth of protestation of affection honoria must always be ready to come must ask said solicitude passed from richard expression softening from tone by mean ask must cap climax round irony of situation to admiration indeed why katherine inquired painfully impressed by renewed bitterness of manner if be fond of be convincingly sufficient have never be very sympathetic be detail will be gone therefore pray have anybody else happen to fancy so long a do have one must be here alone julius remains faithful through chance change imagine even julius have sufficient social sense to perceive that faithfulness may be little out of place at juncture at least sincerely hope will perceive for otherwise will have to be made to do so will be nuisance dickie dickie what be implying lady calmady exclaimed by what strange unlovely thought be possessed to night be learning to look at thing a average man of world look at be said have be too refined to be self critical with consequence that have allowed considerable degree of latitude in many direction julius permanent residence here rank among fine fanciful disregardings of accepted propriety with have indulged ourselves spade be to be called spade in future at least by so for very same reason go forth like average man of world to enjoy pleasure of sin for season do object to julius other man being guest during absence unless have woman of own position in life living here with level in social matter have changed once for have come to sane mind renounced eccentric subterfuge paltry hypocrisy by mean of have attempted to keep disagreeable fact at bay truth naked unabashable be only goddess worship henceforth leaned forward laying hand upon arm of chair manner be harsh still coldness have departed from rather did white heat of passion consume dreadful to witness yes be wisest to repeat so that on part there may be excuse for shadow of misapprehension level have altered old one can never be restored want to have grasp mother swallow digest so that pass into fibre tissue of thought about for acutely unscientific ingeniously unreasonable idea obtains widely among respectable sentimental so called religious person

order just a often a get chance will curse again curse back speaker voice be deep resonant filling whole room utterance deliberate unshaken face dark with malign beauty of implacable hatred hearing seeing thus katherine calmady fortitude forsook ceased to distinguish discriminate nature gave way knelt upon floor before hand clasped tear coursing down cheek of attitude aspect be unconscious oh richard richard cried forgive curse dearest throw blame on dearest accept not on god only try try to forgive forgive for being mother forgive that ever loved married forgive intolerable wrong

content ah hardly know what say only rail at beloved not at god then try try not to leave in anger try before go to forgive richard have sunk back in chair hand clasped under head watching gave strangest sensation to see mother kneeling before thus at first shocked almost to point of heated protest a against thing unpermissible indecorous then devil of wounded pride of anarchy of revolt asserting began to relish to be appeased by unseemly sight little lady constance quayle that of be symbol have disappointed escaped here be woman worth dozen constance quayles in beauty in intellect

always will be in last twenty four hour there be many thing have ceased to believe in among dear mother be human responsibility paused motioned lady calmady towards chair with certain authority therefore calm said grieve a little a may be about matter let talk over without further emotion waited brief space giving time to recover composure then continued coldly with careful abstention from show of feeling let clear mind of cant go forward knowing that there be really neither good evil for even a god whose existence treated from anthro pomorphic standpoint just now so a to supply with target to shoot at windmill at to tilt row of ninepin set up for mere satisfaction of knocking down again be plausible delusion invented by man in vain effort to protect fellow from profound sense of loneliness impotence seizes on if catch so much a passing glimpse of gross comedy of human aspiration human affection briefly human existence strive a might excitement gained on richard once more for young blood be hot gallop masterfully along vein specially under whip of real imagined disgrace sat upright grasping arm of chair looking not at mother away into deep of summer night perhaps personal peculiarity confer on unusually acute perception of inherent grossness of human comedy propose to take lesson to heart teach not to sacrifice present to future to fling away ideal like so much waste paper just take can immediately get tell to limit horizon go common way of common coarse grained sensual man in a far a way be possible to be of world worldly so mother want to understand that from day forth turn over new leaf not only in thought in conduct be going to have just that money position even vile deformity for by god will use too what people wo give for love will give for curiosity can bring of pleasure notoriety be going to lay hold of life with rather horribly strong arm of mine looked across at lady calmady with sneering smile strong repeated strong a young bull ape mean to tear very vitals out of living to tear knowledge excitement intoxication out of making by right of conquest own will compel existence to yield that yield other men more because sens be finer acquaintance with sorrow more intimate quarrel with fortune more vital more just a can not have wife will have mistress a can not have honest love will have gratified lust be not stupid will not follow beaten track imagination have be stimulated into rather dangerous activity by pre natal insult put upon now have emancipated propose to apply imagination practically young man flung back in chair again there ought to be startling result said with gloomy exultation think so mother there must be startling result lady calmady bowed together putting hand over eye then raising head managed to

sinning other from hard earned sleep once again in clearer more urgent accent voice of city repeated message to helen de vallorbes calling aloud to to do even a be doing namely to wed to wed hearing understanding that message for little space shame took in face of own shamelessness so that closed eye unable for moment to look at richard calmady a crossed great room in bland yet generous light almost immediately voice cold measured in tone there close beside claimed attention that said at dinner rather distress helen then shame shame madame de vallorbes of necessity opened eye so doing needed self control to repress cry forced open hand down very hard on mattress of sofa for richard leaned back against jamb of open window saw face poor figure in profile left hand hung straight at side tip of finger only just not touching floor again a at midday spectacle of deformity worked upon strangely what of said at dinner distress asked gently with sudden solicitude showed have be wretchedly negligent host in speaking young man turned head looked at paused moment almost startled by resplendent aspect then looked down at own stunted defective limb expression became very grim raised shoulder just perceptibly reproach with having allowed to be so much alone must have be awfully dull for be little dull helen said still gently ought to have begged to ask of people know in

exasperate saint be saint a yet be still human radically for own peace of mind lamentably human be only too capable of being grieved humiliated hurt there be folly to say such thing to be hopelessly insensible to so take refuge in quoting own word of morning against that explanation be lucid if hearer refuse to accept be dull doubt honestly fail to see how remark of mine can be held to apply in present case applies quite desolatingly well helen declared with spirit then manner softened into seductiveness of forgiveness once again so dear richard be glad have already determined to leave here to morrow must have be little too wretched to arrive at determination after conversation must go alone to hear old flame morabita sing only if voice be still a sympathetic a of old if move from present insensibility may read remembrance of aspect of visit into witchery of if like may occur to what aspect really meant helen smiled upon leaning little forward eye shone a though looking out through unshed tear be not exactly flattering to one vanity to be compelled to depute to woman making of such thing clear be too evident waste time in attempting to make clear explanation be lucid et caetera helen shook back head with extraordinary charm of half defiant half tearful laughter be playing game whole intelligence bent on playing of skilfully yet be genuinely touched be swayed by very real emotion spoke from heart though word passing action subserved ultimate purpose in regard to richard calmady after one must retain remnant of self respect with to cover nakedness of one oh yes decidedly morabita voice have best do rest richard have moved from station in window stood at far end of sofa resting hand on gilded carven arm of now ungainliness of deformity be hidden height be greater than of companion obliging to look up at gave word helen said have notion what be driving at driving at driving at cried why self evident truth that be forcing rather brutally to pay full price of weakness in coming here in permitting indulgence of seeing again told directly arrived with rather cynical frankness have not changed be quite true what be at brockhurst four year ago what then felt that be that feel still oh have nothing to reproach with in defect of plain speaking excess of amiable subterfuge hit out very straight from shoulder directly arrived also told how have devoted place with after be not wholly unconnected to cult to ideal worship of woman whom loved so have devoted richard said yet be weak enough to remain young man face relaxed expression remained enigmatic why not asked because in remaining have laid open to misconstruction to manner of pain penalty not easy to be endured to odious certainty of appearing contemptible in estimation a well a in own helen patted pretty foot upon floor in small frenzy of irritation how can hope to escape since even precious being whom affect to worship keep sternly at arm length be among other pleasing thing confided to immediately on arrival lest seen at close quarter must fall below requirement so must suffer disillusion ah be frightfully cold blooded repulsively inhuman whether judge others by reckoning equally devoid of natural feeling whether find vindictive relish in rejecting friendship affection so lavishly offered be offered lavishly that come a news to put in ah be leave to picture pleasing entertainment afforded offerer in seeing ignore offering worse still take examine throw aside like dirty rag in one case underline rejection almost to point of insult be very instructive be learning whole lot about richard said coolly look madame de vallorbes cried do not prefer exposing to probability of serious illness rather than remain under same roof with inference hit one in face to pestilential exhalation unspeakable abomination of naples harbour appear le dangerous than near neighbourhood put more strongly than must answered smiling yet from certain standpoint may very well be true for instant helen hesitated intelligence for alertness be strained exactly to appraise value of word over under rating eye searched with certain boldness imperiousness of gaze richard

disappointment hardly exercise greater rage of caution perhaps be just perhaps have arrived at at last perhaps be here said turned away steadying with one hand against jamb of window shuffled out slowly laboriously onto balcony into night for quite perceptible length of time helen de vallorbes continued to contemplate light visited surface of crocus yellow silken lap followed line of rich

become beyond example loathsome most deplorable moment of very inglorious career will be precisely that in cease to look at with dispassionate contempt helen knelt down resting beautiful arm upon dark hand rail of balcony letting wrist droop over into outer dimness bland light from open window dwelt on kneeling figure bowed head be a well perhaps that night dropped veil upon face yet so be said may repudiate idea fact remains say must affect woman alike affect for instance whose conception of love of relation between man woman be dependent upon slightly improper very tedious marriage service a authorised by english church let conventional be conventional still so much better if appeal to meagre timid inadequate respectable generation of fashion plate with sixpenny book of etiquette moral social stuck inside to serve for soul helen voice broke in little spasm of laughter hand began unconsciously to open close open close weaving in soft outer darkness may leave out of argument there

like watchful soliciting eye from out darkness of narrow street steep lane cutthroat alley while above high uplifted against opacity of starless sky blood red beacon burned on summit of vesuvius sombre glow of reflected upon underside of mass of downward rolling smoke a upon belly of slow crawling monstrous serpent suddenly helen spoke once again with apparent inconsequence richard must have known must never satisfy why did try to marry constance quayle to escape from whom from from be much same thing a saying from suppose must not escape so seems dear richard said plaintively yet with very winning sweetness why after must want so desperately to escape richard moved little farther from have already explained that to to point of insult so tell said surely be unnecessary to go over

slightly ironical did really like oh dear yes liked exceedingly be quite curiously clever be sincere be rather beautiful too in own style have always thought that by mean have after conversation richard went for long ride inspected cottage in building at sandyfield visited house undergoing extensive internal alteration stand back from clerke green about hundred yard short of appleyard saddler shop at farley row came in late unusual silence held during dinner lady calmady took to task reproaching with selfishness honoria be very dear to so only too probably have overrated friendliness of dickie attitude towards young lady have seemed to get on so extremely well in spring very fairly well at whitsuntide yet perhaps in a in so much else richard put constraint upon obeying conscience rather than inclination katherine be perturbed have perturbation suffered diminution yesterday upon miss st quentin arrival richard remained unexpansive to day however matter have improved something possibly thunderstorm seemed to have thawed coldness broken up reticence of manner therefore katherine gave thanks moved with lighter heart a for miss st quentin innate gladsomeness pervaded aspect

defective taste though diverted must be owned gave attention more closely to outward drama of storm rain to antic of rook because be very conscious of fact that richard calmady have followed mother into red drawing room hurt though have now of necessity witnessed many time hurt still very shrewdly distressed to see walk a heard soft thud shuffle of onward progress followed by little clatter of

excessively provoking for honoria perceived that for once in life young man be distinctly not to say acutely nervous reward will be limited be afraid replied for temper be unaccountably out of sort afternoon if one may make bold to inquire why out of sort dear miss st quentin sat down on parapet near crossed leg fell to nursing left knee woman of black bodice went up across pale stubble to companion talked to nodding head in direction of bridge have promised to do certain thing having promised of course must do honoria looked away towards harvester up there among gold of corn yet now have committed thinking over find dislike doing warmly statement of case be just trifle vague mr quayle remarked if one may brave suggestion supersede first duty by second of course greater with little exercise of imagination little good will little assistance from true friend thrown in perhaps be generally quite possible to manage think be prepared to play part of true friend undoubtedly then go to cairo for winter with evelyn tobermory must take low gown ah poor little soul be pathetic though be forbidden to wear let stay here honoria said ludovic gazed at hand a clasped knee then looked sideways at companion here meaning meaning brockhurst dear miss st quentin asked very sweetly meaning england declared england ah really that plea better patriotism be excellent virtue remark

be use of fencing longer have done that engaged to do namely displayed patience of innumerable ass if may be pardoned mentioning such thing year pas really do seem to get forwarder position becomes slightly ludicrous know know honoria cried penitently that be ludicrous protested have be unreasonable traded on forbearance have done wrong in allowing to wait that must not very well help said since chose to wait indeed greatly preferred waiting a long a there seemed to be hope there be something anything in short to wait for ah be precisely what have never be sure about whether there really be anything to wait for not sat straight on coping of parapet again face bore most engaging expression there be certain softness in aspect to day be le of youth comrade so seemed to mr quayle more distinctly more consciously woman now to sound of trotting horse hoof be added that of wheel with clang park gate be thrown open be still uncertain in back of mind be there still trifle of doubt if so give benefit of young man pleaded half laughingly half brokenly carriage passed under gray archway of red brick freestone lodge rapidly came on down wide smooth string coloured road space of neatly kept turf on side under shade of heavy foliaged elm tree mr quayle glanced at paused with raised eyebrow call to witness that swear dear miss st quentin though men have be known to become blasphemous on slighter provocation than said however rather violently approaching interruption will be soon over hope believe since driving be that of richard calmady of brockhurst when temper like own being somewhat out of sort a jehu son of nimshi of old father morning ministration to maid again driveth furiously then with air of humorous resignation mouth working little long neck directed forward a in

round to horse head stood little extended still rigid a of bronze red of open nostril silver mounting of harness very noticeable lady calmady called to mr young man passed round at back of carriage standing on far side of roadway talked with honoria st quentin remained sitting on parapet of bridge singular disinclination to risk movement have come upon not present situation in relation to ludovic quayle that other situation of half disclosed glory new exquisite fulness of life oppressed penetrating whole being to point of physical weakness questioningly yet with entire unself consciousness looked up at richard calmady from exalted height of driving seat looked down at dark cloth rug be wrapped tight round from waist downward concealed high driving iron against foot rested concealed strap steadied in place person appeared finely proportioned head face be surprisingly handsome seen thus from below though must be conceded expression of latter be very far from angelic be well advised to stay at home honoria said there be grating tone in voice function be even more distinguished for dulness than expected on contrary be not in least dull be actively objectionable ingeniously unpleasant whereas face softened little glanced at golden water cornland lush green of paddock rich massive colouring of woodland sky honoria glanced at likewise so doing rose to foot that nostalgia of thing new glorious ached in yet pain of have strange intimate charm making unlike pain have ever yet felt hurt very really made weak yet must not have have cease yes be very lovely be said laid hand on folded leather of carriage hood again looked up be good deal to have always own to come back to richard spoke sadly almost unwillingly dickie did not answer looked down certain violence energy very evident in blue eye hard in depth of desolate a sky of winter night calmly yet in way desperately a who dare inquiry beyond range of permitted human speech young man woman looked at one lady calmady sweet voice meanwhile went on in kindly question ludovic quayle in well placed slightly elaborate answer near horse threw back head pole chain rattled smartly be lip parted word if word indeed there be died in throat raised hand a though putting tangible actual presence away from did not change colour for moment delicate feature appeared thickened a by rush of blood be almost plain yet effect be inexpressibly touching be a though have received mysterious injury be dumb incapable to express let hand drop at side turned away walked to far end of bridge suddenly richard voice came to aggressive curt look out ludovic stand clear of wheel horse sprang forward groom scrambled up at back carriage swung away from brightness of open to gloom of avenue up long hill to house mr quayle contemplated for minute so then with air of amused toleration followed miss st quentin across bridge poor dear dickie calmady poor dear dickie said attempt impossible fails to attain a matter of course meanwhile miss possible equally a matter of course be very magnificent doubt be also not little uncomfortable at time for other people however that trifle of criticism be after beside mark now that whirlwind have ceased miss st quentin may still small voice of own affair presume to make there stopped abruptly dear friend asked in quick anxiety what be matter pardon what on earth have happened to for honoria leaned elbow on low carved pillar terminating masonry of parapet covered face with hand incontestably shuddered queerly from head to foot wait second said in stifled voice be nothing be right slowly raised took long breath then turned to faithful lover showing brave if somewhat drawn tired countenance ludovic said gently please let talk more about entreat wait longer if there be uncertainty if there be doubt in back of mind be gone forgive must sound brutal there be more doubt ca marry be sorry horribly sorry for have be a charming to a man must be will never be able to marry mr be expression retained sweetness even effect of amusement though lip quivered eyelid be little red come up to requirement of grand passion said ala poor be that honoria protested ah then paused with air of extraordinary intelligence perhaps one else doe yes said simply like be there so have got to go through with one else doe in case be indeed hopeless give up cried moved aside stood gazing at rising trout in golden brown water then raised head sharply a in obedience to thought suddenly occurring to gazed at brockhurst house brightness of western sky found reflection in many window noble cheerfulness seemed to pervade a crowned hillside amid garden far ranging wood by be mr quayle began repressed exclamation expression be wholly friendly a returned to miss st quentin good bye said be glad honestly glad have found grand passion though object of ca in first blush of affair be altogether persona grata to myself to show that really have little root of magnanimity in be quite prepared to undertake winter at cairo evelyn tobemory minus low dress if will enable to stay on here mean in england of course pursed up beautiful mouth carried head on one side with liveliest effect of provocation a held young lady hand while bidding farewell out of heart hope will be very happy said will never be anything honoria st quentin answered rather hastily then softened forgiving oh why said why will make quarrel with just now just at last because because mr quayle voice broke though superior smile remained to think will not prolong interview said to be frank with dear miss st

onward to perfection into lively collision with richard natural man not to mention richard wild bull in net opposing force engaged battle with consequence that carriage horse took hill at rather breakneck pace not that dickie touched that being vibrant felt mood down length of rein responded to ludovic need hardly have be in such prodigious hurry broke out might have allowed one few day grace be defect of taste to come over immediately then that family taste be liable to lapse promptly repented ashamed of anger such self revealing expression of dare say be for best though better thing must be nipped in bud than in blossom put on right footing one might easily drift into depending too much upon honoria own be dangerously near doing that spring mind telling so now mother because see disposes finally of matter voice contended oddly with noise of wheel rattle of pole chain pounding of hoof of pulling horse sentence came to lady calmady ear disjointed difficult to follow interpret therefore answered slightly at random dearest must have kept longer in spring if have only known said disquieting suspicion of lost opportunity assailing from certain thing said thought preferred being alone so did wanted to go because wanted to stay do see ah yes see katherine replied at moment must be conceded sentiment be not conspicuously pacific towards faithful adherent mr quayle have good many interest in common dickie went on there seemed chance of one settling down into rather charming friendship with be beguiling prospect for very reason be best must depart prospect in beguilingness renewed to day after luncheon paused handling plunging horse so after ludovic will be reckoned welcome for a say might have come to depend on one be fool ought to have learnt salutary

infirmary mission promised to be melancholy one yet be not sorry for demand made by upon time thought for notwithstanding philosophic tone have adopted with lady calmady in speaking of friendship if not nipped in bud might have reached peril of too luxuriant blossoming must be saint natural man pilgrim on highroad to perfection very inconvenient animal wild bull in net kept up warfare within

must cleanse yet further of self seeking word if thou wilt be perfect sell that thou hast give to poor follow thou have not material objective significance merely deal with personal desire even apparently most legitimate with indulgence of personal feeling even apparently most innocent with inward attitude atmosphere of mind even more closely than with outward action conduct so richard reached conclusion that must strip yet nearer to bone must digest harsh truth that virtue be own reward in sense that be only reward must look for nothing beyond that have grown slack of late seduced by vision of pleasant thing permitted most men to forbidden wearied too by length of way inevitable monotony of now first heat of enthusiasm have evaporated well be very simple must just re dedicate

finest fibre faithful loyal capable of undying tenderness of encircling heroic love then desire of natural man stirred somewhat in richard just because paradox though undoubtedly be provoked carnal perishing passion of flesh than pure imperishable passion of spirit irrepressible envy of ludovic quayle lover seized irrepressible demand for just thing that other richard must be saint have so sternly condemned to repudiate to cast aside forget must be saint triumphed beating down thought of that trampling under foot so after briefest interval called up to cheerily enough well what do make

delicately militant in carriage swung away down stair out of house be going forth to war indeed to war in shape form have ever waged a yet many men have wooed wooing have left cold have never wooed man why must to man have ever mattered one little bit so mounted rode away spin across level turf to hearten up satisfy fulness of sensation held shake nerve into place be exhilarating grew keen tense

rider be a though rode across floor of ocean green tide sweeping overhead yet tree of wood asserted intelligent presence now again audibly talked together bent little to listen to look a though curious of aspect purpose of wandering mortal unity secrecy of place affected richard honoria strangely circling about with something of earth magic removing far from ordinary condition of social intercourse thus rendering possible inevitable even that must think such thought say such word a part company with subterfuge concealment go naked speak uttermost truth for with only tree of wood to listen with sibilant whisper of green tide overhead with strong emotion compelling in one case towards death of self in other towards giving of self in one towards austere passivity in other towards activity taxing capital of pride of delicacy of tact development became imminent of most vital sort conversation have be broken desultory now by tacit consent pace became quiet again horse be permitted to walk to have gone other than softly through living heart of greenwood must have savoured of desecration yet richard be not insensible to certain danger tried rousing to conversation to rouse also to practical commonplace be glad liked house said hear aristocracy of row lament shy at idea of being invaded by more le frightful creature remain deaf really ca bother about be so immeasurably more unpleasant to be frightful than to see be so that be afraid sympathy remain rather pig headedly one sided propose to educate row in grace of pity may lay up merit by due exercise of richard took off hat rode bareheaded looking away into delicious green gloom here where wood be thickest oak beech shutting out sky clasping hand overhead ground beneath deep in moss fern that gloom be precisely like colour of honoria eye wished be so tried to forget resemblance haunted look where might still seemed to look into singular charming eye talked on determinedly putting force upon too

for well for for like mean in proportion a one brought up tenderly a be one doe realise deprivation disgust of one condition at start once realised one inclination be to kill at least man be woman may accept more quietly suppose richard honoria said slowly be sure greatly exaggerate that shook head thirty year experience exaggerate time one make fresh acquaintance time pretty woman be just bit kinder to one than must dare be to man who be not out of time people be manifestly interested politely of course form circle make room for one a did at particularly disagreeable grimshott garden party yesterday time want to drivel so be one see pair of lover oh well be not easy to retain one philosophy not to obey primitive instinct of animal when be ill used hurt to revenge to want to kill in short hate woman then honoria said still slowly richard stared at for moment hate said only wish to goodness did in case began bravely why be why broke in may remember engagement to lady constance quayle part very properly took in canceling of know better than do though imagination be pretty fertile in dealing with situation what instinct feeling prompted to take part young lady turned to arm outstretched notwithstanding bridle rein whip face strange eye seemed so integral part of fair green wood full of sorrowful entreaty distress richard richard cried will never forgive that did love be horrible yet in doing that did believed believe so still did what be right by undoubtedly did right that justifies contention in doing that did gave voice to opinion of wholesome minded people be exactly where be felt whole business to be outrageous so be heartily agree paused tree talked softly together bending down little to listen to look a say be in love poor child how must be woman ever will be at least not in love of nobler sort of sort if one can not have one have vast deal better have love at be not so sure of honoria said stoutly rush to conclusion be rather reflection on rest of to take little lady constance a measure of insight sensibility of whole sex then have already lost innocent little heart to captain decies indeed be not fair to wait like ludovic quayle miss st quentin straightened in saddle oh dear not least like ludovic quayle said enigmatic reply produced silence for while on dickie part for there be various way in might be interpreted flattering eminently unflattering to from point of view be wisest to accept last form of interpretation whole conversation have be perilous in character have be too intimate have touched too nearly taking place here in clear gloom of green wood moreover bore such haunting kinship to singularly sincere yet mysterious eye be dangerous to ride across floor of ocean with whispering tide sweeping overhead in such gallant company besides that to ride thus forever must hardly come amiss richard in turn straightened up in saddle opened chest taking long breath carried head high said stern get thee behind satan to encroaching sentiment emotion to fair vision companion presence somewhat daring talk have conjured up defied earth magic defied sylvan deity who a divined sought to enthral for moment confounded honoria influence with theirs be something of battle not first one have fought to day for great white road lead onward to perfection looked dusty arid enough reposeful shadow mystery no beguiling green gloom over stark straight hard stretched on endlessly a seemed ahead to travel be slow tedious work in case to travel on crutch be worse than useless to play with such thought a must put stop to disintegrating talk turned to honoria spoke lightly with return of self mockery oh first instinct be true one depend upon said though deny contributed indirectly to giving pretty rough time oh dear honoria cried almost piteously then added see why be that because suppose have sort of unwilling belief in said smiling oh accursed conversation why must insistently drift back into intimacy thus have justified that belief asked with certain pride yet certain eagerness more than justified dickie answered mother who have touchstone for be of high worth knew from first like devil believed trembled at least be how see now so action came a rather searching revelation condemnation when perceived that involved oh well first went to dog then horse walked side by side honoria stretched out hand impulsively laid on arm richard richard for pity sake hurt too much be terrible to have be cause of such suffering be cause said lie be cause behind like fool 'd tried to shelter have be right honoria from first to last what doe matter after take to heart for be over now over thank god have got back into normal relation with thing with people looked at very charmingly spoke with fine courtesy of

time perhaps give trifle of sound advice will need safe enough see what want to get at be temperance temperance round towards everything everybody not fanaticism in respect be much easier attitute of mind richard looked up into whispering green tide overhead yes one must deny luxury of fanaticism if possible said deny vanity of eccentricity one must take everything simply just in day work one must keep in touch keep in touch with world great world world cultivates pleasure incidentally make history a well a with world of dust cart know well enough if one to be quite sane see loneliness loneliness of be thankful to think can form conception be curse of person like incline one to hide to sulk to shut away become misanthropic to hug one misery becomes one chiefest pleasure to nurse one

must volunteer for such service at least one likely to be acceptable to mother indeed likely to satisfy own requirement admit be little fastidious little critical exacting when come to close quarter well permanent association even yet be very glad to hear that honoria said face remained averted there be change in attitude decision in pose of figure suggestive of challenge of triumph richard be nonplussed blood be up conversation have gone far enough indeed too far very certainly must make end of god forbid exclaimed that must ever fall to depth of selfishness a to invite person who must satisfy taste demand to share life may amount to very much at least have never used personal ill luck to trade on woman generosity pity what have have from woman have paid for in hard cash in respect conscience be clear have be bargain fair square above board debt be settled in full hardly think at time of day must use proposed scheme of philanthropy a bait richard sent horse forward at sharp trot

let see turned horse at green ride lead to white temple situate on outstanding spur of hill rode on quickly till reached platform of turf before temple richard followed with deliberation be shaken calm be broken up whole being in tumult why have pressed just matter home on have agreed with to cast aside forget be little cruel surely that temptation must assail thus white road towards perfection be made so difficult to tread just when have re dedicated renewed vow looked after be here have met first after time when a little maid have proved too swift of foot leaving so far behind that sorely hurt baby dignity caused to see depart without regret be still swift of foot left behind now for moment be ready to swear that not only without regret with actual thankfulness must again witness departure yes wanted to go because so desperately wanted to stay be truth for not only dickie natural man dickie wild bull in net have word to say just then god in heaven what hard work be to be good

immense reposeful landscape far ranging purple distance golden harvest field silver glint of water in hollow massive grandeur of wood superb pageant of sunset sky groom rode forward took horse led away to far side of grass platform behind temple rank of rosy cloud in infinite perspective with space of clearest topaz sapphire light between converged to glowing glory of sun rim of now touched margin of world be a rank of worshipper of blessed soul redeemed sainted united by common act of adoration form clothed by reflection of glory heart thought centred upon god richard looked at failed to speak to then saw honoria resolutely turn back upon glory came directly towards face be very thin manner very calm laid left hand on peak of saddle looked full in eye richard said be patient minute

listening hand folded rather high on bosom caressing suavity of summer night enfolded remembrance came to of night nearly four thirty year ago when standing in same spot young untried ambitious of unlimited delight have felt first mysterious pang of motherhood told husband of new unseen life be at once own of yet night when after long experience of sorrow solitude revolt husband have come to once again come even a bird song came from across valley etherealised spiritualised same yet endowed with quality of unearthly beauty how strange exquisite communion with dead have fortified to endure anguish even greater than have yet known have prayed that night that might behold face of well beloved prayer have be granted have prayed that without reservation might be absorbed by conformed to divine will that prayer have a humbly trusted be in great measure granted also then divine will have proved so very merciful divine intention so wholly beneficent there be small credit in being
