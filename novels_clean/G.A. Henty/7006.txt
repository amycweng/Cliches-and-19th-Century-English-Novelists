for few week at brother house restraint of life at bailie be too much for andrew be well ordered household bailie be methodical regular leading figure in kirk far stricter than be most men of time a to undue consumption of liquor strong in exhortation in season out of season wife be kindly precise a outspoken a andrew for first day two real affection andrew have for younger brother pleasure felt at return shielded malcolm from comment rebuke after very first day bailie wife have declared to herself that be impossible that malcolm must long remain inmate of house be not inhospitable must have made great sacrifice in direction for long missing brother of husband conduct outraged best feeling of good scotch housewife even on first day did not come punctually to meal be away about town looking up old acquaintance came in at dinner again at supper after meal have already begun dropped into place began to eat without saying word of grace stamped about house a if have cavalry spur still on heel talked in voice must be heard from attic to basement used french flemish oath horrified good lady although did not understand smoked at hour of day whereas andrew always confined to after supper pipe in spite of assertion on previous evening consumed amount of liquor horrified good woman at meal talked loudly kept two apprentice in titter with story of campaigning spoke slightingly of city authority joked bailie with freedom roughness scandalized andrew be slow to notice incongruity of brother demeanour bearing with atmosphere of house although soon became dimly conscious that there be jarring element in air at end of week malcolm broached subject to andrew said be good fellow though be bailie elder of kirk thank for hearty welcome have given for invitation to stay for long time with will not do janet be good woman kindly can see keep perpetually on thorn in good truth fifteen year of campaigning be indifferent preparation for man a inmate of respectable household did not quite know how thoroughly have become devil may care trooper until came back to old life here way of house must soon be a intolerable to a way be to good wife therefore be better by far that before word have passed between while be a good friend a on evening when returned must get out of met old friend today one of lad who went with from glasgow to join earl of mar at perth be well to do now trade in cattle taking in drove down into england for sake of old time have offered employment methinks will suit a well a other can not surely be going a drover malcolm why not life be a good a other must not sit down after year of roving to indoor life must either do cross water again take service abroad be only six thirty yet be good for fifteen year of soldiering right gladly must go back if leslie be again at head of regiment have be spoiled by ever treated a companion a friend rather than a trooper in regiment must miss sorely did enter other service then too must fain be here to be ready to join again if sends for come must wish to keep eye always on boy will continue to take charge of wo andrew be still little strange take to elspeth will give little trouble when once learns language like at malcolm bailie said andrew must feel be best doubt not that ere wife have told trouble concerning a bailie on preceding night have listened to long string of complaint remonstrance on part of wife a to brother general conduct must not deny truth of malcolm supposition just so andrew malcolm went on knew that must be so mistress janet have kept lip closed firm to must see how difficult be for sometimes to do so must not be otherwise be a much out of place here a wolf in sheepfold a to droving will not mention to meet that be brother to one of bailies of glasgow will like life rough pony will ride will differ in pace from old charger at least will be life in saddle will be earning honest living if take more than be good for may get broken head none be wiser whereas if remain here fall foul of city watch must be grief pain for bailie be silenced have already begun to perceive malcolm way manner be incompatible with peace quiet of respectable household janet complaint be not altogether unreasonable have seen many of acquaintance lift eyebrow in disapprobation at roystering talk of brother have foreseen that be probable trouble must come at same rime felt repugnance to thought after so many year of absence brother must so soon quit house seemed reflection alike on affection hospitality will take charge of child wo malcolm pleaded there be purse of hundred louis will must say pay for expense to may put for year a if must take bairn money andrew exclaimed angrily what do take for malcolm assuredly will take child janet have bairn of own be good for house to have child in look upon a if be yours for be like enough will never hear of father again will have hearty welcome be bright little fellow in time doubt not janet will take greatly to charge of child be serious matter can not hope that will not have trouble with there be trouble in thing at rate malcolm will do best if at end of year find that janet have not taken to will see about other arrangement malcolm do trust that will stay with for week two must seem to a if have turned out of house be to leave so soon so malcolm made three week stay at brother then started upon new occupation of driving highland cattle down into lancashire once two three month came to glasgow for week two between trip in spite of andrew entreaty refused on occasion to take up abode with took lodging not far off coming in evening for hour to smoke pipe with brother never failing of morning to come in take child for long walk with carrying upon shoulder keeping up steady talk with in native french be anxious that boy must forget a at time other might again return to france week after malcolm return to scotland wrote to colonel leslie briefly giving address at glasgow making allusion to child a if colonel be still in prison letter must be sure to be opened by authority also wrote to major giving address begging to communicate to colonel leslie whenever must see that done there be nothing for to wait quietly post be so uncertain in day that have slight hope that of letter must ever reach destination answer came to of letter four year later malcolm went over to paris cautiously made inquiry one have heard anything of colonel leslie from day have be arrested regiment be away fighting in low country only thing malcolm must do be to call upon people who have have charge of child to give address in case colonel must ever appear to inquire of found however house tenanted by other people learned that last occupant have left year before neighbor remembered that one morning early officer of law have come to house man have be seized carried away have be released month later only to find that wife have died of grief anxiety have then sold off good gone one knew whither malcolm therefore returned to glasgow with feeling that have gained nothing by journey chapter ii jacobite agent so twelve year passed ronald leslie grew up sturdy lad full of fun mischief in spite of sober atmosphere of bailie house flogging at school lecturing at home appeared to have slightest effect in reducing to state of sober tranquillity be in mr anderson eye thing to be most desired in boy andrew be le deeply shocked than wife at discovery of ronald various delinquency sense of order punctuality be constantly outraged be however really fond of lad even mr anderson greatly a boy way constantly disturbed ruffled be at heart a fond of a be husband considered not altogether wrongly that wilderness a called be in slight degree due to association with husband brother ronald looked forward to periodical visit of drover with intense longing be sure of sympathetic listener in malcolm who listened with approval to tale of various scrape into have got since last visit of how instead of going to school have played truant with boy own age have embarked in fisherman boat gone down river have not be able to get back until next day how have played trick upon dominie have conquered in single combat son of councillor duff butcher who have spoken scoffing word at stuart malcolm be in fact delighted to find that in spite of repression lecture young charge be growing up lad of spirit still hoped that day leslie might return knew how horrified must be be to find that son be becoming smug well conducted citizen small portion of time on of visit to glasgow malcolm spent in training boy in use of arm father be gentleman must say to be fitting that must know how to handle gentleman arm club be well enough for citizen apprentice must have handle rapier broadsword a well a of young laird when get old enough ronald will cross sea together will try get to bottom of mystery of father fate if find that worst have come to worst will seek mother will most likely have married again will be sure to have forced into even if dare not acknowledge a son influence may obtain for commission in one of king regiment even if think be too old for trooper will go a follower there be plenty of occasion at court of france when sharp sword stout arm even if be somewhat stiffened by age can do good service lesson began a soon a ronald be old enough to hold light blade a between pause of exercise malcolm be always ready to tell story of adventure in war of france day be full of delight to ronald when latter reached age of fourteen malcolm be not satisfied with amount of proficiency lad be able to gain during occasional visit therefore took for further instruction to comrade who have like served in france have returned settled down in glasgow where opened fencing school having be maitre d'armes among scotch regiment arrangement be however kept profound secret from andrew wife on half holiday on other day when must manage to slip away for hour ronald went to instructor worked hard steadily with rapier have mr anderson have idea of manner in spent time must have be horrified must certainly have spared encomium on improved conduct absence of unsatisfactory report have before be so common cloud of uncertainty hung over father fate must not have influence upon boy character happy carelessness gaiety be natural characteristic be modified by thought that father might be languishing in dungeon sometimes must refuse to accompany school fellow on ramble fishing expedition must sit for hour thinking over sort of wild plan by might penetrate to aid to escape be never tired of questioning malcolm anderson a to prison in if still alive father must be likely to be confined must ask a to appearance height of wall whether be moated not whether other house abutted closely upon one day malcolm asked reason of question replied of course want to see how will be possible to get father out although malcolm tried to impress upon that must be almost impossible task even to discover in prison father be kept must not allow to be discouraged there must be way of finding out malcolm tell that prisoner be not even known by name to warder only under number still someone must know there must be list kept of in prison will trust to mother to find out for great lady a be must be able to get at people if set about a certainly must have loved father very very much never must have married secretly got into such trouble for be sure will do best when find that have come over to get out when know that think ought to be able to manage must get employment a warder must go disguised a woman a priest somehow feel sure will succeed if do find out that be alive where be malcolm knew too much about strong well guarded prison of france to share in boy sanguine hope did not try to discourage thought that with object in life before boy must devote more eagerly to exercise must strengthen arm increase skill with weapon render brave gallant officer in be right a time went on ronald became more more serious took part in school boy game frolic in have be once leader worked hard at school task sooner to be done with above devoted to acquiring mastery of sword with perseverance enthusiasm quite surprised instructor tell malcolm man said one day to old comrade after ronald have be for upwards of two year pupil if have known when first asked to teach lad to handle sword how much of time be going to occupy must have laughed in face for ten time sum agreed to pay must not have be enough having begun for sake have gone on for lad have be pleasure to teach so eager be to learn so ready to work heart soul to improve boy wrist be a strong a mine eye a quick have long since taught know be practice now not teaching that have day tell have work to hold own with know trick turn a well a do be quicker with lunge riposte be not that have extra length of arm in favour must not hold own a know have many of officer of garrison among pupil of have learned in good school there be not one of must defend for minute against boy if be not that matter have to be kept secret must set in front of of must see what short work must make of have heard rumour malcolm that young chevalier be likely to follow example of father thirty year back to make landing in scotland have heard such rumour malcolm replied though whether there be aught in know not hope that if doe so will at rate follow example of father no further a know hold to stuart must own be poor hand at fighting charles first ruined cause james second threw away crown of ireland by galloping away from battle of boyne chevalier showed here in ' that be leader of men unless lad be made of very different stuff to forefather have best stay in france if must come malcolm suppose will join be afraid will be fool enough to do so even with fifty year on head suppose will be fool too malcolm said stuart be scotch see with fault must rather thousand time have scottish king than german who govern from london if english like let keep let have king of own however nought may come of may be rumour be card louis have threatened to play score of time whenever wish to annoy england be more than likely that will come to nought a have so often done before tell that there be agent travelling about among highland clan that time something be really to be done have said so over over again nothing have come of for part care way go after muddle be made of thirty year ago doe not seem to more likely that will get rid of hanoverian now besides hanging slaughterings then must must think make noble head of clan think twice ere risked everything again be true when men blood be up count cost besides highland clan be always ready to fight if prince charles come will see there will not be much hanging back whatever consequence may be well have not much to lose except life be true enough old friend must rather die way than other still to tell truth must rather keep head on shoulder for few year if can well nothing may come of if doe will strike blow again for old cause at home ronald heard nothing expression of loyalty to crown mere fact that highlander espoused cause of stuart be sufficient in to make lowlander take opposite side religious feeling have always counted for so much in lowland have caused scotland to side with parliament against king charles have not lost force leaning of stuart be be known still strongly in favour of catholic religion although prince charles edward be reported to be more protestant in feeling than rest of race be not sufficient to counterbalance effect of hereditary catholic tendency otherwise there be feeling of active loyalty towards reigning king in scotland first second george have none of attribute attract loyal affection first must with difficulty speak language of people over whom ruled feeling sympathy be hanoverian rather than english court favour be bestowed a fast a possible upon countryman have bearing manner men associate with royalty grace power of attraction distinguished stuart commonplace homely in manner in figure in bearing be not men whom fellow must look up to respect very vice be coarse hanoverian men woman gathered round be hated by english people thus neither in england scotland be there warm feeling of loyalty for reigning house though be possible that few must adventure life property in cause of stuart be equally certain that outside army there be still fewer who must draw sword for hanoverian king among people of lowland city of scotland loyalty existed be religious rather than civil rested upon fact that forefather have fought against stuart while highlander have always supported cause thus although in household in kirk ronald have heard king george prayed for regularly have heard word concerning calculated to waken boyish feeling of loyalty still le of enthusiasm upon other hand knew that father have fought suffered for stuart be exile in cause that hanoverian have handed over estate of must now be heir to one of adherent be use talking of matter to andrew malcolm impressed upon must do good when be young man took side of hanoverian wo change now while did mistress janet guess that heart be with stuart must say be ruining must bring to gallows be not fond of now though doe best to be civil to husband brother did know that have become jacobite like enough must move andrew to put stop to being with there must be sort of trouble must prevent being with ronald said indignantly father gave into charge not into theirs be true enough laddie be who have cared for brought up when be man can doubt go way plea till then owe duty respect to not to who have done nought for just carry over here in cloak know have done everything for ronald said penitently have be very good kind love for that be only natural that father must be first that heart must be in cause that fought for be right enough ronald must not have otherwise have striven to do best to make a must like to see did never come back again must be sorry indeed to see colonel leslie son growing up glasgow tradesman a brother doubt intends to be for know have long since given up thought of hearing from father in will have say when time come until then must treat andrew a natural guardian there be need to anger by letting know that heart be with king over water more than that can wield sword like gentleman let have peace a long a can be getting on for sixteen now two year will think about going to paris together be off again tomorrow ronald will not be long trip time maybe before get back will have news from france will set land on fire short time after conversation a ronald on return from college for be now entered at university passed through shop bailie be in conversation with one of city magistrate ronald caught word be somewhere in city came down from highland where have be going to fro two day since have warrant out against constable be on lookout hope to have in jail before tonight pestilent rogue be curse to land though can not think clan must be fool enough to rise again even though charles stuart did come ronald went straight up to room for few minute sat in thought man of whom spoke be doubtless emissary of prince charles arrest might have serious consequence perhaps bring ruin on with whom have be in communication who be what be like ronald knew not determined at rate to endeavour to defeat intention of magistrate to lay hand on accordingly few minute later while magistrate be still talking with andrew again went out ronald waited about outside door till left then followed at short distance magistrate spoke to several acquaintance on way then went to council chamber waiting outside ronald saw two three of magistrate enter hour later magistrate be watching came out have gone few pace when man hurrying up approached talked earnestly for minute two magistrate then re entered building remained there few minute then joined man who be waiting outside ronald have stolen up taken stand close by be arranged magistrate said a soon a night have fallen party will go down surround house arrest be better not to do in daylight will lead party will come round to house so if men have left on watch bring news that have changed hiding place let know at once magistrate walked on ronald stood irresolute have obtained no clue a to residence of person of whom be in search after moment thought determined to keep eye upon constable who must most likely join comrade on watch however did not do immediately have probably be for time at work now took opportunity of going home for meal for at once made way to quiet part of city entered small house be hour before came out again ronald fidgeted with impatience for be already growing dusk when issued out ronald saw that be armed with heavy cudgel walked quickly now ronald following at distance passed nearly across town down quiet street terminated against old wall running from castle port to small tower when got near bottom of street man came out from archway two spoke together from gesture ronald felt sure that be last house on left hand side of street be being watched have not ventured to follow far down street for a there be thoroughfare must at once be regarded with suspicion question now be how to warn man of danger knew several men be on watch a only one be in street doubtless others be behind house if anything be to be done there be time to be lost for darkness be fast closing in after minute thought went quickly up street then started at run then came down upon place where must ascend wall be at many point in bad repair with difficulty climbed up found that be exactly opposite house wished to reach be dark now even in principal street town be only lit by oil lamp here there there be attempt at illumination in quiet quarter person who went abroad after nightfall always carrying lantern with there be still sufficient light to show ronald that house stood at distance of fourteen foot from wall roof sloped too steeply for to maintain holding upon halfway along house be dormer window about three foot above gutter be unglazed doubtless gave

young sir how came ye to be in house at if ye be there for good motive decline to say ronald answered seems to that one may be in house by consent of owner without having to give reason therefor will be worse for if defy court ask again how came there have objection to tell how came there ronald said be walking on old wall a know run close by house when saw ill looking loon hiding a if watching house looking behind saw ruffianly looking man there two gasp of indignation be heard from porch at back of court thinking that there be mischief on hand leapt from wall to dormer window to warn people of house that there be ill doer who have design upon place then remained to see what came of be simple fact there be exclamation of incredulity from magistrate if doubt ronald said can send man

be never told in court what say bailie can say nought andrew said boy be good boy quiet one given to mischief like other boy of age doubtless always amenable what can have possessed to behave in such

macklewain who have fought in french war knew father be good enough to teach may say that guardian knew nothing of indeed andrew said never so much a dreamt of if have done so must have talked together to purpose leslie of glenlyon be concerned in ' be not mr m'whirtle said have to fly country son seems to be treading in step bailie doubt ye have be nourishing viper in bosom at moment two constable returned reported that certainly tile be loose a prisoner have described there be scratch a if of foot of someone entering window leap be one very few men must undertake story be so far confirmed prisoner doe not seem to that even have seen two men watching house must be reasonable that must risk neck in way without cause clearly have aided abetted traitor to escape justice will be remanded hope before be brought before again will make up mind to make clean breast of throw on king mercy ronald be accordingly led back to cell bailie being too much overwhelmed with surprise at what have heard to utter remonstrance chapter iii free after ronald have be removed from court woman be questioned asserted that master be away be believed in france that in absence often let lodging to stranger two day before man whom knew not came hired room for few day on evening before hearing noise in attic went up with met ronald coming down stair that when ronald said there be strange men outside house when immediately afterwards there be great knocking at door man drew sword ordered to come up stair with that then made assist to pull up plank thrust from attic to wall ordered to replace when have gone supposed be thief flying from justice be afraid to refuse to do bidding why did not tell woman when came in mr m'whirtle asked sternly have told might have overtaken be too much frightened woman answered there be sword out blood running men using word contrary to law scripture be frighted enough before just put apron over head sat down till hubbub be over then a one asked question feared might have done wrong in aiding thief to escape just held tongue cross questioning must elicit anything further from woman who indeed seemed frightened almost out of sens magistrate at last ordered to return to house remain there under supervision of constable until again sent for andrew anderson returned home sorely disturbed in mind hitherto have told none even of intimate that boy living in house be son of colonel leslie have spoken of a child of old acquaintance who have left to care open announcement of ronald that be son of one of leader in last rebellion coming just a did when air be thick with rumour of rising troubled greatly there be fact that boy have unknown to be learning fencing lastly interference have enabled notorious emissary of pretender to escape arrest boy story may be true a far a go said to wife when relating to circumstance for have never known to tell lie can not think be truth boy doe not take such dreadful leap a risk breaking neck simply because see two men near house must somehow have known man be there went to give warning now think of passed through shop when peter m'whirtle be talking to about though indeed did not know then where loon be in hiding boy went out soon afterwards must somehow have learned if indeed did not know before janet fear that have be like two blind owl with regard to boy dread sorely that brother malcolm be at bottom of mischief mr anderson be ready enough to credit be too much bewildered horrified to do more than to shake head weep will cut off head andrew asked at last there be fear of may imprison for bit perhaps give good flogging young rascal there fret over janet will do can for in truth think malcolm be more to blame than be have be to blame too for letting lad be so much with seeing that might be sure must put sort of notion in boy head what be to be done andrew can not let poor lad remain in prison have choice in matter janet in prison be in prison have to remain until be let out see chance of if have only be brawl with watch must have be got over easily enough be affair of high treason aiding abetting king enemy rest of if be in old time must put thumb screw on to find out knew about for will never believe risked life in plot fact that father before be in arm for chevalier tell that way must not be surprised if order come for to be sent to london to be examined by king councillor will go round now ask justice what think of matter tidings when returned be not encouraging general opinion of magistrate being that ronald be certainly mixed up in jacobite plot that matter be altogether too serious to be disposed of by being of nature of high treason that nothing must be done until instruction be received from london clue have be obtained a to whereabouts of man who have escaped be thought probable that have at once dropped beyond wall made for west malcolm arrived ten day later from journey in lancashire there be serious quarrel between andrew on presenting at house be not only that led lad into mischief malcolm that taught to do behind back may look at in way if will andrew be natural enough from point of view take blame to myself treated boy a if have be son thank with heart for kindness to must not forget leslie of glenlyon blame have kept same alive in mind also be duty to see that young eagle be not turned into barn door fowl never thought be going to use beak claw so soon nice thing will have to tell father that owing to teaching son be prisoner in tower maybe for life there there be fear of will never have to render account for there be more chance of ever hearing more of than there be of becoming king of scotland be bad enough that have always be ne'er do well without training unfortunate boy to ruin well well andrew will not argue with blame at being sore angry over matter do deny what have said about be true enough might say worse thing against without quarreling with ye over however le said better will take off think over what be to be done have better come up have supper with andrew said mollified by brother humility not for twenty golden guinea andrew must face mistress janet have borne with well though know in heart disapproves of altogether after scrape into have got boy dare face might not say much to eat with eye upon must choke malcolm proceeded at once to establishment of friend macklewain be nice kettle of fish malcolm about young leslie have have justice down here asking sort of question have got into mind taught not only swordplay treason have be threatening to put in stock a vagabond snapped finger in face saying earned money a honestly a did that concern in way in politics teach english officer son of glasgow tradesman a well a of highland gentleman be nicely put out can tell did care for for knew be in right of what on earth made young cock meddle in matter how came to be mixed up in jacobite plot have got finger in not james how happens that be concerned in be more than can guess know of course heart be with king over water how came to get hand into pie be altogether beyond people here be well nigh mad about know not who gallant who have escaped be be certain that capture be considered very important one that justice here expected to have gained small credit by arrest whereas now will be regarded a fool for letting slip through finger can not for life of make out how came to be mixed up in such matter one must have known that be lad of mettle who might be trusted in such business can hardly be that must have confided secret to still fact that be in house with man be in search of that drew risked life certain imprisonment to secure escape show that must have be heart soul in plot what do think of doing malcolm will get out somehow can lay hand on score two more of old comrade here in glasgow doubt not that will strike blow with for leslie son to say nothing of being follower of stuart be not thinking man of attacking jail must be serious matter door be strong must have soldier to say nought of town guard citizen upon before have reached james be thinking of such foolishness guess that will not be trying for withstanding watch be small matter will be sending south for king minister to get out of what know about jacobite plot name of concerned be upon road that must get out of hand like enough will only send four trooper with can easily master somewhere in dale be more like malcolm will send by ship will know well enough that if lad know aught there will be plenty whose interest be to get out of hand think will take safer way of putting on board ship like enough will malcolm agreed in case will be harder job than deemed at rate mean to try ronald not lad to turn traitor will say nothing do to may be sure may lie for year in english prison if get out of hand before get there at rate what have got to do now be to mark ship in port sailing for london to find out whether passage be taken for prisoner guard in of will make business between time get score of trusty fellow together in readiness to start if must send by land doubt not that be right that will be taken off by ship day of waiting passed slowly to ronald andrew anderson once twice obtained permission to see bailie wisely abstained from reproach sought only to persuade to make clean breast of business to tell knew about plot must end in failure ruin to concerned although belief in ronald truthfulness be great must not credit that story have told contained fact of matter to bailie seemed incredible that merely from abstract feeling in favour of stuart ronald must have risked life liberty in aiding escape of jacobite agent unless be in way deeply involved in plot regarded ronald assurance to contrary a outcome of what considered entirely mistaken sense of loyalty to stuart cause be very well ronald said shaking head sadly when get to london will find mean to make open mouth have done away with thumb screw rack there be other way of making prisoner speak must be far better for to make clean breast of at once janet be grieving for a if be own son can not myself attend to business who must have thought that so young lad must have got mixed up in such sair trouble have really told bailie though will not believe be sorry indeed for trouble have brought upon aunt for ronald have from first be taught to address bailie wife a if malcolm anderson have be real father anyhow wish must settle must rather know worst than go on from day to day expecting something never happens have to wait ronald till word come from london if write from there that case can be dealt with merely for assault upon watch can promise that few week in jail be that be like to have fear that there be little chance of that be sure to send for to london whether will ever come back alive gude lord only know know what came of treason thirty year ago like enough will be even more severe now seeing that will hold that folk have le right to try disturb matter so long settled have seen malcolm ronald asked to change conversation ay lad have seen meeting be not altogether pleasant one for of hope have not quarrelled with on account ronald said eagerly have not exactly quarrelled have have word must not tell opinion a to learning to take such course parted friend doubt will be long before janet can see with patience jailer who be present at interview here notified that bailie time be up will see again ronald before take south must that must do more to help besides just coming to see know can not uncle have got into scrape must take consequence if be placed in same position must do again few day afterwards a be eating ration of prison bread ronald found in small pellet of paper on opening read word keep up courage friend be at work for will hear more yet of m ronald be glad to know that old friend be thinking of knowing how strong be prison have little hope that malcolm must be able to effect anything to help still note gave comfort three day later andrew called again to bid goodbye telling that order have be received from london that be to be sent thither by ship must like to have seen malcolm before went if must ronald said have not seen for several day bailie said have sent down several time to house where lodge be always away whether there must be chance of seeing have difficulty in getting leave to see though bailie known to be loyal citizen malcolm know that there must be chance of one with character a getting to see that must draw attention to even to ask thing if have hand in mad brain plot must not wish malcolm must not mind straw whether kept watch on not ronald said will tell when see next that got message what message have given message know of will know what mean tell whether aught come of not thank for kindness to a do aunt janet at same time with order ronald must be sent to london authority of glasgow received intimation that minister felt great surprise at lukewarmness have be shown in allowing so notorious important enemy of majesty to escape that king have expressed marked displeasure at conduct of city authority in matter greatly mortified at upshot of affair from have hoped to obtain much credit from government believing certain that there be many greatly interested in getting ronald out of hand of captor authority took precaution to prevent be taken down to river side under strong escort in addition to four warder who be to be in charge of prisoner a far a london put on board twelve men of city guard be to remain with ship until be well out at sea then to return in boat vessel be to tow behind ronald must not smile when saw formidable preparation for safety at same time felt that hope have entertained that malcolm might a message hinted make attempt at rescue be blighted vessel dropped down with tide order of justice have be so strict urgent that whole of men placed on board kept vigilant watch just a be abreast of dumbarton sound of oar be heard presently boat be seen approaching a got nearer two men be seen to be rowing two others seated in stern a craft be large one there be room for others to be lying in bottom constable in charge shouted to boat to keep off stop rowing cried come nearer if do fire a want to shed blood warn have sixteen armed men here a word be emphasized by row of men who with levelled musket ranged along at side of ship boat ceased rowing what be afraid of one of men in stern shouted can not fisherman boat row out without being threatened with shooting what be sixteen armed men doing on board be expecting french fleet off coast do think will beat off if board how long have glasgow trader taken to man ship with fighting men ronald be in cabin under poop opened on to waist received light from opening in door at two armed men have stationed when boat be heard approaching have cabin possessed porthole through must have squeezed must long before have jumped overboard tried to make escape by swimming under cover of darkness now strove to force door open for recognized malcolm voice doubted not that friend have spoken in order to let know that be there that might if possible leap over swim to boat be fastened strongly without guard outside shouted that must fire unless remained quiet reply be made to taunt of man in boat slowly for wind be just filling sail vessel dropped down river boat be presently lost sight of in morning breeze freshened be not till ship be eight mile beyond mouth of river that boat be pulled up alongside guard taking place on board hoisted sail started on return to glasgow once fairly at sea ronald be allowed to leave cabin now that be enjoying fresh air spirit soon recovered tone have lost somewhat during three week confinement in prison thoroughly enjoyed voyage man who be in charge of guard have at first wished to place restriction on going about on board a chose crew sided with young prisoner threw such ridicule on idea that four warder head constable be afraid even for moment to lose sight of boy on board ship at sea that gave way allowed ronald free liberty of action although warned subordinate that must relax caution for moment crew be with think shame that lad like must be hauled to london a prisoner charged with treasonable practice sailor when once get idea into head be a obstinate a highland cattle have told that drew sword held staircase against while noted traitor made escape that ran one of through shoulder only shouted with laughter said be brave young cock like a not if have chance men must aid to escape then must have to answer for heavily too loss of place imprisonment must be least of what might expect so though while at sea in full daylight can do a plea must be doubly vigilant at night in port if vessel must have to put in accordingly to great disgust of sailor watch by turn stood sentry outside ronald door at night thereby defeating plan sailor have formed of lowering boat first night passed near land letting ronald make escape to shore wind be favourable until vessel rounded land end after that became baffling fickle be more than three week after date of sailing from glasgow that vessel entered mouth of thames by time ronald boyish spirit have allayed suspicion on part of guard joked with sailor climbed about rigging like cat be so little affected by position that guard be convinced that be free from burden of state secret that apprehension of serious consequence to be weighing upon poor lad head warder said will need spirit will have hard work to make king council believe that interfered in such matter a from pure love of adventure will have many weary month to pas in prison before free reckon go against heart to hand over mere laddie a prisoner still be matter of mine have duty to do be not for to question order have received to argue whether prisoner be innocent guilty a vessel anchored off gravesend to wait for turn of tide to take up boat rowed by waterman with man sitting in stern passed close by ship head warder have now redoubled vigilance one of guard with loaded musket be standing on deck not far from ronald who be standing on taffrail a boat passed twenty yard astern of ship man who be not rowing turned round for moment looked up at ronald be momentary glance that lad caught of face suppressed with difficulty cry of surprise for recognized malcolm anderson rower continued steadily to ply oar continued course towards ship anchored lower down river ronald stood watching boat saw that after making wide sweep be rowed back again to gravesend ronald have doubt that malcolm have come south in hope of effecting escape guessed that have taken up post at gravesend with intention of examining ship a passed up until one in knew have sailed made appearance what next step must be must not tell determined to keep vigilant lookout to avail instantly of opportunity might offer a captain did care about proceeding up river after dark be not until tide turned just a morning broke that anchor be weighed there be light breeze just sufficed to give vessel steerage way mist hung on water ronald took favourite seat on taffrail kept vigilant watch upon craft seemed likely to come near vessel greenwich be passed vessel presently approached crowded part of pool be near high tide now captain be congratulating that must just reach berth opposite tower before turned presently boat with two rower shot out from behind tier of vessel passed close under stern of glasgow lass man be steering whom ronald instantly recognized jump cried ronald without moment hesitation leaped from taffrail came up close to boat be instantly hauled on board by malcolm just at moment guard who have stood stupefied by ronald sudden action gave shout of alarm discharged piece ball struck boat close to ronald be already in motion men bent to oar boat glided towards surrey side of river loud shout arose from on board vessel four bullet cut water round boat before musket must be reloaded malcolm have steered boat through tier of vessel whose crew attracted by firing cheered fugitive lustily minute later have reached landing step malcolm tossed money to rower then sprang ashore with ronald handed latter long coat must reach to heel conceal drenched state of clothing from notice have tricked nicely dear boy said be safe now long before can lower boat get here will be safe in shelter five glasgow body will have something to do to look for here moderating pace so a to avoid attracting attention malcolm proceeded along several street lane presently stopped at door of little shop be lodging here said have told people of house that be expecting nephew back from cruise in mediterranean a passed through shop said to woman behind counter here be safe sound be be day longer than expected be so very far wrong in calculation young scamp have have enough of sea have agreed to go back again with to own people be right woman said own boy ran away two year ago hope will have come to sens by time get back again when be together in room up stair malcolm threw arm round ronald neck thank god dear boy have got out of clutch of law know how have be fretting since heard be caught thought that if ill came to must be fault now tell how got into scrape for have be puzzling ever since heard surely when saw last knew nothing about jacobite going on ronald related whole particular of adventure said that even now be absolutely ignorant who be man whom have aided to escape know more than do ronald must have thought capture important one by fuss made over escape now to think that have slipped out of hand too malcolm broke into loud laugh must give month earnings to see face of guard a make report that have arrived empty handed be right glad when saw be afraid might have given slip on way then there must have be saying when might have found other again sailor must have lowered boat at night let make for land ronald said there be good guard kept over door be locked sentry always on watch have quite given up hope until saw at gravesend now what do intend to do make way back to scotland lad must never do there will be hue cry after northern route will be watched will make bargain with dutch skipper to take across water then will make way to paris have got money malcolm have got purse lad went to andrew said that wanted for that be to ask question so that came of must say that knew nothing gave at once saying only bemember malcolm have done boy harm already with teaching see that do further harm guess be bent on hare brained plan whatever be wish success ' chapter iv in france next day malcolm went out alone on return told ronald that there be placard on wall offering reward of hundred pound for apprehension think people below have suspicion malcolm not malcolm replied be telling last night after have gone to bed about place have be voyaging to how anxious father snug farmer near newcastle be to have back again have spoken to before so a to prepare for coming old woman take quite interest in because son at sea be lad just about age have brought in suit of sailor clothes will go down have chat with after shop be closed of night will remember newcastle farm can tell of escape from greek pirate how nearly be taken by french frigate near strait consternation of watch at ronald escape be extreme shot man on guard have fired be first intimation of event seizing musket have hastily discharged in direction of fugitive have then shouted for boat to be lowered never be boat longer getting into water than be that of glasgow lass upon occasion captain gave order in leisurely way crew be even slower in executing then somehow fall stuck boat must lower when at last be in water be found that thole pin be missing being found be rowed across river five constable undergoing running fire of joke hilarity from sailor of ship passed near in answer to inquiry where fugitive landed of sailor shouted that have pulled up river behind tier of vessel others insisted that have sunk with hand close by completely bewildered chief of party told sailor to put ashore at first landing when party gained street inquired eagerly of met whether have seen aught of fugitive few of questioned understood broad scotch in question be asked others laughed in face asked how be to know man boy wanted from others after vainly looking about for time returned to stair only to find that boat have returned to ship waterman boat be now hired rower who have heard what have happened demanded sum for putting on board horrified at last after much bargaining be conveyed back to ship hour later chief of party went ashore repairing to tower where have be ordered to conduct prisoner reported escape be at once taken into custody on charge of permitting escape of prisoner be not until three day later upon evidence of men of captain officer of ship that be released four men be put on board ship returning to glasgow next day while be kept to identify fugitive must be caught week later malcolm told ronald that have made arrangement with captain of dutch vessel to take over to holland be to go on board at gravesend said for be searching ship bound for foreign port be not for especially there be supposed to be many jacobite going to fro will lay hand on anyone who can not give satisfactory account of so be just a well for to avoid questioning accordingly next day walked down to gravesend taking boat there boarded dutch vessel when came along on following day dutch captain received civilly have be told by malcolm that wished to leave country privately guessed that be in way fugitive from law a be to be well paid gave concern there be other passenger roomy cabin be placed at disposal passed down river without impediment anchored that night off sheerness dutch trader be slow craft malcolm said a walked impatiently up down deck next morning watching slow progress made past shore wish must have got passage direct to france of course be impossible now two nation be at war what be war about malcolm heard at home that be fighting yet somehow two country be not at war know how come about malcolm said england have minister still at paris for king george be at head of number of british troop in germany fighting against french there what be about malcolm well be matter concern hanover more than england in fact england have interest in matter at a far a can see except that a france take one side take other because be afraid of france getting too strong however be german business england be mixed up in only because present king be hanoverian not englishman be matter a far a can make out charles vi emperor of germany died in october have be arranged by sort of general agreement called pragmatic sanction what extraordinary name malcolm what doe mean have not least idea in world lad however be what be called be signed by lot of power of whom england be one by party agreed that charles daughter maria theresa be to become empress of austria however when emperor be dead elector of bavaria claimed to be emperor be supported by france by spain by frederick of prussia marched to vienna enthroned elector a duke of austria drove maria theresa to take refuge in hungary where be warmly supported english parliament voted large sum to enable empress to carry on war last year sixteen thousand men under earl of stair crossed sea to cooperate with dutch who be warm supporter of empress be joined by six thousand hessian sixteen thousand hanoverian in british pay after nothing be done last year for a in last war dutch be not ready to begin english army be in consequence kept idle then seems that everyone be against empress except england three little state be pretty nearly so malcolm said at present empress have bought off prussian whose king joined in affair solely for own advantage by giving province of silesia so in fact at present be england hanover be same thing with dutch hessian against france bavaria for think that at present spain have sent troop well seems to downright shame ronald said indignantly though have great love for english hate hanoverian george people must like to fight with one of scotch regiment in french service in such quarrel malcolm laughed dear lad if soldier be to discus merit of quarrel in be ordered to fight there must be end of discipline yes see that ronald agreed if one be once soldier have only to obey order one need not become soldier just at time when must be called upon to fight for cause considers unjust be so ronald be fortunate if feeling be in favour of maria theresa that be not thinking of enlisting just at present for must be puzzled side to take if fought for must have to fight under hanoverian if fight against hanoverian be fighting against maria theresa well want to fight at ronald said what want to do be to find out something about father wish voyage be at end that have face towards paris will not be so easy to cross from holland into france malcolm said wish voyage be at end for reason for unless mistake there be storm brewing up malcolm prediction a to weather be speedily verified wind rose rapidly ragged cloud hurried across sky wave got up fast by sea have become really heavy dashing in sheet high in air time bluff bowed craft plunged into long before ronald have gone below prostrate with seasickness be just like obstinacy of dutchman malcolm muttered to a held on by shroud watched labouring ship must have be clear to anyone before be well out of river that be going to have gale a wind then be nearly due south must have run back again anchored in shelter till be over now have backed round nearly into teeth with sign of getting into north then will have french coast on lee be not very serious yet if wind go on rising a have done for last four five hour will have gale to remember before morning before daylight indeed tremendous sea be running wind be blowing with terrible force from north although under rag of canvas brig be pressed down gunwale deep wave a struck broadside seemed to heave bodily to leeward malcolm on coming on deck made way aft glanced at compass then took long look over foaming water towards where knew french coast must lie wind be two three point east of north a clumsy craft must not sail within several point of wind be heading nearly east be making foot to leeward for one forge ahead said to if have be at work all night can not be far from coast so dutch skipper appeared to think for few minute afterwards gave order to bring about on other tack three time tried failed time vessel slowly came up into wind heavy wave forced head off again before headsail filled then skipper gave order to wear head payed off to wind until be nearly before two three great sea struck stern buried head deeply at last boom swung over head came up on other tack during course of manoeuvre have made fully two mile leeway when be fairly under sail with head to west malcolm took long look towards south just a thought said there be white water there dark line behind be french coast sure enough must have be useless to speak touched arm of skipper pointed to leeward skipper looked in direction for minute then gave order for more sail to be put on ship to endeavour to beat out in teeth of gale even when pressed to utmost be evident to malcolm that force of wave be driving faster towards coast than must make off went below told ronald to come on deck must rather lie here ronald said nonsense lad wind spray will soon knock sickness out of will want wit about for wo be many hour before be bumping on sand stoutly built a craft be wo hold together long in such sea a do really mean be only trying to get on deck mean lad be drifting fast upon french coast there be hope of clawing off in teeth of such gale a news aroused ronald effectually have not suffered at on voyage down from glasgow be already beginning to feel better when malcolm went down to call be soon on deck holding on by bulwark there be that long low black line look long way off because air be full of spray coast be low be not more than three four mile look at broad belt of foam for hour dutch skipper did best to beat to windward in vain vessel drove nearer nearer towards shore anchor be got in readiness when within quarter of mile of line of breaker vessel head be brought up into wind lashing of two anchor cut simultaneously will hold do think ronald asked not chance of ronald of course captain be right to try cable be ever made must hold such bluff bowed craft a in teeth of such wind sea cable ran out to bitt just a tightened great sea rolled in on bow two dull report be heard then head payed off jib be run up instantly to help round under sail brig be headed directly towards shore sea be breaking round now brig be almost flat bottomed drew little water on board hung on to shroud bulwark momentarily expecting crash drove on through surf until within hundred yard of shore then a went down in trough of wave there be mighty crash next wave swept forward own length then there be crash even more tremendous than first mast simultaneously went over side next wave moved few foot one followed finding immovable piled higher over swept in cataract down sloping deck stern have swung round after first shot now lay broadside to wave dutch skipper crew behaved with greatest calmness ship lay over at such angle that be impossible to stand on deck captain managed to get on upper rail although frequently almost washed off by sea contrived to cut shroud rope still attached mast to ship there then joined crew who be standing breast high in water on lee side floating mast be pulled in until within few yard of vessel such of crew a must swim made towards skipper cut last rope bound then plunged in joined men distance be little over fifty yard to shore wreck formed partial shelter crowd of people be assembled at edge of beach with rope in readiness to give assistance in power malcolm ronald be among who have swum to mast when within short distance of shore former shouted in latter ear swim off lad mast might crush a soon a neared shore number of rope be thrown most of sailor seeing danger of being crushed followed example of malcolm left mast malcolm ronald swam just outside point where wave broke until line fell in water close to grasped at once give twist round arm malcolm shouted backwash will tear from sailor on shore watched opportunity instant wave passed beneath two swimmer ran up beach at full speed with rope there be crash ronald felt shot forward with great rapidity then a touched ground with foot be swept from under so great be strain that felt a if arm be being pulled from socket few second later be lying at full length upon sand before next wave reached dozen men have rushed down seized malcolm carried beyond influence for minute two ronald felt too bruised out of breath to move then heard malcolm voice be hurt ronald think not malcolm replied making effort to sit up be lad bruised bit worse one by one sailor be brought ashore one with leg broken from force with be dashed down by surf one man who stuck to mast be crushed to death a be rolled over over on to beach captain three sailor be like malcolm ronald unhurt there still remained four men on wreck fortunately have struck just at high tide so stoutly be built that held together in spite of tremendous sea in hour four sailor be able to wade breast high to shore found that spot where vessel have struck be mile west of gravelines be taken to town be hospitably entertained small body of soldier be quartered there officer in command told dutch skipper a two nation be at war crew must be detained until received order respecting on learning from malcolm that ronald be passenger be scotsman making way from england to escape imprisonment a friend of stuart that have for twelve year served in one of scotch regiment of louis be now bound for paris officer said that be free to continue journey at once be two three day before started for found next morning that be too severely bruised to set out at once on journey a malcolm have taken care to keep purse containing ronald money securely fastened to belt under clothes have lack of fund a time be object started for paris on foot ronald greatly enjoyed journey bright weather have set in after storm be now middle of may nature be bright cheerful dress of peasantry style of architecture so different to to be accustomed in scotland everything else be new strange to malcolm spoke french a fluently a own language have therefore difficulty trouble on way arrived at paris without adventure malcolm went to cabaret have at time when be in french service be much frequented by scotch soldier being kept by countryman of own ex sergeant in one of scottish regiment ah sandy macgregor malcolm exclaimed a proprietor of place approached to take order so be still in flesh man right glad be to see again know face sandy replied canna just say what name might be malcolm anderson of leslie scotch regiment be fourteen year since left now be here again four year later if can remember when came over to try find out if aught have be heard of colonel ay ay sandy said grasping malcolm outstretched hand warmly come back to now right glad be to see who be lad ye have brought with scot by face bearing will be bound young yet for service if be what be thinking of be colonel son sandy will remember told have carried back to scotland with need not tell ye that be betwixt ourselves for who have so badly treated father might well have grudge against son more that be rightful heir to many broad acre here in france give hearty welcome young sir sandy said many time have seen brave father riding at head of regiment have spoken to too for officer must drop in here crack cup together in room keep upstairs for quality well well to think that be son what malcolm said be true be best that none knew who be for have unco quick way here of putting inconvenient people out of way have ever heard aught of father since ronald asked eagerly not word sandy replied have heard talked over score of time by men who be in regiment be once none doubted that if be still alive be lying in bastille vincennes one of other cage where keep whose presence king favourite find inconvenient be just stroke of pen without question trial be gone even best friend darena ask question concerning in most case none know why have be put away there be doubt why leslie be seized three four of fellow officer be in secret of marriage when have disappeared talked loudly about there be sair grief anger among scottish regiment at leslie seizure what be to be done be just king pleasure be enough in france leslie have committed grave offence of thwarting wish of two of king favourite great noble too with broad land grand connection be liking of scottish soldier of fortune headstrong girl in comparison in scotland in old time gallant who have carried off daughter of douglas one of powerful noble must have made wife widow ere many week be over be same thing here now have be easy thing for enemy to kill leslie with regiment at back so got order from king a surely got rid of a if have taken life have never heard whether mother have married again ronald asked have never heard name mentioned father be still at court daughter have never be seen since must have heard of more than can not say that give hope that father be still alive ronald said have be dead might have forced into other marriage might so be plainly lassie who have will of own may have held out why did not kill instead of putting in prison if be in way might a said have done at once once in prison be beyond reach king may grant lettre de cachet a order be called to favourite even in france men be not put to death without sort of trial even chateaurouge de recambours must not ask louis to have man murdered in prison to gratify private spite especially when man be brave scottish officer whose fate have already excited much discontent among compatriot in king service then again much must depend upon who be governor of prison men differ like others of be honourable gentleman to whom even louis must not venture to hint that wanted prisoner put out of way there be others who to gratify powerful nobleman must think nothing of telling jailer to forget fortnight to give food to prisoner so see can not judge from now what be thinking of doing malcolm why be over here in first place be over here because young leslie took after father aided jacobite whom george men be in search of to escape drew sword on worshipful justice of glasgow city watch have begun early sandy said laughing how did get away brought down prisoner to london to interrogate a to plot have boat in thames jumped over swam for so here be there be rumour in scotland that king louis be helping prince charlie that army be soon going to sail for scotland be talked of here so far nothing be settled a king george be interfering in louis affair be fighting in germany think more than likely that king louis be going to stir up coil in scotland to give george something to do at home then if there be nothing to be done here will find out old regiment there will be many officer in still who have fought under leslie of may know more about than do will surely be able to tell have become of lad mither may well be so keep quiet tongue malcolm a to leslie son save to on whose discretion can rely tell if be known that be alive in france life must not be worth week purchase must not take trouble to get lettre de cachet for a did for father must be just pistol bullet stab on dark night in lonely place there must be question asked about fate of unknown scotch laddie will be careful sandy silent first thing be to find out where old regiment be lying that can tell at once be on frontier with duc de noailles say that there be like to be great battle with english george army well a have nothing else to do will set out find malcolm said a time be not pressing will stop few day here in paris will show lad sight suppose can put up can time be dull at present after paris swarmed with scotsman who have fled to save head of late year few have come over scotch regiment have difficulty in keeping up number since last of marched for frontier have be looking after empty bench will be good news for when hear that war be over be on way back for day malcolm ronald wandered about narrow street of paris ronald be somewhat disappointed in city of have heard so much street be ill paved worse lighted be narrow winding in neighbourhood of louvre there be sign of wealth opulence rich dress of noble contrasted strongly indeed with sombre attire of glasgow citizen appearance uniform of royal guard filled with admiration beyond fashionable quarter did not appear to that paris possessed many advantage over glasgow poorer class be squalid poverty stricken to far greater degree than anything have seen in scotland chief point of attraction to be prison bastille chatelet temple be point to be continually turning two former especially since if be in paris be in one of that father be most probably lying various plan have so often thought over by in way other might communicate with father aid escape be roughly shattered at sight of building have reckoned on resembling in respect prison in glasgow at sight of formidable fortress with lofty wall flanking tower moat vigilant sentry hope fell to zero must saw at once be absolutely impossible to open communication with prisoner of whose whereabouts be wholly ignorant of whose very existence be doubtful narrow slit lighted cell in be confined might look into inner court cell might be below surface of soil legend of troubadour who discovered king richard of england place of captivity by singing without wall have always be present in mind such plan must be practicable here knew song father father only must recognize even did know song appearance of anyone loitering in open space outside moat round bastille singing at interval at different point must have instantly attracted attention of sentry on wall even did discover that father be lying prisoner in one of cell facing outwards in fortress did see possibility of compassing escape slit be wide enough only for passage of ray of light flight of arrow human being must squeeze through even if must do so must need long rope to descend into moat one day ronald talked over idea with malcolm who declared at once that be impossible of execution there be scarcely case on record said of escape from bastille chatelet yet there have be score of prisoner confined in with friend of great influence abundant mean if have be unable by bribing jailer by other strategy to free friend how must stranger without connection influence wealth hope to effect escape of captive be certain that be within wall waste thought on such fancy ronald if father be still in prison be by influence only influence exerted upon king exceeding that of father enemy that release can be obtained such influence there be possibility of exerting father comrade countryman position service availed nothing when be first imprisoned in time have elapsed number of who know must venture to risk king displeasure by pleading cause must have lessened considerably only possibility mind say possibility of success lie in mother so far be clear that have be powerless know not under what circumstance have be placed may all time have be shut up prisoner in convent may be dead be possible that if be free may have powerful connection on mother side who might be induced to take up cause to plead with king for father liberty may have be told that father be dead be doubt in ignorance of what have become of whether be still alive if belief be dead must have have motive for exerting family influence may have may be living broken hearted woman firm only in resolution to accept other husband yes be possible ronald agreed at rate malcolm let lose further time set out tomorrow for frontier try to find out from father old comrade what have become of mother chapter v dettingen after walking two three mile malcolm ronald came upon rear of train of waggon have set out from paris hour earlier entering into conversation with one of driver found that convoy be bound for frontier with ammunition supply for army be fortunate malcolm said for to tell truth ronald have looked forward to meeting with good many difficulty by way have pass permit to travel must be suspected of being deserter thief came down from north easy enough there be more accustomed to passage of traveller to from coast going east appearance if alone must be sure to incite comment suspicion be hard if among soldier with convoy know someone who have friend in old regiment at rate can offer to make ourselves useful in case of of driver falling ill deserting by way a walked along towards head of long line of waggon malcolm closely scrutinized trooper who formed escort most of be young soldier therefore went on without accosting until reached head of column here two officer be riding together captain young lieutenant malcolm saluted former be old soldier of d regiment of scottish calvary be going with young friend here who have relation in regiment to join will permit sir to journey with convoy be ready if need be to make ourselves useful in case of driver be missing uncommon thing a know on long journey officer asked few question about service said what have be doing since left a say fourteen year ago have be in scotland sir took lad who be then infant home to people having have enough of soldiering while brother father remained with regiment know whether be alive dead if former lad want to join a trumpeter when old enough to fight in rank very well officer said can march along with if of fellow desert will take place of course draw pay be short time indeed before malcolm service be called into requisition for very first night several of driver who have be pressed into service managed to elude vigilance of guard slipped away next morning malcolm with ronald a assistant took charge of one of heavy waggon loaded with ammunition drawn by twelve horse be better than walking after ronald in first place save leg in second one be partly out of dust think must get on faster walking malcolm yes if have stoppage then see a have paper might be detained for week by pig headed official in little country town besides be sure to push on a fast a can for will want ammunition before battle be fought after few day wo make much difference to weather be fine journey will not be unpleasant in fact ronald enjoyed next three week greatly a train of waggon made way across plain of champagne then on through valley of lorraine alsace until reached strasbourg malcolm have speedily made friend with of soldier of escort of evening when day work be over ronald sat with by fire made by roadside malcolm told tale of campaign in have be engaged soldier sang song chatted over probability of event of war none of have served before having be few month taken from home in various part of france although doubtless many have at first regretted bitterly being dragged away to war be now all reconciled to lot looked forward eagerly to joining regiment be at front when duty of looking after convoy must be at end little be known in paris a to position of contending army beyond fact that lord stair who commanded english army sixteen thousand strong have for last year be lying inactive in flanders have marched down with hanoverian ally towards maine that duc de noailles with sixty thousand men be lying beyond rhine at strasbourg learned that french army have marched north to give battle to lord stair who have at present with twenty eight thousand men be waiting to be joined by twelve thousand hanoverian hessian who be on way convoy continued journey pushing forward with speed on th of july joined army of de noailles french be on south side of river having arrived on bank before english have possession of bridge a soon a waggon have joined army malcolm obtained from officer commanding escort discharge saying that ronald have fulfilled engagement a driver with waggon to front be now at liberty to return to france now be own master again ronald malcolm said have taken part in good many battle have never yet have opportunity of looking on at one comfortably de noailles must lose time in attacking so a to destroy english before receive reinforcement a hold bridge can bring on battle when like think tomorrow next day fight will take place be known in camp that evening that english have established chief magazine at hanau be marching up river towards aschaffenburg in early morning portion of french troop crossed river at town took up strong position there ronald malcolm climbed hill looking down upon river from south side thence commanded view of ground across english be marching on eastern side of river spur of spessart mountain came down close to bank inclosing narrow flat between aschaffenburg dettingen at latter place height approached so closely to river a to render difficult for army to pas between while posting strong force at aschaffenburg to hold passage across stream running into maine there de noailles marched main force down river movement be hidden by nature of ground from english who be advancing unconscious of danger towards dettingen de noailles will have in trap malcolm said for from position on hill must see whole ground on further bank hanau lying seven mile beyond dettingen be le than seven mile from aschaffenburg be afraid so ronald said afraid malcolm repeated why must rejoice ronald ca do ronald replied must like to see stuart instead of hanoverian reigning over after malcolm england scotland be one nation there be scotch regiment with french army brigade of irish may be ronald said scotchman who have got into political trouble at home may enter service of france may fight heartily against german fleming other enemy of france know must feel very reluctant to fight against english army except of course at home for stuart will benefit stuart cause if english be defeated here malcolm said may be may not ronald replied told that louis cared nothing for stuart must only aid in order to cripple english strength at home therefore if destroys english army here will have le cause to fear england so le motive for helping chevalier be true enough malcolm agreed be fast becoming politician ronald well will look on a neutral then because although english be certainly more nearly countryman than be french must remember that for twelve year fought under french flag however there can be doubt what be going to take place see dark mass of english army be passing through defile of dettingen french have begun to cross at seligenstadt in rear see be throwing three four bridge across river there in utter ignorance of danger english marched on along narrow plain by river bank towards aschaffenburg look at cavalry scouting ahead of malcolm said there french be opening fire a spoke puff of musketry rose up from line of stream held by french english cavalry galloped back column of infantry still advanced until within mile of french position be there halted while gun from french line opened fire bridge at seligenstadt be now completed mass of troop must be seen pouring over king george duke of cumberland have joined earl of stair just a army passed through dettingen be riding at head of column when french fire opened short time be spent in reconnoitring position of enemy in front english believed that entire french army be there opposed to that advance of army into franconia be main objective be therefore barred after short consultation be resolved to fall back at once upon magazine at hanau from ignorance of near proximity of french have be left weakly guarded believing that a fell back must be hotly pursued by french army king took command of rear a post of danger column facing about marched towards dettingen french have be beforehand with de noailles have sent men under nephew duke de grammont across river to occupy dettingen with main army remained on south side with artillery placed so a to fire across river upon flank of english a approached dettingen while must march up cross at aschaffenburg must english after being beaten back at dettingen try to retreat up river de grammont position be very strong one behind swamp deep ravine hollowed out by stream from hill there seemed possibility of escape for english army who be a yet absolutely in ignorance of position of french a head of column approached dettingen grammont artillery opened upon in front while of de noailles smote in flank a soon a king found that retreat be cut off galloped from rear of column to head horse alarmed by fire of artillery whistling of ball ran away with be with difficulty stopped just a reached head of column at once dismounted announced intention of leading troop on foot there be hasty council held between lord stair duke of cumberland be agreed that only escape from entire destruction be by fighting way through force now in front of must indeed have be impossible have de grammont held position when officer saw english troop halt believed have only advanced guard in front of resolving to overwhelm before main body arrived abandoned strong position led troop across swamp charged english in front de noailles from opposite bank seeing error nephew have made hurried troop towards bridge in order to cross river render assistance be too late english infantry headed by king in person hurled upon troop of de grammont man felt that only hope of escape from trap into have fallen lay in cutting way through enemy so furiously did fight that de grammont troop be utterly overthrown be soon in full flight towards bridge in rear hotly pursued by english before must reach bridge left behind on field six thousand killed wounded king george satisfied with success knowing that french army be still greatly superior to own wisely determined to get out of dangerous position a soon a possible pushed on night to hanau although malcolm ronald be too far off to witness incident of battle made out tide of war rolling away from saw black mass of troop pressing on through dettingen in spite of french artillery thundered from opposite bank of river have won ronald said throwing up cap hurrah malcolm where be utter destruction of english now see plain beyond dettingen be covered by confused mass of flying men english have broken out of trap instead of being crushed have won great victory look like certainly malcolm said must not have believed if have not seen destruction seemed certain now let go round to camp again on way down malcolm said think on whole ronald that be perhaps right french defeat will do good rather than harm to stuart cause have conquered louis must have be too intent on pushing forward own scheme to care much for stuart have real interest in only us a cat paw to injure england if have beaten english hanoverian must not have needed aid a be seems likely enough that will try to create diversion keep english busy at home by aiding stuart with men money to make landing in scotland in case malcolm need not grieve over defeat today know sympathy be with brave empress of austria rather than with enemy defeat must go far towards seating securely on throne now what will do malcolm will try find father friend at once for few day malcolm said just after defeat men be not in best mood to discus bygone matter let wait see what be done next next morning portion of french army have not be engaged crossed river collected french english wounded for latter have also be left behind be treated by french with same care kindness be bestowed upon own wounded de noailles be about to advance against english at hanau when received news that french army in bavaria have be beaten back by prince charles have crossed rhine into alsace a must now be exposed to whole brunt of attack of ally decided to retreat at once next day retreat recommenced many of driver have fled at first news of defeat malcolm without question assumed post of driver of one of abandoned team for week army retired then crossing rhine near worm be safe from pursuit now ronald will look up old regiment will see what be to be done d scotch dragoon be posted in little village mile distant from main camp have now be formed malcolm did make formal transfer of waggon to authority thinking by mean improbable that must insist upon continuing self adopted avocation a driver after seeing to horse be picketed with long line of transport animal ronald walked quietly away without ceremony of adieu must not come back again here said for of teamster must recognize a having be driving lately must have hard work to prove be not deserter must take to old regiment now a long a be here on reaching village found street full of trooper who be busy engaged in cleaning arm grooming horse removing sign of weather battle ronald felt thrill of pleasure at hearing native language spoken have now so far improved knowledge of french a to be able to converse without difficulty for malcolm have from childhood tried to keep up french have lately always spoken in language to unless be necessary to speak in english in order to make understand occasion have become more more rare two month of constant conversation with malcolm others have enabled ronald by time to speak with fluency in french tongue none of soldier paid attention to newcomer whose dress differed in way from of frenchman a after shipwreck have of course be obliged to rig out afresh malcolm stopped before old sergeant who be diligently polishing sword hilt how fare with year angus graeme sergeant almost dropped sword in surprise at being so addressed in own tongue by one whose appearance betokened frenchman know angus malcolm went on with smile yet ought to for if have be for sword of german hussar who carved that ugly scar across cheek must have followed up by putting end to soldiering altogether heart alive be malcolm anderson eh man be glad to see thought be dead year ago for have heard nae mair of since day when disappeared from among like spook same day that puir colonel leslie be hauled off to bastille sair day be that for ' where have ' ye be time back at home angus at least in body for heart be with old regiment who think be must keep close mouth man for must be talked of be leslie son by father last order took off to scotland with to be out of reach of foe now have brought back again to try if between can gain news of father say so malcolm never a much heard that colonel have son though there be talk in regiment that have married great lady that be for that have be hid away in prison be leslie boy only to think now well young sir there be man in regiment wad do best for father son for who have joined since in truth be great part of have heard many tale of colonel leslie though may not have served under not tale be to honour for braver officer kinder one never stepped earth come inside malcolm have got room to myself stoup of good wine let talk over thing fair gentle when know what be that want may be sure will do can for sake baith of colonel of auld comrade trio be soon seated in cottage malcolm then gave short sketch of have taken place since have left regiment well well sergeant said when have ended so lad young a be have already drawn sword for stuart take after father in loyalty a well a in look for now know who be can see father face in plain enough now for plan malcolm plan must be left to chance angus came hither to see whether of colonel friend be still in regiment to learn from whether have news whatever of secondly whether can tell aught of mother ay there be six eight officer still in regiment who served with hume be colonel now will remember malcolm well for be captain of troop major macpherson be captain too then there be oliphant munroe campbell graham of whom be young lieutenant in time be now old captain of troop will see colonel macpherson malcolm said if know younger men be not likely to will go along with angus introduce though hume be like enough to remember seeing be so much with leslie will be dining in hour sergeant said will go after have done meal be always good time to talk with men when be full colonel will have business to disturb then own dinner will be ready directly can smell goose picked up a might be by accident at place where halted last night there be four five of old soldier who always mess together when be not on duty with troop if mistake not will know one of right glad will be to see of course will say no word a to who lad be save that be friend of yours few minute later four other sergeant dropped in there be joyful greeting between malcolm a soon a recognized identity meal be jovial one a old joke old reminiscence be recalled after hour sitting angus said pas round wine lad till come back again be taking anderson to colonel who be captain of troop be not likely to be long when come back will make night of in honour of old time be mistaken on leaving cottage waited for while until saw colonel major rise from beside fire round with other officer have be taking meal walk to cottage shared between angus went up saluted what be graeme colonel asked there be one here who must fain have talk with be malcolm anderson whom may remember a puir colonel leslie servant a being in own troop have brought one with concerning whom will speak to of course remember anderson colonel said be devoted to leslie bring in at once what can have brought out here again after so many year be getting into trouble at home suppose be always in scrape other when be in regiment for though be good soldier be a wild reckless blade a in regiment remember macpherson yes remember well major said colonel be very fond of regarded almost a brother minute later angus ushered malcolm ronald into presence of two officer who have now taken seat in room served a kitchen sitting room to cottage be much largest in village well anderson be glad to see again colonel hume said rising holding out hand have often spoken of since day disappeared saying that be going on mission for colonel have wondered what mission be how be that never heard of again came over to paris four year later colonel regiment be away in flanders a found out from others what have come to learn there be use in following a to colonel mission be put hand on ronald shoulder what do mean anderson colonel asked in surprise be colonel leslie son sir bade fetch straight away from folk with whom be living take off to scotland so a to be out of reach of foe who must doubtless have made even shorter work with than did with colonel good heaven colonel exclaimed be news indeed so poor leslie left child be lad said taking ronald hand believe that anything can do for whatever be will be done for sake of dear father whom loved a elder brother too major said there be not one of must have fought to death for leslie now sit down lad while anderson tell story malcolm began at account of charge colonel leslie have committed to manner in have fulfilled told how have placed child in care of brother having fixed home of own how lad have received solid education while have seen to learning use of sword so that might be able to follow father career then told episode of jacobite agent escape have be effected in thames have done well anderson colonel said when have concluded if ever leslie must come to see son will have cause to thank indeed for way in have carried out charge committed to may well be pleased at seeing grown up such manly young fellow a to leslie know not whether be alive dead interest be made at time to assuage majesty hostility influence of marquis of recambours be too strong king at last peremptorily forbade leslie name being mentioned before see although girl father be of course at liberty to bestow hand on whomsoever pleased have with toadyism of courtier asked king approval of match with chateaurouge a matter of course received majesty therefore chose to consider a personal offence against that scottish soldier of fortune must carry off one of richest heiress of france whose hand have granted to one of peer at same rime can not think that leslie still life for have be dead must assuredly have heard of marriage of widow with one else duke have of course long since married report say that pair be ill matched husband must speedily have be found for widow since duke have married ronald said must no longer be so bitter against father perhaps after so long imprisonment king might be moved to grant release a duke marriage be unhappy one fear that can not count upon hostility to father being in way lessened a must all more regret interference with former plan have idea where mother be sir none colonel said that might find out for will give letter to count de noyes who be on intimate term with archbishop of paris who must doubt be able to tell in convent lady be residing must not be too sanguine poor boy of seeing for be possible that have already taken veil indeed if father have died have still refused to accept suitor whom marquis may have found for may be sure that have be compelled to take veil a estate must then revert to nearest kinsman may for aught know have happened year ago without word of being bruited abroad affair only known to most concerned however must look at best side will be able doubtless to learn through archbishop whether be still merely detained in convent have taken veil can then judge accordingly whether father be likely to be alive dead a to obtaining interview with mother regard a impossible in one case a other at rate be of highest importance that must not be known that be in france if be proved that father be dead mother be secluded for life must then introduce to family try get to bring influence to bear to have acknowledged openly a legitimate heir of marquis to obtain for succession to at least portion of estate say to of brought a dowry in may be sure that scottish gentleman in army will give aid influence can bring to bear ronald warmly thanked colonel hume for kindness next day having received letter to count de noyes set out for paris with malcolm on arrival there lost time in calling upon count presenting letter of introduction count read through twice without speaking friend colonel hume said at last tell that be son born in lawful wedlock of colonel leslie amelie de recambours be aware of circumstance of case being distantly related to lady family will do colonel hume asks namely discover convent in be living warn young man that position here be dangerous one be known that colonel leslie son be alive in france consider life must not be worth day purchase when powerful people be interested in removal of anyone not favoured with powerful protection matter be easily arranged there be hundred of knife in paris whose use can be purchased for few crown of if seclusion be deemed better than removal king favourite can always obtain lettre de cachet man may linger lifetime in prison without soul outside wall knowing of existence there be obstacle to plan of great noble be in france fatal offence wisest course young man must be to efface to get friend colonel hume to obtain for commission in regiment to forget for ever that be son of colonel leslie amelie de recambours however in will doubtless choose for believe advice be good at rate will do what friend colonel hume asks will obtain for name of convent where mother be living see that will be better off when have for assuredly will be able to obtain permission to see however again be affair if will

lost to on arriving at paris found that colonel hume regiment have returned to capital be not expected that there must at present be further fighting on frontier two three of scotch regiment have be brought back ronald at once called on colonel hume related to success have attended first portion of undertaking congratulate indeed colonel hume said own thought enterprise be hopeless one for seemed to impossible that must be able to obtain interview with lady closely imprisoned in convent why anderson be plain now that talent have be lost that ought to have be diplomatist instead of wasting time a soldier way carried out plan be indeed admirable will really begin to think ronald will yet succeed now young friend what do mean to do next must be possible sir to ascertain where father be confined think not lad colonel said gravely in addition to four five prison in paris there be score of others in different part of france name of prisoner in be known only to governor to others within wall exist a number only governor be sworn to secrecy even if must get at one two of must be difficult enough must hope for more must be much satisfaction to merely to know in prison father be lying for be very different matter to communicate with prisoner in one of royal fortress to passing message to lady detained in convent can see nothing for to follow example of mother to practise patience so conducting a to gain friend make name influence so that at grandfather death may bring a strong pressure a possible to bear upon king how old be grandfather ronald asked be man about sixty why may live twenty year yet ronald exclaimed bitterly look at worst side of question colonel hume replied with smile may live year went on more gravely in meantime must think what have better do will tell a great secret that have be finally resolved that expedition will sail winter for scotland fifteen thousand troop will assemble at dunkirk under marshal saxe nothing must be more opportune be to form part of expedition with several other scottish regiment be too young a yet for to ask for commission for if like will enroll a gentleman volunteer in way may have opportunity of distinguishing will introduce to chevalier may be that if succeeds in gaining crown of scotland if not of england will ask king louis a personal favour to release restore to colonel leslie of glenlyon who fought bravely with in ' if expedition fails get back alive to france will then obtain for commission in regiment can carry out plan a arranged what do say to thank greatly sir accept offer most gratefully see that be powerless to do anything for father now plan give at least prospect of success in case nothing will give so much delight a to serve with regiment formerly commanded under so kind friend a yourself be settled then colonel hume said now about outfit gentleman volunteer wear uniform of officer of regiment indeed be one in respect except that draw pay purse will be at disposal show false modesty lad about accepting help from father must have shared last penny with have needed thank heartily colonel for offer must be necessary will avail of at present have ample fund malcolm carried off with bag with hundred louis up to day when landed in france have never be touched have eighty of still remaining will provide outfit maintenance for long time to come there be advantage in being volunteer rather than on list of officer ronald in if be necessary at time can after word with lay aside uniform go about affair a long a choose without question must be hard to do if belonged regularly to regiment at end of week ronald have procured uniform be presented by colonel to officer of regiment a ronald leslie son of old friend of who be joining regiment a gentleman volunteer malcolm joined only in capacity of ronald servant be painful to lad that old friend protector must assume relation towards malcolm laughed at scruple dear ronald said be father servant yet friend why must not act in same capacity to a to duty be so light that now belong to regiment only difficulty will be to kill time there be nothing to do save to polish up arm equipment horse will be looked after by trooper so long a be with regiment will call in morning get cup of chocolate prepare dinner when dine abroad carry message when have message to send escort when go about business in be possible that second sword must be of use to a have said only trouble will be to know what to do with when want be now end of august for next four month ronald worked hard at drill soon became general favourite with officer fact that name be leslie that be accompanied by malcolm who be known to many of old soldier a being devoted to former colonel a having in strange way disappeared from regiment at same time gave ground to general surmise that leslie be colonel son malcolm when questioned denied acknowledged fact turned off with joke laugh be soon a much at home in old regiment a if formed part in when not required by ronald passed greater part of time with former comrade a be natural opinion entertained by men a to leslie identity be shared by officer avoidance by ronald of allusion to family declining when first came among to say to branch of leslies belonged decided manner in colonel hume first time question be broached in hearing in ronald absence said that begged inquiry must be made on score must assure be that leslie father be gentleman of good family personal friend of own put stop to further questioning strengthened idea have got abroad that young volunteer be son of colonel leslie early in january d scottish dragoon marched for dunkirk where twenty thousand men assembled while large number of men of war transport be gathered in port one day when ronald be walking in street with malcolm

for to know foe when see in meantime go on frequenting various school of arm learn trick of sword be to be taught look went on a group of mounted officer rode down street be marshal saxe one of best soldier in france if not best just a wild reckless in private life a be calm prudent a general ronald looked with surprise at great general have expected to see dashing soldier saw man who looked worn

marshal saxe with portion of troop marched to join army in flanders scotch dragoon be ordered to return to paris for present for year ronald remained with regiment in paris have during time be introduced by colonel hume to several member of mother family by of who have known before marriage be kindly received told that must be hopeless to make effort for release of father a long a marquis de recambours remained alive high in favour at court that movement in direction must be likely to do harm rather than good of others clearly intimated to that considered that countess have by making secret marriage defying father authority forfeited right to assistance sympathy of mother family twice ronald travelled to tour sent message to mother through jeanne received answer from countess have however refused to meet again on terrace saying that in spite of love have for desire to see again be firmly resolved not to run risk of danger to failure of hope by rash step at end of summer campaign in flanders marshal saxe returned to paris colonel hume one day took ronald introduced to having previously interested marshal by relating history to marshal asked ronald many question be much pleased with frank manner bearing will have protection can give marshal said man have loved adventure more than have fairer share of sympathy be altogether with besides remember father well many carouse have have together in flanders be soldier know though king be glad enough to employ sword in fighting enemy have little influence at court promise however that after first great victory win will ask release of father a personal favour from king on ground that be old comrade of mine can only hope for sake that marquis grandfather may have departed world before take place for be one of king prime favourite even request of victorious general must go for little a opposed to influence other way now if like will give commission in colonel hume regiment have served for year a volunteer now younger men than have received commission ronald thanked marshal most heartily for kind promise said that at present must rather remain a volunteer because gave greater freedom of action perhaps be right marshal said at rate have better abstain from attempting step such a colonel hume tell once thought of for obtaining release of father success will be impossible failure must destroy altogether hope may have of obtaining release from king seemed that of mother family with whom have communicated must have desired to gain favour of favourite of king by relating circumstance to for short time after ronald interview with marshal marquis came up to colonel hume when be on duty in king antechamber in presence of number of courtier said to so colonel hume find have to thank for harbouring in regiment imposter who claim to be grandson will know sir how to repay obligation gentleman in question be imposter marquis a have taken pain to inform be not aware of reason why must not admit son of scottish gentleman into regiment even though happen to be grandson of yours a to threat sir a long a do duty to majesty fear displeasure of man two night later a ronald be returning from dining with colonel hume of officer be suddenly attacked in narrow street by six men malcolm be with for colonel hume have at once related to conversation have have with marquis have warned to take greatest precaution be perfectly capable of having suddenly put out of way by stab in back ronald if there be anywhere for to go must advise to leave paris at once nowhere in france must be safe from must upset plan to return to scotland at present however can not be too careful ronald have related what have passed to malcolm who determined to watch more carefully than ever over safety never left side when be outside barrack instant six men rushed out from lane at whose entrance lantern be dimly burning malcolm sword be out before assailant have time to strike blow have run foremost through body ronald instantly recovered from surprise also drew be now nearly eighteen although have not yet gained full height be match for most men in strength while constant exercise in school of arm have strengthened muscle of sword arm until in strength a well a in skill must hold own against best swordsman in regiment men be for moment checked by fall of leader then seeing that have opposed to only one man whom regarded a lad scarcely to be taken into consideration rushed upon be quickly undeceived ronald parried first blow aimed at with riposte stretched opponent on pavement then springing forward after few rapid thrust parry ran next through shoulder almost at same moment that malcolm stretched opponent on ground terrified at downfall of three of number while fourth leaned against door post disabled two remaining ruffian took to heel fled at top of speed whole affair having lasted minute tell employer ronald said to wounded man be not to be disposed of so easily a imagined must be only giving what deserve if be to pas sword through body disdain to kill such pitiful assassin except in self defence next morning ronald communicated to colonel hume what have happened be just a well young friend that be going to leave paris received order hour ago for regiment to march to frontier at once be marquis doing doubt thought to get rid of last night to punish morning have failed way have defeated cutthroat will be heartily glad to be at front again for be sick of idle life in paris chapter viii hidden foe be heartily glad to be out of paris ronald said to malcolm on first halt after leaving capital be not pleasant to regard man one meet after dark a possible enemy although escaped scot free from gang who attacked other night one can not always expect such good fortune a that be constant weight on one mind feel like new man now that be beyond city wall nevertheless ronald must not omit precaution enemy have long purse can reach right across france that last affair be proof of bitterness against must be rash indeed be to act a if having made one attempt failed must abandon plan altogether be clearly man who nourishes grudge for year first failure be only likely to add to vindictive feeling say that danger be a great a be in paris be simply because opportunity of attacking be fewer must advise to be a careful a before to be on guard against ambush surprise well may be so malcolm of course will be careful till have proof to contrary will prefer to think that marquis will trust to being knocked on head during war will make further move against until regiment return to paris think what like lad malcolm said so that be cautious guarded will sleep with one eye open can tell till be fairly beyond frontier two day later regiment encamped outside town of st quentin be usually quartered on inhabitant town be already filled with troop a weather be fine colonel hume ordered men to bivouac short distance outside wall ronald be seeing that troop got breakfast next morning when sergeant came up with two men with horse be monsieur leslie said to men be asking for sir what do want with ronald said surprised heard sir one of peasant said that wanted to buy horse have fine animal here cheap want to buy one ronald replied be very well supplied with horse what made think wanted one asked one of officer sir if anyone in regiment must be likely to buy said that monsieur leslie wanted one believed ronald said decidedly whoever told be mistaken have full complement though horse look nice animal must not take if offered to for nothing think will get anyone to buy in regiment believe that officer have full complement of charger in evening ronald happened to mention to malcolm offer have have in morning be nice looking beast said have half mind to ask what must take to exchange with roan did not want to dip further into purse wish have be beside at time malcolm said earnestly two fellow must have gone out of camp so easily why what do mean malcolm mean malcolm repeated in vexed tone be what come of being watchful cautious ronald why matter be clear enough marquis have set men on track of course must hing until of knew by sight so two of be sent into camp with cock bull story about horse come have good look at go quietly off be too provoking have be there must have given in charge of file of men at once then must have asked officer in regiment if have sent to when found a certainly must have found that none of have done so must have marched men off to colonel hume be sure when heard circumstance of case must have be lashed up flogged till have got truth of matter out of great hope have be that must not very well attempt life because none of men who might be engaged on job must be likely to know face must therefore have mean of singling out for attack now two of ruffian will be able to follow watch opportunity oh nonsense malcolm be too suspicious altogether have doubt affair be just a stated to be what be more natural well ronald will meet other officer at supper in hour just ask if of sent two men wanting to sell horse to morning if of say that did so will acknowledge be wrong accordingly ronald at supper put question none of officer admitted knew anything about matter have two very good horse leslie why must anyone suppose that wanted colonel asked know ronald said only know that two men did come up with horse to morning said that one of officer have told wanted to buy one must have be one of men colonel said carelessly though know why anyone must suppose that wanted charger still someone knowing that be last joined officer might think have need for second horse subject dropped malcolm shook head ominously when ronald acknowledged to that suspicion be so far right that none of officer have sent men to next day a regiment be passing through thick wood ronald be riding with captain campbell behind troop happened to be in rear in regiment two shot be fired from among tree first struck ronald horse in neck causing to swerve sharply round movement saved rider life for second shot be fired almost instantly after first grazed body passed between captain campbell be hit leslie latter exclaimed for sudden movement of horse have almost unseated ronald nothing serious think bullet have cut coat grazed skin think nothing more captain shouted order to men with score of trooper dashed into wood tree grew thickly there be dense undergrowth have difficulty in making way through for hour continued search without success then rejoined regiment on march be curious affair colonel hume said when captain campbell reported at next halt that attempt at assassination have taken place look like premeditated attempt upon one other of have be getting into scrape have asked with smile kissing peasant wife offering to run away with daughter seriously be strange affair why must two men lie in wait for regiment fire at two of officer men have be behaving well a far a have heard on line of march nothing have occurred must explain such outrage a may be fancy on part colonel ronald said can not help thinking that be sequence of affair told about in paris just before started first shot struck horse second must certainly have killed have not be for horse sudden swerve therefore look a if shot be aimed at have reason too for supposing have be followed if remember question last night at supper about men who wanted to sell horse malcolm anderson be convinced that whole thing be only ruse to enable to become acquainted with face wanted to be able to recognize so got up story in order to have pointed out to to have talk with none of officer did send to a said must hardly have hit upon better excuse for speaking to certainly look like colonel hume said gravely must give good deal if have caught two men in wood if have must have given choice of being hung at once telling be motive in firing at who paid to do be monstrous if must get shadow of proof against enemy must lay formal complaint before king marquis marquis be not going to have officer assassinated with impunity however till have something definite to go upon can hing until then leslie have best keep suspicion to yourself be best to say nothing of what think in country be dangerous even to whisper against king favourite let be supposed that attack in wood be only work of malicious scoundrel who must have fired out of pure hatred of king troop captain campbell ronald quite agreed with view taken by colonel answered question a to affair that have not least idea who be men who fired on that one obtained a much a glimpse of with most of officer of regiment indeed with except one ronald be on excellent term exception be lieutenant named crawford be first on list of company have indeed be twice passed over in consequence of quarrelsome domineering disposition be man of seven eight twenty stood about same height a ronald be of much same figure indeed general resemblance between have often be remarked dislike to ronald have arisen from fact previous to latter joining regiment crawford have be considered best swordsman among officer ronald superiority have be proved over over again in fencing room have annoyed greatly knowing that must have chance whatever with ronald in duel have carefully abstained from open war showing dislike only by sneering remark sarcastic comment frequently tried ronald patience to utmost more than once called down sharp rebuke from colonel hume one other of major did not lose opportunity afforded by shot fired in wood be continually suggesting sort of motif might have inspired must be assassin ronald who be reverse of quarrelsome by disposition laughed good temperedly at various suggestion one two of senior officer remonstrated sharply with crawford a to extent to carried gibe be presuming too much on leslie good nature crawford captain campbell said one day if be not one of best tempered young fellow going must resent constant attack upon know well that good swordsman a be must have chance whatever if did so be quite capable of managing own affair crawford said sullenly want advice from other man be speaking to a captain of leslie troop captain campbell said sharply mean to quarrel with have have more quarrel than enough in regiment already know colonel hume said on last occasion that next quarrel must be last in regiment tell frankly that if continue course of annoyance to young leslie will report matter to colonel have noticed that have good sense to abstain from remark when be present three day later regiment joined army before namur that evening having drunk more deeply than usual lieutenant crawford after colonel have retired from circle round fire to tent recommenced provocation to ronald pushed matter so far that latter felt that must no longer treat a jest mr crawford said warn that be pushing remark too far on many previous occasion have chosen to make observation must if have chosen have resented a insulting did not choose for hate brawling consider for who have lately joined regiment to be engaged in quarrel with officer senior to myself must be in highest degree unbecoming be sure that fellow officer will bear out in saying have shown fully a much patience a be becoming therefore have to tell will no longer be butt that will treat further remark of nature of have just made a deliberate insult will take measure accordingly murmur of approval rose among officer sitting round sitting near crawford endeavoured to quiet wine have taken have however excited quarrelsome instinct too far for counsel prudence to prevail will say what choose said rising to foot be not going to be dictated to by anyone much le boy who have just joined regiment who call leslie though one know whether have right to name very well sir leslie said in quiet tone be however heard distinctly throughout circle for at last outburst on part of crawford dead silence have fallen on circle for only one termination must follow insult captain campbell will hope act for certainly captain campbell said in loud voice will call upon friend lieutenant crawford may name make arrangement to settle matter in morning macleod will act for crawford said to lieutenant sitting next to will act young officer said coldly a second in matter here will understand do solely because be necessary that one must do so that disapprove absolutely wholly of conduct well make what arrangement like crawford said with oath rising left circle walked away when have left there be immediate discussion several of officer be of opinion that duel must not be allowed to proceed that crawford conduct must be reported to colonel be entirely in hand gentleman ronald said have desire to fight affair have be forced upon have alternative to take up be not boasting when say that be far better swordsman than have need to shrink from meeting have certainly desire to take life have drunk more than ought to do if matter can be arranged can be persuaded in morning to express regret for what have said will be very glad to accept apology if can be settled in way without fighting reporting conduct to colonel must probably result in having to leave regiment must be truly glad what be that broke off a loud cry rang through air whole party sprang to foot snatching up sword ran in direction from cry have come tent be at little distance just a reached saw man lying on ground good heaven be crawford captain campbell said stooping over see have be stabbed in back be over with who can have done questioned several of soldier who have now gathered round attracted like officer by cry none of have seen act have noticed anyone running away in so large camp there be so many people about assassin must well have walked quietly away without attracting attention colonel be speedily on spot instituted rigid inquiry entirely without success attack have evidently be sudden entirely unsuspected for crawford have not drawn sword be singular said a with officer walked slowly back to fire crawford be not popular man can not guess at reason for murder strange that must be second attack made on officer since left paris captain campbell now related what have taken place after have left circle matter must have be reported to at once said although a have turned out must have made difference perhaps after be best a be for duel between two officer of regiment must have done good man be credit to regiment be very serious matter that must be dogged by assassin come up with to tent be not going to blame lad said when be together for must not have acted otherwise than have done indeed have noticed several time that crawford bearing towards be reverse of courteous have idea a to how came by death sir ronald said in surprise know more than others strike leslie that be only sequel of attack in wood that enemy have unwittingly done service crawford be very much height build might easily have be mistaken for in dark fancy that blow be meant for be possible sir ronald said after pause have not thought of likeness between have be frequently noticed be quite possible that blow be meant for have very little doubt of lad if of men be hanging about saw a believed coming away from circle alone may well have taken opportunity let be lesson to to be careful henceforth be unlikely that attempt will be repeated at present men who did will think that have earned money by time be probably on way to paris to carry news claim reward so for time at least be not probable that there will be repetition of attempt after will have to be on guard night day wish to heaven must obtain clue must enable to take step in matter at present have nothing suspicion can not go to king say three attempt have be made on life of one of officer that suspect grandfather marquis de recambours have be author of when malcolm heard event of evening opinion be exactly same a of colonel expressed a convinced that crawford have fallen by blow intended for ronald agreed that for while there be fear of renewal of attempt fellow will take news straight to paris that have be put out of way time will elapse before employer know that mistake have be made then a likely a not will decide to wait until campaign be over camp before namur be large brilliant one king dauphin have already arrived with army household troop be there large contingent of noble of court english army be known to be approaching be expected to fight battle to relieve namur french be besieging vigorously french confidently hoped that in approaching battle must wipe reverse have befallen at dettingen chapter ix fontenoy fortnight after scottish dragoon joined army king be present at inspection of regiment a brilliant cortege passed along line ronald saw among gaily dressed throng of officer riding behind king marshal saxe marquis de recambours duke de chateaurouge side by side ronald with two other gentleman volunteer be in place in rear of regiment be drawn up in double line a royal party rode along for second time ronald saw that two nobleman be looking scrutinizingly through line of trooper at two companion that evening colonel hume on return from visit to marshal saxe told ronald that general have inquired after have sent word that if won battle must not forget promise have made have requested colonel hume to place ronald at disposal on day of battle will want active officer to carry message said 'and young friend may have greater opportunity of distinguishing than must with regiment must in case find easier to bring business before king ' marshal be terribly ill colonel hume said a reported conversation to ronald so ill that can only occasionally sit on horse nothing indomitable courage sustains be drawn about in light carriage made of basketwork serf also for bed on th of may enemy be known to be close at hand french selected position on must fight village of fontenoy have already be occupied by strong body of troop under marshal noailles rest of army now moved forward to post allotted to english army be close at hand be certain that battle must be fought on morrow in evening king held grand reception at officer of rank be present when colonel hume returned to camp officer be still sitting round fire have news for sir believe everything stand a be arranged king be in highest spirit though must say majesty did not choose reminiscence of nature to encourage who heard remarked for instance since day of st louis french have never gained decisive success over english few minute later observed that last time king of france with son have fought at head of french army be at battle of poictiers there be general laugh certainly king be not happy with reminiscence major munro remarked think time table be going to be turned in first place considerably outnumbered enemy even after leaving men to continue siege in second place position have chosen be almost impregnable scheldt cover right with fortified bridge securing communication village of antoin resting on river along front from antoin to fontenoy be narrow difficult valley left be covered by wood of barre where strong redoubt have be constructed whole of position be fortified with breastwork abattis a far a fontenoy between village barre natural difficulty be so great that field work be unnecessary can not believe that will attack in position especially a nearly army be dutch who will count for little english be only troop will find formidable before daybreak camp be astir troop took position assigned to even now be hardly believed that attack must be made by enemy so long a french remained in impregnable position presently column of enemy be seen advancing ronald have ridden up to litter on marshal saxe be placed after saluting have taken up position with number of other officer in readiness to carry order to different part of field at short distance from marshal king of france with dauphin brilliant cortege of noble have taken up post from position in marshal have caused to be placed complete view of enemy approaching rank be obtained must soon be seen that dutch troop who on english right be advancing to attack be moving against village of antoin fontenoy strong force headed a be known afterwards by general ingoldsby moved towards wood of barre while solid column of english hanoverian strong marched forward to attack across broken ground between fontenoy wood of barre be a yet five o'clock in morning when cannon broke out into roar on side dutch who be commanded by prince of waldeck soon hesitated in short time fell back out of range of fire on english right general ingoldsby penetrated distance into wood of barre then fell back again a dutch have done in hour after fighting have commenced right left of allied army have ceased attack there remained only centre be advancing under command of duke of cumberland column crossed ravine in front of fontenoy ground be so broken that troop be unable to deploy moved forward in solid mass with front of only forty men french battery from right left mowed down in line a steadily a if on parade place be filled up unshaken calm great column moved forward cannon dragged along by hand opened against fontenoy redoubt a in spite of hail of fire pressed steadily on french gunner be obliged to abandon cannon fly regiment of french guard officered almost entirely by highest noble met english guard who composed front line of column tremendous volley flashed along english line shattering rank of french guard there be moment fierce fighting then english column swept from before remains of french guard cleared ravine defended fontenoy ronald felt heart beat with excitement feeling of pride admiration a saw english advancing unmoved through storm of fire advanced in most perfect order sergeant calmly raised depressed soldier musket to direct fire vacant place be filled quietly regularly without hesitation hurry exclamation of surprise admiration broke even from french officer regiment after regiment be brought up hurled against head of column with more effect than wave against rock being dashed aside shattered broken by steady volley regular line of bayonet ronald other officer be sent off to bring up cavalry in vain did strive to break serried column one regiment after charged down upon english retaining fire until be within few yard of muzzle received with such tremendous volley that recoiled in disorder french regiment of vaisseaux next advanced to attack fought with greater gallantry than have preceded at last when almost annihilated survivor fell back now seemed a if men be to be victorious over whole french army marshal saxe begged king to retire with dauphin across bridge of calonne while did what must to retrieve battle king refused to leave field there be hurried council held round louis be agreed to make great effort by calling up whole of troop between fontenoy antoin a position held be no longer threatened by dutch have latter now advanced nothing must have saved french army from utter defeat remained immovable at distance from field of battle english now won crown of position have cut through french centre be moving forward towards bridge of calonne when whole of french artillery have by advice of duke of richelieu be brought up opened fire on english column at same moment french regiment from antoin fell upon while marshal saxe who have when danger became imminent mounted horse brought up irish brigade who with wild yell of hatred flung furiously upon flank of english attacked thus on side mown down by heavy fire of artillery unsupported amid army of foe column must do more ten thousand men must not withstand fifty thousand rank be twice broken by irish twice officer rallied until at last when became evident that more must be done column fell slowly back in order a perfect regular a in have advanced french historian have done ample justice to extraordinary valour shown by english troop on occasion valour never surpassed in long annals of british army have received slightest assistance from cowardly ally victory must have be a be although unsuccessful glory honour of day rested with rather than with victorious army of france more than column have fallen in desperate engagement loss of victor be even greater comprised many belonging to noblest family of france ronald have won warm approval of marshal saxe for manner in carried order across ground swept by heavy fire brought up regiment to within close quarter of english after battle be over marshal saxe presented to king several of staff who have most distinguished calling up ronald who be standing near for horse have be shot under a rode by side of marshal with irish brigade to attack marshal said allow to present to majesty ronald leslie young scottish gentleman of good family who be volunteer in scottish dragoon have rendered great service today by manner in have borne order through thickest of fire will bear in mind young gentleman king said graciously charge marshal to bring name before on future day duty a aide de camp over ronald rejoined regiment have lost nearly third of number in charge upon english column major munro have be killed colonel severely wounded number of officer have fallen ronald went about among men assisting to bind up wound supplying who needed with wine other refreshment presently be joined by malcolm thank god be safe ronald tell have given many fright today a watched galloping along through line of english fire where be malcolm did not see have nothing to do malcolm said climbed tree not fifty yard from marshal litter keeping trunk in front of to protect from stray bullet have good view of whole proceeding at one time be on point of slipping down making bolt for for thought be over with how column did fight have be in many battle never saw anything like be grand if have be for irish brigade think that must have beaten whole french army if go into battle again sha' come to see have done share of fighting can take hard knock a well a must not go through anxiety have suffered today about on condition however have be great day for mean about marshal presenting to king yes ought to help did mean that for have not heard of mean about old rascal grandfather marquis de recambours what about have not heard malcolm exclaimed then have good news for ball from one of english field piece struck full in chest of course slew instantly be not thirty yard from tree when saw knocked over be quite dead can assure for when others moved off took trouble to clamber down to assure so now greatest obstacle to release of father mother be out of way thank god for ronald said have reason for feeling one spark of regret at what have befallen be cruel persecutor of parent did best to get removed there be one obstacle now to obtaining father release a be relation old man will be able to deal with yes must be careful ronald remember decree against duelling must not make false step now when fortune be at last favouring there will be no more fighting fancy english will certainly not attack again tournay must fall think on part there will be desire to go out of way to seek engagement with king be sure to go back to paris at once where will be received with enthusiasm marshal saxe will probably follow a soon a tournay have fallen must advise therefore to get leave from colonel to be absent from regiment for time will make way down to tour let mother know marquis be dead get to write memorial to king requesting permission to leave convent then when marwill arrives in paris will get to present ronald agreed to malcolm proposal next morning having obtained leave of absence from colonel malcolm mounted rode for tour message be duly conveyed to countess by jeanne together with ronald earnest request that mother must again meet sent back by jeanne memorial have asked to write to king begging that might be allowed to leave convent refused to agree to wish to meet bidding jeanne say now seemed there be really hope of release shortly must le than ever risk step if discovered might prejudice plan although disappointed ronald must not deny that decision be wise one therefore contented by sending word that have obtained one very powerful friend that hoped that must ere long receive good tidings after short stay at tour ronald malcolm returned to paris where series of brilliant fete in honour of victory of fontenoy be in preparation tournay have surrendered few day after battle governor of town having accepted heavy bribe to open gate for place must have resisted for month allied army be ready to recommence hostility in order to relieve after surrender fell back resumed defensive attitude king therefore returned at once to paris marshal saxe handing over command of army to marshal de noailles followed by easy stage delighted above thing at success gained over english who have for century be victorious in battle in england france have met a enemy citizen of paris organized succession of brilliant fete be responded to by entertainment of kind at versailles scottish dragoon be still at front colonel hume have be brought to paris a must be time ere must be able again to take command of regiment ronald called at house where colonel lodged upon day after return from tour found that have arrived upon previous day ronald be at once shown up on sending in name colonel be lying on couch when entered how be colonel be going on a well a possible ronald found ball got out day before left regiment will do well now have be carried on litter way by eight of trooper good fellow be a gentle with a if have be child scarce felt jar whole distance what have got to do now be to lie quiet doctor promise that in six week time will be fit to mount horse again marshal saxe sent yesterday evening to inquire after will send to to thank for so sending to inquire on part how be going on message will be good excuse for presenting ronald found antechamber of marshal crowded with noble officer who have come to pay respect to victorious general who be next to king at moment most popular man in france hitherto a protestant foreigner maurice of saxony have be regarded by many with jealousy dislike victory have won for french arm have for first time obliterated feeling save admiration gratitude presently marshal came out from inner room with dauphin who have called on part of king to inquire after health be now able to walk excitement of battle satisfaction of victory having enabled partially to shake off disease afflicted after dauphin have left marshal made tour of apartment exchanging few word with present ah be there young leslie said familiarly when came to ronald where have be have not seen since day when galloped about with message through english fire a if have charmed life colonel hume gave leave sir to travel on private business be now bearer of message from thanking for kind inquiry a to wound bid say that trust that own health be rapidly recovering a see leslie fontenoy have done wonder for a well a for france wait here will speak with again in hour most of caller took departure then marshal called ronald into inner room tomorrow said be going to pay respect to king at versailles will take with have mother memorial be right a father be killed at fontenoy there will hope be le difficulty over matter must not be too sanguine for there will be host of hungry competitor for estate of marquis will unite against however think king will be able to refuse first request when mother be out must put head together see about getting father release ronald expressed deep gratitude at marshal kindness say nothing about lad fortunately want nothing for be use being victorious general if one can not utilize in way so be quite glad to have something to ask king next day ronald presented at hotel of marshal saxe rode by side of carriage out to versailles king surrounded by brilliant train of courtier received marshal with greatest warmth after talking to for time retired with into private closet few minute later one of royal page came out into audience chamber said in loud voice that king desired presence of monsieur ronald leslie greatly embarrassed at finding centre of observation not unmingled with envy at summons ronald followed page into presence of king who be alone with marshal saxe louis who be in high good humour gave ronald hand to kiss saying told marshal to recall name to have done so now say that have boon to ask of yes sire marshal said please consider graciously that be who ask a well a majesty have always be gracious to if think deserving of mark of favour after success majesty have gained together must now crave that grant be granted before name marshal king said give royal word that be boon provided that be within bound of possibility be yours then sire ask that old comrade fellow soldier of mine who fought bravely for majesty who fell under majesty displeasure many year ago on account of marriage made contrary to pleasure may be released have now be over sixteen year in prison have therefore paid dearly for thwarting will wife have time be confined in convent be father mother of brave lad colonel leslie who commanded majesty regiment of scotch dragoon wife countess amelie of recambours ask majesty a boon that will order officer to be released lady to be allowed to leave convent peste marshal king said good temperedly request be one of will get into hot water with score of people from day marquis be killed at fontenoy have heard nothing question about estate believe that small portion of have be already promised say nothing about estate marshal replied a to majesty sense of justice be too well known for to be necessary for to say single word countess have estate of own inherited from mother even a to say nothing be liberty that of husband brave lad ask of majesty be granted marshal have boon be great one instead of small one must have granted a freely king again held out hand to ronald who bent on one knee to kiss tear of joy flowing down cheek preventing utterance of audible thanks for boon far surpassed expectation for marshal have said nothing a to intention of asking father freedom indeed only decided to do upon seeing in how favourable disposition have found king see marshal louis went on marriage like must be sternly discouraged order in kingdom must be done away with wilful girl headstrong soldier can not be permitted to arrange affair without reference to plan of parent in instance happened that father plan have received approval great estate of france can not be handed over to first comer who may perhaps be utterly unworthy of say that in present case colonel leslie be in way personally unworthy disposal of hand of great heiress of france be in king gift who cross be against authority king touched bell bade page who entered to order secretary to attend at once search register of state prison said tell where colonel leslie who be arrested by order sixteen year ago be confined then make out order to governor of prison for release also draw up order upon lady superior of paused convent of lady at tour ronald ventured to put in oh have discovered that eh king said with smile then turned again to secretary bidding suffer countess amelie de recambours to leave convent to proceed where will secretary bowed retired ronald seeing that own presence be no longer required said few word of deep gratitude to king retired to audience room where remained until ten minute later door of king closet opened king marshal saxe again appeared audience lasted for half hour then marshal accompanied by many of noble made way down to carriage ronald again mounted a soon a carriage have left great courtyard of palace rode up alongside poured out gratitude to marshal have be fontenoy marshal said smiling here be two order one for tour other for governor of royal castle at king made light of know manner so well that must see must rather that have asked for dukedom for be not often that king be thwarted regard parent a being rebel against authority however be bound by promise there be paper now only one word leslie indulge in hope that will see father more than shadow of stalwart soldier that be sixteen year ago there be few men indeed whose constitution enable to live through sixteen year confinement in state prison therefore prepare to find mere wreck trust freedom mother care may do much for expect too much at first if take advice will go first fetch mother in order that may be at hand to receive father when leaf fortress by way thought just a well not to produce mother memorial a seemed that must be able to do without for might have struck king to ask how obtained must probably have considered that communication with mother be fresh act of defiance against authority malcolm be wild with joy when ronald returned with account of interview with king successful result have not be seasoned head number of bumper drank that night in honour of marshal saxe must have rendered unfit for travel in morning ronald have after acquainting with news gone to colonel hume whose pleasure at hearing that former colonel comrade be to regain freedom be unbounded preparation be made for early start be sure look well to priming of pistol before put in holster tomorrow malcolm said do think will be necessary be sure of ronald news travel fast may be sure that by time fact that king have granted order for release of father mother be known to duke of chateaurouge if did not hear from king must be most likely to do a louis must probably lose time in explaining to that have only gone against wish because under circumstance be impossible for to refuse marshal request secretary who drew out document must no doubt let duke know of there be secret at court now that order for release have be granted ronald said duke can have motive in preventing being delivered for fresh one must of course be obtained in first place ronald duke will be so furious at success that will stick at nothing to have revenge in second place others for there be many interested in preventing mother from coming into father possession will consider that gain of time go for good deal be mover in matter be out of way document destroyed matter might rest a be for long time marshal be busy from morning till night must be long before missed must naturally suppose that have after obtaining release of parent retired with to country retreat even left kingdom must give ample time for working upon louis besides king might never inquire whether prisoner have be released then marshal might die be sent away to frontier therefore a see time be everything tell ronald consider journey be going to undertake tomorrow affair of greater danger than going into pitched battle will have to doubt everyone meet on road people at inn stop at may be attacked anywhere everywhere a to travelling by direct road look upon a impossible only chance be to throw off scent a know destination will be easy matter be astir by daylight malcolm soon brought horse round to door be comfort to know said that horse have passed night in barrack therefore have not be tampered with look well to buckle of girth ronald see that everything be strong in good order be not own horse malcolm be be one of trooper be one of best in regiment persuaded man to change with for week one be likely to notice difference a be a nearly a possible same colour horse be good enough for anything if must not keep up with speed must be useless now think can keep together if have to ride for have got in valise malcolm one must think that be going upon campaign have got four bottle of good wine bread meat enough to last for two day mean if can help to enter shop stop at inn till arrive at tour can make shift to sleep for tonight in wood must be safer thousand time than inn for will bet fifty to one if ventured to enter one must find one of horse lame on starting again oh come malcolm be too much duke of chateaurouge be not ubiquitous have not army to scatter over france no have not malcolm agreed from what know of doubt not that can lay hand on number of men who will stick at nothing to carry out order earn money paris swarm with discharged soldier ruffian of kind with plenty of gold to set machine in motion there be limit to number of men who might be hired for desperate deed a be talking be making way towards one of southern gate arrived there before opened have to wait few minute several other passenger on horseback foot be gathered there must bet crown piece malcolm said that one among crowd be on watch for before half hour duke of chateaurouge will know that have started chapter x perilous journey number of peasant with market cart be waiting outside gate for first few mile of ride road be dotted with people making way to city a rode malcolm discussed question of best road to be taken ronald be still in favour of pushing straight forward for be not so convinced a follower that serious attempt must be made to interrupt journey pointed out that road a far a orleans at least be one of most frequented in france that in city even most reckless must hardly venture to assault agree with ronald that road offer le opportunity for ambush than most others for country be flat well cultivated after dozen men with musket must lie in ambush in cornfield a well a wood fact that people be going along road count for little one way other for not one in fifty must venture to interfere if saw fray going on granting so far a orleans country be open cultivated beyond that be for most part forest above although may regard a possible that may be on guard may travel by other road be upon direct line that be sure to make most preparation for beyond that can only be chance work may go by one road by there may be one trap set on road once past that be safe after riding for upwards of hour came at turn of road upon two cart one have apparently broken down other have stopped that with might give assistance in repairing one cart be turned across road other filled rest of space stop malcolm exclaimed checking horse suddenly what be ronald asked in surprise turn back malcolm said sharply a wheeled horse round ronald without word did same galloped hundred yard down road be nearly caught there malcolm said why how do mean never mind now ronald turn sharp to right here make detour through field will soon see whether be right be shame riding through ripe corn ronald said a without further comment leaped horse over bank dashed off among golden grain stretched far wide on side of road have not gone fifty yard before heard loud shout a came abreast of where cart be standing several shot be fired ten twelve men be seen running through corn a if to cut off although heard whiz of bullet be too far off to be in much danger men on foot have chance of cutting off fact speedily perceived a one by one halted fired few hundred yard farther two horseman came round into road again pursued journey well what do think of ronald be ambush doubt malcolm what on earth made suspect saw nothing suspicious merely two cart in road with three four men doing something to one of wheel be in suspicious humour morning ronald be lucky be sight of two cart completely blocking road brought to halt at once a checked horse saw movement among bush on right of road felt sure that be ambush be well laid one too have ridden on must have be riddled with bullet doubt there be men lying in cart must have jumped up a came up to fellow in bush must have taken in rear between two fire chance must have be small indeed doubt have man on watch directly saw coming got cart across road took up position be well contrived scheme have have narrow escape thanks to quickness watchfulness malcolm have saved life admit that be right be wrong for own did not share apprehension a to danger of journey henceforth will be a much on lookout a be will look with suspicion at beggar woman may pas will be right to do so malcolm said seriously for present think that be safe doubt be main ambush may reasonably have felt certain of success however may be sure that did not rely solely upon doubt be unmounted portion of gang be to try put stop to journey at outset mounted men will have ridden on ahead especially a must have be sure that must follow road might have gone out by one of other gate at south side of town will have watched road now propose that take next lane branch off to right travel by byroad in future press horse too fast have long journey before must always have something in hand in case be necessary to press to full speed two mile further road branched to right a approached ronald be about to touch horse rein when malcolm said shortly ride straight on although surprised at sudden change of plan ronald obeyed without question what be for asked when have passed turning did not see that man lying down by heap of stone at corner yes saw what of have doubt be on lookout for yes thought so went on a stood up in stirrup looked back there do see that horse head in little thicket just side of where road separate expected a much if have turned off in two minute that fellow must have be galloping along road to take news to ahead must have ridden to cut off further along have doubt will find someone on watch at turning between orleans be regular campaign malcolm be campaign ronald ruffian thief of paris form sort of army have head whom implicitly obey who have money enough to set machine in motion can command service of number of men sharp fellow too many of be when received order to arrest journey to tour at cost must not omit single precaution must ensure success former attack upon result will have showed that be not child that enterprise be one demanded effort what be next move now malcolm will turn off before get to next road can see long way across level plain so will dismount lead horse corn be well nigh shoulder deep if choose spot where ground lie rather low that scoundrel behind one at next road be likely to see mile further there be slight dip in ground be good spot malcolm said depression extends far away on right although be very slight must not conceal if ground be bare will do so now so let take advantage of so saying dismounted leading horse turned into cornfield ronald followed for two mile kept straight on through corn then came upon narrow road connecting two village mounted turned horse head to south be a well that none of peasant saw making through corn ronald said must have have upon with stone flail like swarm of angry bee must not be helped malcolm replied must easily have ridden away from however be just a well that have have bother with now will quicken pace be fairly between two of main road south if can contrive to make way by village track will at rate for time be free from risk of molestation must think must be free altogether ronald said when find come along road will suppose have be killed at first ambush malcolm shook head build upon ronald doubt a soon a have passed of fellow mounted horse saw in cart rode off in accordance with agreed plan to give notice that have passed safely be proceeding by road in next place fellow saw on watch must most likely after time mount follow when got to watcher at next crossroad found that have not come along there must know that must have turned off to right left one of be doubtless before on way to next party with news while other have set to work to find out where turned off will be easy enough to discover still have gained something may fairly reckon that if ride briskly there be fear of who be posted along road have left cutting off rode day at steady pace stopping occasionally for short time to allow horse rest feed people in quiet little village looked in surprise at young officer follower a rode through street stopped for quarter of hour while horse be fed for even malcolm agreed that such pause be unattended by danger be rarely indeed that stranger passed along bypath peasant wondered among what must induce to travel by country byway instead of following main road a left rich plain of beauce country be le carefully cultivated field of corn be no longer continuous presently came to tract of uncultivated land with patch of wood now left little road have be following rode straight across country avoiding village crossed several hill late in afternoon drew rein in wide spreading forest be malcolm thought quite a far south a orleans by starting at daylight must arrive at tour by midday here at least be perfectly safe said when approach tour peril will begin again when once find that have given slip be not likely to try to intercept anywhere along route till near town for will know that chance be enormous against doing so party along various road will push on so a to meet somewhere near city river can only be crossed at certain point will feel sure will go by one other of suppose will ronald said ronald idea be that turn west ride to le man then take wide detour enter tour from south side will take day longer be of little consequence think that will in way entirely outwit only precaution will have to take be to cross main road on right at point remote from town village think be capital plan mind share of fair fighting to be shot down suddenly in ambush like of morning own have little fancy for hobbling horse turned loose to pick up what must in forest then sat down to enjoy good meal from ample supply malcolm have brought with when night fell unstrapped cloak from saddle rolled in lay down to sleep hour later be roughly awakened being seized by three men who before must attempt to offer resistance bound arm to side then hurried along through forest have be fool ronald malcolm said bitterly ought to have kept watch be not fault malcolm one must never have guessed that must have found in forest somebody must have followed at distance marked down brought rest upon even have kept watch must have be good for must have shot down before must make resistance wonder did cut throat at once malcolm said know what be troubling to make prisoner for presently saw light in forest ahead of soon arrived at spot where number of men be sitting round fire have trouble with pierre suppose captain slept a soundly a mole have be speaking strange language a came along thank god malcolm exclaimed fervently think after ronald have only fallen in with band of robber not with enemy unbind hand captain of band said first take away sword pistol gentleman may ask to be seated then perhaps will inform officer in scotch dragoon a perceive by uniform be doing here in forest ronald to whom question be principally addressed replied frankly took to forest fancy for same reason for use namely for safety be on way to tour there be people who have interest in preventing arriving there made one attempt to stop near paris fortunately that failed must not be now enjoying society a be likely that attempt must be made upon road thought better to leave altogether take to forest for night what interest must anyone have in preventing officer of king from arriving at man asked doubtfully be rather long story ronald said if be of interest to will be happy to relate may mention that there be three bottle of good wine in valise of one of saddle story be none worse for such accompaniment laugh went round circle at ronald coolness man stepped forward with two saddle have carried from spot when captive have be seized wine be taken out opened yes captain of band said after tasting wine be good now let have story ronald gave outline of history told how father mother have be for many year imprisoned for marrying contrary to king pleasure how have at last obtained royal order for release how enemy of parent be now trying to prevent from having order carried out there be order ronald said a concluded taking from inner pocket where carried see be addressed to abbess of convent of lady at tour to governor of blois story tell be singular one captain replied doubt not truth what be name of father be colonel leslie commanded same regiment to belong remember one of band said regiment be quartered together nigh twenty year ago at flanders be in paris at time when be imprisoned be in next barrack to scotchman remember what stir made regiment be very nigh mutinying remember too though can not recall name malcolm said rising looking hard at speaker if mistake not have cracked many flask together made many raid on hen roost of flemish farmer name be malcolm anderson remember well other said rising giving hand of course met score of time for regiment be generally brigaded together that confirms story altogether monsieur captain of band said from moment consider prisoner longer may say that have expectation of booty in case be captured rather from curiosity than from other reason one of men afternoon happened to see ride into wood then dismount make preparation for passing night there reported matter to know that gentleman of cloth may say of mine for be once officer of majesty though left service somewhat hastily smiled on account of unfortunate deficiency in fund of regiment in happened at time to be acting a paymaster be seldom burdened with spare cash incident seemed so strange that determined to capture question if happen to have more cash on than care about carrying will be glad to purchase few bottle of wine equal to have given if not can assure that press matter be obliged to for courtesy ronald said a at present really happen to be somewhat flush of cash be happy to contribute ten louis for laudable purpose mention so saying took out purse counted out ten piece handed to captain action be received with round of applause for robber have not from first anticipated obtaining booty worth speaking of turn affair have taken have altogether driven idea of gain from mind thank warmly sir captain said promise will tomorrow despatch messenger to orleans be ten mile away will lay out money in liquor with will tomorrow night drink health success in enterprise nay more if like dozen of men will accompany on road to tour have for various reason need not enter into marked objection to passing through town a far a blois be at service thank for offer ronald replied will not accept a intend to ride tomorrow morning to le man then to enter tour from south side by will throw enemy completely off scent why do not go to blois first man asked be on way to tour wish mother to be present at release of father so long confinement may well have broken down now that see how obstinately bent enemy be upon destruction will take with two three stout fellow from tour to act a escort what day will be leaving there man asked today be tuesday ronald said on thursday will be at tour on friday morning will leave very well man replied will be on road be difference to where be a well there a here will have men scattered along in forest between blois amboise if find that there be suspicious party along road will catch if be attacked will find that be close at hand to help be generous fellow story have interested gentleman of wood be obliged to live whatever law say if can do good action to anybody plea a well a others be greatly obliged to ronald said can promise anyhow that time will be not altogether thrown away soon afterwards whole band lay down round fire be sound asleep in morning malcolm saddled two horse after hearty adieu from captain follower of whom be discharged soldier who have be driven to take up life from inability to support in other way started for le man town reached late in afternoon without adventure deeming in highest degree improbable that watch must be set for at place so far from line of travel put up for night at principal inn in morning again started after riding for distance to south made wide sweep crossing river entered tour from south late in evening again put up at principal inn for although doubted not that arrival must be noticed by emissary of enemy have fear of molestation in town like tour on following morning ronald presented at entrance to convent wish to see lady superior said to lay sister at wicket be bearer of communication to from king be left waiting for few minute outside gate then wicket door opened sister requested to follow not soul be to be seen a traversed gloomy court passed through several corridor to room where abbess be waiting in silence handed to king order abbess opened read majesty command will be obeyed said in hour countess will be in readiness to depart carriage will be in waiting at gate to receive ronald said bowing then without word retired malcolm be awaiting outside at once went to officer of royal post engaged carriage post horse to take to blois carriage be at door at appointed time few minute later gate opened countess in travelling attire issued out in moment be clasped in son arm at once handed into carriage took place beside malcolm closed door leapt up on box postilion cracked whip carriage moved off can be true ronald be dreaming be week since be here last news of release came upon with surprise do know fainted be really free be possible have seen last of hateful wall seems like dream where be going be going to blois to prison countess exclaimed there be guard escort be going oh ronald be going to see husband yes mother be going not only to see to release have king order in pocket for time countess be unable to speak joy be too great for word then tear came to relief sobbed out exclamation of joy gratitude ronald said nothing until have somewhat recovered calmness then told manner in marshal saxe have obtained two order of release will pray for night morning to last day of life countess said god be indeed good to have hoped from what said that term of imprisonment be drawing to end have looked forward to long struggle to endless effort petition before must obtain father release with perhaps failure in end not for one moment did dream that such happiness a awaited ronald now thought wise to repeat warning marshal have given mother dear said must be prepared to find that total change will have taken place in father imprisonment have be very different one to yours have have companion certain amount of freedom comfort have have people to speak to have known what be going on in world have be cut off altogether from mankind can not even know whether be alive whether may not have yielded to pressure must be sure to be brought upon acquiesced in divorce being obtained have doubtless be kept in narrow cell deprived almost of air light of heaven will be greatly changed mother will not be like for doe not seem to that have changed much from what be must not see much that night on terrace now see can hardly believe that be mother so young do look be nearly forty countess said smiling be past twenty one when married have not be of age must have pronounced marriage null void be right ronald will prepare to find father greatly changed can not be otherwise after have gone through so have again be enough for matter how great change may have taken place in who be men countess exclaimed a quarter of mile outside town four men on horseback took up place two on side of carriage be alarmed mother be escort malcolm hired at le man be old soldier can be relied on in case of necessity what need can there be for ronald have heard that band of discharged soldier others make travelling insecure have idea that be necessary to have armed escort not absolutely necessary mother useful measure of precaution heard of a came through from paris malcolm agreed that a must have with jewel valuable that took to convent must be just a well to be in position to beat off who might be disposed to trouble a see have brought with malcolm horse mine will now mount le weight horse have to draw better will get in have talk from time to time where road happens to be good to tell truth jolting shaking be pleasant good for talking be expecting to be attacked ronald countess said be sure must not be wanting to get out leave so soon after have met did not anticipate danger frankly mother then do think be probable that attempt may be made to stop that not by regular robber by enemy did best to prevent from reaching tour will now most likely try to prevent arriving at blois will tell about when get there tonight here be order for father release will hide in dress have rather not have about mother if must be attacked be alarmed for have reason to believe that if must be outnumbered hard pressed help will speedily be forthcoming be not in least afraid for countess said be careful ronald remember have only just found for sake expose unnecessarily will take care of said know have always have to do so malcolm have already mounted horse ronald be really glad when took place beside few yard ahead of carriage art of road making carriage building be still in infancy when weather be fine ground hard fair rate of progress must be maintained in wet weather vehicle often sank almost up to axle in mud hole quagmire bumping jolting be terrible now take up work of looking out for ambush again malcolm will not be quite same thing now malcolm said before two three men with gun behind wall might do business now will have to make regular attack have doubt that be watched from time entered town that news that be travelling with countess in carriage with escort of four armed men have be carried on ahead already be by horseman that will be attacked today if be attacked at will probably fall upon in forest beyond amboise will know that with vehicle must keep road that a can not travel more than six mile hour at outside can not attempt to escape by speed do think have better wait at amboise for night go on to orleans tomorrow no think have better push straight on especially a told friend in forest that must come today feel sure will keep promise to be on lookout to aid if be not for must have said let stay at tour for present for may expect to be attacked by force much superior to own why must not have sent down more than six men to attack two malcolm if have be sure road must travel a did know that may have have small party at dozen spot will now be united probably there may be score of however rely on robber captain meant what said won goodwill of men if there be dozen horseman anywhere along road be sure to know of will have doubt post close at hand so a to be ready to join in fray a soon a commences amboise be reached without adventure here horse in carriage be changed party proceeded on way four mile further entered great forest ronald now ordered two of men to ride few yard in front of horse head rode on side of coach other two followed close behind ordered driver in case be attacked to jump off instantly run to horse head keep quiet during fray vigilant lookout be kept suddenly when be in thickest part of wood number of mounted men dashed out from side in obedience to order ronald have given men in front behind at once closed in so that there be three on side of carriage assailant fired pistol a dashed down bullet flew harmlessly by while fire of defender sitting quietly on horse be more accurate two of assailant falling dead while be severely wounded moment later sword be drawn furious combat ensued ronald have told men to keep close to carriage so that must not be attacked in rear keeping just far enough out on side of to be able to use sword for short time defender of coach maintained position number of assailant giving slight advantage a be unable to utilize force ronald ran first man who attacked through body laid open face of next with sweeping blow from left to right men have hired fought stoutly be being pressed together a assailant urged forward horse when suddenly volley of firearm be heard several of assailant fell dead with loud shout number of men rushed out from wood fell upon in rear assailant turned to fly be now turn of defender of coach to attack did furiously in two three minute be over five six only of assailant cut way through footman who have attacked in rear while twelve lay dead dying on ground ronald first impulse be to ride up to carriage to assure mother of safety next to leap off horse grasp hand of chief of robber have kept promise nobly said arrived at very nick of time be beginning to press hotly though fancy must have rendered account of good many more must have be beaten in end be farther behind than intended to be man said be obliged to keep in hiding little distance behind there be four party of kept in sight yesterday last night assembled mile two away have men watching night morning followed here saw take up position on side of road crept up a closely a dared without being observed have for couple of minute to bear brunt of alone thank most heartily ronald said mother will thank so saying led to door of carriage opened mother told that if be attacked relied upon help being near at hand owe life for have doubt yours a well a mine must have be taken to brave man follower thank most sincerely sir countess said at present feel like one in dream for have be so long out of world scene a have well nigh bewildered be only too glad to have be of service man said a stood bareheaded be not good man madame be one of whom necessity of time have driven to earn living a can without much regard to law trust have not quite lost instinct a gentleman be only too glad to have be able to be of slight assistance to persecuted lady for son other night related to something of treatment have have to endure with bow now stepped back follower be engaged in searching pocket of fallen found in store of money spoke well for liberality of employer well satisfied robber for work have undertaken after few word with son countess opened small bag carried with taking from valuable diamond brooch called leader of band up presented to ronald party then remounted horse robber have already overtaken caught of fallen assailant driver mounted box after cordial farewell to rescuer party proceeded on way to blois chapter xi free be late at night before blois be reached having alighted at aigle d'or engaged private room even duke of chateaurouge will be satisfied ronald said that scheme have failed that more can be done just at present will be bitter blow to when scoundrel on return to paris report utter failure for must have considered impossible that must escape from toil have laid for only wish that have clear evidence that be author of attempt if so must go straight with marshal saxe lay accusation against before king however certain may feel about have really nothing to connect with affair must be madness to accuse king favourite unless one must prove absolutely truth of what one say however hope day that will get even with will not be fault if night ronald mother debated what must be best way to proceed in morning finally agreed that malcolm must present at prison with order of release that must remain at hotel to malcolm must bring colonel leslie after breaking to news that wife son be awaiting shock in case of sudden liberty must be severe one meeting with attached comrade must act a preparation for with wife mother son sat hand in hand after hearing carriage drive off with malcolm next morning in hour have spent together have come to know other relationship have become real one have scarce be able to make out other feature at midnight meeting on terrace at meeting rejoiced a be there be still feeling of strangeness between now knew other a be be well satisfied countess be le strange to ronald than be to malcolm have already described to a knew eighteen year before reality agreed closely with ideal ronald have pictured to except that be younger brighter for in thinking of have told over over again that must have grown much older that hair might have turned gray with grief trouble spirit be altogether broken on part have be able to form idea a to what infant have last seen must have grown up be not even sure that be in existence have hoped that if have lived must have grown up like father although now saw slight resemblance between be indeed well satisfied with son be not thought a handsome a father bade fair to surpass in strength stature be delighted with manly bearing when laughed reminded her of husband thought that read in gray eye firm mouth steadfastness depth of character equal to spoke little now be too anxious ronald for mother sake rather than own be prepared to find unknown father man broken down by year of captivity although mother said that too be prepared for great change must not think that reality must be sad shock to in little over hour carriage drove into courtyard be brave mother ronald said a felt hand held in own tremble violently must be calm for sake step be heard approaching door opened malcolm entered with man leaning on arm countess with cry of joy sprang forward next moment be clasped in husband arm at last love at last said ronald drew aside to window to leave father mother to enjoy first rapture of meeting undisturbed while malcolm slipped quietly from room again why amelie leslie said at last holding at arm length that might look better at be scarce changed doe not seem to that be five year older than when saw last yet malcolm tell that too have be prisoner how much love have cost dear be scarce changed while have become old man hair be a white a snow be so crippled with rheumatism can scarce move limb be not so much changed angus hair be white face be very pale be not so much changed if have suffered for love dear what have suffered for mine have be prisoner in way have certain amount of freedom in cage while stopped yes have be hard said kept up spirit amelie never lost hope that day must be reunited now angus here be boy to whom owe liberty joy of meeting may well be proud of such son be proud leslie said a ronald advanced took in arm god bless boy have performed well nigh miracle malcolm have be telling of call in again be right that to whom owe so much must share in happiness ronald at once fetched malcolm until late at night talked of have happened during so many year colonel leslie have passed first three year of confinement in chatelet be well be no longer said for even hard a be with year of soldiering must not have stood that much longer cell there be below level of river wall be damp be there got rheumatism have crippled ever since then moved to blois there cell be in one of turret sun shone in through window slit for hour day besides for hour once week be allowed to take what called exercise on wall between turret next governor be not bad fellow did not try to pocket best part of money allowed for keep of prisoner fortunately never lost hope have done so must have thrown over parapet ended at once felt sure that too be shut up amelie pictured to myself how must try to make give up never thought must succeed dear knew too well for sometimes for month lay a if paralysed by rheumatism think must have died if have not known how enemy must have rejoiced at news of death so held on stoutly have got reward hardship have told tale although same age a malcolm anderson colonel leslie looked fully ten year older long confinement have taken tinge of colour out of face left almost ghastly in whiteness must with difficulty lift hand to head walked a stiffly a if leg have be jointless voice only have not lost cheery ring wife remembered amelie said when remarked kept tongue in practice be one member be free after have be confined few month struck that be rapidly losing power of speech determined that if must not talk for want of someone to answer must at least sing having good store of song scottish french sang for hour together at first somewhat to uneasiness of prison authority who thought must not be so merry unless have communication from without be planning escape at last grew accustomed to a voice must not travel through thick wall of cell annoyed one did never think of escaping first few year of confinement be always thinking of ronald nothing ever came of thought have tool to burrow through four foot wall if must have done so must have tried if have only be to give something to do have not be that hoped day to obtain release that attempt at escape must if discovered a be almost certain to be decrease chance not word be said that evening a to future plan thought being in past next morning colonel leslie said at breakfast now what be going to do next how do stand know more than do angus know whether king have gifted mother estate to others a assuredly have done father land if have have be thinking that best plan will be to ask king permission to leave kingdom return to native scotland be very fond of scotland amelie have also fondness for living how must live in scotland have not most remote idea estate there be small one be forfeited thirty year ago so unless become gaberlunzie sit on step of st andrew asking for alms see how must get porridge to say nothing of anything else amelie seems to that must stop in france for very shame can not let daughter of marquis de recambours starve must at least restore corner of parent estate if be farm how be off for fund at present asked with laugh hope at least have enough to pay hotel bill have forty louis in cash father remains of hundred committed to malcolm with be that so exclaimed can say be that money have lasted longer than ever passed through finger before have plenty of money countess said quietly have jewel came to from mother sale will keep for year either in scotland france be good indeed colonel said cheerily yes took with when be sent to convent have parted with none save diamond necklet gave to girl who brought ronald together a parting keepsake brooch with rewarded men who aided in forest seriously angus must settle upon something quite agree with amelie what be something to be must think angus that proper thing must be for to write to king thanking for release asking command petitioning that mother estate may be restored to will also ask permission to retire to southern town where there be water may do good to rheumatism colonel leslie frowned suppose be right thing to do amelie though for part can not thank sovereign whom have served well after such treatment a have received must rather beg bread from door to door must not ask angus of course be differently placed have right a peeress of france besides have on own account complaint against king be father who shut up in convent not king by way amelie husband said be not yet in mourning do intend to be said firmly unless have to go to court thread of mourning do put on father behaved like tyrant to will not feign grief at event have brought happiness well ronald what do think have best be done malcolm have managed so well that have best leave for to decide think what propose be best think have better travel down to place near where mother estate lay then write petition to king will leave there return with to paris will there consult colonel hume marshal saxe a to how must be delivered to king plan be carried out party journeyed together to poitier there having seen parent comfortably settled in small house near town remained with few day ronald with malcolm returned to paris bearing with mother memorial to king ronald be glad to find colonel hume be now recovered from wound marshal saxe too be better latter at once took charge of petition said that must hand to king on first opportunity ronald accompanied marquis several time to versailles latter have private audience with king thought better not to present memorial in public one day however be called into king closet when emerged with king ronald thought from expression of countenance that thing have not gone well on leaving palace mounted horse for be now well enough to ride a set out called ronald who with other gentleman have accompanied to ride beside thing have not gone well said father enemy have evidently be at work have be poisoning king mind read memorial then said harshly 'the countess of recambours have forfeited right to mother estate by marrying alien land of france be for king of france subject not for soldier of fortune ' touched said 'your majesty may recollect that be alien soldier of fortune methinks that in time of war sword of soldier of fortune have done such thing for france that have earned right to gratitude in hundred battle scottish troop have fought in front rank have not be for irish brigade must not have have to write fontenoy down among list of french victory be bold marshal king said angrily be bold sire replied because be in right humbly submit that brave soldier like colonel leslie deserves better treatment than have received at hand of france king rose at once answer to petition will be sent to tomorrow marshal bowed without word king left closet entered room of audience however lad must not look so downcast must perhaps expect more first time of course man who have hope who have relation who have hope of obtaining grant of mother estate be interested in exciting king displeasure against besides there be a have told duc de chateaurouge who may be regarded a personal enemy of father who have king ear a much a anyone about however must have courage consider personal honour be touched in matter now will not let matter drop till justice be done at appointed time ronald again called at marshal saxe hotel watched gay crowd of officer noble who be gathered in reception room hour later royal attendant entered handed document to marshal latter glanced at looked around a soon a eye fell upon ronald nodded to here be judgement said in low tone a handed paper see be directed to countess to care suppose will start with at once yes marshal horse be saddled will leave immediately hurry horse marshal said with slight smile from king manner think that content be such that few hour delay in delivery will cause countess pain however anticipate anything very harsh in first place although king be swayed by favourite who work on prejudice intention be always to be just in second place after granting release of parent a boon to can scarcely annul boon by severe sentence will tell countess from that be wholly at service must opportunity offer may be sure will do what can to incline king favourably towards lastly leslie take care of change in king manner show that have powerful enemy now that have succeeded in obtaining parent freedom have become dangerous remember attack be made upon before when there seemed little chance that must ever succeed in obtaining release in seriously threatening interest of who be looking forward to reversion of family estate enmity now when only need change in king mood to do justice to parent will be far greater than before bid father too to have care for mother remember that violence be common enough there be few inquiry made attack upon lonely house murder of within be

hume said sternly young friend will not fight in palace ground protest against being forced into duel at at rate will not fight here duke looked for moment a if be about to spring upon colonel hume saw by face that companion also be against for consequence of drawing sword within precinct of palace be so serious that even most powerful noble shrank from braving very well said at last thrusting sword back into scabbard be ten minute walk to boundary wall will let live till then so saying started off with rapid stride down walk followed at slower pace by rest chapter xii end of quarrel be serious business leslie colonel said in low voice if have be anyone must have ordered to barrack at once under pain of arrest have laid matter before king for must have be nothing short of murder can trust to hold own even against duke of chateaurouge in truth after what have be said see that can do other meet must not avoid if must ronald said insult to disturb have father wrong to avenge colonel

of sailing for scotland on own account be told that plan of be known to five six person if get safely through business mount ride thither at speed be more likely to pursue towards frontier northern port will not think have made for nantes if get there before prince have sailed present to join expedition king will be furious at first at loss of favourite breaking of edict must come round gentleman here with duke be honourable men be must see shocked at insult duke passed on therefore can rely upon to join in representing matter in true light to king before return matter will have blown over may be that removal of father most powerful enemy may facilitate arrangement in case dear boy can rely upon marshal to look after interest have now reached wicket gate in wall of park duke be standing few pace distant having already removed coat turned up shirt sleeve of sword arm will act a second marquis said to one of gentleman latter bowed coldly act a second to friend leslie colonel hume said call upon gentleman to bear witness in future that encounter have be wantonly forced upon by duc de chateaurouge cornet leslie a man of honour have alternative to accept challenge forced upon ronald have by time stripped to shirt sleeve second took two sword compared length be found to be a nearly a possible same be then returned to owner piece of even turf be selected position chosen in light be equally favourable to party then fell into position on guard a rapier crossed colonel hume said solemnly may god defend right instant later be engaged in deadly conflict lasted few second duke conscious of own skill believing that have lad to deal with at once attacked eagerly desirous of bringing contest to termination before there be chance of interruption attacked then carelessly eagerly made furious lunge thought must terminate encounter at once ronald did not give way inch parrying in carte slipped blade round that of duke feinted in tierce then rapidly disengaging lunged in carte a before blade passed through body of adversary lunge be given with such force that pommel of sword struck against rib duke fell inert mass upon ground a ronald withdrew rapier exclamation of surprise alarm broke from three gentleman who have accompanied duke while colonel hume said gravely god have protected right ah here come horse mount ride leslie spare spur must advise said drawing aside to take northern route for few mile so a to throw off scent when get to nantes search inn till find duke of athole be intimate friend of mine be from learned in strict secrecy of prince intention show ring know well tell sent to join say nothing at first a to business here own name name will be enough will introduce to prince charlie who will be with under disguised name may god bless lad will do best for here at moment malcolm arrived with two horse thank god be safe ronald exclaimed a ronald leapt into saddle with word of thanks adieu to colonel dashed off at full speed colonel hume then rejoined group gathered round duke scottish officer be looking very grave courtier even more so have from first recognized fully that duel have be provoked by duke have accompanied reluctantly for regarded approaching conflict a so unfair that must excite strong amount of feeling against who have hand in matter a to edict against duelling have not concerned greatly a felt sure that with duke influence breach of law must be passed over with only show of displeasure on part of king order to absent for short time from court contingency that young scottish officer who have scarcely yet attained age of manhood must kill one of best swordsman in france have not occurred to have happened there must be doubt that king anger alike at loss of favourite at breach of law must fall heavily on concerned that prolonged exile from court be least evil must expect not word have be spoken after have on stooping over duke found that death have be instantaneous until colonel hume joined well gentleman said be bad business mean trouble for majesty will be vastly angry however duke brought upon be only person to blame character be pretty well known will be manifest that if have made up mind to fight remonstrance on part must have availed to induce to abstain from doing so at same time king will not in first burst of anger take into consideration for awhile will doubt of suffer from displeasure think that will be lasting duke forced on duel must have fought within royal park have not interfered be in way forced to be present propose that return to palace give notice of what have occurred captain forbes a be not present at affair will not therefore be called upon to give account of will remain here until send down to fetch body will if please gentleman walk slowly for mile that leslie can put between versailles be very important news will reach king ear very shortly after have made public marquis a second in affair be sure to be sent for first a fortunately be present at quarrel be in position to testify that duke brought fate upon that there be preventing duel have refused to act be in frame of mind must have driven to fight without second if none have be forthcoming lastly can testify that combat be fair one that duke fell in consequence of rashness of attack contempt for adversary although in point of fact can tell that young leslie be so good swordsman be confident result must in case have be same suppose there be nothing else for marquis grumbled must prepare for prolonged visit to country estate will doubt be placed under arrest for time colonel hume said regiment will probably be packed off to frontier again however thing make much difference in long run what be most anxious about marquis be that majesty must thoroughly comprehend leslie be not to blame that affair be so forced upon that be impossible for to avoid there be much more than lad own safety dependent on may be sure colonel will do justice at slow pace party proceeded until neared palace when quickened step marquis proceeded immediately to apartment occupied by duke told domestic that master have be killed in duel directed to obtain assistance proceed at once to spot where body must be found colonel went to king surgeon told of what have taken place death be instantaneous said sword passed right through believe touched heart however will be a well that must go see body a king will be sure to ask particular a to wound rest of party joined acquaintance told what have happened news spread quickly through palace created great sensation breach of edict be not unfrequent death of so powerful noble chief favourite too of king took altogether out of ordinary category of such event more so since duke reputation a swordsman duellist be so great that men must scarce believe that have be killed by young officer who have just joined regiment seemed like story of david goliath over again quarter of hour later court official approached colonel hume marquis de vallecourt who be standing together surrounded by number of courtier officer monsieur le marquis colonel hume said saluting regret to say that be bearer of order of majesty that will deliver sword that will then accompany to king presence two gentleman handed over sword to official followed to king presence louis be pacing angrily up down apartment what be hear gentleman exclaimed a entered breach of edict here at versailles almost in boundary of park that duc de chateaurouge one of most valued officer friend have be killed tell that acted a second in affair have told majesty truth marquis said think that much a regret what have happened must scarcely have acted otherwise than did duke drew in first place within limit of park must have fought out quarrel there have not may almost say forcibly intervened then strode away towards boundary of park calling upon antagonist to follow have not gone encounter must have taken place without second witness might then have be called murder instead of duel must have arrested sir king exclaimed for drawing in park perhaps must have done so sire must please to remember that duke of chateaurouge be of temper not to be crossed believe that bloodshed must have taken place have endeavoured to thwart enjoyed majesty favour forcible arrest with perhaps shedding of blood in royal demesne must have be scandal a grave a of duel how did come about king asked abruptly duke be walking with de lisle st aignan when suddenly came upon colonel hume with three of officer of regiment duke at once walked up to addressed colonel hume finding of companion be monsieur leslie addressed in term of so insulting nature that showed that have be waiting for meeting to provoke quarrel young officer replied perfectly calmly with what must call admirable spirit courage so infuriated duke that a have already have honour of telling majesty drew at once when interfered called upon to proceed forthwith outside park there settle quarrel most reluctantly accompanied determined to interfere at first blood drawn affair scarcely lasted for second duke threw furiously rashly upon lad for a majesty be aware be little more latter standing firm parried with admirable coolness in instant ran duke right through body have always heard king said that duke be one of best swordsman in army majesty have heard correctly colonel hume replied young leslie be one of best swordsman in france duke passion rashness led to speedy termination of duel have fought with accustomed coolness believe that leslie must have turned out conqueror be cause of quarrel why must duc de chateaurouge fix dispute a tell did upon officer of yours believe sire that be long standing quarrel duke word showed that bore enmity against lad father that be on account that insulted son leslie king exclaimed with sudden recollection be that youth whom marshal saxe presented to same sire lad who distinguished at fontenoy whom marshal afterwards appointed to commission in regiment in have served a gentleman volunteer for nearly year leslies be always causing trouble king said angrily have already given order that will be arrested wherever be found will be punished a deserves in punishing colonel hume said with grave deference be sure that majesty will not forget that quarrel be forced upon have accepted insult of duke of chateaurouge must have be unworthy to remain officer of majesty silence sir king said angrily will return immediately to paris under arrest until pleasure in case be notified to will at once give order that troop here be replaced by of regiment whose officer will abstain from brawling breaking edict in very palace marquis will retire at once to estate two gentleman bowed left royal presence not worse than expected marquis said after door have closed behind now will send for st aignan de lisle will hear account a can not tally with ours king must see that duke brought fate upon louis be not unjust when temper cool down in few week will meet again here expect to be on frontier with regiment before colonel hume replied a must rather be there than in paris will be hardship colonel hume at once mounted rode back to paris proceeded straight to hotel of marshal saxe to whom communicated what have occurred if leslie get safely away will perhaps turn out for best marshal said a soon a king anger dy out will begin to plead cause of boy parent now that influence of chateaurouge other way be withdrawn may hope for more favourable hearing a to lad will make peace in few month king be brave a showed when under fire at fontenoy admires bravery in others when have once got over loss of chateaurouge will appreciate skill courage lad showed in encounter with one of most noted duellist in france now too that duke have gone of story to disadvantage of there be so many current be likely to meet king ear hitherto one have ventured to speak word against so powerful favourite king eye will soon be open now will become ashamed of so long having given countenance to man who be generally regarded a having not only killed dozen men in duel a having procured removal by unfair mean of score of others when know truth king be likely to do justice not only to young leslie to parent only hope that will not manage to overtake lad before reach frontier for although can rely on king justice when be cool must not answer for just at present a ronald rode off at full speed with malcolm related to whole circumstance of quarrel subsequent duel be well done ronald made sure that sooner later duke must get to blow be if did not adopt other mean to get removed from path anyhow be heartily glad be over that most dangerous enemy of father be out of way now must hope that sha'nt be overtaken before get to frontier danger be that order for arrest will be passed by signal be not going to frontier malcolm be only riding way to throw off scent be going to nantes well be not bad plan malcolm said be not so likely to send order there a to northern port will not be easy to get vessel to cross for see now that be at war with england there be little communication however will doubt be able to arrange with smuggler to take across be not going to england malcolm be going direct to scotland colonel hume have told secret prince charles have gone down to nantes be going to cross at once to scotland what alone without army malcolm exclaimed in astonishment suppose despair of getting assistance from louis now that fontenoy have put end to danger on frontier king of france be no longer interested in raising trouble for george at home be mad scheme of prince malcolm said gravely if father did not succeed in how can expect to succeed now country have have longer time to get sick of hanoverian gallantry of enterprise will appeal to people besides malcolm be not so sure that will not do better coming alone than if brought fifteen thousand men have at dunkirk last year with fifteen thousand men must not win kingdom many who must join if came alone must not do so if came backed by army of foreigner be french will remember who ruined grandfather cause in ireland arrogance interference disgusted irish troop never did fighting to speak of for must thousand time rather follow prince charles fighting with army of scotsman for crown of scotland than fight for with french army against englishman well perhaps be right ronald went against grain at fontenoy for after a said be closely akin in blood language to english although scotland france have always be ally be very little good france have ever done have always be glad enough to get king to make war on england whenever wanted diversion made have never put out of way to return favour have be one sided alliance along scotland have for century be sending of best blood to fight a soldier in france with few exception frenchman have ever drawn sword for scotland be inclined to think be right ronald especially after what saw at fontenoy have wish ever to draw sword again against english be willing to be best friend in world with if will let scot have own king go away peacefully want to force prince charles upon if will let have for ourselves if wo know be who be responsible for quarrel not be one way of putting certainly ronald laughed be afraid after having be one kingdom since king james went to london wo let go own way without making effort to keep here be crossroad will strike off here make for west avoided town on route for although felt certain that be ahead of messenger who might be sent out with order for arrest knew that might be detained for little time at nantes be therefore anxious to leave clue of passage in direction on evening of third day after starting approached destination on first morning after leaving versailles have halted in wood short distance from chartres malcolm have ridden in alone have purchased suit of citizen clothes for ronald a latter uniform a officer of scotch dragoon

vendee story repeated at inn where put up at nantes next morning malcolm went round to inn in town must hear nothing of duke of athole so returned at noon with news of want of success may have hired

did at preston in defeat ruin however lad here be will go through with to end by time get back to france must hope that king louis will have got over killing of favourite however tell frankly that hope be that when highland chief see that prince have come without arm without men without even promise of support by france will refuse to risk liberty life to bring ruin upon people by joining in mad brained adventure hope not malcolm ronald said a looked at prince a be pacing up down deck with duke of athole talking rapidly face flushed with enthusiasm clustering hair blown backward by wind

heard from prince that have come alone unattended refused to have anything to do with enterprise asserted be rash to point of insanity must bring ruin destruction on who took part in prince employed effort to persuade old chief in vain latter returned to isle in boat while doutelle pursued voyage to mainland entered bay of lochnanuagh in inverness shire immediately sent messenger to clanranald who came on board shortly with macdonald of kinloch moidart several other macdonalds received prince with greatest respect like macdonald of boisdale two chief refused to take up arm in enterprise believed to be absolutely hopeless in vain prince charles argued implored two chief remained firm until prince suddenly turned to younger brother of moidart who stood listening to conversation with finger clutching hilt of broadsword a heard young prince whom regarded a future king in vain imploring assistance of brother kinsman will at least not assist prince exclaimed will will ranald macdonald exclaimed though other man in highland will draw sword be ready to die for enthusiasm of young man be catching throwing to wind own conviction foreboding two macdonalds declared that also

interview clanranald be despatched by prince charles to see declined to join urging with truth that promise have given to join in rising be contingent upon prince arriving at head of strong french force with arm supply therefore refused at present to move others however be not so cautious fired by example of locheil by own tradition of loyalty to stuart cause many of lesser chief at once summoned follower to field with majority absence of french troop have exactly opposite effect that have have with sir alexander macdonald macleod have prince landed with french army might have stood aloof suffered to fight out quarrel unaided arrival alone unattended trusting solely wholly to loyalty of scottish people made irresistible appeal to generous feeling although there be probably few who did not foresee that failure ruin death must be result of enterprise embarked in cause with a much ardour a if success have be certain from borodale after disembarking scanty treasure of four thousand louis d'or have brought with few stand of arm from doutelle charles proceeded by water to kinloch moidart mr walsh sailed in doutelle after receiving prince warmest thanks letter to father in

have got musket so far there be cavalry artillery still know thing may come ronald laughed gaily at companion want of faith have now caught enthusiasm pervaded around be true that a yet prince adherent be handful be not to be expected that army must spring from ground promise of assistance have come from quarter if army be small one english army in scotland be little larger if first success

march reached corry arrack on th before sir john cope have commenced ascent a sir john saw that formidable position be in hand of enemy felt that must be in vain to endeavour to force zigzag must have to be carried in turn enterprise must be desperate one success must be of great advantage a highlander lightly clad active must make off defy pursuit defeat must be disastrous therefore called council of war asked officer to decide whether must be best to remain at dalwhinnie at foot of mountain to return to sterling to march to inverness where must be joined by well affected clan strongly urged last course believing that prince must not venture to descend into lowland while remained in rear council of war adopted opinion officer advocated remaining inactive at dalwhinnie one only supported

be good looking young fellow can see strong one wonder that wanted to mount white cockade lad be always wanting to run head into danger have have share of a say still be wise to keep lad out of hold with soldiering fighting in quarrel that concern malcolm ronald travelled through cumberland westmoreland calling upon many of gentleman to whom latter have be charged to deliver prince charles message must not however flatter that mission be success for from few of on whom called did receive assurance that be prepared to take action gentleman professed affection for stuart deprecated descent into england unless prince be accompanied by strong body of french troop rising of have be disastrous for jacobite of north of england though declared that be ready again to take up arm risk for cause of stuart if prince be at head of force rendered success probable be unanimously of opinion that must be nothing short of madness to rise until at rate prince have marched into england at head of strong army principal personage upon whom called be mr ratcliff brother of earl of derwentwater who have be executed after rising of ' gentleman assured that be ready to join prince a soon a came south that wished prince to know that in opinion large number of english must join memory of ' be still too fresh said while stuart have be absent so long that although there be great number who must prefer to hanoverian believe that men have cause sufficiently at heart to risk life property for many will give good wish few will draw sword be what wish to say to prince charles among gentleman like feeling of respect loyalty to father house be a strong a ever will join however desperate in opinion chance of success may be will see that common people will stand aloof leave battle to be fought out by clansman on side george troop on other week be passed in traversing country to fro for desired interview be often only obtained after considerable loss of time must not ride up a two highland drover to gentleman house have to wait chance of meeting wished to see on high road of sending note requesting interview couched in such term while must be understood by to whom be addressed must compromise one if fell into other hand there be indeed greatest necessity for caution for authority in town village have received order from government to be on lookout for emissary from north be frequently exposed to sharp examination questioning indeed be only malcolm familiarity with country fact that have so many acquaintance ready to testify that be a said scotch drover in habit for many year of journeying down from north with cattle enabled to escape arrest after much thought have decided upon place of concealment for quill containing ronald credential must thought defy strictest scrutiny hole have be bored from back into heel of ronald boot deep enough to contain quill after be inserted in hiding place hole be filled up with cobbler wax so that must need close examination indeed to discover existence thus although be several time closely searched document of suspicious nature be found upon money be greatest trouble a mere fact of so large sum being carried by two drover must in have given rise to suspicion although have be on return towards scotland possession of amount must have be easily explained a proceeds of sale of cattle have brought down have therefore left greater part of with butcher in carlisle with whom malcolm have often have dealing retaining only ten pound for necessary expense day after reached manchester four constable came to little inn where be stopping told that be to accompany before magistrate must like to know what offence be charged with malcolm said angrily thing have come to pretty pas indeed when quiet drover be to be hauled before magistrate without rhyme reason will hear charge quickly enough when be before worship constable said be affair of mine order be simply to take there well of course must go malcolm said

sighted gentleman clap hand on first people come across three magistrate be sitting when ronald malcolm be brought into courthouse be first asked usual question a to name business then one of magistrate said story be very plausible one happens have here before report sent in from score of different place for in time like be needful to know what kind of person be travelling through country two men answering to description be reported to have visited almost one of place be stated in nearly report that be drover ordinarily engaged in bringing down herd of highland cattle be added that in case account be verified by person who have previously known must seem natural enough seem to have journeyed hither thither without fixed object sometimes have stopped for two day at little village where must have have business in short seem for upwards of month to have be engaged in wandering to fro in such way a be wholly incompatible with affair upon say be engaged will observe sir malcolm said quietly have not said be engaged upon affair be not come to england on business solely to escape from trouble have put stop to trade in highland a for fifteen year be engaged in journeying backwards forward have many friend acquaintance came down partly a have said to avoid being mixed up in trouble partly to call upon old acquaintance partly to introduce to nephew who be new to work will shortly be engaged in bringing down cattle here thought present be good opportunity to show road halting place in order that might better carry out business story have be well got up one of magistrate said though doubt whether there be single word of truth in however will be at present searched detained until get to bottom of matter be not time when men can travel to fro through country

rigour clothes be examined with scrupulous care many of seam being cut open lining slit to see if document be concealed there shoe be also carefully examined mud have dried over opening where quill be concealed official failed to discover even stick be carefully examined to see if contained hollow place at last convinced have be bearer of document must have be discovered official permitted to

that prisoner can be watched conversation overheard having said malcolm indulged in long violent tirade on hardship of peaceful men being arrested maltreated in way at gross stupidity of magistrate in taking honest drover known to countryside for jacobite spy ronald replied in similar strain listener there might have be must certainly have gained nothing from conversation overheard must not be surprised malcolm said in low tone when night have come be quiet if of friend outside try to help news will speedily spread that two men of appearance of drover have be taken on suspicion of being emissary from scotland will cause little uneasiness among on whom have called can not tell whether paper have be found upon what may reveal to save ourselves so will have strong interest in getting free if possible if do get free malcolm sooner return to scotland better have seen almost whom be charged to call upon be certainly in position to assure prince that need hope for rising in favour here before come that be very doubtful that number will join if march south next morning be removed from cell in have be placed to city jail on following day be again brought before magistrate say

communicating with cell next to widens out on side so that man can get ear eye to hole be high up upon wall quarter of inch across so that must scarcely be observed unless by one who knew of existence warder said that must hear plainly enough through hole must see very little however seem to have gathered much that way be on guard sir friend malcolm thought possible that there might be such contrivance now young friend mr ratcliff said have best mount at once follow road for mile then take broad road to left can not mistake go straight to penrith have got letter to general wade yes sir

ride straight into wade camp at newcastle without being suspected have doubt must malcolm agreed still will be wiser to keep away from neighbourhood of english troop awkward question might be asked although letter have for general may do very well to impress officer of militia newly raised troop may meet on road must certainly pas a two orderly conveying despatch must be just a well not to have to appear before general sword belt must probably be noticed at once by cavalry officer know nothing about english army know how much yeomanry sword belt may differ from of line however be certain le observation attract from soldier better a to civilian can ride straight on through town village with light heart may a well breathe horse bit malcolm now there be occasion for haste can jog along at own pace there be probability of pursuit for when find that warder be missing see rope from window will be sure that will have started early be far away by time find out be gone accordingly travelled quietly north boldly riding through small town village putting up at little inn chatting freely with villager who came in to talk over news for north be excitement order have be issued for militia to turn out there be little response for although few have desire to risk life in cause of stuart fewer still have intention of fighting for hanoverian when arrived within few mile of newcastle left main

to falkirk ran north of english camp displayed a marched royal standard other colour have desired effect of impressing huske with idea that prince with army be moving way in meantime charles with main force have crossed river carron to south be only separated from english by falkirk muir rugged rigid upland covered with heath just a english be about to take dinner country people brought in news of approach of highlander huske at once got men under arm have authority in absence of hawley to set in motion messenger however be sent off on horseback at once to callendar house general presently galloped up in breathless haste putting at head of three regiment of dragoon started for falkirk muir hoped to gain before highlander must take possession of ordered infantry to follow a fast a

respect lord john drummond have from distance be watching movement of english a soon a saw that have taken alarm be advancing against prince made detour riding round english joined highland infantry prince army be divided into two line right be commanded by lord george murray left by lord john drummond prince a at preston took up station in centre of second line on conspicuous mound still known by name of charlie english infantry be also drawn up in two line with argyle militia glasgow regiment in reserve behind second line cavalry be in front under colonel ligonier who at death of colonel gardiner have succeeded to command of regiment general hawley commanded centre general huske right battle commenced by charge of ligonier with cavalry upon highland right here macdonald clansman be posted at lord george murray order reserved fire until dragoon be within ten yard then poured in scathing volley under number of horseman went down two dragoon regiment have fled so shamefully at preston coltbridge turned galloped at once from field cobham regiment fought well when compelled to retreat rallied behind right of line lord george murray endeavoured to get victorious macdonalds into line again be beyond control rushing forward fell upon flank of hawley two line of foot be at same moment furiously assailed in front highlander after pouring in fire dropped musket charged broadsword in hand english nearly blinded by wind rain be unable to withstand combined assault general hawley who at least possessed virtue of courage rode hither thither in front trying to encourage in vain whole centre gave way fled in confusion on right however english be defending successfully three regiment placed there on edge of ravine maintained so steady fire that highlander be unable to cross cobham dragoon charged down upon scattered victorious highlander in centre effectually checked pursuit prince charles seeing danger put at head of second line advanced against three english regiment who still stood firm unable to withstand so overwhelming force fell back from ground have held did so in steady order drum beating covering in retreat mingled mass of fugitive have highlander at critical moment flung with whole force upon regiment english army must have be wholly destroyed night be already setting in scottish leader be ignorant how complete be victory feared ambuscade lord john drummond general officer in french service especially opposed pursuit saying men behaved admirably at fontenoy surely must be feint highlander remained stationary on field until detachment sent forward by prince brought back word that english have already retreated from falkirk left behind on field four hundred dead dying with large portion of officer hundred prisoner artillery ammunition baggage fell into hand of highlander whose total loss be only about hundred english on retreat burned to ground royal palace at linlithgow chapter xviii culloden victory of falkirk brought little advantage to prince charles dissension arose among officer lord george murray being furious with lord john drummond for preventing complete destruction of english army while lord john drummond severely criticised lord george for confusion have taken place among troop after success great number of highlander who have spent night after battle in plundering english camp stripping slain made off with booty to mountain number of desertion be increased by withdrawal of greater part of glengarry clansman on day after battle musket of one of clanranald clansman went off by accident killed son of glengarry clansman loudly demanded life for life clanranald having reluctantly consented to surrender follower poor fellow be immediately led out shot even savage act of vengeance be insufficient to satisfy glengarry men greater part of whom at once left army returned to home after battle siege of stirling be renewed owing to gross incompetence of french engineer who have come over with lord drummond battery be so badly placed that fire be easily silenced by of castle gun prince in spite of advice of lord george murray other competent authority listening only to favourite councillor secretary murray sir thomas sheridan continued siege although on th of january duke of cumberland arrived in edinburgh took command of army never have more bitter enemy relentless savage a general hawley have be deed be more than rivalled by of duke of cumberland who be justly branded by contemporary historian with name of butcher be however able general of great activity high personal courage after halting one night in edinburgh set out at head of army to meet enemy did not repeat tactic at falkirk disgusted at conduct of prince in slighting advice listening only to unworthy counsellor lord george murray with principal military leader held consultation presented memorial to prince in stated that seeing great number of highlander who have gone home be of opinion that battle must not be fought with chance of success therefore recommended that army must at once retire to highland where sufficient number of men must be kept together to defy effort of enemy at season of year that in spring ten thousand highlander must be got together to go wheresoever prince might lead prince charles be struck with grief dismay at decision a military leader have signed be forced to give way army at once blew up magazine spiked gun marched for north in two division with much confusion loss of order duke of cumberland pursued be unable to come up to halted at perth ronald who have from time returned to army again taken up former appointment of aide de camp to lord george murray have during time tried best to reconcile difference be constantly breaking out between general prince clique who surrounded be difficult task for lord george impetuosity outspoken brusqueness unconcealed contempt for secretary murray sheridan reopened breach a fast a be closed since day when have saved prince from being carried off at latter have shown marked partiality for ronald society latter have therefore many opportunity of intervening to prevent open quarrel from breaking out prince be frequently greatly depressed in spirit light hearted gaiety have distinguished on first landing be now fitful short lived disappointment at failure of campaign in have won battle be deep bitter have relied upon aid of france aid have come have be grossly misinformed a to willingness of jacobite of england to take up arm in favour although portion of highlander of scotland have warmly embraced cause yet many on whom have relied stood aloof be in arm against while in lowland have found few adherent so far from gaining ground be losing number of highlander have gone off to home retreat from derby have completely chilled enthusiasm of adherent while waverer time server have be induced thereby to declare against duke of cumberland army steadily increased even have advice of highland chief be followed army dispersed to reassemble in spring chance of success must have be more favourable than at present for now that first surprise panic be past england must put forth whole strength must by spring have army assembled in scotland against highland clan even if unanimous must not hope to cope ronald be perfectly alive to hopelessness of final success have seen british infantry at dettingen fontenoy felt sure that although wild highland rush have at first proved irresistible must continue discipline training must eventually triumph over mere valour when malcolm talked matter over together agreed that there must be one issue to struggle that ruin disaster must fall upon who have taken part in enterprise feel thankful indeed ronald said one day be here only a private gentleman risking own life know what feeling must be if like highland chief have brought kinsman follower with into field thought of ruin misery must fall upon must be dreadful fear that vengeance will be taken after be over will be far greater more widespread than followed ' say that duke of cumberland be brutal pitiless fact that be nearly successful will naturally add to severity with english government will treat if fall into power have enterprise be defeated at commencement must have afforded to be lenient a be fear that will determine to teach highland such lesson a will ensure never again venturing to rise in arm against house of hanover know that be altogether to be blamed malcolm said be not so young a be ronald see now be wrong in teaching to be jacobite be very well for men like tullibardine who knew stuart on throne to fight to put back again to generation ronald stuart be after only tradition be sort of generous madness for to risk life to set again on throne of england can not matter brass pin to whether james george rule at st james be not a in case of royalist in england in charles time of covenanters of scotland that great principle be involved principle for men may well risk life hold dear be question of person only although may hold that by right of descent charles edward be prince of wale rightful heir to throne of england be reason why must risk life to place there after seems to that if majority in island determine that will be ruled by house of hanover instead of house of stuart have right to make own choice argue like philosopher malcolm ronald said laughing remind in slightest degree of malcolm who used to chat with in glasgow be right there lad see be brought up jacobite have be soldier life accustomed to charge when be told to charge to kill be told to kill own since have be out now have got to look at matter differently sight of poor highland body blindly following chief risking life for cause in have shadow of interest have made think soldier be soldier if be to sit down to argue about justice of cause in be ordered to fight there must be end to discipline poor fellow be not soldier so say to myself what concern have in matter chief must gain honour reward patent of high nobility addition to estate if stuart conquered follower must gain nothing lad if get over scrape have done with fighting hope that stuart will ever again succeed in getting scotland to take up cause will go on fighting for prince charles a long a there be man left with after there be end of a far a be concerned hope a far a scotland be concerned hope so too malcolm when scotland be divided ireland passive england hostile success be hopeless stuart will never get such chance again a have on day when turned back on london at derby hope that will not again make attempt especially a be manifest now that france have only used a tool against england have idea of giving effectual aid charles on approaching inverness found toughly fortified held by lord loudon with force of two thousand men prince halted ten mile from town at moy castle where be entertained by lady m'intosh whose husband be serving with lord loudon who have

immediately afterwards four five men came running through tree what be matter malcolm shouted english army be upon one of m'intoshes for be clansman who have be sleeping in wood answered must intend to seize prince ronald said will already have sent round body of horse to cut off retreat scatter through wood men do of raise war cry of one of clan a if whole army be here may cause delay enable prince to ride off malcolm do ride back with speed to castle warn prince of loudon approach highlander at once obeyed ronald order in minute two war cry of dozen of principal clan in prince charles army rang through wood while at same time highlander discharged musket ronald also shouted order a to large body of men english who have made sure of effecting successful surprise hesitated a heard war cry of clan ringing through wood believing that whole of prince charles army be at hand be about to be attacked in overwhelming number retreated hastily to inverness sooner have ronald discovered that have fallen back than rode off to inform prince that danger be over found prince charles mounted with lady m'intosh on horseback by side retainer in castle gathered round broadsword in hand in readiness to cut way through body of enemy horse who might intercept retreat charles laughed heartily when heard of strategy ronald have employed to arrest advance of enemy thanked for again having saved from falling into hand of enemy english made retreat to inverness in such confusion dismay that affair became known in history a rout of moy next morning th of february prince called up army next day advanced against inverness lord loudon did not await coming panic of soldier two day before showed that reliance must be placed upon embarking with in boat crossed moray frith to cromarty where troop shortly afterwards disbanded upon hearing that earl of cromarty be marching against with highland regiment town of inverness be occupied at once citadel surrendered in few day army now in barren mountainous region be deprived of resource many ship with supply be sent off from france few of reached destination several being captured by british cruiser others compelled to go back to french port supply of money in treasury be reduced to lowest ebb charles be obliged to pay troop in meal even be frequently deficient men suffered severely from hunger many deserted others scattered

ronald must be careful to keep shoulder in proper position will never look square again that doe not seem very important to just at present malcolm just at present most important question be that of getting something to eat have have nothing today not much yesterday now that be longer in danger of pursuit one begin to feel one be hungry stay here while go forage there ought to be village somewhere among hill far away do know country malcolm never came by path lad have travelled pretty well over highland just a found to be case in lancashire there be few village know will first pull

regiment there be discipline among highlander man doe a like first impulse after battle be to make for home if be victory to carry spoil if be defeated for rest shelter at rate whether gather again not will have to keep perfectly quiet for time when shoulder be perfectly healed can act according to circumstance make for army if there be army for seacoast if there be not although have eaten short time before malcolm be quite ready for meal sitting down beside ronald joined in assault upon black bread cheese then collected more of bracken mixed strong horn of whiskey water much weaker one for ronald after two lay down be fast asleep be awake at sunrise shortly afterwards lad whom malcolm have engaged to act a guide made appearance horse be saddled ronald mounted started at once for destination among hill followed path malcolm have taken afternoon before for three mile then struck off to left half hour took out of forest journeyed for hour along bare hillside until lying in sheltered hollow saw hut be destination be not likely to find here malcolm said cheerfully even be to scour mountain might ride within fifty yard of hollow without suspecting existence where be to get water asked lad in gaelic quarter of mile away over brow be head of stream lad replied can not well miss be right malcolm said mind carrying up provision bottle of spirit now then to drag water want three mile must be serious door of hut be only fastened by latch entered without ceremony consisted of single room there be two three rough wooden stool heap of bracken in one corner large amount of furniture in opinion of highlander amply sufficient will do here capitally malcolm said now what do think about horse ronald of course might be useful if be obliged to move suddenly have food to give if let shift for will wander about might easily be seen by anyone crossing hill horse be always prize might bring troop out into neighbourhood who must otherwise not have thought about coming in direction quite agree with ronald lad have better take down to village give to head man there can sell keep get rid of a like at rate will be off hand chapter xix fugitive for three week ronald malcolm remained in hiding in hut among hill two three day malcolm went down to village brought back food learned that remains of army at ruthven have entirely dispersed prince seeing hopelessness of longer continuing struggle terrible tale of slaughter devastation by cumberland troop circulated through hill duke have fixed headquarters at fort augustus thence troop ravaged whole country of clan lately in insurrection village be burned cattle slaughtered woman subjected to grossest insult ill treatment often wantonly slain fugitive among mountain hunted like wild beast slain a pitilessly whenever overtaken ronald arm be healing fast youth good constitution care attention of malcolm aided perhaps by pure mountain air did wonder for splint have proved efficacious although have not yet be taken off malcolm be confident that injury must be completely repaired one morning malcolm have left hour for village when returned enemy be in village said can see cloud of smoke rising in direction have better be off at once will be scouring hill here a have done elsewhere have better get out of neighbourhood there be packing to be done taking with remained of food malcolm have last

further let have consultation malcolm said be safe now from pursuit have better settle upon what course intend to adopt will make for glasgow lie hid there until thing blow over little make for isle stay there until get chance of being taken off by french ship be what say prince have done indeed a there must be chance of getting ship on east coast lowland be against be certain to have made for isle clanranalds most of other islemen be loyal to must receive shelter skye be hostile elsewhere will be safe must move from island to island get across to mainland by night if pursuit became too hot what do say ronald must not try glasgow unless a last resource malcolm be known to many there a be there a one of prince officer on two occasion might easily be recognized may be sure that there be very strict lookout for fugitive stranger who enters town will be closely examined after time when prince charles principal chief leader will either have escaped across water be hunted down thing will calm down at present must not try to pas through lowland at rate can not try to do so till shoulder be completely healed can use arm naturally think that have better try cross to isle just at present if prince charles be there be believed by english to be there search will be so keen that stranger must be hunted down although highlander might risk imprisonment death for prince must not be expected to run same risk for anyone else if prince escape will be because whole population be with man woman child be trying to throw pursuer off scent no think must be safer in edinburgh than in isle will make shift to live a can for month so by time hope will be able to use one arm a well a other will then boldly go down into lowland in old character a two drover will be best plan doubt ronald agreed difficulty will be getting over next month will manage malcolm said fortunately have still got money left yes have over fifty pound be lucky be able to draw a returned north from man left with at carlisle yes wanted to give back to treasury malcolm said must have done if have not almost quarrelled with about saying that have be given for certain purpose that have carried out that purpose have therefore right to that must be only looked upon a fool if offered to pay back however there be now lucky be have got however hard time however great danger man will hardly starve in scotland with fifty pound in pocket so now will turn face west make for head of one of loch there be plenty of fish to be have for catching with little oatmeal bottle two of whiskey can live like lord walked for

at once have brought griddle two horn with next morning set to work to fish net be stretched across lower end of pool then stripped waded in splashing throwing stone a went be just up to neck in deepest part willowing to two foot below when reached net found two fine salmon caught there carrying ashore split one placed above fire net be then removed in hour be sitting down to breakfast of grilled salmon hot oatmeal cake ronald thought most delicious repast have ever tasted for three week remained at spot be not always alone being sometimes joined for day two by other fugitive who like be wandering near sea coast seeking escape seldom stayed long for be felt unsafe to keep in party of more than two three at utmost of fugitive be in wretched condition having be wandering among moor forest for week a fishing be very successful ronald malcolm be able to give at parting good supply of smoked salmon portion of meal of malcolm from time to time brought fresh supply up from village people there knew little of what be passing in outer world from conversation of soldier be sure that prince charles have so far escaped capture opinion began to prevail that have succeeded in making escape by sea in spite of vigilance of english cruiser by end of three week even malcolm admitted that ronald wound be completely cured two large blue scar showed where bullet have passed through beneath must be felt lump where broken bone have knitted together must in time become a strong a rest of shoulder malcolm splint have done duty eye must detect difference between level width of two shoulder ronald must move arm freely in direction except that must not at present venture to put strain upon arm might be considered a perfectly cured determined therefore to continue way in first place however be necessary to procure other clothes for ronald be still in uniform although malcolm attire be not wholly military yet differed materially from of countryman will have to get other clothes when get south malcolm said for highlander dress must be looked upon with a much suspicion in glasgow a must that uniform of yours until get down to lowland native garb will be best accordingly paid visit to village with utmost difficulty persuaded man have before dealt with to bring two suit of clothes such a be worn by fisherman there in although malcolm small stock of gaelic must betray at once for other than seemed to first clansman who might address must pas muster with body of english troop might meet by way before starting caught smoked a many salmon a must carry a fisherman of coast be in habit of exchanging fish for sheep with inland neighbour cut short pole slung fish at end then placing on shoulder started on way kept along hillside until struck track for must scarcely be called road leading from village into interior then boldly followed for difficulty of travelling across hilly broken country be so great that preferred to run slight extra risk of keeping to road feeling certain that for first day march at least appearance fish carried must answer for with body of troop might meet of however did not think there be much chance authority must have long since learned futility of hunting fugitive among hill must be confining effort to sea coast be now at considerable distance from scene of bloody persecution of cumberland hawley although in other part of scotland severe measure might be adopted against known adherent of stuart be among highland clan only savage wholesale massacre be being carried into effect occasionally in course of day walk met with clansman passing along road generally passed with brief word of greeting in gaelic one two who stopped to speak recognized at once by malcolm accent that wayfarer be not what pretended to be asked question with significant smile expression of good wish went on way at village where stopped after long day journey same line of conduct be observed towards inhabitant guessed at once that

strapping soldier like enough be at culloden however thank goodness have ground for suspecting detaining be sick of brutal business of fugitive hunting be officer not butcher slaying of brave men who have met fairly in battle be disgrace to british name ronald malcolm followed woman into house be ready to buy of fish said in loud tone of voice in gaelic for there will be many to feed evening a
