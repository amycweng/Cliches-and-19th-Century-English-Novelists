wood while party began assault upon door of winding engine house then jack with closely pressed lip set face turned cock of nozzle with hiss scalding water leaped out in stream jack stood well forward now with hose swept crowd a fireman might sweep burning building driven by tremendous force of internal steam boiling water knocked men in front headlong over then a raised nozzle scattered water broadcast over crowd wild yell scream curse broke on night air move column of boiling fluid fell on engaged on other engine house door smote down then jack turned cock again stream of water ceased be minute since have turned on have done terrible work score of men lay on ground rolling in agony others danced screamed yelled in pain others le severely scalded filled air with curse while able to

hesitation number of came forward lifting men who have fallen near engine house carried off in few minute there be deep silence where just before very pandemonium have seemed let loose then jack strain over sat down cried like child hour later listening intently heard deep sound in distance here come soldier muttered be time for to be off glanced at steam gauge saw that steam be falling while water gauge showed that there be still sufficient water for safety then opened window at back of building dropped to ground in instant be seized in powerful grasp thought ye 'd be coming out here now

only when day fell on sunday still be better to run risk meeting of bull dog be called for th of august at jack announced invitation have be received from mr brook few be inclined to demur at giving up jollity of feast by time majority of lad have gone heart soul into movement for improvement progress made have already be so great difficulty at first met have be so easily overcome that be eager

giving usual wonder produced from inexhaustible box such pretty present in way of well furnished work bag other useful article for girl that be delighted surprise of evening be yet to come be not nine o'clock when conjuror finished mr dodgson be thinking anxiously that party must be back in stokebridge long before feast be over suddenly great pair of curtain across end of tent drew aside regular

home straight to bed without being tempted to join in doings at feast if so will be satisfaction to to think that for first time since feast be first inaugurated neither lad lass of stokebridge will have cause to look back upon feast day with regret shame chapter xix great riot stokebridge feast have not gone off with usual spirit number of young pitman lad from surrounding village be a large a ever there be lack of lass in gay bonnet bright dress fact however that almost whole of lad girl of stokebridge between age of fifteen eighteen have left village gone to rival fete elsewhere cast

sir work below when be night shift mr williams allows to help here by day ah remember now mr brook said let see what be doing be creditable piece of work for working collier be not said holding up beautifully executed plan mr hardinge looked with surprise at draughtsman young man of one two twenty with frank open pleasant face why look talk like miner said mr merton schoolmaster here be kind enough to take great deal of pain with sir have be doing sort of work long mr hardinge asked pointing to plan about three four year mr brook said promptly jack looked immensely surprised mr brook smiled noticed extraordinary change in williams report in handwriting expression now understand work same stall a haden do not yes sir not same shift have mate have worked with ever since father be killed so work other shift with harvey now let look at plan of pit mr hardinge said two inspector bent over table examined plan asking question of mr brook now then jack have turned to leave when employer ceased to speak to mr brook made motion to to stay what be size of furnace mr brook asked mr hardinge be eight foot furnace mr brook replied do know how many thousand cubic foot of air minute pas mr brook shook head left management of mine entirely in hand of manager mr hardinge have happened to look at jack a spoke latter thinking question be addressed to answered about eight thousand foot minute sir how do know mr hardinge asked by taking velocity of air sir area of downcast shaft how must measure velocity theoretically mr hardinge asked curious to see how much young collier knew must require to know temperature of shaft respectively height of upcast shaft how must do then formula sir be m ht tx h being height of upcast t temperature t temperature of exterior air x t ' degree be strange young fellow mr hardinge said may ask question two certainly sir must work out cube root of say jack closed eye for minute then gave correct answer to five place of decimal three gentleman gave exclamation of surprise how on earth did do mr hardinge exclaimed must take ten minute to work out on paper accustomed to calculate while be in dark working jack said quietly why must rival bidder mr hardinge said how far have worked up in figure did differential calculus sir then mr merton said that have better stick to mechanical application of mathematics instead of going on farther be two year ago surprise of three gentleman at simple avowal from young pitman be unbounded then mr hardinge said must talk of again later on now let go down pit young man will do excellently well for guide be afraid mr brook that will have to trouble good deal a far a can see from plan mine be very badly laid out ventilation altogether defective what be opinion asked turning abruptly to jack wishing to see whether practical knowledge at corresponded with theoretical acquirement must rather not say sir jack said be not for to express opinion a to mr thompson plan let have idea mr brook said just tell frankly what must do if be manager of vaughan jack turned to plan must widen airway split current must raise number of cubic foot of air to about twelve thousand minute be too far for single current to travel especially a airway be not wide friction be altogether too great must put split in here take current round through old working to keep clear widen passage split current again here then make cut through new ground so a to take strong current to sweep face of main working carry off straight to upcast that current ought not to pas through furnace be let in above for gas come off very thick sometimes might not be diluted enough with air going straight to furnace idea be very good mr hardinge said quietly now will get into clothes go below so saying opened bag took out two mining suit of clothes first taking off coat companion proceeded to put on over other garment mr brook went into office similarly prepared while jack who be not dressed for mining went to closet where few suit be hung up for use of visitor others prepared to go down then went to lamp room fetched four davy lamp while be away mr brook joined inspector that young pitman be a steady a be clever said

influence over comrade of same age have effected great thing for place vicar schoolmaster now be never tired of praising be clearly extraordinary young fellow mr hardinge said do know suggestion be exactly what have intended to offer to will have terrible explosion here unless make radical change evening inspector stayed for night at mr brook next day that gentleman went over with to birmingham where have business principal object however be to take to see mr merton to question farther with regard to jack simpson mr merton related to visitor history of jack effort to educate gave opinion have given lad that might have chosen have taken scholarship then highest mathematical honour have be working lately at engineering calculating strain stress of iron bridge said now mr brook will tell be sure that gentleman will give promise of secrecy upon subject what have never yet told to soul be that lad who brought word of intended attack on engine got to write letter to sir john butler be not sir be that boy for be seventeen then who defended engine house against mob of five hundred men bless heart merton why did not tell before why have puzzled over ever since to think that be one of own pit boy who did gallant action have done nothing for must not have told sir wanted to go on a working miner learn business from bottom besides life must have be safe in district for day if have be known think ought to be told of now lad be a modest a be brave clever must go to grave without ever letting out that saved vaughan indeed pit in district now that be man be right must know pray let imagine that be aware of be very young yet will rise on own merit must dislike nothing so much a thinking that owed anything to what did that night may tell too that be able to mix a gentleman with gentleman ever since have be over here have come over once month to stay with from saturday to monday have mixed with what may call best society in town here have won liking esteem of friend not one of whom have so much a suspicion that be not of same rank of life a what be to do mr hardinge mr brook asked in perplexity what must advise must give first lift at once mr hardinge said decidedly will be many month before have carried out new scheme for ventilation of mine believe will not be safe if there come sudden influx of gas till alteration be made make young fellow deputy viewer with special charge to look after ventilation in way will not have to give instruction to men a to work will confine attention to ventilation state of air door so on even then position will for time be difficult lad have plenty of self control will be able to tide over men will get to see that really understands business will of course order underground manager viewer to give support underground manager at rate must be perfectly aware of capability a seems to have done paper work for time never be body of men more astonished than be pitman of vaughan when heard that young jack simpson be appointed deputy viewer with special charge of ventilation of mine deputy viewer be not position of great honour pay be scarcely more than getter will earn rank be scarcely higher kind of post indeed be generally given to miner of experience getting past work a care attention knowledge be required rather than hard work that young man must be appointed be anomaly simply astonished collier of vaughan affair be first known on surface a men came up in cage news be told majority instead of at once hurrying home stopped to talk over be rummest start ever heard on one said ah here come bill haden hast heard t ' news bill what news why jack made deputy what dost think o ' right over head o ' didbet e'er hear tell o ' such thing did bill haden said emphatically be t ' first time a e'er

will work under willing jack simpson will go far a live will see bill haden be authority in vaughan pit dictum reconciled many who might otherwise have resented appointment of such lad enthusiastic approval of harry shepherd of rest of other young hand in mine who have grown up with jack simpson knew something of how hard have worked who have acknowledged leadership in thing also have effect new deputy entered upon duty without anything like discontent might have be looked for being excited most important part of jack duty consisted in going round pit before men went down in morning to see that there be accumulation of gas in night that ventilation be going on properly deputy usually take helper with jack have chosen friend harry for post a in event of finding gas have to be dispersed by beating with empty sack so a to cause disturbance of air if accumulation be important by putting up temporary bratticing partition formed of cotton cloth stretched on framework in such way a to turn strong current of air across spot where gas be accumulating from be issuing gas be visible to eye a sort of dull fog smoke if accumulation be serious main body of miner be not allowed to descend into mine until viewer have with assistance succeeded in completely dispersing be lonesome feeling harry said first morning that entered upon duty with jack simpson to think that be only two down here be more lonesome than sitting in dark waiting for tub to come along harry be far safer there be not slightest risk of explosion now for there be only safety lamp down here while in day men will open lamp to light pipe make what regulation master may men will break to get smoke upon receipt of mr hardinge official report strongly condemning arrangement in vaughan mr brook at once appointed new manager in place of mr thompson upon arrival made acquainted with extent of jack knowledge ability requested to keep eye specially upon to employ a far a possible a right hand man in carrying out order wish that main wind drift be through jack said one day six month after appointment a be sitting over tea with bill haden gas be coming in very bad in new working wuss ever knew't jack be main good job that furnace be made bigger o ' th ' airway widened for doe come out sharp surely in th ' old part where be ' notice when went down yesterday where peter jones be working gas be just whistling out of blower close by fortnight airway will be through dad will make great change will be very glad for pit in bad state now ah thou thinkbet good deal of jack because thoubet got part of beponsibility of fret wish men must smoke dad want to get bad name for reporting be just playing with life bill haden be silent be given to indulge in quiet smoke a jack working with for five year well knew well jack thou knowbet there be craving for draw two of bacca so there be for great many other thing that have to do without jack said if be only question of man blowing to piece must say nought about be whether be willing to make five hundred widow two thousand orphan rather than go for few hour without smoking what be use of davy lamp what be use of care a to ventilation if at moment gas may be fired at lamp opened for lighting pipe like pipe if thought there be ever chance of becoming master must never touch tobacco again three day later when jack came up from round at ten o'clock to eat breakfast write up journal of state of mine saw mr brook manager draw up to pit mouth jack shrank back from little window of office where be writing did not look out again until knew that have descended mine a did not wish to have appearance of thrusting forward for hour wrote then window of office flew in piece chair danced wall rocked while dull heavy roar like distant thunder burst upon ear leaped to foot rushed to door black smoke be pouring up from pit mouth stick piece of wood coal be falling in shower in yard jack saw that worst anticipation have be realized that terrible explosion have taken place in vaughan pit chapter xxiv in deadly peril for moment jack stood stunned by calamity there be knew over three hundred men boy in pit turned faint sick a thought of fate came across then ran towards top of shaft bankman lay insensible at distance of yard from pit where have be thrown by force of explosion two three men came running up with white scared face smoke have nearly ceased already damage be done deadly stillness seemed to reign jack ran into engine house engine man be leaning against wall scared almost fainting be hurt john pull round man first thing be to see if lift be right see one of cage be at bank force of explosion be in upcast shaft just give turn two to engine see if winding gear right slowly engineman turned on steam there be slight movement then engine stopped little more steam jack said cage have caught may come there be jerk then engine began to work be right jack said whether lower cage be on not stop now wind back get cage up again doe bell act wonder jack pulled wire when in order struck bell at bottom of shaft then looked at bell hanging over head for answer none came expect wire broke jack said went out to pit mouth again surface men be gathered round now tip men yard men from coke oven looking wild pale be going down jack said may find poor fellow near bottom ca wait till headman come on ground who will go with want married men for know lad there may be blow at moment will go with one of yard men said stepping forward there be one dependent on too said be odds to one whether come up again not here be with come of illustration after first explosion search party jack brought three safety lamp from lamp room took place in cage with two volunteer lower away shouted go very slow when get near bottom look out for signal be three minute from moment that cage began to sink to when touched bottom of shaft seemed age to in knew that at moment second explosion might come that might be driven far up into air above top of shaft mere scorched fragment of flesh not word be spoken during descent there be general exclamation of thank god when felt cage touch bottom jack a official of mine by virtue of superior energy at once took lead now said let push straight up main road just a stepped out came across body of two men stooped over with lamp dead jack said can do nought for little way on in heap be waggon thrown together broken up body of pony that of lad driver then came to first door door no longer not fragment of remaining in door boy niche lad lay in heap bent over be alive jack said will two carry to cage will look round see if there be one else about here beyond way there be hope make haste look how gas be catching inside lamp place be full of fire damp men took up lad turned to go to bottom of shaft jack looked few yard down cross road then followed be in act of turning into next road to glance at also when felt suck of air down on face shouted springing couple of pace farther up cross road threw on face chapter xxv imprisoned miner there be mighty roar thundering sound a of express train blinding light scorching heat jack felt lifted from ground by force of blast dashed down again then knew be over staggered to foot force of explosion have passed along main road so up shaft owed life to fact that have be in road off course returned into main road near bottom of shaft be brought to standstill roof have fallen passage be blocked with fragment of rock broken waggon knew that bottom of shaft must be partly filled up that comrade be killed that there be hope of escape in direction for moment paused to consider then turning up side road to left ran at full speed from shaft knew that danger now be not so much from fire damp explosive gas a from even more dreaded choke damp surely follows after explosion cessation of ventilation many more miner be killed by choke damp a hasten to bottom of shaft after explosion than by fire choke damp be carbonic acid gas be heavier than ordinary air thus lowest part of colliery become first filled with a must with water in coal mine there be slight sometimes considerable inclination dip a be called of otherwise flat bed of coal shaft be almost always sunk at lower end of area owned by proprietor of mine a by mean whole pit naturally drain to sump well at bottom of shaft whence be pumped up by engine above loaded waggon too be run down from working to bottom of shaft with comparative ease explosion have a jack well knew destroyed door direct current of air ventilation have entirely ceased lower part of mine where explosion have be strongest must soon be filled with choke damp product of explosion jack be making for old working near upper boundary line of pit there air must remain pure long after have be vitiated elsewhere be in quarter of mine bill haden twenty other collier worked presently jack saw light ahead heard clattering of step be clear that a have hoped miner working there have escaped force of explosion have without doubt played awful havoc in part of mine where greater part of men be at work stop stop jack shouted a came up to be fire jack bill haden who be one of first asked yes bill did feel of thought felt suck of air quarter hour since be sure then came blew out light come along lad there be time for talking be of use going on jack said shaft choked up came down after first blow fear there be living soul in new working by time must be full of choke damp men looked at other with blank face hast seen brook jack asked eagerly ay passed stall with johnstone ten minute ago just before blast came may catch in time to stop yet jack said if have gone round to look at walling of old goafs there be three men at work there will go with jack bill haden said best place be stall lad went on turning to others be pretty well highest ground in pit air will keep good there a long a anywhere may be till help come come along of mate said turning to man who worked with in stall a hurried along jack in few word told what have taken place a far a knew five minute run brought to place where mason be at work walling up entrance to old working looked astonished at new comer have seen gaffer ay have ' just gone on there see light down heading well saw moment since come along jack said quick expect have met at full speed hurried along presently stopped short light burnt low choking sensation came on back jack for life gasped bill haden at moment jack foot struck something knew be body down at foot help cried stooped tried to raise body then last gleam of light went out lung seemed to cease acting saw more when came to again be being carried on bill haden shoulder right dad said be coming round now put down be good job jack thought thou'dbet scarce come round again have got either of others have got brook 'd arm round so tight that ned lifted together be on ahead mason be carrying ned showing way canst walk now yes be better now how did manage to breathe dad did breathe jack be too old hand for when saw fall just drew back took breath then shut mouth went down for just same a if 'd be groping for under water got hold of lifted up carried along a far a must before drew breath again be sharp jack know everything yet bill haden chuckled to find for once practical experience taught something jack have not learned from book jack now hurried along after bill haden in few minute reached place fixed upon here miner be engaged in restoring consciousness to mr brook who under influence of water dashed on face artificial respiration set up by alternately pressing upon chest allowing to rise again be just beginning to show sign of life interest in employment be so great that be not until mr brook be able to sit up that began to talk about future jack account of state of thing near shaft be listened to gravely fact that whole of system of ventilation have be deranged proof given by second explosion that mine be somewhere on fire needed comment to experienced men sounded death knell gallant unceasing a must be effort made under other circumstance to rescue fact that pit be on fire that fresh explosion might at moment take place must render act of simple madness for friend above to endeavour to clear shaft heading to restore ventilation fact be further impressed upon by sudden simultaneous flicker of lamp faint shake followed by distant rumble blast bill haden said that settle lad may a well turn out lamp two so a to have light a long a last out be there hope mr brook asked presently coming forward after have heard from haden mate manner in have be so far saved not scrap master said bill haden be like rat in trap must have ' be kinder of if 'd let lay a be intention be equally kind mr brook said be there nothing that can do bill haden said have got dinner wi might make last mouthful at time to keep life in for week more what 'ud be th use of may be week ay month before can stifle fire make way here can suggest nothing jack mr brook asked be only officer of pit left now added with faint smile jack have not spoken since reached stall have sat down on block of coal with elbow on knee chin on hand favourite attitude of when thinking deeply other collier have thrown down on ground sobbed occasionally a thought of loved one above lay in silence jack answered appeal by rising to foot yes sir think may do something men raised in surprise in first place sir must send men in direction to see how near choke damp have got there be four road by must come up must shut door on side of place have got to roll block of coal rubbish to keep tight stop up chink with wet mud will keep gas from coming up there be air enough in stall heading to last long time must only prolong life for few hour jack know that must be advantage better to be choked by gas than to die of starvation mr brook said murmur from men showed that agreed with vote for lighting pipe one of miner said if there be fiery gas here must be better to finish with at once there be general expression of approval wait jack said authoritatively wait till have done know mr brook be close to north boundary here in place within very few yard now 'logan lie next to have be worked out year ago of course be full of water be from fear of tapping that water that work be stopped here good deal come in through crevice in stall expect be nearest to now if must work into 'logan water must rush down into working a pit be good deal bigger than 'logan ever be will fill lower working put out fire wo reach here then can get up through 'logan where air be sure to be all right a water will bring good air down with may not do in time be chance what do say sir be worth trying at rate mr brook said bravo lad clear head may save yet by gum jack be good un bill haden said bringing down hand upon jack shoulder with force almost knocked down while men with revived hope leaped to foot crowding round shook jack hand with exclamation of approval delight now lad mr brook said jack simpson be master now will work under order before begin boy let say prayer be in god hand let ask protection head be bared men stood reverently while in few word mr brook prayed for strength protection rescue from danger now jack said when have finished give order jack at once sent off two men along of road to find how near choke damp have approached to block up seal door be necessary to strike light to relight of lamp be danger must not be avoided rest of men be sent round to place where work have be going on to bring in tool dinner to stall to jack bill haden mr brook proceeded at once work have be done there for year floor be covered with black mud close examination of face showed tiny streamlet of water trickling down in several place examination of stall working place on side showed similar appearance in le marked degree be therefore determined to begin work in mean to use powder jack bill haden asked dad without ventilation must be choked with smoke there must be danger from gas when think be getting near water will put in big shot so a to blow in face when men returned with tool dinner latter done up in handkerchief jack asked mr brook to take charge of food there be just twenty of sir without nineteen dinner so if divide among four dinner day will last for five day by time hope will be free four men only must work at face of stall together jack divided twenty into five set will work in quarter of hour shift at first said that will give hour rest to quarter of hour work man can work well know for quarter of hour when get done up will have half hour shift will give two hour for sleep in between men of first shift stripped a usual to waist set to work without instant delay vigour swiftness with blow fell upon face of rock must have told experienced miner that men who struck be working for life death unemployed jack took into adjacent stall set to work to clear narrow strip of floor next to upper wall then to cut little groove in rocky floor to intercept water a slowly trickled in lead to small hollow be to make in solid rock water coming through two stall must thus collected be ample for want jack then started to see how men at work at door be getting on have already nearly finished task on road leading to main working choke damp have be met with at distance of fifty yard from stall upon upper road be several hundred yard before be found on other two road be over hundred yard men have torn strip off flannel jacket have thrust into crevice of door have then plastered mud from roadway on thickly there be reason to fear

meeting be held raved like wild creature miner of district must not own step be necessary for that only chance to extinguish fire be by cutting off air unless dreadful alternative of drowning pit be resorted to in morning smoke still curled up pit mouth be closed board be placed over shaft earth be heaped upon so a to cut off altogether supply of air so stifle fire be on thursday morning nothing be done on friday on saturday afternoon mining authority met again in council there be expert there now from part of kingdom for extent of catastrophe have sent thrill of horror through land be agreed that earth staging must be removed next morning early that if smoke still came up water must be turned in from canal at six in morning number of leading authority met at mine men have during night

unbroken column began to rise a before that conviction that pit be still on fire seized present fear that there be alternative mr hardinge said pit must be flooded there be not dissentient voice party moved towards canal to see what must be best method of letting in water when cry from men standing round caused to turn saw dense white column rise from shaft steam one cried in astonishment low rumbling sound came from pit what can have happened mr hardinge exclaimed in surprise be most extraordinary crowded round pit mouth must distinctly hear distant roaring sound presently died away gradually steam ceased to rise air above pit mouth be clear there be smoke rising one of inspector said what on earth can have happened let lower light down hoisting gear rope have be prepared on first day in case must be necessary to lower one for wire rope have snapped when attempt have be made to draw up cage after second explosion sudden release from strain have caused engine to fly round

flooded to miner be subject of greatest surprise while friend of in pit received news a death blow of last hope be now impossible that one must be alive in pit at ten o'clock mining authority went again to discus curious phenomenon agreed that be out of question that so large quantity of water have accumulated in old working for plan of pit have be repeatedly inspected by inclined to belief that there must have be immense natural cavern above working when fire in pit burned away pillar left to support roof must have fallen in let water in cavern into mine others pointed out that there be example whatever of cavern of such dimension a must have be being found in coal formation pointed to worked out logan pit be known to be full of water a probable source of supply during previous four day plan have be discussed of cutting through from logan be known to have be worked nearly up to vaughan boundary must enable to enter pit rescue miner who might be alive fact that to erect pumping gear get out water must be affair of many week if not month have caused idea to be abandoned a soon a broached to who argued that water have come from logan be pointed out that there be certainly several yard of solid coal between vaughan logan still standing that a force of explosion be evidently near vaughan shaft be incredible that barrier between pit must have be shattered however be decided to solve question one way other by immediate visit to top of old logan shaft be just starting when heard movement in street men setting off to run moment later miner entered room hurriedly there be big smoke coming up from old logan shaft be too light for coal smoke think be steam with exclamation of surprise whole party seized hat hurried off be twenty minute sharp walking to shaft

speaker got over lay down on face working nearer to edge sloped dangerously down while others following in same way held leg be in turn held by others when head shoulder be fairly over pit gave loud shout there be death like silence on part of crowd standing round of close must hear faint murmur come from below then arose cheer echoed again again then dozen fleet footed boy started for
