in carrying point mr fordyce have urged that must be misfortune for boy to bear of name will have to go to school herbert of course boy must make life burden to if have of name mention know what boy be have plenty of in family if be aristides must get nickname of tidy must be hideous other name be worse still must probably shorten into cockle be sure must not want boy to be spoken of a cockle beveridge hate common name mr beveridge said such a jack bob bill well think be quite good enough for ordinary life herbert if must have something classical why not take name of horace one of mary brother be horace know must no doubt take a compliment if gave boy name so be fixed for horace a soon a child be old enough to go out without nurse mr beveridge appointed one of greek servant to accompany in order that child must pick up knowledge of greek while interested so far in a to set aside book have into library for hour day when always talked to in greek thus at mother death boy be

light on greek particle when entered naturally herbert boy boy be high time went to school be thinking other day about getting tutor for getting fiddlestick mr fordyce said sharply boy want companionship what do suppose must become moping about big house alone want to play if be ever to grow up active healthy man harm have be done yet for dear mary kept house bright have sense to let pas most of time in open air not to want always at apron string if when get to age of twenty develops taste for greek heaven forbid for chinese for other heathen out of way study will be quite time enough for to take up beveridge have always be men of action be very well herbert to have one great scholar in family admit that be great credit to two of must ruin happily believe there be record of great scholar producing equally great son at rate do hope boy will have fair chance of growing into active energetic man taking place in county have wish must be otherwise aunt herbert beveridge said quite acknowledge that in respect must be better if have not devoted so entirely to study though work have not be without fruit hope for be acknowledged that book on use of digamma threw entirely new light upon subject still can not expect do wish that horace must follow in footstep indeed trust that when have finished work there will be little for fresh labourer to glean in direction at rate be far too young to develop bent in direction think therefore proposal be good one then in case herbert think can not do better than send with horace hendon two boy to school one be about own age one be little older elder boy have be there year father be well satisfied with school very well aunt if will ask horace to make arrangement for boy to go with son be quite content must be so so horace beveridge went week later by coach with cousin to school at exeter forty mile from seaport there remained until be fourteen passed holiday at home never seeing father until dinnertime after spent two hour with period of day to boy always looked forward with dread sometimes father must chat cheerfully to always in modern greek at others must sit silent abstracted waking up occasionally making abrupt remark to boy then again lapsing into silence when about house ground marco be constant companion greek who be mere lad when have come to england be fond of horace having be fisherman a boy enjoyed almost a much a charge did boating fishing expedition upon accompanied at time horace have strong desire to go to sea even aunt fordyce when broached subject to must give hope encouragement if have be ten year ago horace must have be matter sea be stirring life then even have only gone into navy for few year must have seen lot of service might have distinguished a to staying in must have be ridiculous for a only son now nothing must be more wretched than position of naval officer world be at peace there doe not appear to be slightest chance of war anywhere for many year hundred hundred of ship have be paid off laid up there be thousand of officer on half pay without smallest chance of ever getting employment again have arrived too late in world for sailoring besides think in case father must consent to thing be happy to say that think have idea even desire that must turn out famous scholar a be to man like must seem terrible that education must cease altogether at age at boy go into navy that must grow up knowing nothing of what considers essential of gentleman education no horace sea be out of question must go up to eton a arranged at end of holiday from eton must go through one of university after that can wander about for bit see world will see a much of in six month way a in twice a many year be in navy in time of peace horace looked little downcast there be thing horace aunt said must not be fair for to go into navy even if there be nothing else against how be aunt well horace when there be hundred of officer on half pay who can scarcely keep life together on few pound year get must be hard indeed for young fellow with money influence to step into place keep out yes aunt did not think of horace said brightening up certainly must be beastly shame for fellow who can do anything with to take place of man who can hing else besides horace aunt went on if like sea so much a do now when have done with college there be reason why must not get father to let hire buy yacht go where like in instead of travelling about by land must be very jolly horace exclaimed yes must be really better than going to sea because one must go where one liked so at end of holiday horace went up to eton on return home in summer father said aunt be over here other day horace be telling about foolish idea have of going to sea be glad to hear that gave up at once when pointed out

father said a how there be occasion to be back to night if so be a liked to make cruise of did say that be capital then let go to dartmouth to morrow can start a early a like so a to get back here reckon will have to beat back according to notion wind will be somewhere round to south by to morrow morning will suit nicely now then sir will see about getting sail on a soon a began to throw sail cover off marco came on deck lent hand in course of three minute sail be up mooring slipped surf be gliding past end of jetty be done in pretty good style sir tom burdett said a took up station by side of horace who be at tiller reckon when have have week practice together will get up sail a smartly a man of war captain must want to see do like to see thing done smart if be only on little craft like with three of ought to get lower sail on in time that greek chap know what be about of course have often be out with in fishing boat there have never be call for to lend hand there be quite surprised just now when turned to at only reckoned on dick put greek down a steward cook used to work in fishing boat when be boy tom ah account for be smart sailor of greek in own craft though never reckoned be good in square rigged ship in felucca of theirs ai easy to be beaten in anything like fine weather ai dependable none of mediterranean chap be whether be greek italian spaniard when come on to blow really hard there be land under lee port to run to when come to squeak like lose nerve begin to pray to saint wring hand jabber like lot of child seem to have sort of backbone about in fine weather allow handle craft a well a must be handled mind helm sir must always keep attention to matter what be being said be going to get up topsail tom not at present sir with wind there will be more sea on a get further out know craft yet want to see what way be afore try look to a if must be stiff under canvas running a be ca judge much about have always got to be careful with light draft craft when get to know will be able to calculate what will carry in weather there be hurry about have seen spar carried away afore now from young commander cracking on sail on craft knew nothing about boat can run there be mistake about look at fishing boat ahead of be jasper hill kitty went out ten minute afore came down be overhauling hand over hand be reckoned one of fastest craft in seaport then craft be bound to run fast with fine line willow draft must wait to see how will do when there be lot of wind in couple of hour horace be glad to hand over tiller to skipper a sea have got up good deal surf yawed so much before following wave that needed more skill than possessed to keep straight fetch compass up dick skipper said be dropping land fast now get mizzen off will steer easier without be doing much good do begin to feel queer at mr horace not bit boy laughed why suppose after rolling about in fishing boat when be hanging to net that one must feel easy motion must think not always follow have seen man who have be accustomed to knock about life in small craft a sick a dog on board frigate have seen first lieutenant of man of war knocked right over while lying off bar on boat service one get accustomed to one sort of motion when get quite different seems to take innards aback run to dartmouth be quickly made to horace delight passed several large ship on way yes be going well tom burdett said when expressed satisfaction if wind be to get up bit more must be just other way have got quite a much a want while must stand good bit more small craft will generally hold own in light wind because why carry more sail in proportion to tonnage when big ship have got a much a can do with little one have to reef down half sail be taken off thing be wave knock way out of small craft while weight of big one take through without feeling still say boat ai doing well for be first rate will make very quick passage to port running up pretty river rounded to head to wind dropped anchor short distance from ship of war lowered stowed sail smartly then horace went below to dinner have be ready for little time have not liked leaving deck for rolling a sometimes did must have be impossible to eat comfortably a soon a dined others took meal in fo'castle marco having insisted on waiting on while at dinner when have finished marco dick rowed horace ashore lad took boat

be good deal of sea on before getting up anchor topmast be lowered two reef put in main sail one in mizzen small jib substituted for carried on previous day shower of spray fell on deck a put out from mouth of river once fairly away took wave easily though sometimes few bucket of water tumbled over bow swashed along lee channel nothing like green sea came on board tom burdett be delighted with be beauty mistake said enthusiastically there be many big ship will be making bad weather of to day go over like duck after mr horace sha' mind what weather be out in must not have believed craft size must have behaved so well in tumble like see be more trying for than big sea must be must take easier if wave be longer have more time to take one after other be why hear of boat living in sea have beaten life out of ship long craft doe not feel short choppy sea that small one must be putting head into wave in long sea little one have advantage what do think of sir seems to to heel over long way tom yes be well over see even in puff doe go further vessel have got what may call bearing may take much to get over to when be there take wonderful lot to bring further see there be lot of sail must take off yet if wind be to freshen must get in reef in main sail stow mizzen foresail altogether must stand pretty nigh hurricane with canvas be four o'clock in afternoon before surf entered harbour horace be drenched with spray felt almost worn out after struggle with wind wave when landed knee be strangely weak felt immense satisfaction with trip believed implicitly tom burdett assertion that yacht must stand weather chapter iii wreck be glorious holiday for horace beveridge be seldom at home sometimes two of cousin hendons accompanied in trip be away for three four day at time three time mr beveridge with zaimes went out for day sail horace be pleased to see that father really enjoyed talking little sitting among cushion zaimes arranged for astern basking in bright sun fresh air that

winter holiday be sure to sir if father have not laid up by time there be plenty of day on coast when sailing be a pleasant in winter a be in summer harbour be safe one though be so small see reason why must be kept afloat of course will have to put stove in cabin to make snug with that good thick pea jacket warm glove high boot must be a right a nail so at christmas through next summer holiday

fullest of capacity during holiday horace did not see much of father who quite content that boy be enjoying gaining health strength went on in own way only once went out with during stay at home although a marco told generally went out once week at other time first morning after return at following christmas horace did not a usual get up a soon a be light rattle of window howl of wind outside sufficed to tell that there must be sailing day being in hurry to move sat over breakfast longer than usual talking to zaimes of what have happened at home in village since last went away father be absent having gone up to town week before horace have on arrival found letter from saying that be sorry not to be there for return that found must not get through work on be engaged for two day must however be down at rate by christmas eve after breakfast horace went out looked over sea wind be almost dead on shore blowing in such violent gust that must scarce keep foot sky be dull lead colour low cloud hurrying past overhead sea be covered with white breaker roar of surf a broke on shore must be heard even above noise of wind putting on pea jacket high boot went down to port a have be specially constructed a shelter against south westerly wind with western pier overlapping other sea did not make direct sweep into craft inside be rolling heavily in swell how be tom be wild day be want to see worse sir glad to see back again mr horace quite well hope first rate tom be nuisance gale first day of coming home have be looking forward to sail be afraid there be chance of one to day well sir must say must take send to loonatic asylum at exeter if saw getting ready to go out just look at sea coming over west pier have carried away bit of stone wall at end yes did really think of going out tom though suppose if have be caught out in must have managed somehow must have done best in course sailor said have belief in boat that think might weather must not take six month pay to be out quarter of hour what must do tom if be caught in gale like if there be land under lee must lay to sir under storm jib try sail maybe must unship main sail with boom gaff get top mast on deck lash to then make bridle with strong rope launch overboard lower sail ride to that must keep nearer head on to sea than must lie under sail be what call floating anchor never heard of ship being hove to way be out on boat service in indian ocean when be caught in heavy blow lieutenant who be in charge made lash mast sail oar together heave overboard rode to right through gale have to bale bit occasionally there be never danger think must have lived through other way made note of at time if ever be caught in same way again be what will do what must be good for boat must be good for craft like surf conversation be carried on with difficulty although be standing under lee of wall of cottage roll about heavily tom doe that sir be lucky have got mooring in middle of harbour none of fishing boat be near enough to interfere with see most of have got sail net rolled up a fender in spite of that have be ripping tearing other shocking there will be job for carpenter for time to come five six of have torn away bulwark already after waiting down by port for hour horace returned to house when luncheon be over be just about to start again for port when marco said to dick have just be in sir there be going to be wreck there be lot of fisherman gathered on cliff mile away to right say there be ship will come ashore somewhere along there come on then marco did hear whether thought that anything must be done did not hear anything about think know where will go ashore yet in few minute reached group of fisherman standing on cliff be headland beyond land fell away forming bay three mile across large barque be to be seen two mile off shore be wallowing heavily in sea wave seemed to smother in spray tom burdett be among group horace went up to at once what be to prevent from beating off tom ought to be able to work out without difficulty so must at ordinary time skipper said be evidently heavy sailer deep laden must do now if must put more sail on expect canvas be old see topsail be in ribbon of sea heave bodily to leeward be doomed ship sir there ai sort of doubt about that question be where be coming ashore will make much difference tom well might make difference if master knew coast best thing must do must be to get round run straight in for point water be deeper here than be in bay must get nearer ashore before struck might save few of if lashed to spar coop such like deep a be must strike mile out if went straight up bay tide be nearly dead low in case not man will get ashore through line of breaker then again might strike near ram head over there be like enough if hold on a be doing at present head run long way out under water be willower mile out than be point there be clump of rock there remember anything about tom have sailed along there score of time sir take account of in small craft there be fathom half of water over even in spring tide spring be on now there ai much above nine foot just now that craft draw two fathom half thereabouts over twelve foot anyhow make much difference wherever strike will go to piece in sea in few minute surely there be something to be done tom of be just going down to get rope go along shore mr horace lor ' bless one just doe for sake of doing something one know well enough that ai likely will get chance of saving soul must of boat go out tom there must be plenty of water for where strike fisherman have be talking about sir be of one opinion sea be altogether too heavy for surf must go must tom have always said must stand sea reasonable sort of sea mr horace be downright onreasonable sort of sea for craft of size be deal worse near shore where water begin to willow than must be out in channel though tom burdett spoke strongly horace noticed that tone be not so decided a when said that fishing boat must not go out look here tom said suppose there must be thirty hand on board that ship ca see drowned without making try to save have got best boat here on coast have be out in bad weather in have always behaved splendidly vote try can fetch out between pier right from where be moored if when get fairly out find be altogether too much for must put back again tom made answer be standing looking at ship have be already turning over in mind whether must not be possible for surf to put out have immense faith in sea going quality believed that might be able to stand even sea must be thinking of going in mr horace said doubtfully at last of course must lad said indignantly suppose must let surf go out if be afraid to go in father must never agree to if be at home sir yes must horace said be sure father must say that if surf went out ought to go in that must be cowardly to let other people do what one be afraid to do one besides can swim better than dick must have more chance of getting ashore if went down think must go down be nearly sixteen now a father be here will have own way if say that think there be chance of surf getting out to there be end of if say that think must live through will go illustration horace suggests rescue think might do mr horace have be saying so to others say that must be just madness then know craft a do well look here tom will put way if storm have be yesterday father have be away must have taken out well sir must ca say contrary have always said that boat must go anywhere believe must ai going to back down now from opinion say a ai right for to go be business horace said marco be going out in surf to try to save of men on board that ship be disposed to come too will go if go greek said slowly know what father must say must say if there be chance of saving life ought to be tried marco of course there be danger in tom think can do so do ca stand here see thirty men drowned without making effort to save have quite made up mind to go very well sir then will go horace went back to tom burdett who be talking with dick apart from rest will take couple of extra hand if can get skipper said will want to be strong handed went to group of fisherman said be going out in surf to see if can lend hand to bring of poor fellow ashore young mr beveridge be coming want couple more hand who will go with there be silence for minute then young fisherman said will go tom brother nat be big enough to take place in boat if come back again be willing to try with though doubt if yacht will get twice own length beyond pier will go with tom older man said if son dick be going see why must hang back will do then that make up crew now have best be starting at once barque will be ashore in hour will go to piece pretty near a soon a strike so if be going to do anything there ai time to be lost rest of have better go along with stout rope a be talking of just now that will give bit of chance if thing go wrong six hurried along cliff then down to port followed by whole of fisherman couple of trip with dinghy took on board now then tom burdett said to dick father will get fore sail out rig a try sail dick cut lashing get main

bulwark little came over bow will do sir tom close to whom have lashed shouted will be better when get bit farther out be beauty be answer to helm well gradually surf drew out from shore be going to come about tom not yet sir must get more sea room before try like enough may miss stay in sea if doe must wear round now will try said five minute later get lashing off mr horace will have to go up to other side when be round get ready to go about shouted will put helm down at first lull now surf came round like top have gathered way on other tack before next big wave struck well done tom burdett shouted joyously others echoed shout in ten minute be far enough out to get sight of ship a rose on wave just a thought ben muttered think will weather ram head will go ashore somewhere on reef of rock to certainty in five minute course be again changed surf bore directly for barque in spite of small sail carried water be two foot up lee plank of deck be deluged time by sea struck now almost abeam everything be battened down heeded water little what do think of now tom shouted to brother in law did tell must stand sea when fishing boat dare not show nose out of port be good 'un mistake tom did not think craft size must have lived in such sea a may brag about a like in future there ai man in seaport a will contradict be going through water four foot to barque one be quarter of mile astern of when horace exclaimed have struck at same moment main foremast went over side be just about on willowest point of reef ben harper said now how be going to manage job tom there be only one way to do skipper said there be water enough for tide have flowed hour half there must be two fathom where be lying must run up under lee close enough to chuck rope on board get light rope bent on to hawser must pull on board will hang to a near a dare must go near stern tom will get stove in with mast spar yes be lucky mizzen be standing else must not have gone alongside till got rid of must never do afore broke up horace a watched ship expected to see go to piece moment wave struck with tremendous force sending cataract of water over weather gunwale across deck many of sea broke before reached line of reef must be traced far beyond by white broken water now then skipper shouted will keep surf about twice own length from wreck then put helm hard down shoot right up to will be safest plan tom there be two men with rope standing ready in mizzen shroud will bring in little beyond ben if wreck of mainmast be in way mizzen may come out of moment if fell on deck must be good bye to cheer broke from men huddled up under shelter of weather bulwark a little craft swept past stern mind wreck voice shouted tom held up hand moment later put helm down hard surf swept round towards ship

to house zaimes have be among crowd assembled to see surf re enter port when horace changed thing came down stair found bowl of hot soup ready for have given nice fright mr horace greek said a entered room have be scolding marco can tell be not fault zaimes made up mind to go told so have choice whether must go stay behind went of course went zaimes said ought to have come told then must have gone too how must have met father do think if have be drowned well must not have be to blame zaimes a knew nothing about until after have started no have be gone hour before someone from village came up told in kitchen then one of servant brought news ran down like madman without even stopping to get hat then found that most of men have gone up to cliff to keep in sight went up there waited with until be nearly back again once twice a be running in to pier thought yacht be gone be worst bit zaimes sea came tumbling over stern be washed off foot two three time almost thought that be going down head foremost well be glad be at home morning must not have missed for anything be good thing now be done something to be proud of be told very few of fisherman thought that must ever come back again did know boat a did zaimes felt sure must go through anything besides tom kicked out lower plank of bulwark on side so a to help to free from water a came on board flush decked a be there be nothing to carry away have taken cupful of water down below in evening captain of barque came up horace learned from that be on way from new orleans laden with cotton ship cargo be insured captain said a far a go be good thing be knocked into match wood be dull sailer at best of time when laden must not get to lay anywhere near wind must have done better than did though have rudder got damaged somehow in

navy that must not get anything of price for a be well insured will get handier craft next time be well off shore when storm began to get heavy last night felt anxiety about position till rudder went wrong when saw coast morning felt sure that unless there be change in weather nothing must save well if have be for loss of seven hand must thanks to have nothing to complain of fire have be lit on shore a night came on except fragment of wreck number of bale of cotton nothing be recovered in morning captain crew left seaport two hand remaining behind to look after cotton recover a much a must two day later mr beveridge returned home saw in paper before left town horace account of going out to wreck saving life of on board be very glad be not here lad think must have let go a knew nothing about until be over have anxiety about felt quite proud of when read account money be well laid out on yacht boy say that did think so before certainly think so now however directly read wrote to lifeboat society told must pay for boat to be placed here then there will be occasion to tempt providence next time vessel come ashore on part of coast succeeded once horace might not succeed time knowing what sea set in here in south westerly gale quite tremble now at thought of being out in in little craft news that mr beveridge have ordered lifeboat for port gave great satisfaction among fisherman not so much perhaps because must enable to go out to wreck a because of own craft approaching harbour in bad weather needing assistance must then receive horace became very popular in seaport after rescue be spoken of affectionately a young squire although be unable to associate term with father latter interest in sea occasionally going out in yacht seemed to have brought nearer to fishing people there have before be absolutely nothing in common between studious recluse even greek who have before be held in marked disfavour in village a outlandish follower be now regarded with different eye when be learned that marco have be fisherman too in time share in adventure of surf dissipated last shadow of prejudice against weather continued more le broken through whole of holiday horace have little sailing spent good deal of time over at cousin rode occasionally after hound with did shooting week after coming home father have again gone up to town remained there until after horace have returned to eton be lad observed more abstracted even than usual be at same time restless unsettled looked eagerly for post received despatched large number of letter horace supposed that must be engaged in very sharp interesting controversy a to disputed reading meaning of obscure passage until evening before went away father said suppose horace be following with interest course of event in thessaly well father see paper of course there seems to be row going on there be always fighting about something from what must understand of ali pasha of janina have revolted against sultan turk be besieging what sort of chap be be albanian be yes with virtue vice of race ambitious avaricious revengeful cruel brave astute have be instrument of porte in breaking down last remnant of independence in wide district rule a know very many of christian mussulman village possessed armed guard called armatoli who be responsible not only for safety of village for security of road defence of pass be committed to be able to keep numerous band of brigand within moderate bound organization ali pasha set to work to weaken a soon a came into power played off one party against other mussulmans against christian brigand against armatoli one powerful chief against crushed suliots who possessed greater amount of independence perhaps than of other tribe who must be owned be scourge to neighbour took away real power from armatoli crippled mussulman community a well a weakened christian village inspired terror in whole population by massacre of such a resisted will whom must not crush by force removed by poison finally became so strong that be evident design be to become altogether independent of sultan miscalculated power army fled almost without striking blow son who commanded be fugitive prisoner now hear that be besieged in fortress be capable of withstanding very long siege must be thorough old scoundrel must say father yes mr beveridge assented somewhat unwillingly doubt be bad man horace might have be may even yet be useful to greece when first became evident that matter must come to struggle between porte issued proclamation calling upon christian to assist make common cause against turk specially invited greece to declare independence of turkey to join must say father albanian must be even worse master than turk doubt horace doubt turk may own have not on whole be hard master to christian be much harder upon mussulman population than upon christian a latter can complain to russian who a co religionist claim to exercise special protection over indeed christian power give protection more le to christian greek who especially in morea have something approaching municipal institution be governed largely by men chosen by therefore pasha take good care not to bring trouble on porte by interfering with so long a pay tax be by mean excessive while mussulman part of population having protector be exposed to sort of exaction be limited only by fear of driving into insurrection still rebellion of ali pasha have naturally excited hope in mind of greek friend that result may arise from better opportunity be likely to occur for to make effort to shake off yoke of turk may imagine horace how exciting be to one who like be son of greek mother to whom therefore glorious tradition of greece be story of own people a yet hope be faint there be greater prospect now than there have be for last two hundred year must give be worth in world to live to see greece recover independence chapter iv startling proposal after horace returned to eton remembering intense interest of father in affair of greece read up a far a must everything relating to late event there that must obtain really fair view of situation be impossible greek have countryman in commercial city in world be active intelligent passionately desirous of interesting europe in cause upon other hand turk be voiceless hence europe only heard greek version of state of affair wrong be exaggerated event distorted with utter disregard for truth while whisper of other side of question be ever heard at time term greek be applied to person of greek religion rather than of greek nationality population of european turkey of pure greek blood be extremely small while who held greek form of religion be very numerous influence possessed by be even greater christian be in point of intelligence activity wealth superior to turk be subservient cringing when suited purpose be a rule utterly unscrupulous consequence be that worked way into post of responsibility emolument in great number being selected by porte in preference to duller le pushing turk in portion of european turkey be powerful in transylvanian province of moldavia wallachia post be held by greek there be few small scattered turkish garrison yet here population be incomparably more cruelly fleeced ground down by greek master than be christian in more turkish province in servia part of bulgaria number be more even here also greek held most of responsible post in greece proper christian vastly predominated while in northern thessaly number of christian mussulmans be about same greek metropolitan of constantinople council exercised large authority by mean of bishop priest over whole christian population while for time secret society named philike hetaireia have be at work preparing for rising be started originally among greek at odessa be secretly patronized by russia then a since have design upon constantinople first outbreak have occurred in march when prince alexander hypsilantes who have be officer in russian service crossed pruth be joined by greek official tax gatherer of transylvanian province be vain empty headed utterly incompetent adventurer small band of youth belonging to good family enrolled under title of sacred band army also joined beyond cold blooded massacre of considerable number of turk family did absolutely nothing main body of population who bitterly hated greek oppressor remained quiescent russia seeing utter incapacity repudiated after keeping alive hope of follower by lying proclamation hypsilantes secured own safety by flight across austrian frontier when turkish army approached five hundred young men of sacred battalion fought nobly be killed almost to man with exception of band of officer who refused to surrender shut up in skulani in monastery of seko there defended bravely until last resistance be offered to turk insurrection be stamped out by beginning of june in meantime greece proper be rising though news came slowly horace saw that father hope be likely to be gratified that greek must probably strike blow at least for national independence more than shared general excitement that news caused among educated men throughout europe summer holiday passed uneventfully horace took long cruise in surf saw little of father who be constantly absent in london august came horace returned from last trip be feeling rather depressed at thought of going back to school in two day time met zaimes a entered house be father back from town zaimes yes mr horace told to tell a soon a returned that wished to go to at once in library be so unlike father to want to see particularly about anything horace went in in wonder a to what must be matter mr beveridge be walking up down room be mind very much set on going back to eton horace asked abruptly know father horace said taken somewhat aback at question well must very much rather go back father than be doing nothing here be very fond of sailing a amusement one must not want to be at always of course if there be anything really to do must be different well think there be something else to do horace know feeling with regard to insurrection in greece yes father horace who be indeed rather tired of subject replied well see boy have now resisted turk for five month have gained rather than lost ground seems to show decisively that be mere hasty rising that people be in earnest in determination to win liberty now that be thoroughly convinced of course be clear have determined upon going out to give such assistance a can horace be astounded going out to fight father yes if necessary to fight can be of more use than in merely fighting have never since came into property twenty four year ago spent anything like third of income indeed since return from greece expense here have be few hundred year have always hoped that must have opportunity of devoting saving to help greece to regain independence moment have come at first feared that movement must speedily die out letter receive show that be increasing daily indeed that greek have placed beyond hope of forgiveness by be sorry to say massacre of large number of turk be of course to be regretted that so glorious cause must have be sullied by such conduct one can not be surprised slave be always cruel after wrong have suffered must hardly be expected that must forego revenge when opportunity at last came however important point of matter be that there can be drawing back now for better for worse revolution have begun now horace be sixteen be sensible lad have stood so much apart from other men from boyhood that be what might call unpractical while take that from temperament from being at great public school be eminently practical therefore will be glad to hear opinion a to how thing have best be set about take of course that be a interested in struggle a be well not so interested perhaps father feel of course that be horrible thing that people like greek to whom owe so much must be kept in slavery by turk who have never done good to mankind know of must certainly be glad to do everything in power to help of course come so suddenly upon just at present see what have best be done heard from friend in london that many young men be already starting to assist greek what will need most be not men arm money so at least greek friend write well father horace said bluntly must say have much better give arm than money have be reading thing up a much a must since began a far a can see upper class greek men who suppose will be leader be pretty bad lot quite a bad must say a turkish pasha yes quite agree with there horace see in country be enslaved political other career be closed young men devote to making money see that in history of jew through middle age be everywhere persecuted avenue to honourable employment be closed to consequently devoted to making money have be banker of king for hundred of year doubt be same thing with greek mass of people be uncorrupted with deed of great forefather always before will be sure show worthy of name doubt father think so too mind spending money on cause horace father asked anxiously because though be saving must in natural course of thing come to day not at father be a say saving having at heart a have independence of greece think can not be better laid out than assisting must certainly like to be laid out for not to go into pocket of lot of fellow who think more of feathering own nest than of freedom of greece so must say best thing must be to send out cargo of arm ammunition a beginning other cargo can go out a be required might of course take certain amount of money to distribute a see be required hope mean to take with think so horace be young to do fighting at present will be great support comfort to horace must scarcely resist smile for thought that if there be fighting to be done must be of considerably more use than father well suppose next thing horace will be to go up to town to inquire about arm greek friend there will advise a to purchase so on yes father horace said little doubtfully a be late now think if mind will get supper turn in will think over think have better talk over quietly quite make up mind what be best to be done before set about anything few hour wo make difference quite so horace be use beginning by making mistake be great comfort to boy to have with at rate will write to night to headmaster say that circumstance will prevent return to eton term horace went into next room have supper then went thoughtfully up to bed idea of going out to fight for independence of greece be one at other time must have regarded with enthusiasm under present circumstance felt depressed rather than excited admired father for great learning loved for kindness of intention towards have during last two three year be more more impressed with fact that in everything unconnected with favourite subject father be a said utterly unpractical left management of estate to steward management of house to zaimes happily a chanced honest capable men have be rogue must have victimized to extent that father who lived in library who be absorbed in past must plunge into turmoil of insurrection be almost bewildering idea must be plundered right left must believe story told while a for fighting thing seemed absolutely absurd horace felt that whole responsibility must be on shoulder seemed altogether too much for then admission of father that abominable massacre have be perpetrated by greek shook enthusiasm in cause must be glad to see free independent that said want to be fighting side by side with murderer among such fellow a father who be great deal more greek than greek of present day must say must be made utterly miserable admits that upper class be untrustworthy avaricious now say that lower class have massacred people in cold blood doe not affect much in distance if be in middle of must be such shock to that believe must kill besides fancy going long march in mountain sleeping in wet sort of thing when have never walked mile a far back a can remember lay tossing about for couple of hour then sat suddenly up in bed be exclaimed that be splendid idea what fool be not to think of before if william martyn be at home must be thing above then lay down thought matter over for half hour then went quietly off to sleep well horace have be turning matter over in mind father asked a soon a sat down to breakfast have father have hit upon plan seems to very best thing possible in way what be horace well father seems to that if take out war material to athens will very likely get into wrong hand altogether when arm be really wanted by people of mountain expect that be who will do fighting not people of town there wo be to give next thing be if go to athens people know that be rich englishman will get surrounded by shark before have time to know who be to be trusted anything about money will be gone then be sure that must not in way take active part in helping to free greece never must stand march in mountain sleeping in open air bad food sort of thing after living quiet indoor life have for so many year know must stick to father a long a must seems to must be sure to get knocked up yes ought to have prepared for horace must have be better for to have taken regular exercise day even if did get through little le work still be stronger than think be only forty four man at forty four ought to be able to do nearly a much a ever must do yes father if have lived active life exercised muscle have doubt be just a strong in many thing a other men never remember being ill for day be sure be not fit for knocking about among mountain have be thinking of be if approve of will go over to exmouth morning see if william martyn be there be likely to be at home if vessel be in port if be not will get father to recommend one there must be lot of young lieutenant on half pay who must jump at idea first must engage with martyn if be there go to man whom father recommended to at plymouth get to buy for fast schooner brig one have be english privateer captured frenchman must be about thing arrange with to be captain engage officer crew get to arm with a many gun a will carry must be able probably to put into best way of buying musket a such immense number of soldier have be paid off doubt there have be great sale of musket by government might get at quarter price must have to pay for new one of course must take in ammunition in large quantity mountaineer have doubt got gun ammunition will be thing most wanted of must also pick up cannon doubt be to be bought for scrap iron greek will want to arm ship battery in way see father must have everything under own hand nobody must know how many musket have got on board must serve out when how be required same with money must cruise about pop into quiet place send arm ammunition up into hill of course directly got out there must put ship under greek flag by harassing turk at sea might do hundred time more good than must by land there must be fatigue discomfort must always be comfortable on board must take zaimes marco with must take tom burdett a boatswain be boatswain in navy know if go daresay dick will also go with be excellent plan horace seems to meet difficulty be really feeling uncomfortable at thought of being mixed up in confusion excitement there will doubt be at athens be most happy idea will not lose moment about like young fellow martyn hope will be able to get hold of let name own term have not least idea whether captain of vessel of sort be paid five pound week twenty five of course will be dangerous service must be liberally paid for well have better pack up bag directly have finished breakfast may be away for week ten day ca start to day father surely why not horace because know arranged must go over to dine at aunt of course horace quite forgot that be very annoying suppose ca be helped horace laughed day wo make much difference father be sure aunt must be very vexed if did not turn up do mean to tell anything about mr beveridge be silent for minute think there be occasion do horace said doubtfully might raise objection know though of course must make difference argument be always to be avoided aunt be always very positive woman think be just a well to say nothing about horace said with slight smile for felt sure that aunt must oppose project tooth nail if be aware of that must be backed by whole strength of mother family did not say went on be nuisance being asked tremendous lot of question about thing especially when know much about think father have better keep quite quiet will be time enough to write line to aunt tell that be off last thing before get up anchor agree with horace so will say nothing about trip of ours well a seems ca go to day have better make arrangement to catch coach to morrow morning will sign dozen blank cheque can fill up a required of course accepts post of captain will know will be wanted for

otherwise believe be honest hardworking fellow a for upper class of greek le have to do with better when get chance grind down countryman deal worse than turk do be slippery customer mistake must rather take turk simple word than solemn oath from greek veracity be hardly one of conspicuous virtue doctor put in quietly take that ancient be so accustomed to swear by god even after have ceased to believe in that came to consider oath by be not binding so got into way of lying generally descendant have never amended way in particular since on more than one occasion when there be trouble between sailor greek attended court for good downright hard swearing never heard approached wonder that turk refuse to allow christian to give evidence in court will see when get out have grave doubt whether there have be revolution at whether be not got up thing altogether just to see what rest of world say to others laughed there be one thing doctor miller said have heard from european who be out there

sorry be not here to meet father horace said did not think must be here until night coach did not expect to find here horace so be disappointment well look bronzed well boy friend seem to have done wonder in getting everything done so soon be quite anxious to see ship be to go on board evening if mind father must much rather did go off till morning said that if came must breakfast early be ready for gig at half past eight wo be expecting to night be sure martyn others will like to have everything in best possible order when go on board have be expecting box of book wrote about week ago have turned up will be horrible nuisance if after way have be pushing everything forward must be kept waiting two three day for well horace fact be changed mind four box be packed in hall really be very large box zaimes said master what be going to do with book ca imagine where be going to put why must fill cabin up solid if be sir must not take one of just give holiday take pen in hand while be away will have plenty to see about to think about be sure must do deal of good to give up altogether for time will take up freshly afterwards besides will have people coming on board advice will be asked will have to decide sort of thing know wo be able to bring mind out of book if have on board said something like when first began to talk of packing seemed to impossible must give up work altogether sight of four great box staggered then said 'zaimes be not like little cabin on board yacht be quite large vessel in comparison 'yes sir ' replied 'but cabin wo be larger than main cabin in surf not so large must fancy ' surprised altogether assured be so pressed so much on matter at last agreed to leave behind be capital thing father zaimes be quite right state room be very nice cabin except that be good deal more lofty be certainly not so large by good deal a main cabin in surf besides if have book must be always shut up there what thought of along from time first spoke about coming out be what good thing must be for to have thorough holiday to put aside old work altogether think valuable horace mr beveridge asked wistfully do father think most valuable one can be prouder than be of reputation that learned men must acknowledge immense value of work to greek student father after number of men who go into be very small ca see why life must be entirely given up to think that at rate will be first rate thing for extremely pleasant for that must be like rest of while be out on expedition a zaimes say will have lot of thing to decide upon be going to lead active stirring life be new greece will have to think about not greece of two thousand year ago be aim to raise not greek of time of miltiades people who in two thousand year have become race not only of slave of ignorant savage for massacre of unarmed people show that be nothing better not only to free to make worthy of being nation again think father there will be ample scope for thought attention in present without giving thought to nicety of language spoken by demosthenes so be truly heartily glad decided to leave book behind think be right horace be sure be right be wrench to to cut loose altogether from habit of lifetime now father what be going to do about clothes horace said looking at closely about clothes father repeated vaguely have brought two large box full with yes father doubt have clothes be sure that on board ship will be always living there know will be much more comfortable for to have clothes fit for sea frilled shirt ruffle tight breech high heeled hessian boot short waisted tail coat be very well on shore first time be out in good brisk gale must wish anywhere what want be couple of suit at least of blue cloth like mine with brass button low cloth cap like will keep on head whilst be blowing in fact sort of suit that owner of big yacht must naturally wear of course when go ashore to see of greek leader might like to go in ordinary dress really for sea want comfortable clothes good thick pea jacket for rough weather perhaps be right horace did remark that heel left mark upon deck of surf certainly did father must be agony to will martyn to have beautiful white deck of creole spoiled be too late now be half past eight o'clock oh can take to shop where keep sort of thing besides there be twelve hour before start by paying for one can get pretty nearly anything made in

morning to put on extra hand to turn out fresh suit for person for whom be intended gold lace white facing other distinguishing mark must be removed plain brass button substituted for royal button two three pair of shoe with low heel be also obtained clothes came home at seven in morning mr beveridge came down to breakfast looking like smart captain of merchantman feel a if be dressed for masquerade horace said with smile illustration discussion about clothes look first rate father lot more comfortable than usual can tell be at martyn suggestion that horace have urged father to make change in attire must be good thing if must get to put on sea going togs sailor have said be owner of a smart craft a ever sailed out of british water will look good deal more at home on deck of own ship in regular yachtsman dress than must rigged up in ruffle boot with horace have agreed heartily for father appearance on occasion when have gone out with in surf have struck a being wholly incongruous with surroundings at half past eight went down to step two porter carrying luggage under watchful eye of zaimes a be seen smart gig with six rower be lying short distance off rowed in to step tarleton be steering stepped out to hand mr beveridge into boat be mr tarleton father second lieutenant be glad to meet sir mr beveridge said shaking hand with young officer hope that will have

luggage be placed in bow bowman pushed boat off with boat hook oar have be tossed in man of war fashion fell with splash into water then with long steady stroke gig darted away from step be certainly very pleasant mr beveridge said a threaded through anchored craft made way seaward begin to wish have taken up yachting twenty year back well be not too late father when have done with greece can go in for amusement if like must never find time horace oh must make time father must spare three month in year be better for when have once have break will find how pleasant be hour row horace said be creole father lying in there near farther point doe look a large a expected horace though mast seem great height be heavily sparred for length tarleton said have great beam besides be rather low in water now of course make spar look big in proportion will be bit higher by time get out fifty men consume considerable weight of store water week will be pleased with sir when get alongside think be a handsome craft a ever set eye on will astonish turk warrant when come to sailing twenty minute be alongside according to naval etiquette horace mounted ladder first then tarleton mr beveridge followed martyn miller received at gangway former introducing first officer surgeon to be fine looking vessel mr beveridge said have certainly done marvel with captain martyn for son wrote that have nothing lower mast in when took possession now be wonderfully bright clean deck look almost too white to walk on hope that will always keep in equal order sir have capital crew one must wish for better craft under foot mr beveridge be now conducted round ship expressed highly gratified with everything be wish that must make sail at once sir martyn asked have be expecting heavy luggage on board have not arrived changed mind about there be nothing coming captain martyn be perfectly ready to start if have everything on board there be nothing to wait for sir be perfectly ready returned to quarter deck a martyn gave order there be general movement on part of crew of men clustered round capstan while others prepared to make sail mr beveridge felt keen sense of pleasure a watched active fellow at work in five minute sail be set anchor at cat head creole moving through water under light breeze off shore have favourable wind across bay down coast of portugal everything from start have gone a smoothly a if creole have be six month in commission officer men be alike pleased with ship provision for sailor be of best quality duty be very light for sail have not required altering from time have be set although day men practised for hour at lowering setting in order to accustom to work smartly together there be hour cutlas drill for rest of day beyond cleaning polishing there be nothing to be done mr beveridge spent greater part of time in comfortable deck chair on quarter deck for there be poop deck being flush from end to end horace attended to duty a third officer regularly night be so warm pleasant that watch did not appear long to there be stiffness in cabin when gathered to meal in evening mr beveridge proved in way wet blanket on fun a three officer have rather anticipated must be talked little be thoroughly amused at yarn jest of be a strange to a if have lived in world will certainly have to cut off ration bit mr beveridge will martyn said one day a finished dinner will be getting a fat a porpoise if go on like can feel togs filling out daily a for tarleton will have to have thing let out by time arrive in levant for credit of ship will have to give order for to be supplied with same ration a men go in for luxury only on sunday be not accustomed to be tempted in way at meal be very well for who eat much more than sparrow to have such nice thing always put before to who have be accustomed to steady diet of salt junk except when put into port be able to get fresh meat for change thing be beyond power of resistance eat great deal more than did on shore mr beveridge said find indeed wonderful improvement in appetite be quite infliction to zaimes cared so little for good thing provided with can assure really begin to look for meal now be pleasure for to see eat with good healthy appetite be sure that must be great gratification to greek to see effort appreciated at last be tarleton be thinking of principally sir a for miller nature made square must be disadvantage if became round while a to doctor food be simply wasted on will never do credit to cook tarleton with dark eye of gentle sort of way be what lady must consider interesting youth must be sure forfeit good opinion of lady altogether if be to return looking like mildly animated sausage tarleton joined in laugh do think have gained lot in weight last week said wo always go on in quiet sort of way a for what martyn say believe be only jealousy on part at seeing that angle be filling out on arriving at strait put in at ceuta obtained supply of fresh meat vegetable in mediterranean fell in with dead calm be fortnight in getting to gozo where again replenished stock abstained from putting in at gibraltar malta in order to avoid being questioned a to cargo destination of creole now sir will martyn said when be within two day sail of greece be quite time to decide what port will make for ca decide that until know how matter be going on when left england there be very conflicting account of progress of revolution whether corinth patras nauplia athens be in hand of greek turk well must say sir that best plan must be to put in at zante where a be english therefore neutral ground will learn about state of affair may meet of own people foreigner who have be fighting by side of greek hour talk with one of must give better idea how everything stand than week talk with greek think will be very good plan mr beveridge agreed flying english flag might go in out of of harbour a neutral if by chance leaked out what cargo be turk must probably consider justified in laying hand on at rate be well not to run risk mr beveridge a there be object to be served by will take bearing of zante lay course for there be indeed spot where be more likely to obtain accurate news of what be going on than zante lying a island doe at short distance from mouth of gulf of corinth upon be three of most important town in greece patras corinth missolonghi here too fugitive from morea of party must naturally make way be th of october when creole flying english flag at peak dropped anchor in port a soon a did so custom house officer came on board what ship be asked first

white pleated petticoat bristling with arm mounted in gold silver few english soldier walking about a unconcernedly a if in garrison town at home sailor of several nationality from ship in harbour

hour ago mr beveridge said know very little about etiquette of thing seemed to proper thing be to call at once upon majesty representative here very right proper thing to do mr beveridge have be wondering what that craft must be where have come from if have be for flag tidiness of must have put down a greek pirate though often rig up craft a schooner have be something like pirate in time mr beveridge said for be slaver captured sent home a prize bought at plymouth fitted out mighty nice way of spending money too mr beveridge be biggest thing in way of yacht ever saw at see why gentleman

nothing a to how matter stand out here if will bring of officer off with will be very glad to see have only two here mr lester lieutenant will be on duty have doubt that plunket will be very glad to come off with if have special engagement be not likely for be mighty dull life here can tell be glad will be when order come to rejoin regiment at corfu mr beveridge horace walked about for time then returned on board met two greek in town shopping told that there must be guest at dinner met also will martyn tarleton who have come ashore short time after miller remaining on board in charge good many of men be also ashore have warned solemnly martyn said against drink quarrel be afraid that to night to morrow night will have good many of coming off noisy wine be cheap a have set foot ashore for five week be not in nature of english sailor to resist temptation care much a long a get into row with greek have told boat will be ashore at nine o'clock to fetch that who be not down there by hour will have allowance of grog stopped for fortnight have be arranged with captain o'grady that boat must be at step for at quarter to six horace went in charge of brought off two officer have comfortable quarter here indeed captain o'grady said when mr beveridge have introduced officer to companion sure must like nothing better than to travel about in craft like be like taking floating palace about with if officer be surprised at fitting of cabin be still more so at excellence of dinner up to time dessert be placed on table chatted a to incident of voyage when wine have gone round mr beveridge began questioning of course hear everything go on on mainland captain o'grady everything do say be well content must be if be heard thundering lie be told by greek rapscallion be enough to take one breath away to hear talk must not think that such valiant men have ever lived since day of noah yet with exception of little skirmish that have done be to starve out unfortunate heathen turk then after have surrendered on promise of good treatment to murder in cold blood with woman child hope that there have not be much of mr beveridge said gravely depends upon what call much of at very lowest estimate there have be thirty thousand murdered in cold blood since trouble began account put much higher there have not be single exception nowhere have spared mussulman poor beggar of farmer villager be killed man woman child in hundred of village whole of be destroyed without resistance have be same in large town greek began work at kalamata surrendered under solemn promise of life to turk soul be slain so have be along in district of laconia there be fifteen thousand mussulmans of two third at least be slain at missolonghi there be not twenty turk alive at navarino soul be murdered tripolitza surrendered only week ago saw by letter from colonel raybonde french officer who commanded greek artillery during siege that forty eight hour after entered city collected about two thousand person principally woman child drove up ravine murdered there altogether eight thousand mussulmans be killed during sack have heard of massacre till be sick of listening to story though at beginning hoped that greek must drive old turk out faith have come to think that if be to hear that whole race be utterly exterminated must feel more comfortable in mind than have be for time not content with murdering poor creature in many case villain tortured first have heard fellow who came over here boast of one albanian ruffian who told that have done told sir a if be thing to be proud of have satisfaction of taking by scruff of neck tail of white petticoat chucking off pier into sea when scrambled out offered satisfaction of gentleman seeing that be chief who thought small beer of there be deal of difficulty in explaining to how thing be managed in civilized country never felt more satisfaction in life than did next morning when put bullet into scoundrel body wet blanket seemed suddenly to fall over party in cabin a captain o'grady be speaking horace saw that miller who be sitting opposite to be undergoing internal convulsion in restraining from bursting into laugh will martyn who be facing mr beveridge at bottom of table looked so preternaturally grave horace felt that too be struggling to repress smile doctor nodded a if to signify that be exactly what have expected mr beveridge looked deeply concerned have heard something of in england captain o'grady though of course greek agent there suppress news must tell against countryman did not think be a bad a although for moment attempt to defend such atrocity must remember how long greek have be oppressed by turk people who have be in slavery for hundred of year to stranger alien in blood in religion in very primitive state of civilization except in city must be almost certain in first rising against oppressor to commit horrible excess same thing happened although happily on much smaller scale in own country captain o'grady in that without hundredth part of excuse that greek have true for mr beveridge captain o'grady admitted there be denying that have turned table on there be mighty difficult a say to hold savage peasantry in hand be same thing in french revolution again be practically revolt of slave behaved like fiend number of person murdered men of own race religion remember be at least a great a of who have be massacred here revolt called jacquerie in middle age be equally ferocious number of victim must probably have be a great have not revolt be nipped in bud regret deeply conduct of greek think be only what be to be expected from people naturally fierce revengeful under circumstance maybe be right mr beveridge though did not look at in light before who be leader now faith be leader one day one hears one man name mentioned be hard enough to crack one jaw next day be upset have taken place dirty little chief of brigand set up a leader a be about only chap who understand anything about fighting come to front if only spent twentieth part of time in preparing for war do in quarrelling among a to share of spoil seems to must make much better fight than be likely to do there be fellow called odysseus be way of pronouncing ulysses used to command mohammedan albanian under ali pasha now have turned round fight against old master be one of chief of then there be kolokotronis mavrocordatos must say be two principal men just at present then there be chap called prince demetrius hypsilantes be brother of fellow who got up rising up in north of danube pretend to be head of greek demetrius say be invested by brother with sort of viceroyalty over greece want to have own way then there be greek bishop priest be pretty well against rest want to keep peasantry under thumb then there be primate have got big lot of power do mean archbishop captain martyn asked not bit of primate be sort of half half officer be supposed to be chosen by people of own district of course be always big wig chap with most power influence once chosen became turkish officer collected tax be accountable for money for doings of district nicely ground people down feathered own nest naturally when turk went became local leader people have one else to look to priest in morea two class have power in hand north of that hear much of primate think have of there be albanian klephts be brigand of fighting clan such a suliots band of armatoli be sort of village militia who be backbone of rising chief be jealous of other if one fellow proposes plan others differ from if there be one of big leader there plan be adopted others march away to home do what can to prevent from succeeding great thing with chief be to get spoil people be different really want to fight turk to win freedom be because see that not one of leader be honest that jealousy keep from common action that will not unite to form central government that people have confidence in just follow one man until get disgusted with then go off to join everything be wasted spoil have taken have be enormous people be little better for be divided among chief not penny of have gone to form fund for defence have captured enormous quantity of ammunition have fired away like child just to please with noise at one place be told by englishman who be there that two million cartridge captured be wasted in what called rejoicing in course of three day what want be big man fellow who will begin by hanging hundred politician a many chief bishop primate who must organize first government then army must insist that halfpenny taken a spoil from turk must be paid into public treasury then sir believe that greek must polish off sleepy turk in time with advantage have in knowing foot of mountain in being a active a goat in possessing idea that be fighting for freedom mind say that turk will beat even a be turkish pasha be a incapable a greek leader soldier be good a greek have regular army idea of standing up to fight turk ca get at greek can move about quickly fall upon at own time besides will bring to standstill by starvation care about attacking turkish troop be down like pack of wolf on baggage train if turk venture distance from sea coast will be harassed out of life have turk still command of sea there greek ought to be match anyhow turk still send store ship escorted by men of war frigate corvette greek hover round among take care to keep pretty well out of range of turkish gun only idea of fighting seems to be to launch fire ship at man of war be burnt while at anchor short time back by knaris who be best sailor greek have got still at present turk be so far master of sea that take convoy where like can revictual fortress whenever have energy to do so on other hand greek scour sea in direction not single merchant ship flying turkish flag dare show nose outside dardanelles be cruelty on one side horace asked not bit of of course turk have not have much chance yet when have have have naturally paid greek in own coin in thessaly have put down rising ruthlessly when troop go into place find that whole of people have be murdered be not to be wondered at set to to play same game on who began work of massacre greek hate turk object be to root out altogether turk despise greek want to root out by mean because if did there must be no longer revenue to collect turk seem to strike more at leader have strung up lot of greek living in constantinople a whole affair be got up there greek be most of taking sultan pay while be plotting against be only just that if anyone be to suffer must be men what be afraid of be that when news of horrible massacre of eight thousand people at tripolitza get known turk in asia minor will everywhere retaliate upon greek settled among ca do much in greece for most of people can take to mountain there be almost a many of settled in asia minor a there be here for be trader shopkeeper in port be afraid will go mighty hard with everywhere when turk come to know atrocity have be perpetrated over here if greek have thought for moment when began must have seen that be game two must play at for turk must murder turk have in hand three greek at least that must put end to to mind be bad business altogether plunket will tell have not put bit too strongly not in least young officer said tale fellow tell be ghastly have over here by dozen man be leader one day fugitive next run over here till see chance of landing again getting together fresh band actually make boast of horrible massacre have taken part in if islander here saw way to must rise against a be have be a much a can do more than once to prevent going on board neutral vessel put into harbour with few wretched turkish fugitive murdering fact be greek believe that be christian be just a much pagan a be two thousand year ago sympathy be altogether with in struggle for liberty try to make allowance for action do believe that if what o'grady say must be carried out leader politician bishop primate hung people must carry on struggle with ten time chance of success have at present for must then be forced to form strong central government might find honest man to put at head regard in light of religious war rather than one for national freedom suppose at least mussulmans who have fallen be of greek blood for especially in north nearly tribe have changed religion become mohammedan since conquest be there many european fighting with mentioned french colonel commanding greek artillery in siege of tripolitza good many there be austrian frenchman italian few of own people among last be general gordon naval lieutenant although greek know nothing whatever of military matter be jealous in extreme of interference even advice from foreigner believe there be altogether thirty forty foreign officer who came over to fight for only two three of have got employment of sort a to attempt to introduce military discipline raise anything like body of regular soldier seems impossible believe entirely in fighting in own way dispersing when choose just a spanish guerilla band did during peninsular war in fact seems to that greek character resembles spanish very much peasantry in country being brave animated by patriotic hate of enemy while upper class be equally vain cowardly given to boasting absolutely faithless to promise if have duke of wellington here with couple of hundred good officer must make greek into a good soldier a did of portuguese must a likely a not wind up war by driving turk out of europe altogether at half past ten o'clock officer went ashore when have left ship others returned to cabin must not take to heart mr beveridge will martyn said cheerfully seeing how depressed employer looked at news have heard of course greek have behaved badly horribly badly see be because poor beggar be not much better than savage never will be better a long a be kept down by turk thing will right in time a said be worse than french when rose than spanish peasantry whenever got chance irish peasantry must not look at from own standpoint once be free will get settled government become nation again be what have got to help to do be not going to land take part in massacre have got to do be to look out for turkish ship of war pull down colour whenever get chance even more than what want specially to do a soon a can be to get rid of of cargo in hold be what be bothering at present thank martyn mr beveridge said holding out hand to be trying to hear of glorious cause being disgraced by such horrible atrocity cause remains same atrocity be a say such a have occurred among other people when blood have be heated to boiling point will not shake determination to aid greece in struggle for freedom chapter vii change of name next two day mr beveridge horace spent entirely on shore speaking modern greek fluently be able to converse with people of class from mainland learned from report that captain o'grady account of utter confusion existing from end to end of country be in way exaggerated a soon a greek perceived that mr beveridge be well wisher to cause judging from possession of large yacht to be wealthy man innumerable scheme be proposed to involving placing in hand of proposer advancing considerable sum of money project mr beveridge resolutely turned deaf ear to resolution being greatly strengthened by horace who distrusted plausible adventurer profoundly must wait father said until see something like stable government in power when have be at work bit find that make authority respected restores order unites people in common effort will be time enough for to let have money to give now must simply be to waste indeed worse than waste for must only add to struggle for power on greek be wasting strength from learn sailor of hydra spetzas psara be only men who at present be acting with common object a everything depends upon crippling turk at sea must think must not do better than get rid of of gun ammunition by giving to if must get rid of twenty thirty ton of cargo must put in first rate sailing trim at rate get something off mind then from there must sail to athens get paper require authorizing to act a greek privateer of course must be protection to if fell into hand of turk must hing until get without acting a pirate rendering liable to be hung by european man of war might overhaul course be determined upon to great satisfaction of william martyn after stay of three day at zante sail be again set creole left anchorage be well that did so for next day greek sympathy must have be insufficient to prevent fighting on other side algerine barque have separated from turkish fleet have just captured galaxidhi have taken possession of thirty four greek brig be attacked by eighteen hydriot ship refused to surrender made gallant resistance that hydriots did not venture to run alongside carry by boarding algerines knowing that if spar be shot away must all be killed ran ashore near southern cape of zante fight have be witnessed by thousand of refugee moreots zanteot peasant who opened fire upon algerines when landed two english officer with twenty men have gone down from town to enforce obedience to quarantine regulation be very strict ordered greek to retire refused continued to attack turk officer commanded men to fire over head of crowd when zanteots at once turned musket against one soldier be killed rest retired into house with turk defended until stronger body of english troop came down from town rescued for firing upon troop killing one of five zanteots be afterwards tried executed lord high commissioner issued proclamation forbidding entry of turk greek men of war into ionian port greek commercial navy before outbreak of revolution consisted to large extent of shipping of four little island hydra spetzas psara cazos island be small barren have sprung into importance by wise policy of sultan at beginning of eighteenth century seeing that exaction of own official rendered impossible for greek mussulman sailor to compete with of other nation have exempted from tax other burden person settling on island have allowed to perfect self government result have answered expectation colony of albanian sailor have established at hydra spetzas while greek seaman have settled in psara cazos four island became populous flourishing owning among nearly three hundred craft of from sixty to four hundred ton contrast between population manner of four island be very marked two albanian island be governed by twelve primate elected by wealthy while in greek island government be purely democratic albanian be by far more sincere honest while people of two greek island be more courteous have early thrown in lot with revolution peace of have caused great reduction in price of grain on continent fall of freight consequently many ship remained unemployed prosperity of island diminished sailor became discontented clamorous for employment spetzas have be first to declare for revolution have at once sent off ship have captured turkish corvette of twenty six gun brig of sixteen with small crew be waiting at milo to receive contingent of sailor from albanian island turk expecting attack be taken by surprise first greek naval success be dimmed by mussulman prisoner being carried to spetzas where be at once murdered rest put to death with horrible torture psara quickly followed example of spetzas hydra be time before raised greek flag people be in favour of revolution wealthy ship owner who possessed power be averse to fitting out vessel for unprofitable service opposed revolution until popular insurrection broke out authority be set aside united fleet of three island instead of attacking turkish fleet be occupied in conveying store ship to besieged garrison swept sea of merchantman attacked plundered austrian vessel two hydriot brig captured turkish ship with very valuable cargo carrying among other passenger recently deposed sheikh el islam patriarch of mussulmans family on board be murdered by captor affair in end benefited turk for captor refused to conform to regulation have be laid down that booty must be common property of fleet quarrel began between sailor of different island so that fleet broke up be for long time useless for concerted action against turk creole visited three island in succession handing over to authority in ten gun with considerable amount of powder shot thousand musket ten thousand round of ammunition there be large amount of shipping in of harbour will martyn have creole gun loaded double shotted before entering there be saying what fellow may be up to remarked to horace seeing giving away so large quantity of valuable may think that have got gold mine on board mean to close eye while be in harbour can tell mr beveridge personally be received with much honour at island gun will martyn have taken care must be largest of in hold be dragged up by people placed in battery creole then crossed to piraeus acropolis of athens be still held by turk who be closely besieged there will martyn landed with mr beveridge horace told father that must rather not accompany will be going about seeing people father said a say may have to go to other place to find of nominal authority to sign document so on authorizing to hoist greek flag giving usual paper carried by privateer may take time for martyn think that a greek have such formality fight turk just a find may be difficult for to persuade that letter of marque be really required authorizing vessel a greek ship to capture burn destroy turkish vessel may meet be mere formality horace well father think that martyn others look at at in light know consider absolutely necessary that must have paper of sort even with such paper say expect there will be lot of difficulty if take prize in disposing of that unless have paper signed by central government chance be that moment turkish prize be brought into port greek will seize a public property want to cut throat of turk prisoner certainly must not stand that must be in position of having to fight turk at sea greek in port so must not be surprised at if be ten day fortnight before can get paper want of course martyn signature will be necessary to sort of thing a there be humbugging will be wonderfully useful to in sort of way why must not go with too horace must very much rather not father of course be quite with in wishing to see greece independent be so disgusted with story of horrible atrocity have be guilty of at way in instead of joining together to fight turk be bent only on getting power spoil of behaving more like collection of band of brigand than united people must rather not see more of at present will get regularly to hate in short time have doubt will hear of lot of thing done by other side may be sure that turk will avenge eight thousand mussulmans who be murdered at tripolitza heard at zante that have begun then one thing will balance other may get enthusiastic about greek again at present father what must like to see be that creole must be employed a rescue ship how do mean horace mean father that must try to save a many of wretched turk woman child from massacre a can on other hand that must try to save a many greek a possible from vengeance of turk there ought to be lot of opportunity way if be with greek when capture turkish vessel can buy off prisoner greek be fonder of money than even of blood money will be deal better spent that way than if wasted among politician captain of brigand primate must do good to cause of greece by saving from dishonour when greek make descent upon turkish island must send boat ashore take off lot of inhabitant must do same thing when turk attack greek place island if greek turk interfere with at work must say let thrash whoever be consider must be glorious mission must be credit to flag fly whether be greek english if be must speak out to kolokotronis other leader may meet tell frankly that have come out to help greek with arm money that massacre will turn europe against that unless be provided with authority to take hold turkish prisoner to protect from populace sailor will withdraw altogether will do best to prevent such atrocity even if come to firing upon greek vessel engaged in will do so horace father said in tone of decision be match fancy for dozen of greek ship will find very different vessel to deal with than slow sailing turk quite approve of what say for first outburst of vengeance when rose be willing to make allowance revenge taken by turk at kydonia must have reminded that there be at least million of fellow countryman in asia minor whose life have be endangered by atrocity henceforth will a propose devote to saving life part of money have intended for greek will go to make up to crew for loss may sustain by missing chance of taking prize will hoist greek flag a intended at least will keep unsullied horace repeated substance of conversation to will martyn other two officer who cordially agreed for although have of course heard le at zante of detail of massacre than employer son have done have heard enough to fill with indignation to disgust with cause that have come out to defend will be first rate martyn said can foresee will have lot of fun be likely to end by fighting party there will be plenty for to do will see if ca cut off of turkish vessel laden with greek captive for sale a slave in market of alexandria while a for greek if slip in save captive will be like pack of wolf after prey if be to go with father horace may be sure will take opportunity may get of speaking out reckon will open eye of of greek swell by way will give tell what miller while be away do get up eight of eighteen pounder from hold mount instead of twelve now that have got so much of weight out of can carry well enough fancy be likely to want a heavy metal a can mount before have done at dinner that day horace said be thinking of changing name father when change nationality be thinking of changing name at horace mr beveridge said in surprise well thought father greek must understand name of creole at be good name for slaver did well enough for yacht if ever take back to england must like to be creole think must be better to have name that greek will understand what name must propose horace well father have be thinking of if have objection must like to call misericordia pity ' came out here because pitied greek now pity unfortunate people turk greek have agreed that mission will be to save of from slaughter think must be very good name horace misericordia will be what do say captain martyn think must be capital name mr beveridge martyn said crew will fight better when know what name mean what intend to do sailor have particular love for greek always regard a treacherous beggar have particular hostility against turk who fought pluckily enough on side in egypt have always be friendly with be sure that when fellow understand that what be going in for be to save woman child from being murdered whether happen to be greek turk will find ready to do anything next day mr beveridge will martyn landed miller set crew at work to mount eighteen pounder in place of twelve to get ammunition for into fighting magazine in place of of lighter calibre zaimes have accompanied mr beveridge marco remained on board have leave morning to go on shore first thing after breakfast to remain there until late in afternoon when came off in time for dinner brought news that be believed turk in acropolis must not hold out much longer a provision be running very short after absence of ten day party on shore returned hour after did so english flag be lowered that of greece be hoisted while flag with word misericordia replaced that of creole at masthead captain martyn called crew together lad said knew that when arrived here be going to hoist greek flag instead of own that be going to act a greek privateer against turk that see be done be authorized by greek government to capture destroy turkish vessel may meet see have changed name will tell why mr beveridge have done be going to fight for greece at same time a british sailor be not going to stand by see men woman child murdered in cold blood whether be turk anyone else there have be great deal too much of sort of thing done on side mean to stop a much a can be going to prevent massacre of greek by turk hope will manage to lay hand on of turkish vessel carrying greek woman child captive to sell a slave on other hand intend to save a many turk a can from being massacred by greek be reason why mr beveridge have renamed craft misericordia mean 'the pity ' be sure lad that there be not british sailor who must not risk life to save of woman child be what mean to make first object although hope to lower turkish flag before have done with in case mean to save life whether be greek turk have to fight in doing so be work lad in may be proud to take part in whether fight under english flag greek will be doing duty dear to british sailor now lad will give three cheer for misericordia three hearty cheer rang out from sailor have be on shore at zante have heard enough from soldier fraternized with there to fill with disgust indignation at conduct of greek announcement that must henceforth put stop to such cruelty even if have to fight for filled with satisfaction have hard work of martyn said to horace talking over visit ashore in first place wanted to hand over prisoner took plunder value of prize to miserable government told that must see at bottom of sea first be with father at meeting with fellow call kolokotronis odysseus dozen other of leader must have seen how father spoke out got upon leg just poured out did not know of course what be saying told little about afterwards must see by face that be hot strong told that countryman have disgraced cause by conduct worthy only of lowest savage that if did not give authority demanded to interpose to save turk from massacre must sail on to constantinople hoist turkish flag fight against ship behaved like bloodthirsty pirate rather than greek patriot that must find ship very different opponent to turk did not think father have in be splendid can tell face of fellow be worth seeing expect ever have such straight talking to before believe altogether spent about thousand pound in bribing dozen of anyhow got what wanted in first place be authorized to hoist greek flag to capture destroy turkish vessel in second to dispose a please of prisoner may take on board turkish fugitive dispose of at pleasure free from interference from greek authority greek ship be to pay quarter of value of prize booty into treasury of central government be to send ashore to morrow five thousand musket twenty round of ammunition for father have have hard time of believe there have be single greek politician leader who have called upon privately to what call borrow money from at last have to regularly mount guard over set zaimes at door to tell comer that be too unwell to see anyone be not far from truth for be regularly upset at meanness trickery of people have come to spend fortune to assist however thank goodness be over be precious glad be back can tell for believe if have stayed there much longer must not have be able to have prevented from walking into of father have be trying to find out whether have got general plan of defence have more plan than lot of child must have if got up rebellion everyone want to be leader everyone complains of everyone else scarcely seem to give turk thought energy be occupied by own miserable squabble rivalry well want to set foot on shore again a long a be out here unless be on real expedition what about turk in acropolis martyn be negotiating poor beggar know there be faith to be placed in greek so far there be not single instance in have kept promise for safety of garrison who have surrendered want guarantee of european consul for safety ca give a have force here to protect told consul that must lend whole of crew if liked that thought must pretty well clear out town said that must be well enough if there be one to protect that a there be something like two thousand men woman child up in citadel fifty men must never protect against mob however hope turk will be able to hold out for time yet greek only guess that provision be running short if man of war french english austrian come into harbour consul will ask commander to protect turk will then guarantee safety when be going to sail horace asked to morrow two greek will go ashore first thing in morning to lay in fresh stock of meat vegetable a soon a be on board will get up anchor have heard lot of shocking story on shore from greek who have escaped from asia minor turkish island there have be massacre in almost city where there be greek at smyrna adrianople salonika co rhodes in crete cyprus a far a can hear turk have altogether massacred nearly a many men woman child a greek have done saw general gordon who be warm friend of greek said that be impossible to justify ferocity of greek to deny that comparison between turk must give latter palm of humanity be if term humanity must be employed to went up saw of troop a call active hardy looking fellow seem in enough be ready a french officer said to to submit to anything discipline said that klephts armatoli be a fine material for mountain warfare a one must wish to see one day honest hard working peasant next engaged in partisan war in raid on neighbour frugal hardy active in way brave men who must never storm position stand against attack of turkish infantry cavalry a war have everywhere shown so far who must defend hillside hold ravine against good troop when driven out make stand at first position came to anyhow be worth lot more than townspeople who brag vapour go about armed to teeth who take precious good care never to get within range of turkish musket early next morning large boat came off musket ammunition be transferred to at noon two greek brought off boat load of fresh meat vegetable fowl egg fruit other store a soon a be slung on board anchor be got up misericordia under gentle breeze stole out to sea be better miller will martyn said a looked over side have not gone like since shook out sail for first time must say be just about in right trim now be ready to fight sail anything of size afloat how easily go through water there be scarcely ripple in wake be beauty port now martyn be talking over last night with mr beveridge a soon a get well off land be going to shape course will take down between cyprus alexandria be of use cruising about here turk only move about under convoy of men of war must not be much better across on other side for greek vessel be everywhere on look out like going far from home if cruise well to south will have good chance of falling in with craft bound for alexandria from cyprus crete syria of will be likely to be carrying greek captive to slave market at alexandria tunis tripoli be sort of craft to meet with miller said suppose be sure to be armed of course one must be glad to rescue captive save from horrible fate there will be much more satisfaction in doing if have bit of fight first yes must say be certain to be armed turk must venture to sea at present unless thought strong enough to beat off attack of at least two three of greek vessel after cruising about for bit intend to dodge about cyprus other turkish island keeping near coast so a to give greek fugitive chance of coming on board know that there have be massacre at island may be again there must be thousand of unfortunate creature who must give anything for chance of getting away can anchor in quiet bay for need have fear of boat attack if turk come out in force have always option of running away fighting be very good programme martyn be not likely a say to find greek craft cruising about between cyprus alexandria turkish vessel going up towards dardanelles coming down from there be prize worth taking for may have pasha rich official on board down there must be le likely to have anything must repay greek for risk of fight a for risking anything to save countryman mr beveridge be saying heard that at massacre of greek at kydonia although greek fleet under tombazes be close at hand launch went on shore rescued four thousand of countryman compelled to purchase passage to nearest greek island by giving up greater part of property have saved brute martyn exclaimed with great emphasis how fellow can be descendant of old greek beat altogether old greek be pretty cruel horace who have just joined said used to slaughter captive wholesale mercy be among virtue besides father say that except in morea very few indeed be descendant of greek rest be bulgarian albanian neither of whom greek of old must have recognized a kinsman be case of distance lending enchantment to view miller laughed illusion be gone never mind must make best of miller be not greek at rate be be left of greek action show that christianity be sham at same time be intelligent race capable of day becoming great people again be struggling to throw off yoke of race intellectually inferior incapable of progress in sort of way be what father said to a be walking up down deck morning be light mean to look at in future be capable people struggling with incapable one if be savage vindictive debased be fault not of of who have so long be master good martyn said be most satisfactory view of thing will stick to shut ear a much a possible in future against story to greek disadvantage in afternoon fleet of vessel be seen standing out from land there be one of greek fleet captain martyn said now will try rate of sailing with stand on for little bit longer then haul wind on same tack be sailing trial be perfectly satisfactory by greek fleet be far behind misericordia again shaped course for cyprus for week cruised backwards forward under easy sail about midway between cyprus alexandria without meeting with single craft flying turkish flag dozen vessel be overhauled be austrian italian british appearance of schooner evidently excited profound distrust in mind of master of vessel for hoisted rag of sail must set did best to escape from captain martyn have difficulty in overhauling satisfying of nationality astonishment of master when smart gig manned by six english sailor rowed alongside be unbounded be only equalled by satisfaction have given nice fright master of one of english ship said to miller who accompanied by horace have boarded what on earth be flying that greek flag for took for pirate for fellow be better when get chance be greek privateer miller said carry letter of marque issued by greek government only wanted to assure that be not turk turk be jiggered master said angrily must have thought anyone with eye must have seen that be one of lubberly turk quite so captain made that out time ago have only overhauled to ask whether know of turkish ship likely to be sailing from of eastern port object be to rescue greek woman child on way to slave market then give flipper master said be business english sailor need be ashamed of though a for sailing under greek flag must almost a lief sail under skull cross bone for nine case out of ten mean pretty nearly same thing have known many ship sail in among greek island never be heard of again when there have be no storm to account for disappearance must a lief anchor ship near land in malay archipelago a among greek island still woman child ai to blame for be at broussa two month ago slave market be chock full of greek girl child thought then what burning shame be that europe did interfere to put down such villainous doings well now a to turkish ship think be likely to meet with hereabouts greek have given bad scare fancy that ship from cyprus from aleppo other syrian port will run down due south till sight land will hug that a near a dare go till get within shelter of battery of alexandria if be after turkish vessel must stand south anchor a close inland a water will let get down lofty spar of yours want that craft of yours sail like witch think scarborough be fast brig went through water three foot to two so can do without topsail can tell look of craft be enough to frighten one fifteen mile away more rascally looking vessel never saw look like pirate over be slaver at one time miller said ah that account for thought that long low hull lofty spar be never put together for honest purpose seem to carry mighty heavy metal went on looking at misericordia lay with head sail aback few hundred yard away four side pivot look like eighteen be eighteen miller said see have got to keep sharp eye on friend a well a foe must think so well have just come out from larnaca heard from consul that there be bad doings in north of island that christian be having very rough time of through cyprus have doubt there be lot of christian hiding there who must give stiver have got in world to be on board craft say there be massacre going on when be there yes heard that turk be attacking one of christian village on north western corner of island be way up on mount olympus few mile from coast morphou bay be nearest point to hear be naturally strong place christian from other village round have gone in there people attacking be not troop who fancy have nothing to do with massacre native of mussulman village of poor devil may have got down to coast might pick up if be to cruise along there perhaps might horace said at rate must be worth try will go on board again at once will have glass of wine first got hold of good stuff at larnaca good wine be cheap there now thank will be off at once miller said well good bye gentleman good luck to there be nothing must like better than to be going for cruise with for few month for vessel can do better work than be engaged on miller horace dropped down into boat be rowed back to schooner chapter viii besieged village a soon a gained deck of misericordia miller reported advice skipper of english brig have given a to taking station near southern coast to pick up vessel hugging shore on way to alexandria west have doubt be right will martyn said that account for not having seen single craft flying turkish flag well mr beveridge think ca do better than take advice there be something else though horace broke in then told what captain have said about fighting among villager on mount olympus think father might go there first with wind must not be much more than twenty four hour getting there might pick up lot of fugitive in hiding possibly bring off people from village must not be great loss of time anyhow think might horace hearing of in way did seems almost like call to help what do say captain martyn just a like sir a horace say be great loss of time anyhow certainly may do good order be given schooner be headed for cyprus with brisk wind on beam heeled well over sent through water at nine half knot hour news be soon known through vessel that there be massacre going on in cyprus that there might be work to be done so there be air of increased activity animation among crew wind held steadily next morning mountain of cyprus must be seen lying like cloud in distance by eleven o'clock north westerly point of island be five six mile away rounding point entered great indentation known a morphou bay martyn now ordered topsail to be lowered will run along about mile off shore said can make out flag then will go along a far a other end of bay then come back again if there be people in hiding in wood will keep eye on a come back will come off in boat if have got will come down to shore signal can send boat in for a be still going through water faster than wished foresail be also lowered then went quietly along coast keeping sharp look out with glass on shore passed several village must see that appearance created much excitement that population at once deserted house made off be evidently mussulman village mr beveridge said be mussulman village at present mr beveridge martyn agreed chance be be christian short time ago see have got fishing boat riding at anchor hauled up fancy most of fishing be done by greek inhabitant expect turk have cleared out what do say mr beveridge to firing shot two at of village a pas will act a warning to turk to keep out of range if there be christian left may take opportunity of seizing boat coming off might lie to for hour opposite village to give chance of doing so must be very good plan think captain martyn a be passing village at moment misericordia be at once brought round two of broadside gun be loaded two shot be sent over village then craft be hove to waited for hour a there be sign of life again proceeded on way three more village be fired at with same result mile beyond furthest tarleton exclaimed there be someone swimming off captain martyn have just put off from point there do see black spot little way off point martyn turned glass in direction see said lower small gig mr tarleton take four hand row off pick up have better go too horace chance be wo speak anything greek in couple of minute boat left side of schooner rowed in direction of swimmer vessel being again thrown up into wind horace stood up while tarleton took tiller line can see horace asked not yet there be too much ripple on if keep head a be now will make out before long three four minute later exclaimed see be dead ahead five minute later swimmer be alongside be lad of about horace age be greek asked in surprise in alarm a looked at uniform of crew a horace helped on board be fighting for greece horace said although be english heard that there be trouble here came to see if must save fugitive saw flag lad said heard fire twice at village mother sister twenty thirty others be hidden in wood there mussulmans came down from mountain village three day ago killed must find be expecting for have gone to next village first man from there brought news just before arrived lived on outskirt have time to get away think father brother have be killed do go on shore take off must go back to ship first horace said boat be too small to be of use besides must send stronger crew doubt turk be watching will come down if see landing schooner have filled again be following boat so that in two three minute be on board horace lent young greek of clothes schooner stood in towards point with man in chain sounding a went ask whereabouts be horace just on other side of point will see coming see sign of yet tarleton said when having got within three hundred yard of shore anchor be let go be likely enough said martyn that of turk may have be coming down through wood if poor beggar heard must not dare show now mr miller take charge of long boat with ten men will cover landing four broadside gun be loaded with grape crew mustered to quarter while rest armed with musket lined side take boy with mr miller can lead to where friend be hiding stop to fire a make for shore will dispose of turk there may be about boat have not rowed more than fifty yard before five six musket shot be fired from bush near edge of water give round with aftermost gun captain martyn said in moment water near bush be torn up with shower of grape give next gun more elevation boatswain send shot well into wood be same with other two gun will clear out there be further firing at boat a soon a touched shore miller jumped ashore with eight of men while other two pushed boat off few yard led by greek boy party ran along shore be lost to view round point two more round be fired into wood everything be quiet there in five minute miller party made appearance round point with number of fugitive time be lost in getting into boat at once rowed off to schooner there be three men among rest be woman child most of be completely exhausted illustration give round said captain martyn horace after asking question two said to zaimes have better prepare soup zaimes a quickly a can have have nothing to eat for three day while be being done sip of wine mouthful of bread be given to in meantime sailor be rigging up partition with sail cloth across main deck here hammock be slung for use of woman child a soon a poor creature have taken basin of hot soup revived good deal poured out expression of profuse gratitude to rescuer have passed terrible three day crouching among bush expecting moment to be discovered few of woman have snatched up jewel before taking to flight most of be absolutely destitute mr beveridge two greek persuaded to go below take sleep so much needed a soon a deck be clear anchor be got up schooner proceeded on way reached farthest headland of bay just a night began to fall martyn decided to anchor there till morning from greek lad who have first swum off learned that village among mountain still resisted say there be two three hundred there who have taken refuge from village round there be rich men among be reason why mussulmans be so anxious to take place how many men be besieging know boy replied must think four five hundred have heard nothing for last three day place may have fallen since then went last night to village in hope of finding bread in of house there be too many turk about be near enough to hear talking of be going up to day to join in siege how far be place from sea be ten mile from north shore be not more than four five from western coast be there road not from side road from mountain village lead down to bay be too steep to climb from other side not too steep to climb on foot donkey mule must get up there matter be talked over in cabin that evening be agreed that if guide must be obtained attempt must be made to carry off occupant of village during night boat with twelve fugitive came off from shore a misericordia sailed slowly along coast on following day several party of from three to ten people came out from tree waved white handkerchief scarf be brought off four five boat full of people be picked up during day occupant have seen schooner passing on previous day have at night when mussulmans in village be asleep stolen down to beach launched boat put out to sea in hope that schooner must return next day be overwhelmed with joy at finding under greek flag although greater portion of have lost everything possessed woman child be like first batch provided for below while men boy be told must sleep on deck be hardship in balmy climate among in last boat picked up near west point of bay be young man who be native of village lying short distance from one be besieged happened to be down in coast village when turk commenced hostility there hearing that village to belonged have be destroyed have remained in hiding near coast marco brother who mingled with fugitive have learned at once took news to cabin say have be goat herd know path among mountain then be very fellow want to get hold of will martyn said have better have in here question young greek be brought in knew of several path from village down to western shore now what sort of place be village captain martyn asked stand at top of rocky ground that slope away round there be vineyard garden among rock since trouble in greece began people have be frightened have built wall five six foot high round village christian in village round decided that if there be trouble from mussulmans must go there to help defend be there high ground round village yes hill rise very high on three side be too far away for gun to do much harm besides house stand thickly together people will fight till last know how long provision will last know made up mind that if be besieged saw hope of succour must at last kill woman child to prevent being made slave by turk then must march out to fight until last man be slain how long must take to get up from shore to village one can come down in hour take three hour hard work to get up must after dark take close to point where one of path come down to shore oh yes must do easily very well that will do for present now mr beveridge be for to decide martyn said of course affair be risky one seems to that forty well armed english sailor ought to be able to make way into village without very much difficulty for of course turk will be scattered about round difficulty be not in getting in in getting out must have to bring perhaps two three hundred woman child cover retreat down to water of course men must help still must be stiff job in face of four five hundred of enemy turk may know nothing of soldiering be mountaineer be used to arm for irregular fighting like must be quite a formidable a best troop if knew anything about ground must be able to give more decided opinion what of course must want if possible must be post defile steep eminence that must hold for hour keep turk back until woman child be well on way down mountain after must make bolt for might get down without much loss if there be place where must make stand anywhere along road must be in awkward fix especially if path be bad one a expect be see whole party must have to go in single file if there be four five hundred of must be next to impossible to guard flank keep turk off if made rush while shot fired must tell on long line understand mr beveridge be putting matter to in worst light so that must understand sort of business be likely to be see that be very serious affair martyn at same time when know that there be so many life at stake think that must run risk however great very well then be settled mr beveridge be sure be glad that have decided so next question be who will go who will remain behind will certainly go mr beveridge said be not going to allow others to take risk share ought to be a strong party a possible martyn said at same time must leave enough to sail schooner if not to fight be probable that yesterday morning a soon a flag be seen messenger be sent off at once to limasol larnaca to tell that greek vessel be in bay if there be turkish vessel of war in of harbour will be having coming round be likely enough miller said must certainly be ready to get up anchor be off at minute notice well miller then must remain on board with ten men will load gun before go ten men be enough to get up sail to fight pivot gun have better not waste time in getting up anchor buoy then slip cable can recover if like afterwards if must be driven off coast while be away lower sail under fore foot so a to deaden way encourage turk with hope that be going to catch lead dance for seven eight hour then cut drag adrift set stitch of sail run back again will be here in plenty of time to get on board before can come up again of course if see that be gone will choose position where can make stout defence will hold until come back to anchorage right sir will obey order of course must rather have gone with expedition ashore someone must stay on board if be going must take command in absence ten men will be quite enough for can leave main foresail standing when anchor so that will be plenty of strength well a be settled will bout ship cruise east again will be dark in hour be well must think on shore that be off again to east daresay can make out from point on mountain not far from village if see sailing away will never enter head that have intention of interfering in little game up there accordingly schooner be again put about retraced course along shore until became quite dark then stood out to sea until well out of sight of land when be headed west again news have already got about through ship that there be to be landing party to rescue number of christian besieged by turk among mountain sailor be in highest spirit cutlass be ground pistol musket served out to who be to land disappointment of who be to remain behind be mitigated by horace mentioning to that not improbably might have brush with turk on own account cartridge musket pistol be served out arm carefully examined man be ordered to take with water bottle filled with weak grog two pound of bread in haversack hearty supper be served out once round point of bay schooner be kept close in shore greek kept sharp look out on hill looming high above about nine o'clock announced that be now near place where track from mountain came down to shore anchor be at once dropped headsail lowered then sailor took place in three boat two of men who be to stop behind going in to bring back to schooner when landing have be effected zaimes be to accompany party while marco remained with mr miller on board ten of fugitive active young men have begged to be allowed to accompany expedition offer have be declined be told that might be more useful helping to work gun of schooner must turkish ship of war come round when arm have be purchased dozen good rifle have be among after mr beveridge zaimes three officer have armed with one of rest be divided among best shot of party tom burdett much to disappointment be left on board to assist first lieutenant a soon a boat reached shore men be formed up tarleton be to lead advance party of ten men having with guide close behind be main body twenty strong led by martyn behind mr beveridge with zaimes surgeon who be also accompanying party have place horace commanded rear guard of ten men although nominal division be made whole party kept closely together a night be so dark that might otherwise have missed other none of fire arm be loaded lest accident must occur by gun being discharged by fall by striking against rock by trigger catching in bush after few hundred yard walk along shore greek struck upon track led way up rest following in single file climb seemed interminable to horace at time be so steep be difficult to scramble up in darkness there be many fall there be frequent stop to enable men to get breath after three hour climbing at last reached comparatively level ground guide told be within mile of ridge from must look down upon village well will move slowly forward until come to bush bit of hollow where can get shelter for be quite sharp up here a soon a men begin to cool down bit will feel wish have brought blanket now never struck that must be cold mr tarleton let ten men scatter let wander too far let search about for place where can get shelter will remain here if of men find place send one back to bring up have got four hour to wait before daylight in ten minute one of men came back with news that have found patch of bush large enough for to take shelter in in short time arrived at spot bush be sweet smelling free from thorn men soon crushed way into lay down will remain in charge mr tarleton will go on take look down at village suppose will see much may be able to make out whether be still holding out will go on with mr beveridge stay here will go on with find bitterly cold here for not being accustomed to hard work a men be found that climb almost too much for hot a have be must not like to stop still in keen air even with shelter of bush well will take easy last bit mr beveridge come along horace again preceded by guide followed by zaimes ascended shoulder of hill be steep pull in quarter of hour reached crest just a did so heard report of gun followed at once by several others exclamation of satisfaction broke from climb have not be in vain village be still holding out fifty yard farther ground fell away suddenly in front of stood at edge of deep descent extending round foot of hill formed amphitheatre in centre of village lay be line of fire blazing brightly others dim red spot chain of fire much closer together extended across mouth of valley village lying in black shadow of hill be invisible to not even single light indicated position be where be guide said pointing down to centre of hollow a spoke flash of flame followed second so later by report shot out from spot towards be pointing be keeping sharp look out martyn said be not to be caught napping now point be be best side for going down on village without being seen best point guide said must be from head of valley orchard extend from village to foot of hill ravine run distance up there if must get into might get distance through orchard before be noticed must lead along side of hill to ravine in dark think so be sure must lead danger must be from setting stone in motion so calling attention of enemy hillside be very steep stone set rolling must go right down to fire must risk that martyn said must be great thing to be able to take by surprise think so mr beveridge must say be well worth trying be getting out not getting in seems to difficult part of business there be doubt about martyn agreed will ask if part be standing on go straight down to village slope look to almost too steep mr beveridge put question to guide say road zigzag olive tree grow up for distance about third of distance say that be good martyn said because if get people with sudden rush across open can defend lower edge of tree woman child will be hidden from below till get up above tree where must be pretty well out of danger except from chance shot think mr beveridge must be good thing to leave tarleton with fifteen men here if can take by surprise five twenty of ought to be quite enough to make way in even if there be six hundred of must be scattered pretty thinly round circle be probably thickest down at mouth of valley rear guard here will of course be concealed until sally out then if turk from other side end of valley try to climb hill on side of path so a to cut off fellow here must open fire prevent doing so a enemy must not be able to see how many men there be must stop bit think must be very good plan captain martyn very well then horace do go back to bush bring mr tarleton men up tell to move a quietly a can when get near point men got up willingly when tarleton gave word for although bush afforded shelter be already feeling very chilled be pleased to be in motion again met short distance from spot where horace have left men be halted now mr tarleton be to take fourteen men who came ashore with in gig for present have best return with to bush wait there till daylight then will come back to point post men where can not be seen from below be sure that not head be shown take own post at point whence can see down into valley without being seen will remain in hiding while fight way into village a soon a see sortie begun get men ready for action let lie down without showing more than can help at edge of brow from can fire down into valley duty be to prevent party of enemy working along side of hill to take fugitive in flank a come up path a woman child arrive tell to push on along path a fast a can without stopping paying attention to fire may be opened upon will be told before start that schooner be in readiness to take off still may a well hurry along will remain here until last form rear guard will make stand here a long a can so a to give woman child plenty of start do quite understand yes sir will go with wait here macfarlane asked think might a well stay here doctor there wo be time for to be dressing wound till be back here again tarleton called out men who have landed with marched off with now lad martyn said to others be going to work along side of hill so a to come down behind fancy will be very steep in place sling musket behind so a to have hand to hold on by if once begin to roll go right down to bottom then there be end to chance of surprising be careful above thing how walk for if set stone rolling will put on guard have to go a quietly a mouse now follow in single file keep a close a can to other yet so far off if stumble wo touch man in front of men fell in horace took place at rear few step halted guide then went on in front of martyn mr beveridge zaimes fell in behind hill rose so abruptly on right that be necessary to keep along on slope very cautiously men made way along hillside step have to be felt before put weight down sometimes be slippery grass so steep that be obliged to crawl on four to make way along sometimes passed patch of bare rock sometimes slide of loose stone have gone short distance when martyn passed word along in whisper for to sit down pull off shoe fasten round neck indeed have not be for precaution there be place across must have be impossible to pas a be took full hour to traverse half mile between point from have started head of valley at last sharp fall told that be at edge of ravine a soon a descended into there be short halt to allow mr beveridge to rest be sorry came said a sat down faint exhausted did not reckon on sort of thing captain martyn if have done so must have remained with tarleton be right now mr beveridge have done climbing be marvel that have done without alarming fellow below for small stone rolled down once twice if noticed doubt thought that be sheep goat on hillside now lad before go further have better take drink from bottle will have to be careful in going down ravine for there be sure to be loose stone lying about after halt of five minute proceeded cautiously down at last to great satisfaction stood on level ground soon entered grove of fruit tree where halted lay down there be short consultation whether guide must try make way into village to inform besieged of help be near in order that might assist by opening fire upon besieger a soon a sailor made attack idea be however abandoned because be seen by turk must put on alert because in second place might be shot by besieged a approached village did not seem to martyn that there must be difficulty in getting in be not likely that more than fifty of enemy at outside must interpose between village taken by surprise ignorant of number of assailant must offer effectual resistance must be up under shelter of gun of defender of village before turk must rally from first surprise two hour daylight began to appear martyn waited until be light enough to make way through tree without difficulty then men most of whom have fallen asleep a soon a lay down be roused now lad be to keep together keep musket slung use cutlas pistol expect there will be serious resistance at rate straggle of course want prisoner shoot cut down one who opposes follow straight on now load pistol a soon a be done proceeded through wood guide a before led way instruction be that directly be through turk be to run on at top of speed shouting to villager not to fire a approaching be friend martyn mr beveridge horace zaimes followed close behind guide line of seaman extending behind be nearly through orchard when shout be given saw dozen figure leap up from ground come along lad martyn shouted sailor gave cheer at run party rushed forward turk astounded at appearance of body of sailor snatched up musket one two fired at random then whole fled when assailant be still thirty yard away few pistol be emptied at fugitive then paying further attention to party kept straight on when emerged from tree village be three hundred yard away greek waving red sash shouting friend friend fire dashed forward at full speed across garden intervened between orchard rocky knoll upon village stood row of head appeared above wall line of musket barrel pointed outward a greek approached shout of welcome triumph broke from besieged swelled more more loudly a party of sailor be seen running in compact body towards wall few straggling shot be fired by turk passed harmlessly overhead party reached wall without single casualty be soon helped over delight of greek be only equalled by astonishment at approach of body of foreign sailor hope of escape rescue have left have thought only of fighting to last a soon a understood from guide zaimes horace mr beveridge that there be ship in readiness to take off that there be chance of fighting way through besieger village be scene of wildest delight men shouted screamed danced laughed wept by turn woman seized sailor hand kissed to confusion of tar threw on knee poured out passionate ejaculation of thanksgiving that hope of rescue must be afforded be time before anything like order be restored by time alarm have spread round circle of besieger anger be exhibited by shot being fired into place many of pressing forward so threateningly that defender manned wall opening fire upon turk drove back out of range of gun chapter ix rescued a soon a excitement subsided little mr beveridge assembled head of family in village church must prepare to leave at once said landing will be shortly known will be guessed that intend to take off in ship consequence be in addition to enemy now round others will gather will be no longer possible to cut way through what propose to do be to make rush out woman child following a soon a have gained that wood driven mussulmans out woman child will hurry up path while fighting men will hold wood keep turk at distance there be more of men at top of hill there will keep off party of enemy who try to scale hillside at other point a soon a woman be fairly at top men will fall back gradually sailor will cover retreat will hold top of hill till know that woman have got nearly down to sea shore then fall back be risking life here to save will expect men to fight valiantly to obey order be only by working well together that can hope to beat off turk a retreat to get safely on board ship must not load yourselves with baggage of course man can take anything can carry wrapped in sash woman can take bundle such a can carry on head must beware not to take too great weight anyone who lag behind will have bundle taken off thrown away must not be better to wait till night one of elder of village asked captain of ship say that in dark must not be able to keep off enemy to travel fast may lose rather more in first rush in daylight after that light will be in favour how many men have armed with musket there be hundred forty six men have gun how many woman there be about two hundred woman girl hundred eighty child of age very well leave to to make preparation must tell woman that be to keep together to follow about hundred yard behind men a advance a soon a wood be taken be to hurry through mount hill by path then without stopping minute go on at top of speed to sea shore be just possible that turkish ship of war may have driven vessel away if be so will be back again evening if find have gone must sit down under shelter of rock near shore will keep turk at bay till ship arrives make preparation get valuable together for in hour from present time will sally out while be going on martyn have formed up villager for firing have now ceased besieger have before shrunk from attacking wall relying upon famine to compel defender to surrender addition small a be to garrison rendered idea of assault more formidable than before horace acted a martyn interpreter now said expect will have difficulty in carrying wood for enemy can have idea that intend to escape in direction that mean to sally out at therefore be not likely that will have more than fifty sixty men at point in first place want forty determined men who can be trusted to obey order one of leader of defence chose out that number of men martyn divided into two party told off five sailor to horace will take command of one of band jones said to coxswain of gig will take command of other band will fall in behind main body will lead will go straight at wood will follow till be half way across open will then take post one to right other to left fifty yard from line take work will be to check of turk who may come running down from end of valley to cover passage of woman a soon a have passed along will both run in join in wood now lad want wall undermined for width of ten yard so so that when push will all fall together leave wide front for to pour out be not above three hundred fifty yard so to wood will be half way across before turk can pull together wo have time for much more than shot before be upon in hour whole of villager be gathered there be five six wounded men unable to walk be laid on door four greek be told off to child be told off one to woman twenty of greek be to form special escort for woman martyn order to leader be see that woman take along child told off to if doe help along take off bundle throw away force to look after child not single child will be lost if can help life first property next martyn be well pleased with bearing of greek men looked ready eager for fight woman stern determined of have knife dagger in sash in addition have husband father pistol bundle be poised on head with exception of few of old woman have infant in arm held child by hand twenty english sailor formed first line behind came main body of greek horace jones party be drawn up three four pace in rear behind be gathered woman now martyn said to greek fighting men on one point order be distinct not shot be to be fired until reach tree firing must be no good whatever must be loss of time gun must be empty just when want besides must be a likely to shoot in front of a enemy have got to do be to follow closely until get into olive grove then scatter clear of turk go foot beyond in pursuit directly be clear let man take up station behind tree at edge defend there until order be given to fall back zaimes translated order then sailor advanced to wall from lower stone have be removed a far a be safe now put shoulder to hearties heave together one two three now wall shook a sailor flung against be going now try there be shout a wall toppled over then with cheer sailor sprang forward led by martyn dashed over fragment of wall down steep rock greek pouring after in confused mass then whole dashed across flat cultivated ground towards olive grove a martyn have foretold not shot be fired until be nearly half way across though loud shout of alarm be heard then straggling fire be opened enemy be evidently too flurried alarmed to take aim without check sailor ran on cutlas in hand turk did not await attack outnumbered surprised have sooner fired than dashed away among tree to join companion right left olive grove be deserted when sailor entered that will do lad martyn shouted leave greek to hold wood sheath cutlass unsling rifle come back with to help others keep back enemy in open there be however occasion for assistance woman instead of waiting have followed close behind flanking party be already coming into wood by time martyn joined flanking party woman have passed while horace jones be just beginning to fall back with command by time valley rang with shout cry gun be being aimlessly discharged sailor be back in olive grove before turk have mustered strongly enough to think of advancing sailor lay down in interval between tree a soon a enemy began to advance heavy fire be opened upon twelve rifle telling with deadly effect turk on opposite side of valley instead of advancing at once to assistance of comrade made rush at village a soon a perceived that be no longer defended thinking for moment much more of plunder than of attacking retiring greek while party who have begun to advance towards wood rapidly retired again before heavy fire opened upon go round stop greek firing horace fool be simply wasting ammunition martyn said savagely a greek continued to blaze away when enemy be already out of range of gun horace hurried off one way zaimes other in minute two firing ceased a did so report of gun must be heard on hill above be tarleton party at work martyn said to mr beveridge of course turk have seen woman mounting hill suppose of be beginning to climb up to cut off tarleton fire will stagger bit from shout in valley be evident that enemy be gathering for serious attack horace have returned to martyn side now horace do take ten of men ascend path half way up hill post five of on side of to act a flanking party zaimes do tell countryman be time for to be off must get well up hillside before fellow make rush mr beveridge will make way up path at once greek be a active a goat must recommend to be pushing on to get start of in couple of minute entire party have left wood be mounting path martyn sailor forming rear guard greek sprang up path with such speed that sailor active a be have hard work to keep near mr beveridge be speedily overtaken jones take mr beveridge rifle do hawkins baldock help along make haste lad will have storm of bullet coming up after in time for a soon a fugitive appeared on path above level of tree top loud shout have broken from enemy be certain must soon be upon so rapidly however be ascent made that martyn sailor reached spot where horace with party have taken up position before shot rang out from below there be slight shoulder on hillside at point lying down here men be sheltered from fire below wait here lad until get wind gun will hardly carry height there be fear of showing above tree at rate for present mr beveridge threw down on grass even sailor be glad of pause for in five minute have elapsed since left wood have climbed half way up hill be fully three hundred foot above olive grove roar of musketry broke out from below of mussulmans dashed out from tree waving gun calling upon others to follow a soon a showed sailor under horace opened fire of others must have joined martyn forbade be use trying to take aim lad just after such run a must wait until breath come quietly hand get steady again must be only throwing away powder ball will probably want have got before be on board schooner again firing above still continued looking along hillside men must be seen straggling up in considerable number on side forward lad must move on again horace may a well bring men straight up there be fear of venturing on attack up path bring father on with there be occasion for haste will push straight up now forward run go at steady pace that can keep up till reach top horace followed with rear guard at leisurely walk wherever inequality of ground sheltered path from bullet still came singing out from below stepping out briskly whenever be exposed to fire coxswain be waiting with order when reached top captain order be mr beveridge said to horace that party be to remain here for present with twenty greek be to spread along edge here for bit keep up fire if turk try to climb hill hereabouts captain be with party away there on high ground back on left mr tarleton with rest back there on right so a to prevent varmint working round in front of be to let know if see large body of men climbing hill either right left of horace divided party in two telling jones with five sailor ten greek to take post hundred yard to left of path while with others went same distance to right let waste ammunition jones father zaimes will go with a three have rifle may do something to check fellow from climbing up away to left be use others firing gun wo carry distance of course if turk try to come straight up from wood party will open fire upon a soon a got to station horace lay down with one of sailor with who have rifle opened fire upon stream of men ascending hillside near head of valley after firing three four round told sailor to desist be only wasting ammunition frost said be seven eight hundred yard away rifle be of real use at more than half that distance ten minute later sent off sailor to martyn tarleton to tell that turk continued to climb hill in large number that must think that at least two hundred men must have gone up on flank that flame have broken out in village number of men be pouring out from there must probably join in attack few minute later message came from martyn captain say sir now woman have got hour start will fall back party be to retire by path mr tarleton will work down hill on flank be to keep eye on regulate pace by theirs keeping about hundred yard in rear unless be pressed when can double on till be in line with have sent order to mr tarleton sir horace be expecting order sharp fire have broken out on side knew that turk be trying to work round to cut off run on said to sailor tell other party over there to join in path in three minute united body be marching to rear crackle of musketry be now incessant horace soon caught sight of two flanking party making way down hill at distance of hundred yard so on side of path be in scattered order loading a retired crouching behind rock to take steady aim then retiring again going at run when ground permitted hanging to rock bush when afforded shelter on higher ground to left of martyn party be number of mussulmans be pursuing similar tactic to of opponent at time crouching behind rock then bounding forward with loud yell get ready to fire lad horace said next time fellow make rush give volley be not thinking of yet will take by surprise take steady aim hurry halt drop on one knee will be crossing that open space in minute repeated order to greek there come said moment later get ready now fire thirty gun rang out several of turk fell rest with shout of surprise bounded back into bush now retire briskly for bit load a go after hundred yard running again fell into walk horace kept eye upon tarleton party did not seem so severely pressed have advantage foe be on somewhat lower ground than be presently sailor came in from left captain martyn order be that two flanking party be to fall back quickly to path then to double down hill to shoulder mile below be to act a rearguard to follow close behind in two three minute two flanking party taking advantage of cover concealed from enemy made rush to path body under tarleton gained first at once started down at top of speed martyn party be minute later paused till horace came up at run can go faster down path said than can follow over rough ground there be lot of that will jostle other on path wo get along a fast a will how be feeling mr beveridge be right now be going downhill martyn be only climbing ca stand be really very exciting work though like running away will make stand presently wanted to be getting on will get stronger minute will have to fight hard presently do see that schooner have gone exclamation broke from mr beveridge horace in excitement of fight neither of have thought of schooner there be five twenty mile away to northwest with two turkish frigate lumbering after firing have ceased yell of turk rose loudly in air be fully two three hundred yard in rear be in plenty of time martyn said will line other side of flat step when reach can keep back there for time there be attempt at keeping in order path be too steep broken went down running leaping a best must down path in front be long straggling line of greek with sailor keeping in two distinct body among a soon a head of line came down on to flat step in hill spread out right left in le than ten minute from issue of order to retreat hundred eighty men be lying down along lower edge of level ground be forty yard across centre of position being left vacant for last party arrived instant rear guard threw down opened heavy fire upon turk who be crowding down path horace be lying next to father do keep head lower father said a turk left path bounded in among rock shrub opened fire ca take aim if see horace father be right enough might move foot two back so a to be in shelter while be loading then if push rifle up before must only have to raise head to look along barrel fire of mountain fellow be good shot firing in front of increased moment a turk poured down took up position until puff of smoke seemed to dart out from bush rock martyn now went along line posting men horace party be left lying thickly opposite path in case turk must attempt rush rest be disposed two yard apart sailor being placed at regular interval among greek fortunately ground fell sharp away from flat so even from higher ground lying behind be completely sheltered except when raising head to fire by martyn order did seldom let blaze away a much a like said do harm great thing be to have musket loaded in case make up mind to try rush think will do that more smoke make better for prevents taking aim can stop here for hour a long a work round flank satisfied that be going on well martyn returned to mr beveridge have stopped for time effectually sir yes be capital position martyn capital a far a go sir of course if fellow be soldier must either gather make rush march away work round flank being only peasant there be one to command man fight for macfarlane be at work with wounded did lose many men in retreat martyn three of greek be killed dozen of be wounded fortunately not severely two of own fellow be hit of badly have sent greek on ahead to join woman on shore tarleton lost two greek killed have about a many wounded a have one poor fellow be so badly hit that must not keep up with others on retreat two of men tried to carry hurt so much that begged to put down a soon a did drew pistol shot so altogether have lost six be little enough considering be more than half way down to shore if do try to outflank suppose must fall back again yes if succeed must do so of course will try to prevent directly see sign of trying on will make strong effort to drive back think will try at present sole object of man seems to be to fire away ammunition a quickly a can have just be giving order to greek fellow to shove cap up in front of on end of ramrod so a to encourage turk to keep on firing to push musket up fire occasionally without raising head to take aim smoke hanging about along line will hide trick of cap shot will keep turk blazing away for two hour firing continued towards end of time slackened considerably expect good many of be running short of ammunition martyn said now have done firing will have time to talk bit may arrange to march off somewhere come down between shore so think be time for to be making move will go along tell third man to fall back at once think mr beveridge must be a well that must go with will send tarleton in command tell to pick out spot from hundred to three hundred yard from shore place men in position there five minute later will pick out second man horace go down join will keep up more rapid fire now so that sha' have idea be falling back of course when join tarleton will take up position with will be down five minute after when be there can form semicircle with end resting on sea there will be end of constant fear of being outflanked five minute later tarleton with third of men went off at double down path left behind renewed fire taking aim among rock bush at once provoked fresh outburst of firing on part of turk in short time martyn told horace to get men together be off in twenty minute joined tarleton who have taken up post at little more than hundred yard from shore men be slashing down bush with cutlass piling stone so a to make low breastwork party horace have brought at once joined in work be screen want more than defence tarleton said see be commanded everywhere from hill bush will hide will only be able to fire into at random besides want cut down in front of to be able to use gun be soon joined by rear guard turk must be distance behind martyn said must hear blazing away when be nearly mile on road be good work mr tarleton will get finished by time come so strong party made quick work of in quarter of hour screen of bush be completed down to shore on side sweep being three hundred yard in length breastwork in most place three foot high wo keep out bullet martyn said from distance wo see how thin be at rate be good screen whole of greek twenty of sailor be placed at interval of about six foot apart behind screen man be told to dig up soil with knife cutlas in front of with few rock to make protection for against stray bullet other twenty sailor martyn retained under own command to carry to assistance of defender at point against serious attack might be made mr beveridge have gone down at once to woman child who be sitting under shelter of bank by sea shore cheered by assurance that schooner must be sure to return time during night be not until quarter of hour after screen have be completed that party of turk must be seen descending side of hill did not seem to be hurrying think have got in trap horace tarleton said that have only to wait bit to starve out perhaps be just a well schooner made off for must have be hot work getting on board under fire whereas now will be able to slip off in dark almost without knowing when turk approached to within distance of three four hundred yard of breastwork party with rifle opened fire upon at once fell back little distance for hour nothing be done then party of fifty sixty men be seen reascending hill be going to make siege of martyn said like look of breastwork what be sending men away for martyn horace asked because be just a necessary for to eat drink horace a be for have got water bottle biscuit greek have brought something with be warned to do so before started gentleman came off in hurry expect of have breakfast in excitement not one in twenty be likely to have caught up a much a gourd of water so have doubt men see going up hill be on way to village for supply of food water perhaps to get more ammunition if can find will warrant fellow in front of have fired away last shot will see wo disturb more to day illustration captain be wounded few shot only be fired from side during course of day apparently being done on part of turk from pure bravado a generally showed conspicuously brandished long gun over head shouted defiantly before firing one of however having be shot by sailor armed with rifle amusement ceased during afternoon be quiet anxious look out be kept seaward day at five in afternoon one of sailor sang out sail ho where away baldock about west north west must say sir though ai sure of bearing here martyn went up to where man be standing on rock projected eight ten foot above surrounding ground position must have be dangerous have not turk be almost out of range there sir do see just under streak of white cloud be little black patch see baldock believe be schooner gaff top sail sir be too narrow for square sail think be right baldock might be peak of one of native lateen sail think be too far away for that be about direction might expect schooner to come from be more to north west when saw last to get round turk must have to bear either one way other if ran to south be just about where must be on way back hullo be near shave have better get off baldock be hit sir yes think be of consequence be in arm a can move right be only through flesh half dozen gun have flashed out in reply to shot have be fired from distance of le than hundred yard man having crept through bush unseen martyn coat be taken off arm bandaged at once be rather foolish to expose like captain martyn mr beveridge said a came up life be too valuable to to be risked in way be rather foolish martyn laughed thought fellow be out of range did not give credit for enterprise anyhow there be great harm done think have made out schooner sir be worth getting ball through one arm to know that be on way back do feel sure be well can say that be not square top sail be certain must either be gaff top sail peak of lateen sail of one of native craft think be schooner if be sha' be long before can make out fore top gallant sail native craft carry lateen anything like square sail if be schooner how far be off do think five twenty mile must say there be not much breeze be better for will be slipping along now at least two knot to turk one while in strong breeze must not go more than five to four be five o'clock now though ca feel wind here expect be making five six knot hour anyhow ought to be here between ten twelve quarter of hour later baldock said may take squint from look out sir yes stand there long baldock expect that fellow have moved off again if be not hit by of shot still be a well not to give chance baldock stood on rock shading eye from light of western sun be now getting near horizon for minute two stood uncertain then said be schooner sir sure enough can just make out black line below sail must be fore top gallant sail just showing cheer broke from sailor lying along shelter of screen of bush be good news baldock martyn said come down now half hour will settle anyhow there will be light enough till then next observation settled question be certainly square sail underneath sharp peak of gaff top sail joy of greek be extreme when heard that vessel be to carry away be in sight schooner will be in nice mess martyn grumbled to tarleton with what there be on board now there will be something like six hundred of nice cargo that there be one thing horace laughed expect have carried a many before yes daresay have taken six hundred slave ca pack greek a pack slave there will be moving on board a to fighting gun if fall in with turk will be well nigh impossible why will be a deep in water a be when sailed out of plymouth what be weight of horace do suppose not very great captain martyn suppose there be dozen of men weigh over ten stone suppose woman average seven child counting baby say four a there be a many child a there be men must make average seven stone round even if said eight stone be hundredweight be certainly not that anything near must make thirty ton wo be over if throw in bundle calculated that got fifty ton out of hold oh well be not so bad if come on to blow will make shifting ballast of pack up to windward on deck ought to make a stiff a church will be big job getting on board tonight there be one thing suppose turk have made out of course know that be expecting vessel anything about rig must make fire down on shore a soon a get dark keep sharp look out for putting fire out a soon a be near enough for light to begin to show on sail then will open fire along line a if thought heard creeping up towards will cover rattling of anchor chain will hail miller to muffle oar in way may manage to get most of on board at rate before turk have idea of what be going on by firing occasional shot will keep attention fixed gradually withdraw from line a did from place held up there chapter x daring exploit soon after nine o'clock will martyn took post on shore at northern end of position dropping fire be kept up round semicircle a if defender feared that assailant might be trying to crawl up towards martyn continued to listen intently for hour then thought heard sound on water in minute two must make out sound of voice miller have got head screwed on right way said to be showing light five minute must dimly make out outline of schooner misericordia ahoy shouted ay ay came across water be going to put out fire so that light wo show on sail in minute two be going to open fire heavily to cover rattle of chain directly hear begin let go anchor answer horace be standing by fire at once scattered brand threw sand over martyn ran up to front of position shouted open fire rattle of musketry broke out round screen turk surprised at sudden din fearing that sortie be going to be made replied briskly for four five minute fire be maintained horace down on shore heard rattle of anchor chain creaking of block followed shortly by sound of tackle a boat be lowered please muffle oar mr miller shouted answering hail came across water twelve of sailor came down from post to assist with boat in three four minute there be slight splash of oar four boat of schooner ran gently ashore well hope tom burdett asked a jumped out all well tom with exception of about dozen slightly wounded thank god boatswain said tell felt mighty sore at having to run away leave just at daybreak morning ca tell how glad be when caught sight of fire first then made out popping of gun have got greek out mr horace yes there be over

sir doubt boatswain said have got whole lot of down between deck bill scoons have got deck to woman child be crowded into boat be first backed stern on shore to allow to enter sailor lifted child wading into water put in smaller boat pushed off a soon a be filled be back again just after two larger one started schooner be hundred yard away so quickly did work go on in little more than quarter of hour last batch of woman child left shore horace directed marco to see that wounded be carefully lifted into next boat to go on board with then ran up to martyn continuous fire have ceased now dropping shot be kept up round position last batch have gone on board captain martyn reported thank god for horace be load off one mind be smart piece of work to have got on board so soon did not expect for time yet have be listening sharply of course heard sound even here be faint while turk being twice a far away can hardly have heard if did must not have made out knowing nothing of what be going on now do tarleton go off one way send third man down to boat if third man be sailor send next greek to when get down to shore go along to boat see men off a soon a be in boat start back again

want to kill more of poor beggar than can help of course wanted to massacre christian a know own people have be massacred in ten of thousand by greek be only human nature must take revenge anyhow be glad there have not be much bloodshed only time got fairly at be when first gathered for charge at olive grove again when came down path to place where stopped of course few fell while be falling back must say that from forty to fifty must be quite outside likely enough may not have be that have be much easier business than expected must say when first got into village saw what crowd of woman child there be there thought be going to have very tough job before got on board schooner again now think can fall back go down to shore again please start men from end so that can keep on firing from here up to last moment in very few minute last of defender stepped into boat rowed off to ship safe captain martyn miller voice asked a boat came alongside safe mr miller then will give hearty cheer sir will know in few minute that have gone will make difference now lad together three hearty cheer broke from english sailor swelled by shout yell from greek clustered on deck a stepped on to deck miller shook hand heartily with martyn tarleton horace thank heaven be back safe again said a hear without loss of single life have have anxious time of a may guess since have be away suppose may a well get boat up sir certainly sha' want to go ashore again miller boatswain whistle rang out fall be hooked on boat run up to davit swing in at present martyn said want room on deck what have done about greek miller cook have big copper of soup ready have basin a came on board have given up whole of lower deck to woman child fellow men sleep on deck thought be how must manage miller indeed see other way that must be done have got scuttle open down below miller said hatchway off so think will manage will be pretty close doubt none of people be particularly fond of fresh air have got supper ready for men hope miller have something to eat in village at daybreak have have biscuit took with expect be ready for regular meal of course will have ration of grog round have seen to sir marco came up just before came alongside to say that supper must be ready for in five minute how managed know for mr beveridge zaimes have be busy settling woman below ever since came on board how did chief get through a well a anyone except in climbing there be lot more in than thought miller watched when be loading firing be just a cool quiet a if be sitting here on quarter deck what be better always fell in with what suggested without talk argument if be asked must say that really enjoyed whole business have never seen look so bright animated well be quite ready for supper at least will be when have have wash in short time party in cabin be seated at supper be in highest spirit enterprise have be complete success in respect be more pleased that have be accomplished without loss of single life on part of crew supper be not quite so varied a usual marco apologized for shortcoming there be occasion to say word marco be excellent martyn said know how on earth have managed have most of ready before dropped anchor captain martyn said went ashore with boat have be helping with woman until few minute ago so have not have time to finish thing properly thought must rather have so than wait much rather marco now miller let hear report have not have time to ask single question since came on board made out from top of hill twenty five mile away with two turkish frigate after yes miller said be a near a possible caught in trap be lucky have have anchor buoyed chain ready to slip of course kept sharp watch night be on deck hour before day began to break for knew that be dangerous time be very dark then yes know martyn put in pretty nearly broke neck scrambling along face of hill nearly a steep a wall just a first gleam of daylight came miller went on made out two large craft coming along about mile half from shore be not quite abreast of perhaps mile south may guess lost time in slipping chain getting up head sail fortunately there be enough breeze even in here to fill sail knew must not make out a yet lying in here under shadow of land indeed be half inclined for moment to lower sail trust to not making out at a must soon be light doubt must be keeping sharp look out for saw must do be not long before saw that though of course have good deal more wind than have be holding own with ten minute after got under weigh made out changed course steering so a to cut off before be clear of northern point while stood little more out so a to get farther from shelter of land catch little more breeze closed bit with one of began to try distance with bow gun though be not quite out of range shot went altogether wide of never saw such lubberly shooting be better than mile ahead when came out beyond point got true wind a soon a felt beginning to walk along got couple of sail overboard to deaden way stood for north west turk got out stun sail did best to come up to a wind be pretty fresh walked along faster than must have given credit for have to get one of sail on board again to keep distance fired occasionally a kept in line must only bring couple of bow chaser to bear think altered distance by ship length for six hour by time be good thirty mile away from island nearly dead to leeward so thought be about time to begin to have amusement directly have started have got cook to make tremendous fire in galley have put six eighteen pounder shot in kept coal heaped on stuck couple of extra length on to chimney to make draw by time ball be red hot did not begin with at first having got second sail out of water luffed little so a to get pivot to bear tom burdett sent first shot smack into frigate fore foot yawed bit let have four five of forward gun on starboard side time couple of shot went through sail a did not want to run risk held on till put half mile between then began again with pivot boatswain be capital shot hulled leading frigate time evidently did not like expect have idea that craft of size carried such heavy metal came up into wind gave broadside put helm down at same moment a did returned compliment trained gun high a good luck must have one of shot struck maintop mast down came bringing fore mizzen topgallant mast down with gave cheer greek yelled like fiend have sent woman child down into hold men be on deck danced about like lunatic when saw top hamper of turk go over side wore round gave other broadside then set greek to work to load broadside gun while fellow went to pivot again now be time to try red hot shot while be lying broadside on to plumped whole six into one after other then stood off again for other frigate have come up be joining in game if have have spar knocked out of must have be up for carried something like forty gun a soon a got pretty well out of range hauled wind stood south first frigate be still in complete confusion with glass must make out men trying to cut away wreck be not long before saw thin wreath of smoke rising from forward hatchway presently saw ensign half hauled down a signal of distress to consort at once gave up chase must have already seen be useless bore down to thinking have done enough being in stew about left to settle matter a best must began to beat back to island when be five mile away pillar of smoke be rising from frigate with glass must make out boat passing backwards forward between consort be lying to near last must make out of be that be in flame from keel to truck capital miller be splendidly done martyn exclaimed schooner with ten men on board destroying forty gun frigate be capital idea of yours of heating shot cook be in great way miller laughed for pretty well melted galley will have to get fresh one next time put into port now tell about share of day work well have done very well martyn said have quite taken down conceit may have felt quite envy need not do martyn mr beveridge said one may be a proud of saving five hundred life a of destroying frigate admirable a action be will tell about doings have doubt martyn will be too modest to do justice to ah what be that broke off a heard report of gun followed by several others turk venting dissatisfaction martyn said expected before of course heard cheer at distance be may not have made out came from water expect be time before crawled forward found out that line be deserted will fire round of grape over head a hint to that have better clear off a there be hope of plunder blood will not care about risking life for nothing will go up mr tarleton just touch off one of port gun fire in direction be shooting from only want to frighten not to hurt in couple of minute vessel quivered a eighteen pounder sent content rattling among rock tarleton soon rejoined party mr beveridge proceeded to relate to miller event of day next time land mr miller concluded will take good care to ascertain nature of ground have to cross have never be accustomed to active exercise even a boy never cared for must not have believed that human lung must have failed in action so completely human heart bump a mine did in going up hill a for scramble along in dark be sort of nightmare martyn zaimes hauled along like helpless bundle be only conscious of foot continually slipping from under of grasping at grass of having knee bruised against rock of thinking moment that coat collar must give way must roll to bottom of hill zaimes have hold of martyn of arm must say that flesh will be black blue for week mentally registered vow that though be ready to fight for greek be not ready never must again undertake to climb among mountain for there be limit to endurance of human nature limit be very distinctly passed upon occasion moreover dignity a man suffered be humiliated at own helplessness be deeply impressed with thought that whole life have be mistake when resulted in being hauled along by zaimes who be year two older than be believe made resolution to practise athletic exercise be afraid that like many other good resolution will be dropped with memory of terrible hour where be thinking of landing people mr beveridge have not least idea martyn where do think so get rid of a quickly a possible sir doe matter in slightest there be one thing certain will be week before will get deck white again must say that thorough fumigation of from stem to stern will be advisable suppose british authority must be grateful to if be to dump down in zante corfu because be certain must have to feed greater portion of for considerable time on other hand if land at greek port there be very strong risk of dying of starvation new government have other thing to think about be very awkward captain martyn very awkward mr beveridge said seriously however be evident that now have rescued ca be allowed to starve there be one thing father horace put in think that money must be much better laid out in feeding than in enabling politician klephts to spend in gaudy dress in keeping band of armed ruffian round certainly must horace a to where have better be landed must say that might give choice of say four five place must be much better that must be divided a must in way be more likely to get employment than if be turned out at one place might be landed at of greek island in morea others at athens perhaps in ionian island where must be under british flag think must be deal better off there father than in greece greek island where at present everyone be thinking of war field be going out of cultivation certainly must do great deal better in corfu cephalonia other island than must elsewhere if be landed in small batch might find work expect most of have got little money a living be very cheap if be to give couple of pound head must enable to live long time while be looking for work besides there be committee on island for helping refugee so do think must be better to land who have friend in greece particular wish to go there in island must say zaimes marco might go round among in morning ask if of have friend in greek island mainland to put to others though can be landed in greece if like will probably be better off certainly much more free from anxiety danger in ionian isle think that must be very good plan mr beveridge said when be going to get under sail again captain martyn a soon a have finished cup of coffee mr beveridge will get boat lowered find buoy pick up anchor miller slipped morning want to lose chain a soon a have got on board will be off there be not much breeze here after dark may a well get what benefit can from have fear of other turkish frigate looking in here on way back if did now that have got crew on board have doubt must give good account of want to be under weigh there will be comfort on board till have got rid of passenger whereabout do think buoy be lying miller fancy be anchored couple of hundred yard so farther out quarter of mile astern know where landed last night have to march along beach little distance before came to path on hill be so miller be afraid will have little trouble in finding however will have try be just eight bell now wo be light for six hour want to waste time if can help well will take one of gig tarleton can take other will take blue light with expect will soon find very well directly do hang on to buoy rope get end of chain into gig hail send tarleton back will get up anchor at once gig long boat will tow schooner up to then can pas end of chain on board will get round capstan have anchor up in time now mr beveridge if will take advice will turn in at once only got couple of hour sleep last night in orchard have have twenty four hour really hard work will take advice martyn mr beveridge touched hand bell beside marco must help to cabin for be so stiff think must get out of chair by will help in sir martyn said miller raised mr beveridge from chair almost carried into cabin then lit pipe went on deck buoy be found after few minute search in ten minute schooner be under weigh stealing out from land will take watch miller said have better turn in will put couple of hand who remained with at wheel let rest lie down a will be on deck one can rouse up in minute if be wanted next day two greek went among fugitive questioned head of family a to number of party mean possessed whether have friend in greece most of possessed little money proceeds of last harvest vintage eight ten have sum varying from hundred to four hundred pound besides jewel of female in case be of considerable value of poorer one have literally nothing beyond clothes in stood few almost worthless trinket there be not dozen of whole number who have friend connection in greece thirty of unmarried men expressed desire to join greek army fight against turk rest thankfully embraced offer of being landed on island under protection of british flag took whole day to ascertain particular on following day exile be asked to divide into party according to village from came in order that acquaintance relation must be landed together when have be done zaimes distributed in name of mr beveridge to head of family sum amounting to two pound for of member except to whose resource be sufficient to maintain for considerable time wind be very light be six day after weighed anchor before entered port of zante week be spent in landing fugitive among ionian island party being in proportion to size of island facility of obtaining employment there gratitude of poor people to mr beveridge indeed to on board schooner be very great be all much depressed on landing at first delight at having escaped with life be unbounded a day went on feeling that have lost else be separated for ever from birthplace home be in future to live among stranger overwhelmed mr beveridge went great deal among endeavoured to cheer with assurance that war must not last very long that at termination whenever might be there must certainly be general amnesty that fugitive must then be permitted to return to home therefore advised to keep always in mind to lay by penny must spare of earnings so that must eventually be able to return to cyprus resume former life when misericordia left cyprus there remained on board only dozen family who have friend in greece young men who intended to join greek army never did vessel undergo more thorough washing cleaning up than schooner on voyage round to athens deck be scrubbed holy stoned twice day lower deck be equally cleaned in addition woodwork received two coat of fresh paint after having be thoroughly fumigated greek may have virtue martyn remarked to miller cleanliness on board ship be marked by absence there be doubt about miller agreed have always heard that cargo of mohammedan pilgrim to mecca be about most painful experience sailor must have back greek against think schooner liked seemed to have lost liveliness to be depressed at being turned into human pig stye believe be worse between deck when have cargo of slave on board mr beveridge have just told martyn said that be to tell crew at next pay will give three pound head to man a reward for work at cyprus inconvenience have be since put to will appreciate miller said certainly have be put about good deal will be pleased at recognition of a much a with money besides same

with booty have gathered to own village there be afraid be likely to stay till turkish army invades athens nauplia may hold out for time longer for week perhaps possibly for month therefore for present leave entirely with to cruise where think best then sir will go south since have come out have not taken prize worth having think that a prize money be certainly one of inducement held out to sailor when joined might a well try to pick up few turkish merchantman there be doubt that ship from smyrna syrian port a well a from island keep near land that even bound for alexandria african port coast round there also of doubt carry rich cargo many will be taking greek slave to alexandria tunis so will be carrying out object by releasing a well a picking up prize money think men well deserve little indulgence in way work have not be altogether pleasant for time have be turned out of quarter have have to sleep under awning forward have heard grumbling among for be sure be glad to do must to help poor creature have have on board still will be glad of chance of what must consider legitimate business very well captain martyn let be so quite agree with a to excellent conduct of men have certainly have good deal of hardship to put up with for everything have be very uncomfortable since visit to cyprus in few minute boatswain whistle be heard followed by tramp of men round capstan stir of getting up sail then watch be set schooner sped along under gentle breeze towards south for next two month misericordia cruised on coast of syria scarce day passed without vessel being overhauled many of be small coaster laden only with grain other cargo of small value be permitted to proceed on way without interference of larger vessel contained mixed cargo in case where greek captive be on board valuable portion of cargo be transferred to schooner ship be then permitted to proceed on voyage where greek slave be found on board captain be given choice of having vessel burned giving bond for amount equal to half estimated value that of cargo signed by representative of owner if there be one on board principal passenger bond must not perhaps have be enforced in court mr beveridge have

have mean to prove must let go a have others though be nuisance for only warn people at port against wo put on mainland time land on one of little island may be time in getting craft to take to mainland then will find rough work making along coast however can settle upon later first thing to do be to get deck roughly cleaned dead body thrown overboard dozen men be set to work with mop bucket while others fastened shot to foot of algerines dropped overboard a soon a be done marco be sent below to tell captive that must come on deck a woman poured up looking almost dazed at sudden release at bright sunlight after stifling atmosphere of dark hold in have be confined for six day horace saw one of woman of five thirty year of age to whose side girl of fifteen be clinging looking round

by cry of girl oh mother mother looked at in astonishment illustration greek captive be brought on deck be english exclaimed yes cried be english have be seized carried away by horrid turk mother said fancied heard shout in english thought must have be mistaken a only greek came down spoke to in hold did not think possible that must be english have rescued out of hand of turk sir mother said be taking away to sell a slave yes have rescued horace said be free now if will hold mother head for moment will fetch doctor have one on board if must get little water sir will soon come round have

lady face poured few drop of spirit between lip in minute two opened eye be right now madam said a looked round in confused way be safe among friend british sailor thank god for mercy murmured while tear fell down cheek seems almost too great happiness to be true in few minute be well enough to be assisted down to cabin of schooner where be left to care of daughter for time hour later be able to relate story to mr beveridge be said wife of english merchant at smyrna lived short distance out of town have since trouble began gone little abroad for although be only greek who have be involved in massacre have taken place there month before there be good deal of hostility upon part of lower class of population against christian one evening have be with daughter in garden husband being engaged till late at business in town be just getting dark be about to re enter house when five six ruffian of lowest class rushed into garden seized daughter in spite of shriek threw thick cloth over head then carried away be taken for distance when stopped heard animated conversation clink of money then be placed in boat presently carried up on to deck of ship taken below when mufflings be removed found be in hold of vessel with large number of greek captive endeavoured in vain to make understood by sailor who came below who perceived at once be not turk told that be english that husband must pay large sum if daughter be set on shore unharmed attention be paid to entreaty on persisting be brutally knocked down in short time man who be evidently officer came down forced to take off european dress put on others that of greek woman be ordered to hand over to be now evident to that have be seized by of ruffian of town sold to algerines who be in way particular a to nationality of slave that be destined to be sold in slave market of tunis algiers few hour after be taken on board heard anchor run up must soon tell by ripple of water against plank that be under weigh hope now left have passed terrible six day overcome by despair half suffocated by foul air of hold hope have again sprung up when gun be fired overhead be soon evident that vessel be engaged in encounter with enemy at last firing ceased then there be sound of shouting clashing of sword on deck above head presently hatchway have be opened greek have come down told that vessel have be captured from turk that be free fancied that heard english voice until have reached deck saw face uniform of sailor thought that must be mistaken after remembered more until heard doctor voice be rejoiced indeed have be enabled to save daughter from horror of slavery mr beveridge said have have pleasure of rescuing many hundred of greek woman child from hand of turk never expected to find countrywoman among cabin will be at disposal except must fear take meal here cabin adjoining will be wholly yours in course of week hope to land at corfu thence will be able to write to husband arrange either for joining again at smyrna taking passage for england must must think in present state of thing be wisest course purse will be entirely at disposal be owner of schooner be called misericordia although fight under greek flag have come out to assist to obtain independence be principally devoting to saving unhappy victim of war lady whose name be mr herbert expressed deep gratitude mr beveridge at once took possession of miller cabin a lieutenant must have doubt remain in charge of prize when capture be made schooner be eighty mile to east of rhodes after talking matter over with miller martyn decided to land algerines on caxo islet lying fifty mile to south west of rhodes miller tarleton be for present to continue on board prize prisoner forty eight in number be transferred into schooner next evening arrived off caxo where algerines be landed in boat martyn then went on board polacca have be thinking miller that a seem to have frightened turk into remaining in port for present will leave tarleton on board polacca give twenty men let cruise on own account while take woman child round to ionian isle will shift two of eighteen pounder on board craft one will suspect will have good chance of picking up more prize while sight of white sail sends everything running into port a far off a can be seen can rendezvous here again day fortnight must like very much miller said think be capital plan must ask mr beveridge to let have marco will have mean of making understood by turk greek fortnight later schooner returned to island have have rough weather for last three day of voyage sky have now cleared again there be island martyn said a horace came up at six o'clock in morning to take charge of watch for have now command of starboard watch tom burdett have port there be island there be sign of polacca yet wonder miller be not here first if have be having calm must not have be least surprised at not turning up with strong southerly wind there be reason why must not have be here go up to main top horace take look round horace must see sail in sight be not uneasy about miller surely mr beveridge said at breakfast seeing that martyn be not in usual spirit well be rather uneasy sir miller must be more likely to be day too soon than too late with wind from south must have calculated time here from wherever happened to be within hour two wind have be strong with for aught know may have be blowing gale more to east know much about sailing quality of polacca certainly be very light in ballast if have be caught off lee shore in heavy gale may not have be able to claw off especially if happened to be embayed when came on of course must give twenty four hour more if doe not come then will shape course north east cruise along coast a get eastward may pick up fishing craft small coaster hear what weather have be there possibly even get news of polacca if miller get here after have left will guess what course have taken very likely will land boat learn that have be here course took when sailed away must then be guided by circumstance at rate if nothing have happened to be sure to meet sooner later do just a think best captain martyn most sincerely trust that there be ground for uneasiness hitherto everything have gone well with must be terrible indeed if anything must have happened to two friend so many of brave fellow day passed slowly look out be kept in top until sun went down sail be seen above horizon crew shared anxiety of captain gathering in group discussed what must have occurred to prevent consort arriving at rendezvous believe a turk have caught one of sailor said wo never gammon into taking in such yarn a believe a there be turk living must get weather gauge of lieutenant miller a to tempest be different care for tempest one way other on board schooner then be craft such a see twice in v'yage round world if have be in must have felt noways uneasy seeing a how be in outlandish brig whose way understand may be that if be caught off lee shore by heavy gale even first lieutenant with men at back must get out of mess said along sailor put in shaking head a there be bad luck coming three day ago dreamed of black cat everyone a know anything know a there ai nothin ' more unlucky to dream about than black cat surely bill said shaking head gravely well mate be opinion tom burdett said gruffly a there be something in dream in nine case out of ten be something a have gone afore not what come after know once when came back from v'yage have written letter to tell old woman what time must arrive reckoned to be in to dinner well coach broke down did not get in till nine o'clock old woman have made plum duff pretty nigh a big a head knowing a be fond of be in such taking at not having be in to eat at dinner that sat down finished that there pudding cold for supper well dreamt of about ten million black cat about a many shark mixed up together if will believe nothing came of ever since have held to opinion that when have bad dream what have got to think about when wake ai what mean in future what have be having for supper now expect if bill there be to turn mind back must remember that night a have that dream have be filling up with fruit such like trash afore turned in say a nothing have happened to lieutenant miller mate be cocksure a black cat bill said dreamt on have nothing to do with way why bless in village there be hundred of woman a think of nothing dream token be matter what dream of have got 'terpretation of if 'terpretation happens to be bad one bother husband brother son a case may be not to put to sea there be many good fisherman whose cupboard be bare year through listening to may have idea a to whether harm be come to polacca not if seaman on board ship be to dream of black tom cat wife family must make not so much a shade of difference in opinion martyn did not wait for daylight when middle watch be relieved sail be made schooner bore away to north east land be sighted about four o'clock by nightfall be coasting along at distance of about mile when became dark stood on off shore a martyn wished to examine inlet bay a went on a soon a be daylight schooner proceeded on way sail of several craft be made out seaward during course of day none of resembled canvas of polacca attention be concentrated upon shore rock being closely scanned with glass sharp look out kept for signal of kind in evening small fishing boat be overhauled a made way into village fisherman be interrogated by zaimes who understood little turkish have seen nothing of craft answering to description of polacca interrogated about weather replied that storm four day before have be exceptionally severe one coming on very suddenly blowing with tremendous force for hour next morning be at mouth of gulf of adalia if miller have gone to grief anywhere martyn said to horace be a likely a not to be somewhere in bay might very well have be cruising about in here to pick up anything coming out of adalia be principal port along part of coast be large bay see if happened to be well up when be caught in sudden gale be probable enough that must not be able to beat out in craft see on map there be three four small town between cape adalia want to show inside cape for probability be schooner must be recognized directly what think will be best plan must be for zaimes to take one of boat coast along close in to cape there be place called grambusa mile two around corner place called yanar little farther on want to board fishing boat find out whether have news of wreck between adalia have heard of greek european prisoner being brought there from farther east if ca succeed in getting hold of fishing boat zaimes might land try to pick up news at cottage in outskirt of village there be greek in sea side village for most of fishing be in hand though in town there be massacre suppose must be disturbed in quiet village where have be settled for generation zaimes be summoned agreed at once to land a martyn horace be of opinion that there be more probability of getting trustworthy information that way than from fisherman who must be scared at finding boat suddenly overhauled accordingly taking gig with six men horace zaimes started for shore while schooner turned head west will cruise backward forward martyn said sha' go more than four mile from cape so when come out again will only have to lie on oar till come back for rowed direct to shore crept along close to till saw village mile ahead then rowed in landed zaimes be absent hour walk assured horace that have bad news even before reached side of boat be afraid have bad news zaimes zaimes shook head very bad must hardly be worse there be several christian in village learned from that four day ago brig be caught in storm be driven ashore close to adalia be found that be turkish vessel have be captured by pirate people must have torn to piece pasha who have come down to shore with body of troop to try save on board ship when be seen to be driving ashore protected from mob lodged in prison say that have sent off to smyrna where governor of anatolia resides to ask for instruction be expected that order will come for execution in day two stretch to oar men horace said others have be wrecked captured by turk sooner be on board with news better men bent to oar made boat fly through water when rounded cape khelidonia saw schooner quarter of mile away in act of going about be seen almost a soon a caught sight of remained thrown up in wind until got alongside martyn mr beveridge be on deck a soon a zaimes have told story went down into cabin for consultation what on earth be to be done martyn said adalia be large town zaimes say there be troop there likely enough whole regiment must be hopeless to try to attack with thirty men only thing can see at present must be for to sail right in anchor off town threaten to bombard with red hot shot if give up prisoner objection be that be likely to have battery there in case might get worst of besides be likely enough that might hang miller rest of at first shot fired be not to be thought of mr beveridge said seems to that might anchor within sight of place send boat ashore with white flag offer to pay ransom might fix for prisoner must rather pay ten thousand pound than harm must come to what do think horace if must have got at pasha before sent off to smyrna might have done father having once referred case to smyrna be afraid might consider too risky to let go might try that if everything else fails what else be there horace well must say father best thing must be to land zaimes again have already made acquaintance in village here doubt must rig up in dress like own then must go boldly on to adalia find out exactly how thing stand what sort of place be imprisoned in how strong be guard how close barrack of troop be to prison must suggest that sail away west so that if a be likely enough schooner have be noticed by of peasant in village scattered about among hill word sent to adalia report may also go that have sailed right away then must capture small turkish craft large fishing boat must do leave ten men on board schooner sail in prize nearly up to adalia if anchor say couple of mile side of town hoist little flag say red flag over white to mast head must recognize come down to beach if be in daytime will make out with glass easily enough send boat ashore for if be nighttime will empty out little powder moisten flash off then can send ashore for must order schooner to come night keeping three four mile off shore sailing up nearly to adalia then returning so a to be round cape again before daylight in way must communicate with go on board again when liked till examine place there be saying whether there be possibility of rescue not if find that there be possibility of anything being done in direction can embark on board schooner again carry out plan suggested anchor off adalia send in to offer ransom with alternative that if be not accepted will bombard place about ear in way see will anyhow lose nothing by expedition of zaimes ashore think plan be excellent one horace martyn said mr beveridge equally approved of think there will be great danger about martyn there seems reason why suspicion must fall upon zaimes if be dressed in same way a greek in village see why there must of course will only speak with other greek certainly think plan of getting hold of small native craft anchoring near town be capital one will save great deal of time for be somewhere about fifty mile from cape to town must in fact save whole day a if come off to in evening must do what there be to do night whereas if have to walk way down coast to cape come on board there must be too late to do anything night must have to wait until next zaimes be called in eagerly embraced proposal when be explained to be passionately fond of brother from whom have never be separated be ready to dare anything to attempt rescue be agreed have better wait till dark before landed accordingly schooner sailed west for hour did not return to cape until after darkness have fallen then zaimes horace be landed a soon a boat returned schooner again sailed away before leaving ship horace have dressed a greek on landing walked to village have best remain outside for few minute mr horace zaimes said while see man conversed with morning told then that brother be on board polacca be wrecked must endeavour to get ear of person of importance at adalia said that be sure that must hing anything must do to help must for people came year ago from naxos a know be native place will just go in first to see if be alone to tell have friend with a soon a see that be in same mood will call in in three four minute door of cottage opened again horace be called in be young friend who accompanies zaimes said to man be not relation have be with brother ever since be born be willing to join in effort to save be quite hopeless peasant said be only risking life still be business be ready say to buy of two suit of clothes have one suit belonging to son who be at present away in coasting ship have suit of own can let have zaimes horace have brought on shore considerable amount of gold stowed in belt beneath clothes in case must find opportunity of bribing prison official have in pocket ample sum for ordinary expenditure a peasant only asked about three time amount clothes must cost new paid for without bargaining at once put on have brother at man said well pleased with bargain have made if go to say that come from brother alexis of village be sure will be glad to lodge especially when tell that too belong to naxos after receiving instruction a to how to find man brother in adalia started at once upon journey lay down for three hour in middle of night in wood entered adalia at eight o'clock in morning went straight to address peasant have given be small house with two room master be cobbler a soon a zaimes mentioned brother name said that be ready to pay for accommodation shoemaker agreed at once to receive be chatty fellow be very anxious to hear news about affair in greece when told that have lately arrived from there now said what be business of course can see that belong to be from naxos a say notice few turn of speech such a father used to use what have come here for why have bought brother clothes from for recognized directly came in like to know thing not because be inquisitive because want to have pasha executioner suddenly coming in at door taking off head without even explaining reason why be what told greek of naxos zaimes said a explained to brother have brother who be one of crew of ship be wrecked here six day ago have come to see whether by greasing palm of of official can manage to get out that ca man said decidedly if be in civil prison might be done pasha guessing perhaps that many of christian must sympathize with possibly having idea that mob might rise handed over to soldier be confined in room in military prison in centre of barrack where there be lot of sentry gate have be closed since be taken there civilian be allowed to enter under pretence so see there be bribing to be done of course sentry be changed frequently there be knowing what officer have prisoner specially under charge even if be bribed there must be getting past sentry so can give up idea altogether of getting brother out how long doe take for messenger to go from here to smyrna zaimes asked with slight glance at horace to show that be changing conversation purposely by ordinary travelling two week mounted messenger with relay of horse can do in four day then in three day answer may come from smyrna be so wonder that pasha took trouble of sending to governor of anatolia instead of hanging prisoner at once suppose thought that governor might like to have sent to so that must forward to constantinople be thinking of delaying messenger return might be done know man drew finger across throat significantly see that delay must be of use zaimes replied if there be chance of getting brother out matter not whether messenger arrives to day fortnight hence however be matter may be worth thinking over later at rate will go out have look at barrack will go with be not without money can make well worth while to aid by advice be ready enough man said trade be dull man must live besides must gladly save christian native of own island from turk must not trust too far zaimes said in undertone to horace when man went into apartment behind to speak to wife be now inclined to help especially if think that will be well paid for have better not let know anything of plan when saw there be danger what with fear a to own safety hope of bigger reward than must expect to get from might decide to turn traitor have better let suppose that have given up hope agree with zaimes hint about messenger may be useful one mean of course that must cut poor beggar throat might bind fasten up for few day if find there be need of time to make preparation be afraid time will not help zaimes said fellow can have motive for lying if what say be fact see shadow of chance of getting out even if have crew of schooner here will know more about when have seen place zaimes expected must be securely locked up be not much worse than looked for be hard if ca hit on plan for getting out chapter xii planning rescue even horace be obliged to admit when with zaimes guide have walked round barrack that saw chance whatever of being able to get prisoner out by force barrack consisted of old castle portion of be a shoemaker told now used a military prison round at distance ran strong wall fifteen foot high loopholed for musketry troop be lodged in hut between wall castle there see guide said what said be true must not get bird out of place much le man be so zaimes agreed well what can not be done can not however will talk over evening at house now let walk about view city truly be fine one few town indeed have finer situation than adalia standing a doe at head of noble bay great portion of be fringed with lofty precipitous cliff town at time contained ten thousand inhabitant stand on ground sloping upwards from sea in terrace rising one above be surrounded by ditch double wall of massive construction with square tower fifty yard beyond wall stretched garden grove of orange lemon mulberry tree ten mosque with dome minaret reared above house there be several church belonging to christian population be guide told about two thousand in number great proportion of whom spoke only turkish language can talk equally well in for be fifty year since father settled here always talked greek in family a long a lived now always speak turkish be safer doe not remind turk continually that be of greek race where doe pasha reside horace asked presently will show place be at lower corner of north wall garden stretch down to wall by water high wall on side separate from town passing through several street arrived opposite residence of pasha of sanjak of tekeh of adalia be chief town residence stood at angle of two wall dividing garden from town be massive building soldier sat on bench at side of gate opened into court yard townspeople official passed in out public office be in court yard guide said pasha private dwelling harem lie behind suppose can walk in certainly guide said passed through gate into court yard on one side be guard room stable other office on other be room of secretary official that in pasha transacted business received visitor portion of house facing gate be blank on basement story except that door faced gateway above be line of window closed with jalousie be dwelling house guide said believe apartment of family face garden window see there be only of apartment of servant slave after leaving pasha walked down to bottom of town where two gate with strong flanking power opened upon port be smaller than horace have expected to find however be glad to see that there be several craft anchored in roadstead near port at distance showing that vessel did not come in unless for shelter in bad weather to discharge heavy cargo craft then in crew of schooner might arrive must not attract attention by anchoring outside port a arranged returned with guide to house have meal there zaimes be profoundly discouraged saw prospect whatever of rescuing brother other prisoner strength of wall gun be mounted upon step host told have be taken few month before to defend town against greek fleet must make appearance there showed that there be prospect of turk being alarmed by appearance threat of craft like schooner seems altogether hopeless zaimes said to greek latter shook head can see possible way replied if have be ordinary prisoner in jail must be managed without difficulty must have got one of countryman of influence to have approached prison officer must have worked with warder small sum of money must have done now seems to hopeless even if stop messenger gain eight day while pasha sends again to smyrna must only run risk gain nothing zaimes assented mournfully have better make man present zaimes horace said when be alone for minute after meal be finished tell that seems to to be hopeless that will probably go right away that if thinking over can hit upon possible plan will be back again evening sleep here zaimes carried out suggestion gave host gold coin said that saw use in staying longer must think over in way might return that evening if go outside town must be back by sunset man said gate be closed at hour will not forget think will see again even if people arrive evening zaimes think will be just a well not to go back into town horace said a issued out through gate into country say for moment that man be not honest be just a well not to put temptation in way know that be friend of prisoner doubt guess that belong to craft captured polacca be wrecked no doubt must not openly betray must bring into discredit with christian in town few word whispered to turk agreement to share reward may be given for capture must answer purpose just a well say must do know must be just a well not to run risk on issuing from gate horace saw that there be narrow road running between deep dry ditch at foot of city wall outlying garden orchard will be shortest way down to water zaimes let follow greek turned without question when have gone half way down between gate bottom of hill horace stopped now let have good look at place on other side of wall be garden of pasha house counted number of step up from house to cross road leading to gateway have counted coming down again be about fifty yard below upper wall of garden daresay be so zaimes replied listlessly ditch be about ten foot deep from bottom of ditch to top of first wall be from five twenty to thirty between wall higher one inside be about fifteen foot inner wall be about fifteen foot higher than outer one square tower form junction between two wall now may be quite sure that there be sentry on wall on square tower suppose there be sentry anywhere except in battery on water face there certainly wo be here for must command view down into pasha garden so may quite conclude except for trouble of scaling wall there be nothing to prevent getting over couple of rope ladder one two twenty foot plank with bit nailed across to give foothold must take on to inner wall then must need long ladder to get down into garden must be about thirty five foot must say yes see zaimes whose face have again become animated a listened agreed what must be good of getting into pasha garden no good at if be by zaimes with martyn twenty men from schooner good deal of good must say have only got to make sudden rush into house will of course be open to garden seize pasha carry of wife child off to craft that fellow come in then on to schooner then can send ashore to say that unless prisoner be sent off in boat to by twelve o'clock in day will hang pasha maybe when get hold of pasha there will be occasion to carry woman off mere threat of might be enough can tell that will be painful to to have to hoist up to top of wall in sack that will be obliged to do unless sign order for prisoner release sends off at once by officer to jail handsome bribe will enable to make peace with superior at smyrna may help to quicken perception zaimes seized horace hand with fervour shook wildly clasped hand on breast raised to heaven poured forth stream of exclamation of delight quiet habit of many year have be thrown to wind in moment excitable greek nature burst through restraint have given new life exclaimed a soon a have calmed down little just now there did not seem even shadow of hope now there be chance once again may clasp brother in arm plan be difficult be dangerous yet may succeed be desperate undertaking what be must give life for brother sailor must risk theirs for comrade let sit down here quietly for few minute zaimes take good look at wall be evident by look of road that be very little used even if anyone did come up must only think that have be working in orange grove behind be taking quiet smoke be lucky that there be moon to night must be awfully difficult job to get over wall into place know nothing of if be dark night there will be difficulty in throwing up grapnel getting on to first wall greatest difficulty will be in crossing from one to one behind of course with regular gangway must be easy enough must not be able to get material for making one however with couple of stout spar put up foot apart with rope between foot from other so a to make ratlings must get up though must be very easy job passing woman down still hope wo come to must think if capture pasha child if have suppose with dozen wife will be sure to have might leave woman alone though of course must threaten to take will tell what will want be man who can speak turkish well so a to explain exactly to pasha fix be in yes will want such man zaimes agreed very well zaimes then think have better go back to friend at once even if did mean treachery must have taken step yet a wo expect back till evening if come at tell that want service of in will run personal danger for know can dress up in of thing put bit of black cloth a mask half over face that will be paid twenty piece of gold for night work will be fortune to will be best plan zaimes said where will meet will go down hill to bottom to see what sort of road there be along sea will wait there for if road be exposed to view of sentry on battery at sea wall must make way through orchard to point if not will move along there do think that captain martyn be sure to be here evening be quite certain to be know that hour be of importance will get hold of craft other early morning even if have to go into fishing port to get zaimes retraced step up hill while horace sauntered down until came out on to road leading to port along shore good many small house be scattered along by side fishing boat drawn up on beach at angle of wall there be battery three gun pointed along road turkish sentry be leaning against parapet by side of will have to make way through orchard said to there will be getting along road with moon up sentry must notice quarter of mile away besides tramp of so many foot must be certain to bring people to door must come early if can so a to catch pasha before go to bed in hour zaimes cobbler came up be agreed former said in english twenty pound will make what considers rich declares be ready to run risk for single night work in order to gain think be honest fellow watched closely when went in if have thought whatever of betraying think must have seen in face be now four o'clock in afternoon soon made out small brigantine anchored quarter of mile out about mile half along shore expect be horace said have only just come in for there be men upon yard stowing away sail be just position agreed must take up when have gone mile farther must see that have small red white flag at mast head when got opposite to went down to water edge horace waved white handkerchief for moment

light before accompanied perhaps by present nothing more must be heard about in case be ready to pay sum of one thousand pound a ransom for have sent officer out of room that must not hear offer will be entirely between ourselves be not meant a bribe to a ransom if choose to send to smyrna will doubtless assist pasha there to perceive that being with whole family at mercy have resource to comply

minute later be alongside brigantine mr beveridge hailed a approached be that martyn yes sir horace plan have worked perfectly have got out boat can only carry half be waiting with rest on beach thank god for martyn one hurt at one not even turk have be knocked down only scrimmage have be with one of pasha wife maid who fought like wild cat before two of men must make prisoner directly rest of party came off anchor be weighed sail made on brigantine be headed from land in hour look out in bow called out think can make out schooner away on beam sir think be martyn said after going forward to have look light red flare up brought with horace a soon a red flame broke out similar signal be shown by craft in distance brigantine be headed for two vessel rapidly approached other presently hail from tom burdett came across water captain martyn ahoy ay ay tom have got everyone be safe well cheer broke out from schooner be answered by louder one from brigantine throw up in wind tom martyn shouted will bring craft alongside in two three minute vessel lay side by side before leaving brigantine crew be released mr beveridge in delight at success of plan made handsome present for inconvenience have suffered cobbler of adalia have not come aboard with boat horace having given reward of twenty five pound before embarking a soon a crew of schooner be on board head sail be filled rapidly drew away from brig boatswain be ordered to serve out ration of grog round officer then assembled in cabin where greek placed cold meat wine on table to especially miller tarleton fell to with good appetite when have done martyn told story of step have be taken for rescue see miller be entirely horace plan made whole arrangement have only to carry out be simplest thing in world now let have account be not very lucky miller said overhauled five six craft for most part contained little of value one two of have silk other good on board be transferred to polacca weather kept fine thinking that rig must not alarm turk sailed in within three mile of adalia be intending to go right into road anchor there when saw cloud banking up to south have barometer on board looked so bad that headed out again for mouth of gulf have not gone far when gale struck blowing like fury right into bay did everything must old tub drifted to leeward two foot for one worked out wind got higher higher till be blowing hurricane a soon a water willowed sufficiently to anchor let anchor go gear be rotten cable snapped like packthread finally drove ashore about mile to east of town there be mob there waiting pasha with lot of troop tied line to keg floated on shore hauled on then sent hawser swarmed along turk behaved very pluckily joining hand rushing into breaker to get ashore a soon a saw by uniform who be there be regular hubbub thought must have be killed then there however pasha made troop form up round marched into town there be stowed away in room in old castle prospect did look good for a went in saw that troop be in hut round that there be besides high wall outside window of place be shut up in be about eight foot from ground very strongly barred in addition kept four soldier always on guard in room two three fellow came to spoke in different lingo of must neither make head tail then chap came who spoke italian know much of enough to make out what meant when spoke very slowly upshot of be that have sent to smyrna for order a to what be to be done that must take five six day for messenger to go there back did not seem to make much odds to what answer be knowing how go on on side be moral certainty that must be hung here at smyrna did not seem to that there be much choice between two place of course often talked about knew must do everything must that when found did not turn up at rendezvous must sail along coast till got news of did not seem likely that must do anything to help knew that must not land more than twenty men with twenty men must hing at against about thousand turk with strong wall in front of besides old castle be capable of defence there be lot of stationed in thing looked about a black a must be be not starved turk gave plenty of bread sort of thin broth evening stretched out a usual about nine o'clock be asleep when outer gate of castle be opened then there be loud trampling of foot then door be unlocked when officer came in followed by lot of soldier thought that be up with officer made sign that be to go with made so certain that be being taken out to be shot hung said few word to men telling that end have evidently come that must die a christian british sailor be led out about hundred turkish soldier closed round be surprised when marched out of place a went on through street of town supposed be taking to quiet spot outside wall then turned in through gateway then know rest martyn think that be coward that felt afraid to die when horace rushed out to speak to must have knocked over with feather be not until got out into garden found party formed up there that be quite sure be not dream when have talked over rescue mr beveridge said well have have enough of cruising for present will make for athens at once captain martyn by time probably something will be going on there be late in february when anchor be dropped in harbour of piraeus mr beveridge at once went on shore with martyn returned next morning news of importance father horace asked a came on board yes hypsilantes be likely to be succeeded by rival mavrocordatos samian adventurer named lykourgos have got together fleet have proposed landing at chios there can be doubt that intention be simply plunder for even if must drive turk out of chios must not possibly hold island a large turkish fleet will very shortly be ready to sail out of dardanelles worst of be that chiots be utterly opposed to movement of kind be agricultural people island have always be mildly governed lightly taxed municipal administration be already in own hand tax collected by when admiral tombazes appeared off chios with greek fleet during first cruise inhabitant turned deaf ear to invitation to to rise in fact there be doubt that people of chios have everything to lose nothing to gain by becoming part of greece have sent urgent remonstrance against landing of greek troop on island pointing out that there be strong body of turkish troop there that citadel must not be captured that attempt must only inflame passion of mohammedan population end in ruin disaster to christian inhabitant hypsilantes have written mild letter to lykourgos suggesting that must at rate be prudent to defer enterprise be feared however that like greek commander in general fellow will pay attention to will proceed on own account martyn agrees with that must be a well for to cruise about island see how matter go on endeavour to rescue of turk from fury of greek of greek from fury of turk must say best thing to do father horace said indignantly must be to attack ship of fellow lykourgos to hang at own yard arm must be good action doubt horace a have with fleet of seventy eighty vessel be probable that if made attempt must decorate yard arm not lykourgos at rate will stop here for two three day give men run on shore just at present owing to fact of having destroyed that turkish frigate will be very popular character be not likely to get into serious row have still got money paid for conduct at cyprus when sailor have got money in pocket be never happy until have got chance of spending accordingly crew have twelve hour on shore third of number going day on fourth day vessel sailed for chios cruised round island for fortnight frequently overhauled fishing boat have conversation with crew learned that fresh troop have lately arrived at chios that a band be principally composed of volunteer vehid pasha governor have great difficulty in maintaining order among have persuaded christian to raise monthly contribution of thirty four thousand piastre to give regular pay ration to troop so keep in good temper on d of march schooner made out large fleet of vessel approaching island kept away until saw anchor then cast anchor at short distance from boat at once put off from ship flying flag of lykourgos to demand who be with what intention be there fly a see flag of greece mr beveridge replied to officer have authority of greek government to fight against enemy however recognize authority on part of commander unless be acting at present time under explicit order of prince mavrocordatos who be now president of greece will therefore consult only own feeling a to whether not take part in proceeding on shore admiral will know how to make obey order officer said angrily be admiral mr beveridge asked a if for information be not aware that have received commission must authorize to use title either from last president from present one when be well assured that be case will naturally modify view a to compelling can look round at armament of craft three month ago destroyed turkish frigate fancy that if be interfered with must give good account of many of vessel anchored there if therefore lykourgos be really bent upon capture of chios must advise to set about without wasting time in meddling with may mention to that be english gentleman who have fitted up vessel for purpose of aiding greece to achieve independence that in honourable warfare be ready to take part if see that object of expedition be honourable warfare will lend assistance in power if find that be merely plunder destruction will also do in power to prevent greek flag from being disgraced by act only worthy of pirate moreover will take care that countryman various nation of europe will obtain fair account of what have be done here greek be completely cowed by calmness confidence of owner of schooner returned to boat without of swagger with have quitted horace translated father speech to martyn other two officer a soon a mr beveridge have returned to cabin chief be perfect brick martyn said enthusiastically fancy sending off such message a from schooner to fellow commanding sixty seventy sail sir richard grenville must hardly have sent from deck of revenge more defiant message to spanish fleet miller rubbed hand will get men in readiness for making sail casting off gun captain martyn there will be time enough martyn said when make out movement among can get up sail in time can must not be surprised if fellow lykourgos knuckle down did see how officer came down from stilt if fellow have pluck must be sailing to meet turkish fleet instead of landing to pillage here for from what mr beveridge said that can be only motive still will keep sharp look out on if see flag ship signalling to others boat putting off to will know what to expect may a well get buoy on anchor chain have everything ready to slip be too near to be pleasant if open fire once under way out of close range can talk to a like chapter xiv chios quarter of hour after greek officer left schooner miller said be lowering large boat from greek flag ship sir martyn brought glass to bear upon there be stir on board said look a if commander be going on shore yes there be officer of importance being handed down ladder now be putting off by jove believe be coming here at rate be heading straight for perhaps lykourgos be coming to blow out of water quite a likely be coming to pay respect miller said betting be ten to one fellow be coward that if officer gave message a got be impressed with idea that chief be englishman of great importance possessed perhaps of unknown power of destruction horace martyn said have better tell father can make out that fellow in stern be got up in gorgeous uniform expect be lykourgos mr beveridge came up on to quarter deck just a boat came alongside martyn went to gangway a greek officer came up announced that admiral lykourgos have come to pay visit to english lord lykourgos mounted to deck be commandant of craft sir martyn said be mr beveridge owner lykourgos advanced with air of great pleasure with outstretched hand be delighted to make acquaintance of english friend of greece said mr beveridge bowed shook hand with greek what contrast there be between miller whispered to horace theatrical looking greek with oily manner father in quiet blue serge ah be asking to go down into cabin interview lasted about ten minute then two men returned on deck lykourgos entered boat rowed away well sir be peace war martyn asked peace a far a be concerned mr beveridge said fellow made allusion to message to paid large number of absurd compliment expressed boundless admiration at result of miller action with frigate of have heard hoped that must have assistance against turk told what thought of enterprise that be bringing destruction upon head of unfortunate christian assured that have be misinformed that christian must join to man that must make short work of turk must at once besiege in citadel said that wished success in part of undertaking that there must be time to waste a turkish fleet might understood appear day that if undertook siege operation own force proved inadequate must land party to assist hinted that money might be required to support siege told that have arranged with central government that assistance have to give in way must be given through that if people of island really did rise must be happy to furnish thousand musket ammunition for use seeing that nothing be to be got out of took leave said landing be to take place in hour will send party on shore with mr beveridge martyn asked martyn say have got two thousand five hundred fighting men ready to land that being case must be powerless to interfere in way besides for present think must be best to keep men on board trust fellow in slightest if thought vessel be left weak handed be perfectly capable of making sudden attack on doubt think have money untold below must say great proportion of vessel be better than pirate who have merely joined in hope of booty know that have none of psara ship with for chios lie so near island that must have wish to draw vengeance of turk upon know a well a chiots sent to corinth to protest against expedition think have of hydriot ship with only sail under own admiral do to certain extent respect order of central government ship fancy belong to smaller island be sort of craft be honest trader one day pirate next if see chance riffraff of island in fact if really do besiege turk in citadel see that can be of assistance will land party at rate will take matter quietly until see how thing go vessel be lowering boat captain martyn tarleton reported very well mr tarleton let men go to quarter unloose gun load with grape be quite upon card that fellow may make sudden dash upon thinking to catch napping boatswain whistle be heard then tom burdett shouted out hand to quarter cast loose gun load with grape in moment scene of animated bustle succeeded quiet have reigned on board schooner since anchor have be dropped in few minute however crowded boat left ship rowed towards shore will do boatswain can call men away from gun said martyn will take cartridge out sir leave a be put fold two of sailcloth over touch hole be just a well to be on guard a long a be in neighbourhood of slippery gentry horace take glass go aloft see if can make out turk in neighbourhood be four five hour since greek fleet first hove in sight there be ample time for turk to have come down to oppose landing if thought strong enough to fight in open horace ascended shroud sitting on cap of mainmast examined shore there be dozen horseman riding about short distance from shore sir called down can see sign of troop anywhere then be evident mean to fight martyn said to first lieutenant between ourselves miller be very glad be not here to oppose landing for if have be no doubt chief must have wanted to fire few shot to help cover operation must be sorry to lift even finger to help in wretched business be like landing from one of old buccaneer fleet on spanish main used to pretend went to attack spaniard while in reality simply fought for plunder still fellow have courage plenty of be more fancy than greek be likely to exhibit when once get in front of turk lykourgos with twenty five hundred men marched without opposition into town of chios where burnt custom house destroyed two mosque plundered generally house of inhabitant occupied house nearest citadel placing rifleman in opened fire while party began to throw up battery on commanding position known a turloti following morning mr beveridge landed accompanied by miller horace party of twenty sailor armed with rifle cutlas pistol proceeded to chios found street of town in disorder troop rather armed men for be under discipline control be wandering about occasionally going within sight of citadel discharging musket two three time in direction looked with surprise at orderly little party of british sailor a supposed have come to help received with exclamation of good will visited turloti where score two of men be working lazily then went down to port where battery have also be begun what on earth be putting up battery here for miller said at distance might a well fire potato at citadel ask officer horace what be up to greek replied that be going to run trench forward against citadel from point well then be fonder of work than gave credit for miller said when understood reply if whole of be to set to work in earnest must take month to run trench from here up to citadel at rate at be working now must take couple of year returning to town mr beveridge called upon lykourgos who have taken up quarter in bishop palace greek received with air of much greater pomposity than have shown at first meeting evidently believed that work be almost accomplished that be already conqueror of island have be doing good work morning said have deposed demogeronts municipal council know be poor creature lukewarm have appointed revolutionary committee indeed mr beveridge said gravely what military work have in hand seems to that men must be much better employed in working at battery than in idling about street citadel will soon fall lykourgos said loftily cut off from succour surrounded by army must speedily surrender undoubtedly must if be so situated mr beveridge said so far a see there be nothing whatever to prevent turk from sending reinforcement from mainland be writing to ask government at corinth to order fleet here to blockade island oppose

massacre of greek be in constant fear of retaliation upon by mussulmans made sure that sooner later if war went on chios must become involved in of course did not suppose that mad brained expedition a of lykourgos must be undertaken supposed that sufficient force must be sent to ensure capture of island accompanied by fleet must protect from that of turk even be greatly dreaded by knew that turkish province governed by greek official be much more heavily taxed oppressed than in turk collected taxation knew that change must be for very much for worse except that have same religion have little in common with greek in mainland dreaded thought of albanian who must be sure to send over armed band who must harass oppress of course have be for century under turkish rule island have certainly flourished exceedingly under trade have be almost entirely with constantinople connection be turkish can quite understand therefore repugnance to change must ruin trade vastly increase burden while a to master must imagine that one in sens must prefer albanian to turk seeing storm coming most of wealthy chiots have prepared in way for by sending much of available capital for safety to correspondent abroad by investing in foreign security believe that merchant have done so a greater part of money valuable remained be at present down in hold will be able to live if not in a great luxury a before at rate in comfort at corfu wherever may settle while several of have told that intend again to embark in trade if possible under flag have be asking good many question about ourselves

when everything be in readiness dead silence reigned fore aft noise be now much louder there must be doubt longer that be caused by approach of large number of boat then martyn spoke in clear voice

direction in can hear oar to fire when get light minute later rocket shot up in air a burst number of boat be seen crowded together towing behind two large brig there be moment pause while men at gun adjusted aim then pivot gun roared out four on broadside followed in quick succession distance be about six hundred yard crashing of wood followed by chorus of shout cry arose a storm of grape swept down upon boat load again lad a quick a can martyn shouted show couple of blue light quarter master boatswain load pivot with ball fire a fast a can at brig never mind boat will attend to blue light be lit rocket sent up so a to burst over enemy again broadside of grape be poured in while shot from pivot gun crashed into bow of one of brig have apparently be lashed together so that boat must tow on broad front confused din came across water shout cry order mingled together a far a must be seen everything be in confusion of boat have sunk occupant be being pulled on board of others have thrown off tow rope be heading for schooner others lay helpless in water illustration repelling turkish boarder keep rocket going quarter master martyn said more light have better horace tell men at aft

made straight at vessel a approached opened fire of musketry be answered by rifle musket of sailor a swept up alongside shot be heaved down into crashing of plank told that have done work gun on starboard side be silent at first a first boat came up so close alongside that must not reach followed be further out two be instantly sunk a turk strove to climb up side cut way through boarding netting be shot down by pistol run through by boarding pike few managed to climb over force way through netting be cut down before must obtain footing on deck for ten minute fight went on by flare of blue light then eight turkish boat alone floated rowed away crowded with survivor from others loud cheer broke from schooner never mind men martyn shouted load with ball now aim at brig have taken part in fight left by boat head on to schooner almost without steerage way have in vain endeavoured to get broadside on so a to bring gun to bear lashing have be cut rudder be put in opposite direction have drifted little apart with head outwards a boat rowed away from schooner opened fire with bow gun boatswain with men working pivot gun have from first continued steadily at work regardless of din around horace taking place beside in order to call off to aid in repelling turk must gain footing anywhere on deck when boarding netting have be triced up gap have be left opposite gun fire at brig have be kept up without intermission shot raking one other of fore aft a soon a boat be fairly away gun from starboard side be run across spare port being thrown open eight gun brought into play to aid pivot gun a soon a boat reached brig took shelter behind in short time craft began to swing round gun firing a be brought to bear eight gun side miller said must not matter if there be twenty if did not aim better than for not single shot have struck schooner one two passed overhead rest went wide instead of brig being left broadside on a have expected head swept round until be stern on to schooner then began slowly to glide away have have enough of miller exclaimed cheer broke from schooner cease firing martyn said if leave alone be content to leave alone must have suffered tremendously a be examination be now made a to casualty four men have be killed be shot through head a have fired over bulwark at boat a came alongside six others be wounded more le seriously by pistol shot have be fired by turk a tried to climb on board small total indeed considering nature of attack when morning dawned brig must be made out near opposite shore be still being towed by boat a be looking at sail be made a light breeze sprang up when wind reached mainmast of one be seen to go over side having doubtless be wounded by raking fire carrying in fall fore top gallant mast topmast quarter of hour later breeze reached schooner deck have be already washed down everything have resumed ordinary aspect before getting up anchor four men who have fallen who have already be sewn up in hammock be committed to sea mr beveridge reading funeral service over mr macfarlane reported that wounded be likely to do well a soon a fight be over woman child who have be suffering agony of terror while have be going on have be brought out from hold allowed to sleep a usual on lower deck have be entirely given up to when schooner got under weigh be permitted to come up on deck although have be assured by zaimes brother that danger be over first action on coming up be to look round timidly be evidently greatly relieved when saw that sea be clear of enemy looked much surprised at seeing everything going on a usual at absence of sign of terrible conflict have heard raging round night before bullet mark in bulwark being only evidence of what have passed have already be decided to sail for greece in course of day two a have a many fugitive on board a must carry be now determined to do so at once a sailed west made out large number of ship approaching be soon running through greek fleet be sorry left now miller said will miss fight expect will be back in time macfarlane remarked greek be in great hurry to fight be two month since be sent for when landing be made at chios after taking time to make up mind about be likely to take few day before make up mind to have tussle with turk greek mind observe be full of contradiction sometimes especially if there be plunder to be got eagerness be just wonderful when be question of fighting caution be very remarkable miller laughed daresay be right doctor feel at confident that there will be fight so far greek fleet have done nothing only idea of fighting turkish ship have be to launch fire ship against fire ship be good against enemy who know what be doing martyn said couple of boat can always tow fire ship clear turk be lubberly sailor fire ship seem almost to paralyse ca make out miller put in why turk must manoeuvre vessel so badly considering that sailor be for most part thessalian drawn from mohammedan sea side village albanian by blood just a hydriots be want british officer doctor said officer be always weak point with turk there be braver soldier in world when be well led never be well led now pasha seem to be chosen for stupidity obstinacy be great pity that did not make up mind to take turkey instead of india eh man must have made grand country of when have once got into order will make grand country of india day doctor have never be out there there be doubt just what say about turk be true of native there make very good soldier when have british officer to lead so say captain martyn must remember that have only fought against other native without british officer to lead must wait till see fighting against european troop of other nation before can say that be fine soldier if wait till then be likely to wait long time doctor besides must remember did fight well against french troop under dupleix so did not till got idea that soldier be better than french a say will be long time before get chance again french be no longer power in india be dutch distance be too long for ever to send out army big enough to wrest india from a to marching by land well must not be done next day reached port of athens got rid of cargo of passenger then with sail set hurried back to chios touching at psara on way a from direction in greek be steering thought probable might have made stay there small psariot vessel have just come in from fleet horace who have gone ashore with marco learned that miaoulis greek admiral have coasted along north of chios that turk have at once weighed anchor gone out to engage greek not caring to fight in narrow water where power of manoeuvring must be thrown away have stood out engagement have taken place at mouth of gulf of smyrna fought most valiantly greek said be drawn battle what be done horace asked how many vessel be sunk on side oh there be vessel sunk fired at fired at be there many killed wounded think there be killed wounded see manoeuvred round turk must not go near because gun be much heavier than ours sent down fire ship among unfortunately evaded of most daring captain ventured so close that ship be struck by turkish shot yesterday combat be renewed again cannonading be like thunder morning again fought then needed rest to get fresh meat sailed back horace have difficulty in restraining expression of disgust at conduct of fleet have after two month delay at last sailed to annihilate turk a walked back to boat marco poured out in undertone volume of execration in choice greek a reached schooner doctor looked over side be not too late horace there be greek fleet rounding point a ca make out with glass shot hole in sail splinter on bulwark be evident be right that be in plenty of time to see engagement be mistaken doctor horace said a reached deck there have be great naval battle lasting three day there be killed wounded one two ship commanded by daring captain ventured within gun shot of turk be struck be exact history of affair a learned from one of hero be that really story have heard horace mr beveridge asked be father almost in word that be told to really think martyn said seeing how depressed mr beveridge looked at news that much more must hardly be expected from greek ship be for most part small metal very light have not slightest idea of discipline of working in concert turkish broadside must sink dozen of if ventured to close quarter of course superior seamanship be not of slightest avail a long a fight at distance must avail if have pluck horace said bitterly english ship went out to engage great galleon of spanish armada be a inferior in tonnage in weight of metal a greek be for that gave good account of yes horace must remember that english sailor have be fighting thrashing spaniard for year before have come almost to despise while greek have never fought before have confidence in hold turk in high respect ca expect doctor put in bulldog be going to be manufactured out of mongrel in one generation horace fighting race grows up little by little greek fought just a pluckily in old day against big odds a ever did may do again in time have got to be built up to thank doctor mr beveridge said keep on forgetting that greek have be slave slave lose military virtue be just same thing with briton valour excited admiration of caesar after being under domination of roman for generation completely lost manhood fell easy victim to saxon must not be too hard on greek horace expect to behave a men whose father have be free independent in evening miller went ashore with mr beveridge have talk with philhellene who have joined expedition agreed that miaoulis have manoeuvred ship well always keeping weather gauge of turk there be shadow of discipline among ship fire be a wild inefficient a of turk men loading firing a quickly a must quite regardless of direction distance of shot great part of entered sea half way between combatant kanaris be here said will see that at least will attempt something against turk before be done be not however until fifteen day later that move be made kanaris have paid visit to misericordia be greatly struck by order discipline prevailed men will not submit to beveridge be in vain to assure that nothing can be done unless can introduce discipline such a prevails on ship of war of other nation unfortunately have be accustomed to state of thing sailor be always paid by share in profit of voyage everyone have say a to port to be visited course to be steered before change be made there be always general council of on board matter be decided by vote such being habit can understand difficulty of getting men to submit to anything like discipline thing be that ship belong to private person not to state although may receive pay from government be therefore very chary of exposing vessel to risk of loss for more likely than not must never receive penny from central government have plenty of object of much greater interest to member to spend money upon until total change take place in organization manning of fleet can see hope of improvement on th of june two ship got up anchor sailed on board schooner progress be watched with interest kanaris have confided to mr beveridge that ship be loaded with combustible that be going to attempt to set fire to turkish fleet wind be contrary two craft tacked backwards forward off north of chios a if intending to beat up gulf of smyrna four hour after have started schooner also got under way a be anxious to see what must take place mr beveridge have told kanaris that must go within short distance of turkish fleet burn blue light so that boat on leaving fire ship must row off to be taken back to psara be last day of ramazan number of principal officer of turkish fleet have be invited by capitan pasha to dine with on board flag ship to celebrate feast of bairam night be dark one whole of turkish vessel be illuminated in honour of festival outline be clearly visible misericordia have entered northern passage hour after two greek ship being when last seen about three mile ahead schooner lay to couple of mile distant from anchorage have scarcely done so when made out sail of two vessel between line of light on turkish war ship there go martyn said steering straight in one of be making straight for capitan pasha own ship doubt be kanaris other be making for seventy four carry flag of reala bey can tell by variegated lamp along yard turk evidently have not caught sight of yet must open fire on dark night a suppose will make out till be close alongside kanaris man of greatest calmness courage be at helm of craft running straight before wind steered down upon eighty gun ship of capitan pasha not until be within ship length be observed when startled hail sounded from deck of turkish ship steering straight on ran bowsprit through one of port hole sailor instantly threw grapnel to retain in position then jumped into boat lying alongside a soon a did so kanaris fired pistol into train fire flashed along deck there be series of sharp explosion then flame ran aloft rigging sail being soaked with turpentine kanaris have scarcely stepped into boat before ship be in mass of flame lying to windward of turk flame be blown on to pouring in at open port hole at once set fire to quantity of tent stowed on lower deck rushed up hatch mingling with flame from sail have ignited awning extending over deck ran up rigging spar of man of war most terrible confusion instantly prevailed throughout ship few boat alongside be sunk by crowd who leapt into crew of ship lying round at once began to haul farther away from blazing vessel boat be lowered feared to approach because of falling spar flame poured from lower port hole in addition to crew soldier on board pasha guest be great number of prisoner who have be brought off from island to be taken to constantinople shriek cry a be caught by flame sprang overboard to evade be terrible kara ali sprang from ship into boat approached near enough for purpose of saving before must put off blazing spar fell on capitan pasha be so severely wounded that died shortly after being carried on shore loss be severe one for turk for be most skilful naval officer few of who leapt overboard be picked up by boat swam to other ship with exception whole of on board vessel perished other fire ship have be calmly skilfully managed in haste excitement commander after running alongside ship of reala bey fired train made off without attaching to consequently fire ship drifted away without flame communicating to turk burned out harmlessly a soon a be seen that kanaris have succeeded blue light be burned on board schooner in twenty minute two boat rowed alongside not shot have be fired at turk being too much occupied with danger of fire to pay attention to kanaris be heartily congratulated on success when reached schooner at once set sail be back at psara in morning where news of destruction of turkish man of war be received with wildest enthusiasm turkish vessel leaving strong garrison on island sailed north few day later be pursued by greek fleet however did not venture to interfere with although stopped at two port on way finally anchored under gun of fort of dardanelles misericordia took part in harassing turkish fleet martyn have asked mr beveridge opinion upon subject being in favour of doing so think must give greek lesson two in sort of thing sir show what can be done even against fleet by craft mean business be sure must do that martyn think must be justified in running slightest risk of loss of life among men merely for purpose must do more than greek do unless be willing to expose more must not hope either to capture sink one of turkish ship in face of whole fleet know must give great deal of trouble more than that must not do when greek show willing to fight will fight by side not before be indeed glad that so decided for on evening before greek set sail boat arrived at psara with six fugitive from chios reported that destruction of capitan pasha ship with on board have brought fresh misfortune upon christian for that mussulmans infuriated by detail of disaster have fallen upon christian over island even in village where hitherto there have be no trouble second massacre be indeed far more fatal than first woman child being a before spared a slave many thousand being carried away small craft from psara hovered round island succeeded in taking off number of fugitive while schooner returned to cruising ground between island mainland up gulf of smyrna where captured burnt large number of small craft laden with slave have to make four trip to island to clear crowded deck of hapless chiots news of massacre of chios unlike committed by greek spread sedulously over europe excited deep general horror indignation number of killed sold into slavery be never known estimate varied considerably putting down at twenty thousand while others maintained that figure must be doubled without exaggeration be probable however that really exceeded thirty thousand detail of terrible massacre learnt from woman rescued aroused among officer crew of misericordia far deeper feeling of enthusiasm for cause of greece than have hitherto felt since came out interest in cause have be steadily waning tale of wholesale brutal massacre constant violation of term of surrender cowardice of greek in action eagerness for plunder incessant dispute between various party absence of general attempt to concert measure for defence have completely damped sympathy for sight of hundred of woman child widowed orphaned torn away from native land sold into slavery set blood boiling with indignation two greek took care to translate narrative of weeping woman to sailor excited among passionate desire to punish author of outrage have of craft overhauled made active resistance little mercy must have be shown to turk a be be bundled headlong into boat with many hearty kick cuff from sailor destruction of vessel be effected with alacrity satisfaction of men performing act of righteous retribution poor creature seemed terribly cast down martyn said one day at dinner a sailed with last batch of chiots for corfu have transported three previous cargo to ionian island a former one have be most unwillingly received in greek port authority saying that have mean of affording subsistence to fugitive who be daily arriving in ionian island committee have be formed distributed money sent out from england for support while ration be issued to by british authority of island one ca wonder at miller said still must say that woman even at first seem a delighted a one must expect at getting out of hand of turk be not so very sure miller that be delighted at macfarlane said quietly think be doing greatest service possible in opinion be more than doubtful whether see in same light what not thankful at being rescued from being sold a slave to turk sound very terrible doubt must not be pleasant lot for seeing that must set to work life must be worse than dog have got to put in position of unfortunate woman girl then must see that might think differently about to begin with till now there have be animosity between turk be admitted that turk have be gentle master to chios people have be happy contented prosperous misfortune have be brought upon not by turk by greek who came to island contrary to entreaty plundered ill used then left to vengeance of turk so if have preference for will certainly not be for greek a to being sold a slave suppose view at in same way do be not going to be sold to work in field anything of sort turk treat domestic slave kindly to one of chiot girl there be nothing very terrible in being slave in household of rich turk know that georgian circassian girl look forward to being sold to turk know that life at constantinople be vastly easier more luxurious than at home say for moment that woman must not prefer life of ease among own people friend what be life before now to have to work for own living in field to go a servant among greek italian family dark uncertain future tell man think be doing mighty service doubt whether there be one of think so chiots be celebrated for docility intelligence woman child must fetch high price in market be purchased by wealthy turk lot must be enviable one in comparison to awaits most of word slavery be hateful to be not so many year since be sending people out in hundred to work a slave in plantation of virginia word slavery in east have not same terror a have with doubt if feeling of chiot peasant girl on way to be sold be not good deal like of girl who go up from scotch english village to edinburgh london to go into service in grand family think be going to better to have fine clothes to live among fine people a turn out maybe be better off than be before maybe be worse be most disagreeable man macfarlane martyn said after pause here have be thinking that have be doing good action put altogether out of conceit with have be doing good action doctor said have be acting according to light to be abominable thing that greek woman child must be sold a slave to heathen turk be only pointing out to that from point of view there be nothing so terrible in lot that have reason to expect very lively gratitude from that looking at matter only from material point of view be not likely to be benefited by change know that if be greek woman must rather be slave in family of rich turk than working a drudge say in family of maltese shopkeeper though if be scotch girl must certainly choose other way sat silent for minute two idea be wholly new one to must not deny that according to point of view of chiot captive be reasonable one mr beveridge be first to speak what say have certainly given shock doctor can not deny that there be truth in still know there be something beyond mere material advantage deny sir a say a briton christian feel that be doing good work still can hardly be surprised that chiots naturally view differently christianity be like of eastern christian of very debased form living so long among turk have very great horror of mohammedanism know on mainland ten of thousand of albanian have become mohammedan think that be justified in inflicting what one can not see be from material point of view distinct injury to people because a christian feel be for moral advantage then be just same feeling caused spaniard to exterminate native of west indian island who declined to become christian oh say doctor be too strong altogether miller exclaimed indignantly well prove by argument doctor replied calmly be not saying that from point of view be not more than justified be simply explaining why chiots feel extraordinary gratitude to be benefiting if did know be saving body soul be not light in see be right doctor mr beveridge said now put before be really not surprised that poor creature feel very lively gratitude be fond of ease comfort have be accustomed to to utter uncertainty of life among stranger be not unreasonably more terrible than prospect of easy life a favoured slave in turkish household be sad that must be so be human nature still consideration must not weigh with in carrying out what know to be good work have saved in more than three thousand soul from turkish slavery can only trust in long run most of will recognize inestimable service have rendered chapter xvii rescuing garrison of athens tell what be mr beveridge governor said when latter went up to call a usual upon arrival at corfu quite begin to dread appearance of smart schooner of yours during last five week have added thousand mouth to anxiety what be to do with poor creature have not slightest idea ca go on feeding for ever what with voluntary fugitive brought over to there be at present forty fifty thousand stranger in island of something like half be absolutely dependent on for mean of living be very difficult problem mr beveridge said of course when war be over great proportion of will return to home in greece fugitive from turkish island mainland be in different position doubtless when peace be made there will be arrangement by family have men among can also return to home without being molested consisting only of woman child must not do so of woman girl can find employment in greek family suppose rest will finally become absorbed a servant in town on adriatic see nothing else for mr beveridge unless choose to continue good work transport in batch across atlantic believe there be great dearth of woman in canada united state will have to set up school teach english first sir mr beveridge laughed must not be welcomed there when can speak language will think over suggestion do think that greece ever will be free mr beveridge think so certainly think so terrible massacre on side seem to render absolutely impossible that must return to former relation turk have not yet made great effort believe that when do will reconquer greece think will hold hatred between race be now so bitter that can never live together in peace believe that greek will continue resistance so long that europe at last will come to assistance insist upon frontier line being drawn terrible affair of chios dreadful a be will tend to that christian feeling of europe will become more more excited until if government hold back people will force forward england france at least will if necessary intervene by force believe that must do so now be not for jealousy of russia be russia who fomented revolution for own purpose be solely fear that will reap whole benefit of action that cause england france to look on struggle with folded arm fancy be right that will be end of governor said need not say how earnestly wish time must come can assure have very anxious time of with providing for people what with preventing breach of neutrality by greek what with calumny complaint that greek scatter broadcast against can assure that task be not enviable one can quite imagine that greek make very hard for well wishers to assist indeed if be bent upon bringing obloquy upon name must hardly act otherwise than be doing one man have hitherto produced who go way regardless of intrigue faction fighting bravely for country be constantine kanaris who have destroyed two turkish ship with own hand hundred of such men a be greece must have achieved independence without foreign assistance yet even in own ship be unable to maintain even shadow of what must consider discipline acknowledged a much to at psara hear took off after have burned turkish war vessel yes be lying off port saw be glad be not nearer for be terrible business be barbarous war altogether then why do mix up in mr beveridge mother be greek have always lived in greek thought rather than in english desire not only independence regeneration of greek have lost virtue of ancestor save intelligence once free will hope trust recover lost virtue become if not great people can hardly do number being comparatively so few at least worthy one hope may certainly have enthusiastic friend only week two since young fellow named hastings lieutenant of navy came out have fortune of seven eight thousand pound intends to devote to buying fitting out ship for service there be score of english french officer kicking heel at corinth vainly asking for employment hear be organizing corp composed entirely of foreign officer who will fight a private soldier without pay simply for purpose of endeavouring to shame greek into feeling of patriotism where be thinking of sailing now if have fixed plan must advise to go round to athens say turkish garrison be at last extremity have have message from consulate there asking to send british ship of war round to insist upon condition of surrender being observed unfortunately insane rage for retrenchment at home have so diminished strength of fleet that have single ship in water at time like hear that french consul have also sent urgently asking for ship of war at rate influence might do something fear not mr beveridge said gravely however men gun might have weight at rate will go round at once do best if possible be even more anxious to save turk from massacre by greek than greek from massacre by turk can understand that governor said cordially well wish good fortune mr beveridge say honestly that wish to see saucy schooner again unless come in with empty deck give turn at malta next time dear sir will feel really grateful towards four day after leaving corfu schooner dropped anchor in port of athens learning from first boat put off to that capitulation of turk be to be signed on following morning mr beveridge determined to land at once in order that might see a many of leading official a possible urge upon necessity of preventing repetition of breach of faith have brought such disgrace to greek name will take zaimes with said to martyn must see sign of intention upon part of populace to commence massacre of turk will send off instantly in case captain martyn will at once land whole of crew fully armed with exception say of five men march to british consulate in athens know where be take greek flag with for two reason in first place if be to go without greek must spread report that crew of english ship of war have landed in second place may quieten appease mob if see that be in service of greece very well sir will carry out instruction think that rascally mob will venture to interfere with hope not martyn at rate must risk that other message may have to send off to will send by ordinary messenger if be wanted will trust one zaimes late in evening greek came off with letter must mr beveridge hoped be well turk have agreed to surrender arm greek have bound to convey to asia minor in neutral ship by term of capitulation turk be to be allowed to retain one half of money jewel one half of movable property have hope that treaty will be respected mr beveridge wrote be happy to say that bishop of athens who be man of high character president of areopagus have insisted upon civil military authority taking most solemn oath to observe strictly term of capitulation so far to redeem good faith of nation have be so deeply stained by violation of so many previous treaty next morning mussulmans marched out from acropolis out of remaining only be men capable of bearing arm so stoutly obstinately have defended place yielding only when last drop of water in cistern be exhausted be housed in extensive building in town three day passed quietly two ephors who have be ordered by greek government to hasten embarkation of turk took step to do so on morning of fourth day horace who have be twice on shore to see father saw boat rowing off to ship turned glass upon exclaimed there be zaimes on board that boat captain martyn be sure father must not send on board unless there be trouble in town martyn did not wait for boat to arrive instantly mustered armed crew boat be in water by time zaimes arrived alongside handed note to martyn contained only word land instantly be murdering turk with hearty execration upon greek martyn ordered men to take place in boat gave final order to tarleton who be to remain in charge get gun loaded with ball mr tarleton for aught know may have to fight way down to beach fire first shot over head if doe not frighten plump others into three boat pushed off doctor taking place by side of horace who be in command of one of have got instrument doctor horace asked smiling have got instrument macfarlane said tapping butt of heavy pair of pistol just for once be going a combatant thought there be limit to everything there really doe seem to be limit to faithlessness of greek must like very much to help to give little lesson a to sanctity of oath sailor marched in compact body from port to town have be told errand upon have come from pace at marched expression of angry determination on face be evident that entered thoroughly into business be met at entrance to town by mr beveridge be of use going to british consulate said there be english official there place be simply in charge of greek who dare not if must move in matter turk be taking refuge in french austrian dutch consulate be more than doubtful whether flag will be respected have better place say eight men at with order to defend place till last if mob attack while with rest of men can endeavour to escort fugitive turk to consulate let men use arm till last extremity martyn very well sir where will be will go to french consulate aid there in pacifying mob son have better go to one of others harangue from window horace point out to that be disgracing greece in eye of europe implore not to bring austria on back by insulting flag at same time see that lower shutter be barred be ready to sally out with men to bring in fugitive who may approach mr miller do take eight men to dutch consulate martyn said follow instruction mr beveridge have given to son zaimes will go with mr miller thank mr beveridge if will do haranguing will look after fighting if there be to be done three party of eight men at once started for consulate martyn waited till have gone then turned to remainder boatswain take ten men go one way will go way with rest heard mr beveridge instruction that men be not to use arm unless absolutely attacked at same time if come upon of greek engaged in murdering woman child will remember there be order against using hand that there be window a well a door by greek can be made to leave house ay ay sir tom burdett replied with grin will be a gentle with a possible martyn have provided several small greek flag have be fastened to boat hook party taking one of proceeded on way have gone little distance when shriek cry be heard bursting into house from proceeded sailor came upon greek engaged in diabolical work of torturing woman child with cheer fell upon striking right left with fist levelling astonished greek to ground then turk be placed safely in midst with few hearty kick at prostrate ruffian marched out scene be repeated again again punishment inflicted upon greek being more more severe time when twenty fugitive have be collected be marched through yelling rabble to one other of consulate to large

soldierly looking man said earnestly for have not be for brave crew even flag of consulate must not have sufficed to protect assuredly countryman must never fire at when engaged in such work of mercy might not in cold blood mr beveridge said have just be saving chiot prisoner a cruelly treated for turk who have be massacred in athens well nigh hundred chiots have be murdered defend for breaking pledged faith to one can not be surprised at savage thirst for vengeance martyn have got up anchor set sail on schooner directly fugitive be on board a soon a learned that tenedos be destination

place in with one of turkish officer white flag be hoisted in stern six men rowed ashore movement have be watched body of turkish soldier be drawn up at landing place with several official turkish officer mounted step explained to governor of island who be among at landing stage purpose for misericordia have arrived at port there be rapid conversation a officer frequently interrupted by exclamation of indignation question from turk narrated what have taken place then governor officer ran forward seized miller horace by hand patted on shoulder with liveliest demonstration of gratitude friendship turk who have come ashore with translated to horace in greek governor earnest request that owner of ship officer must come ashore to visit governor say that must at once come off to visit ship return thanks that a be flying greek flag can not do so much a desire that if flag be lowered white flag substituted must come off instantly have heard of fight between greek ship with english crew boat of turkish fleet of many craft have taken destroyed always sparing crew sending ashore have great esteem for so brave enemy now can not view a friend after noble rescue of so many of countryman woman child horace in reply said that must give governor message to father that fugitive must at once be landed do think that really meant that must come on board if hoisted white flag horace think so father officer with certainly seemed thoroughly in earnest what do think martyn there can be objection to lowering greek flag must think while acting a neutral must think not martyn said must not care snap of finger if there be greek flag be well enough mr beveridge when see armed turk of superior size in sight at other time feel proud of will lower down then martyn greek flag be lowered from peak white one run up then work of debarkation commenced turk insisting upon shaking hand with mr beveridge officer thanking in most fervent way calling down blessing of allah upon while woman many of weeping threw on knee poured out thanks of holding up infant to gaze on face of to whom owed life sailor came in for share of thanks be quite embarrassed by warmth with be greeted just a first batch left ship large boat flying turkish flag be seen putting out from shore in few minute governor with seven eight civil military official came on board brought with merchant who spoke english to act a interpreter martyn drew up whole of crew who be not engaged in boat service a guard of honour to receive while with mr beveridge met governor a mounted gangway governor who be tall dignified turk expressed to warmest thanks in name of sultan for rescue of so many of subject from fury of populace of athens mr beveridge through interpreter explained to pasha although englishman have greek blood in vein have therefore joined in attempt to achieve independence be prepared to fight on side that a englishman revolted against barbarity with war be carried on by combatant that vessel be named misericordia that while have saved great number of christian fugitive on one side be equally ready pleased at being able to render same service to mussulman fugitive on other side illustration governor come on board errand be noble merciful one turk said must have approval of allah a well a of god of christian have heard of terrible vessel how destroyed frigate off cyprus beat off boat of fleet at chios played havoc among shipping from smyrna knew when saw for have heard of white sail tall mast have heard too that prisoner be injured by never thought to set foot on deck of ship have become dread of trader of smyrna other port be glad to do so since who sail although enemy in battle have proved indeed friend in time of distress when have be translated mr beveridge invited governor companion into cabin where coffee chibouks be served then be conducted round ship governor conversed for little time with two three of principal turk from athens learned full detail of surrender subsequent event a watched debarkation of fugitive then after obtaining promise from mr beveridge that officer must come on shore at sunset to dine with entered boat be rowed back at sunset mr beveridge officer with exception of tarleton who remained in charge of ship went ashore be received at landing place by guard of honour of turkish soldier in charge of one of principal officer of governor be conducted to house through crowd of people cheering shouting governor received at door dinner be served in turkish fashion sitting on cushion round table raised about foot from floor band of music played without great number of dish of most of horace must only guess at ingredient be served after meal be of great length be concluded slave brought round ewer of water in dipped finger wiping on embroidered towel variety of sweetmeat be then handed round followed by coffee three four interpreter have stood behind guest who be placed between turk thus conversation be rendered possible at ten o'clock took leave with many cordial expression on side be again escorted by party of soldier to boat there be gainsaying macfarlane said a rowed off that there seems to be good deal livelier feeling of gratitude among turk than there be among greek have come way out from england to fight for greek have sunk turkish ship beaten off boat with very heavy loss rescued nearly three thousand woman child from hand yet there be greek official who have said a much a thank seem to consider that be quite sufficient reward for to have be of service to so great people a be upon other hand here be turk though have done great deal of damage putting aside enmity treating like gentleman because have saved ship load of people be very fine old heathen governor turk too be deal more grateful than of greek have be except batch from cyprus horace said be in better heart for being thankful horace mr beveridge replied have taken back to native land will soon rejoin friend family whereas chiots be going into exile have lost everything be dear to lot before be a doctor pointed out little if anything better than that have saved from still will do justice to say that turk be really grateful to though be not working for purpose of obtaining gratitude be pleasant to see that people do feel that one have done something for suppose wo get up sail until morning martyn mr beveridge said a went down into cabin yes sir if have objection will get up anchor a soon a be on board see be not many mile from mouth of dardanelles with good glass must make out colour from mainland if word be sent to admiral that greek craft be at anchor here might send two three ship out to capture give turk credit for such enterprise be just a well not to run risk what be to be course next mr beveridge there be likely to be regular battle in short time between greek army turk indeed greek will have to fight if really mean to gain independence dramali pasha have twenty thousand men collected on bank of spercheus of say eight thousand be cavalry drawn from mussulman clan of macedonia thrace may move forward day to reconquer morea relieve nauplia if be suffered to do there be virtually end of war have not shadow of faith in of greek leader in areopagus still do believe in vast bulk of people morea consists almost wholly of hilly broken country just ground where armed peasantry knowing pas place of advantage ought to be able to render passage of regular army with wagon baggage well nigh impossible in such country turkish cavalry must be of little use there be only infantry to cope with artillery must probably have to be left behind altogether if ever effort be to be made by greek must be made now propose therefore martyn to sail down to nauplia to land there turk of course still command harbour with gun greek vessel land supply ammunition for besieger so there can be difficulty about have still good many thousand musket in hold ammunition for will see what spirit prevails among peasantry will issue arm to who need help with money if required peasantry will not want patriotism of primate captain may be good deal strengthened by little judicious expenditure of money morea be key of whole position present will be critical moment of revolution if turk succeed greece be at foot if turkish army be defeated greece may conquer now therefore be time for to do utmost to aid very well sir then will lay course to morrow morning for south eastern point of euboea on voyage down mr beveridge discussed with others course that intended to take have quite determined to leave coast go into interior where if turkish army be to be checked decisive battle must be fought be decided that horace two greek must accompany question most at issue be whether must take with portion of crew of schooner be somewhat averse to need hardly say martyn have intention whatever of mixing up in fighting may take place go simply to rouse enthusiasm a much a possible of peasantry to get small local leader to stir if can hing will simply come back to schooner again if greek dispute passage of turk will if can take up position where can see what take place if greek be beaten retire across hill what good then must be for to take of sailor with may want on board for be possible indeed be probable that turkish fleet will come round to nauplia with supply for turkish army when arrives there well sir must require whole crew to get up sail make off if see coming do think that must be very much better for to have men with in first place having guard of sort must add to importance in eye of greek give more weight to counsel in second place if be going to take arm money on shore will certainly require guard for run risk of getting throat cut lastly if there must be fight greek get beaten if have fifteen twenty men with chance of getting off safely must be very largely increased for must beat off small party of horseman happened to overtake what do think horace certainly think so too after what have seen of greek father do think must be better in way to have party of sailor with if be known that be going about hill with considerable sum of money might be safe enough among peasant must say there be number of miserable primate captain who must think nothing of cutting throat to get beveridge gave way at once be arranged that party of fifteen men under command of miller must land from schooner accompany think mr beveridge macfarlane said that must be a well for to take medical attendant with mr beveridge smiled have scarcely regarded hitherto doctor in light of medical attendant a attendant of ship company think that horace of landing party be likely to take fever among hill of morea hope not sir see there may be preliminary skirmish before regular battle expect will take place suppose greek will have surgeon accustomed to gunshot wound capable of amputation among therefore see might be of service in addition to doctor martyn laughed think must like ramble on shore bit well what do think martyn mr beveridge said be for to decide doctor may be a say useful on shore then again service may be required on board be not likely to do fighting sir if will mix up gallon two of jalap such other medicine a think might be useful for ordinary ailment on board daresay tarleton will see to being administered a required oh yes will see to tarleton said make a nasty a can doctor so that sha' have unnecessary application for so be settled that dr macfarlane must form one of landing party chapter xviii turkish defeat town of nauplia stood on projecting point at head of gulf be in old time known a gulf of argo be now more generally known a gulf of nauplia town being most important port in greece carrying on large trade in sponge silk oil wax wine acorn be seat of government of venetian at time be master of morea have be very strongly fortified by acropolis citadel stood on craggy hill where point on town stood joined mainland venetian have taken greatest pain in fortifying rock be well nigh impregnable be considered strongest position in morea turk have long be besieged here negotiation have at one time be carried on with view to surrender have greek acted in good faith must have gained possession of place before dramali advanced to relief six week before turk having entirely consumed provision signed capitulation turk have little faith in greek observing condition be of opinion that must be better to be massacred at once than to slowly die of hunger by term of capitulation turk be to deliver up arm two third of movable property while greek be to allow to hire neutral vessel to transport to asia minor bound to supply with provision until vessel arrived to take away greek government at once sent of member to nauplia to register property of turk immediately pursued usual course of endeavouring to enrich by secretly purchasing property of turk by selling provision greek minister took step to charter neutral vessel professing that be unable to raise money for purpose really delaying to enable secretary at nauplia to make larger gain by bargaining with wealthy turk there turk having now got provision enough to enable to hold on be in great hurry to conclude surrender a knew that dramali be advancing such be state of thing when schooner arrived in gulf of argo landed party on opposite side of gulf at once proceeded into interior stopping at village at place came to messenger be sent out to summon peasantry of neighbourhood to come in when have assembled mr beveridge harangued pointing out that now never be time to win independence that if turkish invasion be rolled back now might hope that enemy must see that country must not be conquered when inhabitant be determined to be free for if thoroughly established hold of occupied fortress there must be chance of ever again shaking off yoke said that englishman stranger have come to aid a far a possible that unprovided with arm lacking ammunition must receive on going down to ship anchored in bay at place previous to addressing assembly have distributed money among local leader priest seconded harangue number of men went down to coast obtained gun ammunition while mr beveridge be travelling over country army of dramali be advancing unopposed troop central government have placed to defend pass fled without firing shot dramali occupied corinth without resistance acropolis there be impregnable commander priest named achilles theodorides in spite of christian name fact that citadel be amply supplied with provision murdered turkish prisoner in hand fled with garrison a soon a dramali approached place ease with turkish general have marched through eastern greece possessed of corinth raised confidence to highest point have be arranged that turkish fleet must meet at nauplia therefore determined to march with whole army there obtain possession of store brought by fleet relieve town then proceed to conquest of morea two of officer alone disagreed with yussuf pasha ali pasha latter of whom be large land owner of argo of whom knew country well proposed that corinth must be made head quarter of army great magazine be formed there that army must be divided into two division one of under dramali must march to then recover tripolitza while other must march along gulf of corinth to patras recovering possession of fertile province of achaia dramali however confident in power to overcome opposition might be made determined to carry out own plan started with own army for nauplia owing to fact that dramali have met with opposition have advanced with much greater rapidity than be expected preparation for resistance be altogether incomplete at time moved forward from corinth though people be firmly determined to resist advance from nauplia accordingly to great disappointment of mr beveridge moved without opposition through narrow defile of dervenaki where few hundred men must have successfully opposed advance of army arrived without firing shot at argo almost within sight of nauplia sending forward ali pasha with five hundred cavalry to take command at nauplia have turkish fleet now arrived with supply a have be arranged be probable that dramali must have overrun morea that revolution in greece must have be stamped out instead of doing passed round morea to patras in order to take on board mehemet who have just be appointed capitan pasha dramali therefore found at argo without provision a relying upon obtaining supply from fleet have not encumbered with baggage train member of greek government whose head quarter have be at argo have fled precipitately at approach of dramali argo have be crowded with political leader military adventurer who have gathered there in hope of sharing in plunder of nauplia fled in such haste that national archive large quantity of plate have just be collected from church monastery for public service be abandoned wild panic have seized inhabitant whose number have be vastly increased by refugee from smyrna chios other place thousand deserted house property fled in frantic terror a soon a have left town be plundered by band of greek klephts who seized horse mule working ox cart of peasantry round loaded with plunder collected in city turk when entered argo found that have already be sacked while however minister senator general of greece be flying in panic spirit of people be rising body of volunteer took possession of ruined castle where ancient acropolis of argo have stood defended position successfully against first attack of turk of greek leader prince demetrius hypsilantes alone showed courage presence of mind hastening through country addressed energetic harangue to people who responded enthusiastically to impassioned word took up arm without waiting for call of nominal leader work of little english party now bore fruit peasant with arm in hand without leader commanded by captain primate flocked from part of morea towards scene of action having seen work well begun hypsilantes hastened back to argo accompanied by several young chief threw with eight hundred men into ruined castle raising force there to thousand men place be however badly supplied with provision water turk closely invested object with first volunteer have occupied place have be gained advance of turk have be arrested time have be given to people of morea to rise hypsilantes greater portion of garrison accordingly withdrew during night small band held for three day longer cutting way out when last loaf be finished on st of august having occupied on th of july by time greek have five thousand men assembled at lerna port of argo where cowardly leader have embarked held very strong position where ground rendered impossible for turkish cavalry to act other large body of greek occupied mountain surrounding plain of argo have dramali when first found that fleet have gone past with supply returned to corinth must have done so without shot being fired be not until th of august after wasting fortnight that prepared to move have brought with from corinth ten thousand men of whom half be cavalry already much greater number of greek be gathered round kolokotronis be nominally in command villager obeyed local leader there be order system among have there be must have occupied strong position on various road leading up to hill compelled surrender of whole turkish army instead of doing of local chief took up position seemed to to be best advance guard of turkish army consisted of thousand albanian trained seasoned troop be allowed to go through without even skirmish body of cavalry be then sent forward along road by have come ordered to occupy dervenaki defile dramali have left unguarded behind found greek intrenched there first turkish division therefore moved by pas niketos one of bravest of greek commander with two thousand men barred valley fell on left flank while body of greek under hypsilantes dikaios attacked on right turkish cavalry charged forward tried to clear valley picked body of marksman on low hill overlooking ravine shot down blocked ravine with body of horse rider pressure from behind increased body of well mounted horseman managed to dash through reach corinth in safety behind slaughter be terrible turk be shot down in number fled in direction many be killed more succeeded in escaping for greek directed whole attention to plundering great baggage train consisting of mule camel laden with valuable of pasha rich spoil have be gathered in advance news of destruction of first division of army astounded dramali be impossible for to remain at argo following day moved forward by road up steep hill known a kleisura dikaios opposed in front niketos hypsilantes fell on left flank a on previous day baggage train proved salvation of turkish soldier greek directed entire attention to while be occupied in cutting off brilliant charge by chosen band of turkish horseman cleared road in front dramali with main body of cavalry be enabled to escape to corinth military chest whole of turkish baggage fell into hand of greek troop under immediate command of kolokotronis took part whatever in day fighting whole of be done by two thousand men under command of niketos under whom dikaios hypsilantes acted a kolokotronis however be nominal commander credit of defeat of dramali be generally ascribed to moriots returned to native village enriched by spoil have gathered party from schooner have be spectator of fight have scarcely expected so good result for disorder want of plan neglect of attempt to seize occupy road above utter incapacity of kolokotronis seemed to render success almost hopeless indeed out of fourteen thousand greek assembled two thousand fired shot fortunately brunt of turkish attack fell upon one little division be ably commanded have main body aided not soldier of dramali army must have escaped a be loss in men be comparatively small total destruction of baggage train still more disorganization depression followed disaster inflicted upon by enemy despised completely paralyzed forward move be again attempted dramali be utterly broken down by humiliation died at corinth two month later mr beveridge be well contented with success be due partly to effort have expended upwards of five thousand pound eight thousand musket large quantity of ammunition have be distributed from schooner to peasant victory ought felt to have be much more conclusive spirit awakened among moriots confidence must be engendered throughout greece at victory over army have expected to overrun whole country without difficulty immensely improved chance greek independence must be finally established there be however one unfortunate consequence of affair success of armed peasant at argo confirmed greek in idea that discipline be wholly unnecessary that regular troop be mistake that be needed to conquer turk be for people to muster under local leader whenever danger threatened absurd idea be cause of many heavy disaster subsequently occurred when second day fighting be over english party made way back to schooner congratulate heartily sir on success greek have gained martyn said for news of victory have already reached thank martyn might ought to have be great deal better still be very thankful that be a good a be can feel now come what may mission out here have not be altogether failure have done much good work in cause of humanity work during last three week have be exactly what pictured must be before left home by personal effort did good deal to arouse enthusiasm of peasant money increased influence arm brought out contributed largely to success of fight be pleased gratified what sort of time have have miller martyn asked comrade a walked up down quarter deck together a mr beveridge descended to cabin have be good enough for have done lot of tramping up hill down chief bought horse day landed be sure never must have stood be pretty hard work even for must have seen day after day haranguing crowd of villager of course must not understand word said can tell worked up into regular frenzy way shouted waved hand a imagine swore terrible oath that must kill eat turk saw be something tremendous quite electrified fellow who have be accustomed suppose to consider chief a quiet easy going gentleman cheered shouted a loudly a greek zaimes brother went off on expedition on own account to village must not spare time to go to be all right a to quarter grub primate captain whatever leader call naturally made lot of wonder considering how chief scattered money among mule carried money be pretty heavily laden when went up box be emptied before returned food of course be pretty rough though be best have one have be spoiled for roughing by living here found difference can tell miller since went be heartily glad that marco be back again how have doctor got on think have found harder than expected miller laughed confided to to day that will not volunteer for expedition be very glad be with for horace of course be always in thick of with father jawing away with village notable must have have dull time of if have not be for doctor whose remark upon real enthusiasm of peasantry bought enthusiasm of leader be very amusing doctor doe not say much when be together be not at bad companion there be lot of dry humour about now sha' be sorry when supper be ready for have be on leg since daybreak have have nothing to eat bread carried with wine with have filled water bottle after for time misericordia have quiet time of cruising idly about among ionian island then crossing to venice where stayed for three week then crossed adriatic again put in at port of missolonghi mr beveridge be very anxious to hear result of battle be expected between greek army under mavrocordatos turk advancing south have strongly wished to go with greek army have be dissuaded by horace dear father if do fighting at sea assuredly do share without taking part in fighting on shore when have once seen greek make successful stand will surely be time enough for to take share in matter philhellene will fight be quite certain think odds be against greek doing so besides a have often said mavrocordatos be more fit to command army than old woman in street of athens must be know nothing whatever of military matter will take advice from who do think there must be tremendous risk in joining greek army advantage to be gained from of course if wish to go will go with can take of men if like certainly think have better keep away from altogether so instead of joining greek army have sailed to venice a soon a dropped anchor off missolonghi horace be rowed ashore to get news returned in hour be lucky indeed father that went to venice instead of with mavrocordatos have greek be beaten completely smashed up father have be talking to two three of philhellene who be lucky enough to escape mavrocordatos sent army on to petta established twenty mile in rear chief of staff general normann felt position be very bad one must not fall back when turk advanced a have order regular troop be one regular regiment hundred philhellene body of ionian volunteer be stationed in position in front greek irregular two thousand strong be placed distance in rear be to cover regular from attack from direction two leader of irregular be in communication with turk when advanced eight hundred men in front who have two gun with repulsed reshid pasha sent round six hundred albanian who advanced against strong position in rear whole body of greek irregular bolted like rabbit then turk in front albanian from rear attacked front division on side fought gallantly of hundred philhellene seventy five be killed other twenty five broke way through turkish rank greek regiment ionian be cut up by turkish infantry fire followed by charge of cavalry half of be killed others broke way through turk so out of eight hundred men over four hundred be killed say that not one surrendered so think father be very well that did not go up to see fight for must naturally have be somewhere near philhellene be bad news indeed horace be father how greek must suppose that be use getting up regular army consisting of one regiment of six hundred men to fight turk be more than can imagine a to irregular except for fighting among mountain see that be of slightest good be awfully sorry for foreign officer after coming here a did to fight for greece then forming into corp to encourage native to fight to be deserted left to fight whole army be shameful spoke to be terribly cut up at loss of three quarter of comrade turk be advancing against suliots have made term be to be transported to ionian island british consul at prevesa guarantee that term will be honourably kept on side mr beveridge went ashore later returned completely disheartened by conversation with leading inhabitant learned that so far from defeat at petta convincing greek that be only by submitting to discipline forming regular regiment that must hope to oppose turk have determined on contrary that there be hope of fighting in way henceforward must depend entirely upon irregular blindness be extraordinary said saw few a disciplined men be repulsed attack of turkish troop in front be only crushed when totally surrounded while on other hand two thousand five hundred irregular be unable even to attempt to make stand against six hundred albanian deserted comrade fled after scarcely firing shot yet in future intend to trust solely to useless band at present everyone be quarrelling with everyone else while reshid pasha be preparing to invade captain primate instead of uniting to oppose be quarrelling fighting among for share of national revenue district of agrapha be being laid waste by civil broil province of vlochos be being devastated by band of two rival leader kravari be pillaged alternately by band of two other scoundrel gogos dozen other captain have openly gone over to turk there be only one hope can see added bitterly what be mr beveridge martyn asked be that greek will continue civil broil until make country complete desert that turk finding that can obtain food will be obliged by starvation to quit country one thing be resolved upon be that until greek fight for will hing further in matter will still try to save woman child will hing else will interfere with turkish commerce fire gun at turkish ship of war will lower long gun four of others down into hold captain martyn will cruise about enjoy for bit very well sir be just year since arrived out here little peace quiet amusement will do harm know how must be with flag whether can sail into malta into italian port with whether can hoist own again paper be right believe mr beveridge said see be nominally sold to agent here of greek firm in london be therefore registered a property of greek subject have paper signed by selling vessel again to with blank for date can be filled in at time of course must only fill in use in event of deciding to leave greece altogether return to england so that at present be simply greek ship owned by native of country holding letter of marque from greek government to act a privateer think that transaction must be recognized by european power in case of two european belligerent be exceptional case a sympathy of christian power be with greek a far a turk be concerned make difference whether greek english must hang if caught think very close inquiry be likely to be made in european port greek paper be correct a know that account of having saved large number of fugitive from chios have be in english paper doubtless interference to save turk at athens have also be published think that must be received well by sympathizer of party next morning sailed to corinth where remained few day john iskos mr beveridge agent at athens came across to see informed that have sold very small portion of good consigned to in prize have shipped great bulk in neutral vessel consigned to firm in vessel have disposed of to hydriot merchant recommended mr beveridge to hand over to store of silk other valuable have be retained on board schooner must put at once on board italian ship at present in port consign to greek house in genoa a certainly must not obtain anything like fair price for in greece operation occupied two day most valuable good be retained a prize might have be recaptured by turk on way to athens prize have be brought in by miller tarleton alternately marco zaimes accompanying to interpret crew being taken back in native boat to naxos to island schooner have made several trip to pick up for next two month schooner cruised in italian water from venice round to genoa putting in to many port making circuit of sicily paying short visit to malta then learning that turk be about to besiege missolonghi that town be going to resist until last crossed over there in second week in november found that port be blockaded by turkish ship from patras that hydriot vessel be expected to arrive shortly mavrocordatos be in town organizing defence taking really vigorous measure for holding out to last week later seven hydriot brig arrived misericordia have again mounted gun joined a approached port turkish vessel got up sail made for patras greek entered port missolonghi be protected by low mud wall with ditch six foot deep by sixteen foot wide contained foot of water at bottom be deep clay rendering quite impassable there be eight gun mounted on rampart mr beveridge landed at once six more of still lying in hold with supply of ammunition for whole a soon a port be open thousand men crossed over from morea under command of partisan chief from time to time others came in until garrison originally six hundred strong be increased to two thousand five hundred for week nothing be done on eve of th of january be greek christmas day greek fisherman brought in news that turk be preparing to assault next morning at daylight when believed christian must generally be in church forty men be landed from schooner to take part in defence at daybreak defender be in place hidden behind rampart concealed in house near storming party be led by eight hundred albanian volunteer one division be intended to scale wall on eastern flank while be to endeavour to penetrate town by wading through willow lagoon at eastern extremity whole turkish army turned out suddenly opened tremendous fire of musketry against rampart while storming party moved forward defender remained in concealment until albanian be close at hand then leaping up poured fire into expecting to take defender by surprise albanian be astounded at sudden heavy fire poured into at once broke fled in confusion for hour turk kept up heavy fire did not renew attack in earnest ton of ammunition be fired away on side then turk fell back to camp on following day raised siege wildness of fire be evidenced by fact that only four greek be killed blue jacket from schooner joined in fire upon storming party when be evident that turk have idea of renewing attack returned on board ship remark upon combatant be reverse of complimentary be well nigh enough to make man sick tom one man said to in horace hearing to see blazing away good powder lead like reckon to be downright sinful be right there mate be downright waste of gift of providence why there be powder ball enough to have killed good five thousand englishman frenchman thrown away in accounting for four five of yelling fellow be more like play acting than fighting why if be to arm couple of gal school put to fire at other must do ever so much better than to think greek call christian know how to aim musket no better than might just a well be heathen while missolonghi have be resisting successfully turkish garrison of nauplia have at last surrendered after dramali army have abandoned only hope remained to be that fleet might return greek retained possession of small fort have be given up to at time that first negotiation for surrender be going on from fort combustible missile be fired into town brisk cannonade kept up with defence without much damage being done on side on th of september turkish fleet appeared off entrance to gulf greek fleet from island of hydra spetzas stood out to meet unfortunately admiral kanaris be not present for four day two fleet remained in sight of other firing at such distance that harm be done on side there be nothing to have prevented turkish admiral relieving nauplia landing troop provision in transport feared to enter gulf while greek shrank equally from attack upon after thus exhibiting for four day cowardice incapacity turkish capitan pasha abandoned nauplia to fate resistance only continued because turk must put reliance upon oath of greek woman child dropped dead from hunger in street soldier be so weak from starvation that few be able to carry arm citadel be

greek have common language show be one people family fall out more than stranger man replied with laugh english american have common language yet have be fighting against other refuse to remain one nation with thing signify more than smoke of pipe christian money christian good cattle be worth just a much to a turk captain who pay be more to than mavrocordatos sultan daresay that english milord be worthy man though must be fool yet wine will buy out of share of money will be just a good a if have grown in father vineyard horace laughed be not skilled in argument even have inclination to indulge in at present time sauntered off sat down by doctor who not being able to talk with greek found time hang heavy on hand horace repeated to conversation with two brigand own did not know how to answer last fellow doctor there be answer to be made horace to argue men must have common ground to start from there be common ground between argument be argument of materialist everywhere whether be briton frenchman greek to man who have religion principle there remains only self interest from point of view there be gainsaying argument of albanian scamp more than must have be of use for lowland merchant carried off by highland caterans to urge upon that conduct be contrary to law of morality political economy must have said that knew nothing about cared le that unless goodwife fellow citizen put hand in pocket sent ransom demanded head must be despatched to in hamper with small delay certainly have on hip with what said about ancient greece for more quarrelsome cantankerous waspish set of little community world never saw unless be city of italy in middle age at rate be of respectable size be by way only respectable thing about religion principle patriotism be three thing keep men nation straight greek italian community have least glimmering of idea of of except love for own petty state may be called patriotism good deal like highland clansman must say doctor horace laughed head of clan be much greater man in eye of follower than king of scotland be so horace consequence be that while there be peace order prosperity in lowland highland scarcely made step forward until clan be pretty well broken up after culloden be sore business at time one can doubt that did good in long run now lad think will just take sleep be not many hour got of last night see most of fellow have set example next morning started at daybreak main body of band have moved off hour before leaving lieutenant kornalis demetri four of men three hour walking took out of mountain there be little talking greek must have preferred going with leader to plunder village for although booty taken be supposed to be handed over to chief for fair distribution there be few who did not conceal trinket money a own special share of plunder be mile two beyond hill when from wood skirting road four five shot rang out two of greek fell rest throwing away gun fled at top of speed before prisoner have time to recover from surprise number of men rushed out with butt of musket pistol struck to ground when recovered sens group of men be standing round while at little distance must hear sound of firing showing that pursuit of late captor be being closely maintained by time have become sufficiently accustomed to various costume to know that have now fallen into hand of men of one of albanian tribe probably mussulmans acting a irregular with turkish army engaged upon raiding expedition one of asked horace question dialect be so different to of greek of athens morea that be unable to understand presently men who have gone in pursuit returned whole party set off to north placing prisoner in midst warning by pointing significantly to knife pistol that have better keep up with eh man doctor said be dreadful just a thought that everything be settled that in couple of hour must be with own people here be in hand of pack of villain even worse than others said that must not shout until be out of wood doctor have turned out true prophet at present be thinking more of head than of anything else be sure have got couple of lump on a big a egg show folly of man doctor said philosophically what good must expect to get from knocking down be neither fighting running away have not wit about lad must have just taken to heel expect must have caught if have have of have much walking lately fellow be always climbing among mountain do think be of use trying to make understand that if will take few mile farther will find three hundred pound waiting for might try horace think that will be of use expect be just skirting along at foot of hill to see what can pick up there be not above thirty of must not like to go far out upon plain besides know that must turn out well if be to go on in body martyn must a likely a not fire at then must think that have led into ambush shoot without waiting to ask question still can try if like might be sorry afterwards if did when horace tried to speak to men be threatened roughly lapsed into silence for three hour ascended great range of hill running east west when gained crest must see stretched away far in front of flat fertile country plain of thessaly doctor said fairest richest portion of greece of old there be little chance of forming part of greece of future at least not until complete overthrow of turkish empire if greece attains independence frontier line will be somewhere along crest of hill for thessaly although there be slight trouble there at first have not joined movement there be mountain fortress where can take refuge troop of turkish cavalry must scour whole country there be where be bound for expect pointed to large clump of white tent far out on plain expect be camp of pasha of province suppose be going to operate on side when main force advance to west took four hour walking before approached camp when within short distance of captor turned off entered village where number of countryman be sitting in shade smoking dozing band went on until reached principal house in village four of entering took prisoner into room where tall old chief be sitting on divan talked for minute evidently explaining circumstance of capture when have done chief asked prisoner in greek who be be englishman horace replied belong to ship lying off village whose name know have landed to buy fruit vegetable then be suddenly seized carried away to mountain by greek brigand led by fellow named rhangos have arranged for ransom be on way under guard to village where money be to be paid when band put greek to flight made prisoner how much ransom be to be paid albanian asked three hundred pound if will send there now friend will be glad to pay to people tried to explain to on way must not listen to be fool chief said decidedly besides speak greek be too late now must take to pasha who will deal with a chooses then rising followed by group of officer prisoner in charge of four men walked across to turkish camp be picturesque looking set of cut throat macfarlane said that be people at home must stare to see with white kilted petticoat gaudy sash with pistol inlaid with silver embroidered jacket white shirt sleeve well what be to say if be asked about ship must tell truth lad doubt not have have news before now that schooner be cruising about on coast even if be disposed to tell lie be not must guess where have come from english merchantman must be likely to be anchored off coast here to buy vegetable indeed there be very few british vessel of sort in water now need not just tell that schooner be craft have be playing mischief over on other coast robbed of chiot slave be precisely necessary to enter into affair near cyprus need simply say if be asked that be englishman in naval service of greece expect will ask many question after that will have occasion to do much more talking think will hang doctor may be hanging horace may be shooting for part be not very particular be shooting be quickest then hanging be more what may call family way of dying must say that a many a score of ancestor be one way strung up by stuart on one miserable pretence other such a cattle lifting settling grudge without bothering law court trifle of sort horace burst into fit of laughter caused albanian chief to look round sharply inquiringly be all right old chap macfarlane muttered in english be just laughing while can there be contempt of court intended pasha be in tent considerably larger than surrounded albanian went in leaving prisoner in charge of guard in five minute came out signed to to follow in pasha be elderly man with snow white beard looked at prisoner with interest hear that be englishman said in greek be so sir that be in greek service be in greek service after being carried off by greek brigand know that will have inclination to remain in if have be taken fighting against must have ordered to be shot pasha said a be know do belong to schooner with white sail have be cruising off coast day do horace admitted be told pasha went on that be ship did much harm at chios be attacked beat off boat horace said be fair warfare principal object have be to rescue people in danger distress whether christian turk rescued number of chiot slave on other hand saved number of turk at surrender of acropolis at athens conveyed safely to tenedos where landed governor there recognized service to countryman came off to ship invited on shore to dine with yes have heard about that pasha said have heard of white schooner have be dangerous enemy to have done more harm than whole of greek together after humanity at athens can not feel animosity against be noble deed worthy of brave men thus be that nation must fight greek began by massacre have be false to oath swore twenty time how can fight for men who have courage faith who be a cruel a be cowardly there have be cruelty on side horace said though own that greek began in england love freedom be not long since drove french out of egypt preserved for sympathy be with greek because be oppressed have never killed turk save in fair fight crew of ship have taken have permitted to return to shore in boat without injuring one of also have heard pasha said therefore will do harm will send to constantinople where sultan will decide upon fate have given order that foreigner taken in arm against will at once be put to death for interfering in matter in have concern a be not taken in arm feel that order applies to will therefore take upon to send to thank sir horace said though fear will only be reprieve can not say pasha replied gravely sultan strike hard when wish to give lesson see people be massacred wholesale by greek at chios taught that must retaliate be not cruel by choice be unswerving when mind be made up whether will make exception in case not be more than can say can only send to hope that will be a merciful in case a must be have power then ordered one of officer to take charge of prisoner to see that have comfortable tent be well cared for that none molested four soldier be to be always on guard at tent to answer for safety of prisoner with life in short time be placed in tent among allotted to officer four sentry be placed round after sunset two soldier brought large tray with meat vegetable sweet from pasha own table also bottle of raki turk be gentleman horace doctor said a after having finished dinner mixed spirit water be not saying mind must not have mightily preferred bottle of good whisky be bound to say that when one have once got accustomed to raki have virtue be insinuating spirit cool mild to taste dangerous to one who be not accustomed to what do think of horace care for then care for spirit horace said thoroughly agree with that pasha be good fellow only wish must have seen way to have let go sultan be terrible personage way have hung up hostage at constantinople have be awful if have made up mind that will deter foreigner from entering greek service by showing mercy to who fall into hand have very great hope that will make exception in case chapter xx at constantinople upon following morning horse be brought round be ordered to mount officer with twelve turkish trooper took charge of pasha came out from tent be sending letter to porte saying what know of doings of ship of service rendered by saving countryman at athens have also given direction that vessel conveying will touch at tenedos have written to governor there asking also to send on letter in favour after hour riding reached town of larissa then followed river on stand down to sea what lovely country horace exclaimed a looked at mountain to right left be travelling on classical ground doctor replied be vale of tempe hill to right be mount os to left be mount olympus be grand horace said though must certainly enjoy more under other circumstance fancy that being hill jove used to sit on must be grand place to climb must must be quite content to look at comfortably from deck of schooner horace must have desire to scale where be schooner now do think doctor where left must wait at village where expected to be handed over to till late in afternoon then most likely march back to shore morning will be trying to get news of be possible that one of greek have taken down news of capture by turk in hope of getting reward must not know whether be killed captured bolted too fast for if fellow doe take news of fight will probably offer to show spot martyn will take out strong party when find body of two greek sign of will arrive at conclusion that have be carried off greek probably recognized men who attacked a being band of albanian white petticoat alone must tell a christian albanian must certainly not be likely to be plundering on side at present time will be sure be mohammedan raiding on own account acting with turkish force in thessaly doubt will offer reward for news of will probably learn from peasant other that party of albanian crossed range into thessaly about mid day then when hear that pasha force be lying in plain not far from foot of hill will arrive at truth that be taken there what next step will be can not say must fancy will sail round promontory try open communication with small village get someone to visit camp try pick up news of what have become of must be day before can do by time find have be put on board ship will be at constantinople at rate horace regard idea of there being chance of rescuing a out of question what will do be of course beyond guessing be vexing to think that if did know at present moment be being put on board ship might cut off at mouth of dardanelles be little farther from gulf of zeitouni than be from mouth of river schooner must probably sail twice a fast a craft be likely to be put on board be annoying be of use being annoyed know be going to be embarked ca learn for four five day at very earliest so let worry about have reasonable cause for worry in knowing that be going to be taken to constantinople for not improbably will be executed when get there think that be probable doctor do indeed sultan be not man to stand on nicety have decided not to give quarter to foreigner who fight against a matter of policy be perfectly right knew along what fate must be if fell into hand of turk have done immense amount of mischief have destroyed frigate beaten off boat have taken lot of prize delivered two three thousand valuable slave from hand only set off to be that assisted to save three hundred turkish woman child a to whose fate sultan be probably perfectly indifferent balance be very heavy against horace must not admit that be so in beautiful valley with constantinople still in distance idea ere long violent death might befall there be not sufficiently vivid to depress spirit greatly after four hour riding came down upon little port at mouth of river two three craft be lying there under gun of battery be vessel will see horace be man of war brig expect be placed here on purpose to enable pasha to communicate direct with constantinople instead of having to send up through pass to salonika leaving prisoner under charge of guard officer took boat rowed off to brig in few minute large boat lying beside be manned by dozen sailor rowed ashore officer be on board of two of men who have brought valise strapped behind saddle have already removed stepped into boat forward while comrade took charge of horse officer then signed to horace doctor to step on board be rowed out to brig hour later anchor be got up sail set vessel left port there be attempt at restraint of prisoner young lieutenant who spoke greek informed in name of captain that order of pasha be that be to be treated a ordinary passenger requested to take meal with in cabin must be entirely at liberty except that must not be allowed to land at tenedos at other port at vessel might touch brig proved fairly fast sailer wind be favourable late on afternoon of day after have sailed dropped anchor off tenedos officer in charge of captive at once went ashore with pasha letter to governor returned late at night after prisoner have turned in in one of officer cabin have be vacated for use there be not breath of wind in morning captain accordingly did not attempt to weigh anchor must be fine thing if calm must last for fortnight doctor said a came on deck in morning yes there be chance of doctor have never have dead calm for more than three day since came out well might do equally well with light breeze from north must help schooner across gulf at same time must not enable brig to work up dardanelles there be strongish current there still be not at saying be likely only say that wish must be so when officer came on deck informed through lieutenant that governor have given strong letter to porte speaking in highest term of humanity have shown towards turk have rescued from athens hour later two three boat came off among on board be several woman when saw doctor horace leaning over bulwark broke into loud cry of greeting expect be of poor creature brought over horace said remember face have have too many on board for understand what be saying be evidently that of boatman understood greek turkish translated expression of woman gratitude regret at seeing prisoner be not allowed to set foot on brig handed up basket of fruit sweetmeat one of woman stood up in boat in greek said in low tone to horace a leant over rail there be few of here be poor heart melted morning when news spread that be prisoner on board ship on way to constantinople can hing pray to allah for safety husband be one of soldier brought over one who have lost arm who be tended by hakim a be of more use have discharged have remained here a be native of island have many friend will start in hour with fisherman relation of mine will land above gallipoli will walk to constantinople then will see bimbashi former comrade find out osman fazli bey who be with tell of being prisoner so that may use influence at porte tell how risked life for may allah protect effendi story terminated abruptly for captain at moment came up ordered boat away from side what be that about horace macfarlane asked a horace returned woman last salutation with two three word of earnest thanks why what be matter lad there be tear in eye be touched at poor woman gratitude doctor a can see by dress be poor be wife of discharged soldier man who lost arm dressed stump may remember know said that have be horribly neglected remarked what splendid constitution turk have thought that have be englishman wound must probably have mortified long before of course remember horace have got over have horace then told what woman have said doe one good to hear that macfarlane said when have finished human nature be much same whether be in wife of turkish soldier of scottish fisherman poor creature husband be doing can bimbashi bey be great men in eye doubtless think that be quite important person at constantinople still be pleasant to think that poor fellow whose arm must still be very far from healed be undertaking journey to do what can for mind of grand story of effie dean tramping way from scotland to london to ask for sister pardon say that anything be like to come of there be saying if turk be a grateful a soldier wife might possibly do something for if be not that sultan will settle matter ordinary turkish official will do almost anything for money favour sultan be not to be got round say be strong man go own way without asking advice of anyone still be a said pleasant to know that there be people who have interest in who be doing in power to help hour later small boat be seen to put out from port to row away in direction of mainland for three day brig lay at anchorage then gentle breeze sprang up from south making sail brig be headed to entrance of dardanelles unless there be more wind than horace said must hardly think will be able to make way up doctor be not going through water more than two knot hour will have to anchor again a soon a be inside strait unless wind freshens think be likely to do to mind look a if must die out again at sunset proved to be case before became dark brig be anchored in bay on asiatic side short distance from entrance next morning breeze again blew somewhat fresher than before day captain strove to pas up strait sometimes by keeping over out of force of current made two three mile then when came to projecting point current must catch vessel drift rapidly down so that when breeze again sank at sunset have gained only four mile next day be more fortunate passed castle of abydos third evening came to anchor off gallipoli on following morning wind blew briskly from east in afternoon dropped anchor off constantinople eh man be wonderful sight macfarlane said a looked at city with crenellated wall running along by water edge dark grove of tree rising behind mosque with graceful minaret on sky line ahead of be pera with house clustering thickly one above other background of tall cypress across water lay scutari with great barrack mosque kiosk scattered along shore caiques be passing backwards forward across water heavy boat with sailor troop rowing between ship of war shore native craft with broad sail coming up astern from broussa other place on sea of marmora pleasure boat with party of veiled woman rowing idly here there occasionally long caique impelled by six sturdy rower must flash past with official of rank have seen many place doctor went on none like nature have done more for rio a much perhaps for bombay man have done little for may boast of western civilization doubt can rear stately building in point of beauty oriental be a far ahead of a be ahead of south sea islander who must think that turk with sober way must ever have even dreamed of designing thing so beautiful a mosque with graceful outline see how well dark cypress grow with must lose half beauty be

of course a anxious to aid men who have saved parent sister from massacre a be naturally at first thought of getting out of prison by bribing guard though must have be comparatively easy be doubtful whether there must be time to carry out there be several prison here there be saying might be sent to who must be men in charge of therefore time must be needed after arrived here saw that be probable that time must be given sultan might of course view case favourably on other hand if ordered to execution there must be delay when thing have to be done especially when foreigner be in case be better to do at once otherwise porte must be pestered by foreign representative be agreed therefore that if be to be rescued must be done between time of arrival being put in prison divided work into four

three of have commanded at athens who have wife child who have be rescued by be much loved by soldier for lived starved a did did in power for comfort be always dangerous to trust anyone in case there be men loyalty to gratitude to to bind must learn from fazli hour when sultan decision must be given three soldier be to be upon spot to watch for coming out of officer followed by man fazli be to appoint officer be sure to go to one other of barrack for soldier to accompany to vessel must depend upon hour order received whether to go direct on board to do in morning be certain hour must be

influence to bear to aid representation made by by officer who brought down minister grand vizier be agreed that kindness shown by on board english ship must suffice to save life sultan decides for be

lighter than scull of english boat be round with long broad blade be not in rollocks in strap of leather fastened to single thole pin inside thickened to bulk of three four inch in diameter narrowing at extremity for grip of hand thick bulge gave excellent balance to scull be rendered necessary by fact that boat be high out of water length of scull outboard disproportionately large to inboard few

gone to constantinople to tell of people whom brought from athens that two of officer have be captured to ask to do what must to save life did not think anything of though of course be pleasant to see that of people be grateful mr beveridge made handsome present will do justice to say refused until almost have to force upon knowing how bitter sultan be against foreigner in greek service that after harm have done be not likely to be specially well disposed towards thing seemed almost hopeless two greek volunteered if must put ashore to west of strait to make way to constantinople a did not seem to that must do good that idea be given up at last tarleton proposed that must disguise schooner go up ourselves admitted that betting be hundred to one against being able to help in way especially a be almost certain must have be few hour after got there still if have be put off must be in prison there be just possibility might land at night make way to prison blow in gate get out make way across country to place where boat must be waiting for be on board before daylight be certainly desperate undertaking a none of must think of other plan agreed must be well to try so sailed at once to athens have great debate whether must not be better to buy turkish brig have be brought in a prize finally agreed to stick to schooner for if be discovered on way if did get on board must have to sail knew that nothing turk have got must outsail schooner worked hard at athens sent down tall spar got clumsy pole up in place got up yard turned into brig then bought lot of old sail a see turned into a lubberly looking craft a will meet even in sea then filled up between deck with good bought out of prize brought in by hydriots dirtied deck threw acid down side to take off paint took down cabin fitting a see daubed over woodwork with dirty paint be enough to make one cry to see misericordia spoilt be like disguising girl of fashion a dirty gipsy while have be at work two greek have be on shore have gathered up eight men who spoke turkish a well a greek most intelligent made captain with two officer under got paper from turkish prize brig about same size have be captured by hydriots on way from rhodes to constantinople then be agreed that father must disguise a turk respectable land owner of rhodes going a passenger to constantinople with a nubian servant way must stay on deck when be ready started crew kept on deck till got near dardanelles then stowed away in hold a saw be stopped at castle a paper be all right there be suspicion excited nothing happened till iskos came down told caique be coming alongside then minute two later heard voice chapter xxii end well hour passed on be still dead calm a martyn have thought likely visit be paid by turkish port official a brig be lying good mile below usual anchorage must doubt move up to wharf a soon a got wind horace went to main deck gave sketch of adventure to tom burdett who knew must retail to crew well mr horace boatswain said be certainly good one at getting out of scrape have nothing to do with getting out of tom be done without effort on part be mighty well done sir must not have given turk credit for putting plan together always liked chap when served with a young fellow in egyptian business under abercrombie good natured sort of cove be wonderful good tempered considering what shocking bad grub have never looked upon a sharp still there be see one never know what chap can do till be pushed well there be one thing mr horace care how many turkish fugitive may take on board ship in future will be heartily welcome by man jack on board for sake of what fellow did for wish have known when first came on board must have liked to have given that young turk hearty shake of hand men must have given a good cheer a ever heard come from fifty british sailor be just a well did know tom for if have given cheer together on deck must have be heard from shore to shore everyone who heard must have known that never came from turkish throat a soon a be dark anchor be weighed vessel drifted down with current boat towing ahead so a to give steerage way while rest of crew set to work to unbend sail be not going to put up own sail be captain martyn horace asked for a soon a got dusk martyn have removed stain from skin exchanged nubian attire for uniform horace white sail must tell tale at once got two suit at athens one miserable lot saw on to day other have cut up to fit a be sparred now be not very clean wo affect sailing though mean to say will walk along a must under proper canvas fancy be likely to sail a fast a anything will meet will only get foresail jib that square top sail on a want to go along a slowly a possible want to manage to anchor below gallipoli after sunset if ca manage that will anchor mile two side of town so a not to be visited by of port officer then when get quite dark will get up sail run down strait be against rule to pas through at night if fort catch sight of doubt will send few shot after must risk that be not easy to hit moving mark when be so dark that can scarcely see outline there be dozen of ship of war lying abreast of fort must keep a far a dare over on other shore be not afraid of ship will be mile away before crew wake up load expect keep pretty sharp look out in fort though most likely attention be chiefly directed below took couple of hour work to unbend sail bend on fresh one horace spent evening in cabin chatting with father when others came down at ten o'clock for glass of grog heard that boat have be run up housed that brig be now under easy sail there be very little wind martyn said there be enough to give steerage way will not count in for duty until to morrow oh be ready to take watch a usual have be living very lazy life for last three week will be very glad to be on duty again will get gun up first thing in morning miller will throw tarpaulin over when get into narrow part of strait will have pivot gun up too yes think so if have to fight may a well fight a hard a can when get mounted can put few barrel along side of cover whole over with sailcloth stow one of gig at top of one must have suspicion that there be gun there then if wanted to use must clear in minute turkish custom house officer will stare in morning when see brig gone miller said will wonder what have become of if think of at miller will think have got up sail at daylight gone up bosphorus on way to varna one of black sea port must require good deal more breeze than there be now yes did not think of well then perhaps will suppose that made try to go up to anchorage a soon a day began to break simply drifted back see mile astern must take round point there out of sight of however care much what think be not likely to be interested enough in matter to bother about one way other certainly not likely to do only thing must be of consequence to mean send down messenger to gallipoli telling to overhaul if came down strait now then watch on deck others turn in be sure mr beveridge will be better for quiet night rest have certainly not slept much for last month have be getting thinner thinner daily while have also long arrears in way of food to make up have be quite pitiful to see face of greek a sent away plate after plate untouched will soon be again martyn even one good night rest will be sure do wonder for have be getting quite uneasy about father miller said a horace went up on deck for middle watch yes look sadly broken down miller directly have taken off beard be quite shocked look year older have be really anxious about must turn up three four time during night watch walk deck for hour two talking to one other of a if must not stop alone in cabin martyn ever have slightest idea of finding be alive when got here still le of getting out when tarleton proposed disguising schooner coming up caught at idea so eagerly that fell in with at once seemed to rather mad sort of business must not have cared what be so that must rouse up for from time when first got word that have be taken to turk till tarleton made that proposal at tenedos have scarcely spoken word cheered up for hour two when marco brought news that at rate have not be killed at ali pasha camp have be sent on to constantinople that lasted for very short time for soon saw that so far from improving chance have lessened ali might have taken handsome sum for ransom guard might have be bribed anyhow there must have be much better chance of getting away from camp than from prison in constantinople of course did must to cheer be afraid told awful crammer a to easy job must be to get out still plan did do good gave something to think about a at athens be constantly thinking of something other that must go ashore see about since sailed from there have be in sort of fever walking restlessly about deck going down to cabin coming up again twenty time hour worrying about wind complaining at boat loss of speed took to tarleton most because be nearest age think talked to several time about a child seemed specially unhappy because have seen so little of up to time when bought that first craft have two greek be terribly concerned about be two fine fellow be a gentle a woman well have be anxious time for even men have felt for be quite curious to see how silent ship became when be on deck seemed to speak almost in whisper have not heard laugh forward from hour that doctor be missed be glad be taken with for be good fellow be comfort to know that be together be great pull horace agreed be just same time a be on board quiet slow in talk with occasional gleam of humour have be rather hard on too because from day first landed there have always be someone with who must speak greek be very slow for man sitting listening to talk that ca understand waiting for bit to be translated to still never showed that minded yes that must have be very annoying miller agreed especially when talk be about matter concerned life make feel so helpless baby like to have everything managed for to be able to hing think took kindly to turkish dress slipped away changed before have be on board five minute while kept yours on till turned in for nap two hour ago be comfortable enough never gave clothes thought after have worn hour two horace laughed of course one felt very baggy about leg certainly must not like to go aloft in thing wonder turk be such clumsy sailor with leg in bag like did notice that doctor never seemed to move about naturally expect if must have talked away a did must not have thought of so much wind be heading bit yes be miller gave order for sheet brace to be hauled aft must not be surprised if be in south by morning must be better for then must choose own time for getting off gallipoli must get up sail when be daylight make show of doing best when one be tacking backwards forward one can always manage to keep little off wind so close into a pretty well to deaden one way through water horace turned in at four o'clock hour half later heard trampling of foot on deck knew that watch be making sail when went up at eight o'clock wind be blowing briskly from south east schooner be making long leg out from land be now able to see set of sail have be bent on evening before lower sail be of same size a schooner original suit fitted well upper sail contained le than canvas of old one spread be sufficient to lay over well to send through water at encouraging rate of speed be not going along so badly be horace martyn asked indeed of course in light wind loss of upper canvas will tell at present be doing well enough for anything quite well enough for anything be likely to meet have be holding own for last two hour with felucca on other tack have be purposely sailing good bit off wind must overhaul soon enough if liked most of boat be fast want to get along too quickly if wind freshens more will tow sail alongside to deaden way bit want to arrive off gallipoli about hour after sunset two of broadside gun have just be brought up put in position by midday other six pivot gun be in place latter hidden by screen of barrel one of gig bottom upwards laid over deck have be scrubbed a martyn said mournfully must take week to get back to former colour rope still hung slackly although schooner looked good deal more ship shape than when horace have first seen on previous day be still a untidy a average of vessel in eastern water course be timed well sun have already sunk time when dropped anchor short distance outside craft lying off gallipoli see of ship of war have come up from below since passed three day ago however there be fear of sending boat off to night martyn said a gathered in cabin for dinner will naturally suppose that anchored so far out because be going on down strait first thing in morning mr beveridge have remained in berth day reaction after long excitement anxiety told severely upon although have got up first thing have be obliged to lie down again being too weak to stand doctor however told horace that be only to be expected will want week quiet plenty of nourishment to set on leg again have be fairly worn out there be fever about can trust greek to feed up be just a well that must keep perfectly quiet to day sleep a much a can to morrow hope will be able to get up on deck then chatting with taking interest in thing will rouse at nine o'clock sail be again made anchor weighed wind have gone down very much have veered round to south enabled to lay course through greater part of strait two men be placed in chain with lead line light be extinguished with exception of binnacle tarpaulin be removed from gun barrel gig from around pivot gun watch off duty be sent below two of keenest eyed men on board placed a look out at bow european shore be comparatively high must be made out a dark bank asiatic shore be low must scarcely be seen chart be laid on cabin table port hole having be carefully covered with curtain tarpaulin laid over skylight men in chain kept on taking sounding horace going backwards forward between quarterdeck with news a to depth of water miller be in charge of deck while martyn paid frequent visit to cabin to determine position on chart according to depth of sounding there be fear of meeting with craft until approached fort in darkness be necessary to be very careful a water be willow on eastern side be to run on to shoal going a be with force of current there must be little chance of getting off again unless by lightening ship there be just wind enough to give steerage way men be stationed in readiness to let go anchor instantly must be necessary while ten men in longboat paddled gently ahead of just keeping tow rope taut in readiness to tow instantly in direction might be required none of be acquainted with set of current martyn have only depth of water dim outline of bank to direct course by several time when water shoaled crew of boat be directed to row vigorously in direction of right bank once twice there be few foot under keel keen feeling of anxiety be experienced on board until lead man announced that water be deepening at last according to martyn calculation must not be far away from formidable fort boat be directed to fall astern hang on to rope in readiness to come on board to carry out order might be given crew on deck be told to take ax capstan bar so must drive down against one of turkish ship must fend schooner off a much a possible cut away rope might catch be directed to stand perfectly still not word be to be spoken happened greatest danger lay in fact that most of ship of war be lying above fort consequently must alarm be given by gunner at battery must be in readiness to pour in fire upon a passed ground to right look much higher than did miller think must have be drifting good deal over towards side think so too miller agreed have be fancying that be getting over way ever since stopped sounding at rate must take chance martyn said dare sound again splash must attract attention mile away on quiet night like besides must not tow other way now must take chance be not likely be keeping much of look out on board might pas within twenty yard of vessel without being noticed on night a will stay at helm miller sail be still full have got steerage way do go up into bow let two of men take boot off if make out anything ahead let one of run to like lightning with order whether to port starboard helm conversation be carried on in lowest tone miller stole lightly forward tarleton horace be already there one on bow straining eye into darkness be long way over on side miller believe that high ground over there be more than two three hundred yard away be just what have be saying tarleton current must have set across tremendously martyn be at helm see be heading off shore think be going more than couple of knot through water in five minute tarleton whispered think there be something dark just over cathead at same moment horace stepped from other side there be ship short way ahead miller unless be mistaken by jove so there be miller said looking out will never be able to clear with current taking down have kicked off own shoe when reached bow thinking better to carry message port helm martyn said a ran up there be two craft ahead can never clear outside one in current only chance be to run between martyn have jammed helm down a miller spoke keep there martyn said to helmsman sprang to bulwark to look out be enough said straighten now just a be con from other side miller on board saw two vessel now by height bulk be evidently large frigate men of war be not fifty yard away be about same distance apart martyn pulled off jacket threw over binnacle a light must have be at once noticed by anyone looking down from lofty hull noiselessly schooner passed into gap between ship not slightest sound be heard from deck two officer looked anxiously up at sail for have one of flapped block rattled sleepiest look out must have noticed silence on deck of turkish ship be a profound a on schooner rapidly latter slid between current taking along faster than wind minute more be beyond still hail be heard minute loomed dark indistinct behind thank god for miller said in whisper a crossed deck to martyn yes indeed be touch go expect have only anchor watch most likely be asleep must know that nothing must come up strait with light breeze think miller be two eighty gun ship noticed a came up be moored good bit outside others in case have clear course before yes have doubt be two miller agreed now have only fort be about quarter of mile further down go forward please tell men not to move till get order quarter of hour passed martyn felt sure that be now well beyond fort for few minute longer held on then passed word along deck that danger be over now that knew exact position there be longer occasion for sounding men in boat be called up watch off duty ordered below when morning broke land be far behind brisk wind have sprung up from south east vessel be just able to lay course for athens doctor have remained below during passage through strait must only have be in way if have be on deck said when horace chaffed for taking matter so easily when man can do good be always better for to get out of way after there be great pleasure in standing for hour afraid to move without duty to perform so just chatted for bit with father directly saw sleeping draught have given be beginning to take effect turned in have a comfortable sleep a ever have in life after sleeping on sofa for three week in heathen sort of way be comfort to get between sheet again well went to bed night before doctor be so doctor agreed good thing be just a good second time a be first better perhaps first time novelty of thing prevents altogether enjoying knew very well that if ran into of turkish ship fort opened fire at be like to hear plainly enough must have lain there then doctor lad must have have duty to perform must have dressed gone into main deck at once with instrument ready to do anything must for required have seen father morning doctor yes be glad to say that be better for two night sleep pulse be stronger will get up here after breakfast news that be fairly out to sea that danger be over be better for than medicine well lad did not think eight forty hour ago that must be racing down aegean again on board misericordia by time have have wonderful escape of altogether must not like to go through again for enough money to set up for life in scotland when be on board that turkish brig on way to constantinople must not have given bawbee for chance when arrived at athens greek sailor who have personated turk be landed mr beveridge be unequal to exertion of going ashore day after day be visited by politician military leader others after fortnight spent there dr macfarlane said to be use sir giving medicine trying to build up if be going on a be now doing be losing strength man instead of gaining morning seem little better evening be fagged worn out by importunate beggar can see that worry dispirits be very good to wish well to greece mr beveridge unless have desire to be buried in greek soil sooner be out of better be not so much change of air a change of thought that require go anywhere so that be to place where will never hear name of greece think be right doctor worry disappointment have know be telling on for month yes will definitely decide to go away at rate for time will ask captain martyn to come down captain martyn went on when latter entered cabin doctor tell must absolutely get away from here be quite sure that be right sir have be gradually wearing out ever since came here think will go back to england in first place martyn have doubt more bracing air will do good then can see how event go on here very well sir think will be heartily glad to be on way back have better go ashore at once martyn take horace with go to agent know have always kept paper in readiness for re sale of vessel back to go with to consulate have sale formally registered will write note for to take to agent ten minute later gig took martyn horace ashore returned four hour later there be little move of excitement among crew a stepped on deck again for through greek who have heard news from mr beveridge have spread forward on reaching deck martyn went to signal locker now miller said down with flag greek flag fluttered down from peak a british ensign be run up in place martyn took off cap shouted three cheer for old flag lad shout given with strength of lung of officer crew showed how hearty be pleasure be felt at change a soon a cheer have subsided order be given to get down awning prepare to make sail in few minute clank of anchor chain be heard by evening schooner be running down past shore of morea month later anchored in portsmouth here crew be paid off a during absence from england have have small opportunity of spending money have nearly two year pay coming to together with l head being share of prize money remainder of crew also received pay prize money two month leave of absence mr beveridge horace have have many discussion on subject have be agreed that misericordia now again since re hoisted english flag creole must for time be kept up a yacht with complement of two officer twenty men martyn having be consulted have chatted matter over with miller tarleton although have enjoyed trip greatly have made comfortable sum in pay prize money preferred to return to royal navy if must do so rather than remain in yacht mr beveridge promised to use influence a soon a returned to get appointed to ship promise be able to fulfil few week after arrival at home for home cruising a yacht martyn considered that tom burdett must be sufficient for if again went out to greece there must be difficulty in obtaining other officer making up crew to full strength portsmouth have be chosen instead of plymouth a point of arrival because from there mr beveridge must much more easily get up to town dr macfarlane insisting that must go up to obtain best medical advice there be nothing matter with mr beveridge have urged be just sir if have anything matter with might have chance of curing be because ca see reason why gain strength want other opinion about doctor have frequently talked over with horace during voyage can see nothing bodily matter with father horace wish must there be nothing to account for being in feeble state that say be that feel tired opinion be that really be sort of reaction after mental excitement just a there be reaction after great bodily fatigue father have lived smooth easy tranquil life change excitement worry utter disappointment with greek have have same sort of effect upon a climb up to top of ben nevis might have on man who did not stir out of house for month together a for being cause have doubt whatever be a to cure want to consult with big wig know whether quiet movement must be best for must have have quiet more complete than that have have on way home yet have done no good if be to go down home inducement to arouse must be still le what sort of change must really suit be more than can say horace thoroughly agreed with doctor if even cheerful society on board yacht did not rouse father dreaded what must be when be at home with one to stir up in way there be two three consultation in town with of leader of profession after hearing whole circumstance be unanimous in agreeing that there seemed serious disease of kind at same time condition gave cause of anxiety patient be evidently man of highly nervous organization at present nerve be wreck quite agree with be to go down to lonely house in country must probably sink into grave in few month at outside if must get to go in yacht of on expedition in feel what may call healthy interest might do good must say cold climate must be better for than warm one have have more than enough of enervating work in greek water try interest in polar expedition there have be great many of just lately ross parry franklin have be trying best to find north west passage be not likely to be of good if do find be nothing to point get interested in matter let go poke about for bit among iceberg if can get to do that see reason why in time mind must not recover tone matter have to be done cautiously horace professed vast interest in recent expedition doctor be full of interesting fact little by little kindled interest on subject in mr beveridge mind when horace broke out one day a if idea have only just struck dear father why must go up north in yacht for few month become explorer must be glorious to see iceberg to shoot bear seal must be splendid change for be sure must find frightfully dull going back to seaport did not entirely repudiate idea said that must not like to go away when thing be looking so dark for greece fortunately week later news came that immense preparation sultan have be making for invasion of greece with great army have be arrested by tremendous fire supposed to be work of janissary who did not like prospect of leaving constantinople fire have destroyed vast store collected artillery baggage train munition of war of kind be probable that at least year must pas before fresh effort must be made news evidently relieved mr beveridge mind when horace backed by macfarlane returned to charge at once consented martyn be written to by horace same day at once came up to town saw of officer who have be out with franklin parry returning to plymouth where creole be lying body of shipwright be at once set to work to strengthen by network of timber below to sheath with thick planking outside captain of whaler be engaged a first officer be

discovery of slightest importance have numerous exciting adventure have many narrow escape of being nipped by iceberg passed winter frozen up in baffin bay voyage achieved object for be undertaken subject of greece be forbidden one mr beveridge came to take lively interest in new scene with be surrounded joined in hunting party took prominent part in amusement got up for keeping crew in good spirit health through winter returned to england more healthy vigorous man than horace have ever before seen creole have taken out with barrel other appurtenance for whaling having be fairly successful in way returned with sufficient oil seal skin to pay greater part of expense feel man horace to what be when started mr beveridge said a stepped ashore at plymouth look different man father different man altogether to what have be since first remember suppose have grown be so much more upright that look a if have walk differently even voice seems changed now know must not go back again

in short time ibrahim arrived with army again besieged place throwing up formidable battery work against several time term be offered to garrison be contemptuously refused several attack be beaten off with great loss at last provision be absolutely exhausted brave defender of town resolved upon step almost unexampled in history namely that whole of men must sally out placing woman child in centre cut way through enemy there be still nine thousand person in town of whom only three thousand be men capable of bearing arm two thousand men woman child be too weak from starvation disease to join movement rest be divided into three division most of woman dressed in men clothing carried arm even child have loaded pistol unfortunately turk have be informed by deserter that attempt be about to be

turkey to grant independence of greece a event happened mr beveridge followed course with interest be only with interest shown by englishman in general personal feeling in matter have entirely left during last four year of struggle there be sign that misfortune disaster have have effect in inducing greek to lay aside personal jealousy ambition to make common effort against enemy large sum have received from loan raised for most part in england be spent in most unworthy us covered uniform with gold lace dress of men on foot often cost fifty pound of horseman ten time amount affected through
