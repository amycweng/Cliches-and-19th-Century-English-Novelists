many yard out of depth now will run home change thing james walsham be too much accustomed to be wet through to care anything about dripping clothes served a excuse to get away for felt awkward embarrassed at gratitude of old soldier pushed way through little crowd have now gathered round started at run for news have brought almost gathered round peep show to shore excitement of somebody being drowned being superior even to of peep show to great majority though few who have hope of obtaining necessary penny have lingered behind seized opportunity for gratuitous look through glass james ran upstairs changed clothes without seeing mother then taking down one of lesson book set to work shrinking from idea of going out again being made hero of hour later there be knock at front door few minute after mother called down ran down to parlour there found showman oh say boy broke out say anything more about do hate being thanked there be nothing in swimming ten yard in calm sea please say anything more about must rather hit ever so much sergeant smiled gravely mr walsham exclaimed why did come in tell about jim must not make out at first what mr mr sergeant wilks madam what sergeant wilks meant when said that have called to tell how grateful felt to for saving little grandchild life be proud of jim oh boy exclaimed be horrid going on so if have swum out with rope through surf there might be something in just to jump in at edge of water be not worth making fuss about one way other not to perhaps young gentleman be to showman said child be light of life only thing have to care for in world have saved if have only be by stretching out hand must have be equally grateful however will say no more about will not think le believe madam that there be credit in be just quickness promptness saved life have son hesitated moment must have be too late for must never have found be not likely that son will ever have occasion for help of mine must there be opportunity may rely upon that service can render will be to death unlikely a may seem may yet turn out that brave act of in saving life of granddaughter of travelling showman will not be without reward be right now james asked abruptly anxious to change conversation yes soon came to herself wanted to tell about must not let talk in few minute dropped off to sleep there left woman tell will probably sleep till morning will then be a well a ever now must go look after box boy will be pulling to piece be however untouched for in passing sergeant have told little crowd that if left alone must on return let see without payment during rest of afternoon be fully occupied with successive audience being obliged to make lecture brief in order that might have turn after sergeant have left james took hat went for long walk in country in order to escape congratulation of other boy next day little agnes be perfectly well appeared with grandfather in seat far back in church always occupied on sunday spent at sidmouth on occasion be always neatly prettily dressed indeed of good woman of place comparing graceful little thing with own child have not be backward in criticism on folly of old showman in dressing child out in clothes fit for lady chapter showman grandchild three month later showman again appeared at sidmouth did not set up box a usual leaving at lodging went at once with grandchild to mr walsham have come madam said after first inquiry about child have be answered on particular business will seem strange thing to for man like to ask thing be not quite a seem though ca explain now be beating about bush not getting nearer have come to ask whether must take charge of child for two year of course be ready to pay anything that may think proper take boarder mr walsham said much surprised at proposition only take girl who come in morning go away in afternoon besides be good many year older than grandchild none of girl who come to be under twelve know ma be know be sure must think great liberty on part to ask thing sergeant said apologetically be not teaching want just home for mr walsham felt puzzled did in heart feel to be liberty surely wandering showman must find difficulty in getting grandchild taken care of among people of own rank in life did seem most singular that must seek to place child with mr walsham be not given to thinking what neighbour must say thought of buzz of comment astonishment taking charge of child must excite have be particular in keeping little school to extent select a be now a large a must manage unaided be able to make almost favour to farmer wife to take girl to do mr walsham justice thought have le influence with than of time care must be required by child of age in house certainly thought a looked at sitting with eye wide open expression of grave wonder in face be little darling a jim saved life have special interest in be out of question be two three minute before answered showman last word can not be done sergeant wilks money must be paid must make up to for charge of child of age be day in school what must child especially one accustomed to be out day do with worry anxiety must be immense be not for school must be different altogether child of age especially such sweet little thing a granddaughter seems to be must be pet amusement a be be sorry to say that be out of question surely will have difficulty in finding plenty of good woman who must be glad to take to whom having child of same age must be trouble yes sergeant said slowly be afraid must say that ma be besides though be good enough not to say know that there must be other objection know must be surprised at wanting to be with lady like so far a money go must afford to pay fifty pound year perhaps might get girl who must look after aggie while be busy fifty pound year mr walsham said greatly surprised be large sum great deal too large sum for to pay for care of little child for half that there be score of farmer wife who must be happy to take where must be far more happy comfortable than must be with know must get plenty to take soldier said have reason very particular reason why wish to place with lady for two year can not explain reason to may imagine must be strong one for to be willing to pay fifty pound year for money have be laid by from day be born for purpose have other reason of own for wishing that must be at sidmouth rather than at other place have reason slight smile stole across face for preferring that must be with rather than anyone else must seem very strange to madam at end of two year when know what reason be will acknowledge that be good one god know went on looking very grave what wrench will be for to part with how lonely will be a tramp country without pretty prattle to listen to have got to do sooner later two year when can see sometimes will be break accustom to do without sweet face please madam urged give final answer today will not go till monday will call again if will let that morning believe if must tell must give reason must think induce to change mind so saying made military salute took child hand in be soon striding along towards sea mr walsham be time before recovered from surprise be indeed mysterious affair earnestness with old soldier pleaded cause have moved strongly have almost persuaded to accept proposal have at first seemed preposterous fifty pound year too be certainly handsome sum must get girl from village for two three shilling week to look after child go out with during school hour hundred pound must be very handsome addition to sum have begun little by little to lay by for jim preparation for medical profession in five year must elapse before must be time for to enter upon study for must hardly hope to lay by more than sum must at stroke double certainly be tempting offer must not do justice to child must not give care attention ought to have must have for such sum elsewhere sergeant knew exactly how be placed if be willing anxious for to assume charge of child why must refuse good offer however pupil be waiting for in next room with effort mr put matter aside went in to when james returned home to dinner mother related to whole conversation james be more amused than puzzled seems rum idea mother see why must take be sweet little thing will be great amusement fifty pound year seems tremendous sum for man like to pay suppose know own business will be great pull for will be able to have sort of comfort must like very much have often wished have have little sister can go out walk with know must be like having big dog with one only much jollier yes mother said smiling must be surprised if wanted to throw stick into water for to fetch out to be taking out for night fishing be constantly bringing home splashed with nasty red mud from head to foot must be nice playmate for little girl jim perhaps be that special advantage that sergeant have in mind eye when be so anxious to put with james laughed must see that did come to harm anyhow know after suppose be picking out of sea have something to do with first thinking of putting with suppose have jim said more seriously what do think boy know there be disadvantage in there will be good deal of talk about taking showman grandchild of farmer wife wo like then let dislike james said indignantly child be a good a daughter day why noticed in church looking like little lady there be not child there to compare to yes have noticed mr walsham said be singularly pretty graceful child will certainly cause remark well mother can easily say what be really fact that naturally felt interest in because picked out of water besides if people make remark will soon be tired of if not can get into scrape other give something else to talk about accordingly when sergeant wilks called on monday morning for answer mr walsham told that have decided to accept offer be aware how be placed said can not give care time must wish ought to have for such liberal payment a propose know beforehand see that for two year payment must not sacrifice school connection must have to do if gave time must wish understand madam said be grateful to for consenting to take be getting too old now to wander about with since narrow escape have last time be here have felt anxious whenever be out of sight must not suit to put in farm house want to learn to speak nicely have done best to teach if went to farm house must be picking up sort of country word want to talk like little lady so be settled ma be be going on to exeter from here will get stock of

there be few so neatly prettily dressed what be there to object to grandfather have be sergeant in army bear good character be liked wherever go consider james be in way demeaned by sitting down to

without provocation assaulted maltreated nephew say be lie sir james said fearlessly squire uttered short exclamation of surprise anger have be at first favourably impressed with appearance of young

james only little girl sir did not bring up be so little thought be better must not come can send for if wish be not necessary mr linthorne said have heard quite sufficient manner in fisherman have given evidence convinces that be speaking truth be sorry that must have be placed in position will understand that be not formal court therefore that there be question of discharging can only say that having story of what took place at fight between nephew be convinced that did what other boy of spirit must have done under same circumstance that punishment administered to be thoroughly deserved good morning james walsham witness left room mr linthorne rose saying to nephew follow sir went to study without saying word a to what have passed took down book from shelf proceeded to examine richard in few minute sufficed to show that boy be almost absolutely ignorant of latin while few question in geography history showed that be equally deficient in also will do squire said go up to

richard horton be in disgrace exact circumstance of affair be unknown for fisherman have not be present when richard have told story mr walsham who be much shocked when james told circumstance have impressed upon that be better to say nothing more about be clear in matter jim be enough for squire will doubt punish nephew for wicked lie have told day know boy will be master here let set everyone against by telling disgraceful story so beyond fact that there have be fight between james walsham squire nephew richard horton have be thrashed that squire have said that served right sidmouth knew nothing of what have taken place in justice room mr linthorne first impulse have be to send nephew at once back to parent with message that must have nothing more to do with though have reputation of being stern man squire be very kind hearted one be shocked to find that boy be liar to shield have invented falsehood against opponent upon reflection acknowledged that have be to blame in matter have taken boy into house have assigned to position of heir have paid no further attention to unfortunately man have selected a tutor have proved false to trust boy have be permitted to run wild head be turned with change in prospect fault have grown unchecked be to be said for that have not intended in first place to bring opponent into disgrace by making false accusation against for tutor have acknowledged that have said did not intend to tell to take step in matter position of accuser have be to extent forced upon by necessity of confirming tale have told to account for being thrashed by boy smaller than yes must be unfair upon boy utterly to cast off for first offence must give one more trial result of squire reflection be that on third day of imprisonment richard be sent for to study squire did not motion to to sit down remained standing with a squire said to hang dog look upon face have be thinking over matter quietly richard for did not wish to come to hasty conclusion first impulse be to pack off home have more to do with have thought better of mean despicable a conduct have be take blame to myself for not having seen that tutor did duty by therefore have resolved to give chance not here must not bear to have boy who have proved despicable liar about will try think that be first offence that lesson have taught may influence future life that may yet grow up honourable man will remember that henceforth be on trial that position in will stand by will will depend solely entirely on own conduct if prove by that lesson have have effect that deeply repent of conduct be resolved to do best to be henceforth straight honourable true will at death occupy position have intended for if not not one single penny of money will get be going to put in school where will be looked strictly after where will have chance of retrieving have just written to friend of mine post captain in majesty service asking to receive a midshipman have told frankly that have be somewhat over indulged that discipline of sea life will be of great benefit to have requested to keep tight hand over let know occasionally how be going on have told that position a heir will to very large extent depend upon report have asked in name of old friendship to be perfectly frank open in with have said 'he be eldest nephew have others who will take place if be unworthy of position although must be sorry if must be found wanting will commit interest of tenant people on estate to one who be not in respect honourable gentleman will do sir need not remain longer in room will not leave ground friend ship be at portsmouth at present doubtless will receive answer in course of few day until then le see other more pleasant for there be few more miserable boy in england than richard horton during week elapsed before answer to squire letter be received can not be said that in true sense of word be sorry for fault be furious with not because have lied because of consequence of lie thousand time called fool for having imperilled position risked being sent back again to dingy house in london merely to excuse for being thrashed by boy smaller than mad with folly not in having invented story in having neglected to look round to assure that there be witness who must contradict wandered disconsolate about garden park cursing what called fortune be additional sting to humiliation that knew servant in about house rejoiced at discomfiture imagined that there be veiled smile of satisfaction at bruised visage notorious disgrace with squire on face of man met outside of woman who passed in house during whole week did not venture near stable for there knew that have rendered specially obnoxious there be nothing for to do to saunter listlessly about garden until day arrived that letter came granting squire request begging that might be sent off at once a vessel must probably put to sea in few day now richard squire said that evening to in kinder voice than have used on last occasion understand exactly how stand towards other that being so wish to maintain present uncomfortable relation have have punishment unless hear to contrary will assume that punishment have have effect when return from sea after first voyage will come home here a if nothing have happened business need never be alluded to between if turn out a have hitherto believed to be will receive a warmly a if opinion of have never be shaken have requested captain sinclair to let know what be average allowance that midshipman receive from parent will see that have a much a messmate have also asked to kindly allow one of officer to order proper outfit in respect to have bill sent in to so now boy will have fresh fair start trust that will turn out everything can wish will try sir

sidmouth james walsham continued to make pet playmate of little aggie out of door life have made strong sturdy be able to accompany in ramble while when be at work at home preparing fishing line making boat otherwise amusing be content to sit hour quietly beside chattering incessantly quite content with occasional brief answer to question when be studying too must work at lesson however much might be puzzled over must never disturb by asking question when so engaged be intelligent child hour lesson morning afternoon soon grew into two be eager to learn rapidly gained ground on mr walsham older pupil during two year that lady never have cause to regret that have yielded to sergeant entreaty aggie be trouble in house brightened with childish laughter merry talk companionship james mother must not think did boy much good softened manner although still often went out with fisherman be no longer thrown entirely for companionship upon boy on beach sergeant came went seldom being more than two month without paying visit to sidmouth child be always delighted to see grandfather james took to greatly liked nothing better than to stroll up with to sheltered spot on hillside where must throw down on grass while sergeant smoked pipe told story of travel adventure aggie ran about looking for wildflower occasionally sat down for while to listen also squire lived usual lonely life up at hall absence of nephew whose ship have sailed for foreign station be relief rather than otherwise to have from first be painful effort to to regard boy a heir have only done when heartsick from long fruitless search for one who must have be nearer dearer to have ever taken to lad personally squire felt that there be not ring of true metal in careless way in spoke of parent showed want of heart although uncle be ignorant how much boy made disliked in household be conscious of certain antipathy for led to see a little of a possible two year for sergeant have placed grandchild with mr walsham came to end that did not intend to continue arrangement judged from something said on occasion of last visit two month before time be up gave hint a to what intended to do with in week mr walsham frequently thought matter over that sergeant have plan for child must hardly doubt child have told that knew of other relation than grandfather yet must hardly intend to take about with after placing for two year in comfortable home be seven year old now far too young to go out into place a servant girl in farm house doubted not that sergeant have expended whole of saving thought foolish in not having kept with for little time longer if must not do that might have placed with honest people who must have kept for sum have paid until be old enough to take place a nurse girl yet while argued thus mr walsham felt that old showman have not acted without weighing whole matter there must be something in did not understand in fact have said so when placed child with a time approached became more worried at thought of aggie leaving little one have wound very closely round heart expense of keeping be small indeed cost of food next to nothing while extra girl whom mr walsham have taken on when first came have be retained very short time james constant companionship with rendering keeping of nurse altogether unnecessary at last made up mind that must offer to keep on without pay james must miss companionship sorely must not be considered extravagance since money have received for must pay for cost of keep for year to come when mr walsham mind be once made up only fear be that mysterious plan of sergeant must not allow to leave aggie with punctual to day sergeant wilks arrived after little talk in parlour a usual with james aggie present formally requested favour of conversation with mr walsham alone take aggie for walk james stay out above three quarter of hour a tea will be ready for then must have wondered ma'be good deal sergeant began when be alone why who get living by travelling country with peep show wished to place grandchild in position above to have taught to be little lady be time now must tell aggie be granddaughter be granddaughter too of squire linthorne up at hall bless mr walsham ejaculated too astonished for further expression of feeling yes ma'be be daughter of squire son herbert who married daughter cissie dear dear mr walsham said what extraordinary thing of course remember herbert linthorne handsome pleasant young fellow be on bad term a everyone heard eight year ago with father because married somebody beneath mean somebody of whom squire did not approve year afterwards heard that be dead there be report that wife be dead too be only rumour squire went away just at time did not come back for month afterwards after that be altogether changed before have be one of most popular men in part of country now shut up gave up acquaintance never went outside park gate except to come down to church remember gave quite shock when saw for first time seemed to have grown old man at once everyone said that death of son have broken heart aggie be granddaughter well well have astonished why did not tell before there be good many reason ma'be thought in first place might refuse if knew for might do harm squire be vindictive man be landlord of house if came to know that have knowingly taken in granddaughter there be saying how might have viewed then if have known might have thought ought to keep in not let run about country with son altogether must not have be so comfortable for chose to put at sidmouth because wanted to come here often to hear how squire be going on for if have be taken ill must have told sooner than intended why did not tell before mr walsham asked just selfishness ma'be must not bring to run risk of having to give up be a much a be hundred time more to than must be to took baby from dead mother arm fed nursed taught first word first prayer why must offer to give up to who likely enough must not accept offer when be made to always intended to make day be duty to give chance at least kept on putting off day till saturday when be so nearly drowned then saw duty before have from first put aside hundred pound to give more of education than must do if have be for fall into sea might have be year before carried out plan then saw must not go on longer be getting too old too bold to sit quiet while be showing box have have narrow escape who must say what might happen next time got into mischief then bethought that squire be growing old that be better not to put off too long so ma'be came to made up mind to put with have way mr walsham said smiling though be with difficulty expected must be difficult ma'be made up mind to have kept on refusing must a last chance have told whose child be why mr walsham asked why be so particularly anxious that must come to of people sergeant smiled be difficult to tell ma'be have reason what be mr walsham persisted sergeant hesitated may think old fool ma'be will tell what fancy came into mind son saved aggie life be twelve year old be five seven year difference why what nonsense sergeant mr walsham broke in with laugh mean to say that fancy entered head did ma'be sergeant wilks said gravely liked look of boy much be brave modest gentleman spoke about to fisherman night everyone have good word for so said to myself ' ca reward for what have done directly may be that can indirectly aggie be only child have loving faithful little heart said to myself 'if throw with boy who know have saved life for two year be sure to have strong affection for ' many thing may happen afterwards if squire take will be separated may get to care for someone so may be just giving chance then too thought little about liked to fancy that even though must have to go from to squire little plan may yet turn out must be not who have arranged for future happiness of little darling must have told ma'be must have be glad brought to sergeant wilks anyhow mr walsham said for love dearly have be great pleasure to what be talking about be simply nonsense son be good boy will hope grow up honourable gentleman like father can not look so high a granddaughter of squire linthorne more unequal marriage have be made than ma'be sergeant said sturdily wo say more about have thought over over many hundred time a wheeled box across hill seem to impossible will agree that squire must never say yes squire may be in grave year before aggie come to think about marriage besides be more than likely that will have nothing to say to pet if pride made cast son off rather than acknowledge daughter a will keep from acknowledging daughter a grandchild hope will with heart hope so in case sergeant wilks mr walsham said let be home for time before told story have made up mind to ask to let remain with need feel under obligation for money have paid be amply sufficient to pay for expense of what eats for year will be real pleasure for to keep for have become part of house must miss sorely indeed be quick intelligent will teach know can train up to take situation a governess in gentleman family perhaps laughed little romance might come true day can in case stop in home until james make be very kind ma'be sergeant said truly kind indeed humbly accept offer except so long a live will be expense to earn more than enough for want can at rate do something towards preventing from being altogether burden on hand now ma'be how must recommend to go to work with vindictive old man up at hall must have thought be vindictive be not at character bear sergeant said hear spoken well of have seen in other case men who have have name of being pleasant generous be yet tyrant brute in own family judge a found hard hearted tyrannical vindictive father think have better not see have never met have never set eye on save here in church regarded a responsible for folly of son wrote violent letter said have inveigled lad into marriage although might have told be false did not answer letter for mischief be done then hoped must cool down in time however be past now wish to see be thinking of letting child go to hall by herself drop in suddenly upon be very like father may possibly take heart by storm yes mr walsham assented now know who be can see likeness strongly yes must think that must be best way people often yield to sudden impulse who will resist if approached formally from distance have reason to suppose that will not receive did refuse at first to undertake charge of child doe even know that be alive may be that year have be anxious to have with that have be doing injustice altogether never thought of in light sergeant said after pause never came near son when lay dying never wrote line in answer to letter if man must not forgive son when lay dying how must care for grandchild have never seen may be so sergeant wilks son death certainly broke down terribly may be that will gladly receive granddaughter there be young one back again will think over what have be telling can discus again tomorrow chapter squire granddaughter following day council be held mr walsham told sergeant on thinking over have concluded that best way must be to take old butler at hall who have served family for forty five year into confidence to ask to arrange how best aggie might be introduced to squire have be thinking over what said ma'be may be that be right have partly misjudged squire hope so for aggie sake yet can not help feeling sorry have always felt almost sure must have nothing to say to have clung to hope must not lose little girl know of course how much better will be for have done must to make so that must be fit for if took will be wrench ma'be ca help feeling will be wrench old soldier voice quivered a spoke can not be otherwise sergeant mr walsham said kindly have be everything to other though for good happiness be ready to give up be heavy sacrifice for to make afternoon

especially in winter when wind blew strong across upland began to feel that be no longer a strong a used to be prospect of having aggie always near be however far greater temptation than of ending day in quiet comfort hand that of squire met in cordial grip matter be settled fortunately a sergeant reflected have still pension of ten shilling week must suffice to supply clothes other little necessary might require must thus save from being altogether dependent on squire aggie be wild with delight when be called in informed of arrangement thought of grandfather tramping country alone have be one drawback to pleasure of life at mr walsham many time have cried to sleep a pictured to herself loneliness that be to be with always be to give up work to settle down in comfort be indeed delight to greatly pleased be also to hear that mr walsham be to be asked to come up to be governess oh will be nice exclaimed clapping hand just like fairy story used to tell grampa when everyone be

james be to go to school be splendid what be talking about aggie mr walsham asked bewildered a child poured out news aggie be too fast madam squire said entering room accompanied by sergeant be taking for granted while have yet to be arranged must apologize for coming in without knocking child opened door rushed in best thing to do be thought to follow have come in first place to thank for great kindness to little granddaughter to tell son how deeply feel indebted to for having saved life two year ago now aggie run away look for friend while talk matter over with mr walsham aggie scampered away to find james who be at work at book to tell news while squire unfolded plan to mr walsham offer be so handsome that mr walsham accepted without instant hesitation be to have entire charge of child during day with option of returning home in evening when aggie went in to dessert after dinner of living entirely at hall squire explained intention of sending james to good school at exeter a instalment of debt owed for saving child life pointed out that when be at home for holiday aggie must have holiday too mr walsham need only come up to hall when felt inclined mr walsham be delighted with offer even more for james sake than own although prospect for herself be most pleasant to have only aggie to teach walk with must be delightful after monotony of drilling successive batch of girl often inordinately tiresome stupid said at once that must prefer returning home at night decision pleased squire for have wondered what must do with in evening arrangement be at once carried into effect school be broken up a parent of child be almost tenant of squire offered objection to girl being suddenly left on hand when heard that teacher be going to live a governess at hall indeed surprise of sidmouth neighbourhood at learning that little girl at mr walsham be squire granddaughter that showman be therefore connection of squire be going also to live at hall be so great that there be room for other emotion save for wreck arrival of shoal of fish off coast of trouble between smuggler revenue officer sidmouth have few excitement present news afforded food for endless talk conjecture on comparing note appeared that there be not woman in place who have not be all along convinced that little girl at mr walsham be something more than seemed to be that showman be man quite out of ordinary way when on following sunday sergeant who have in meantime be to exeter walked quietly into church with squire agreed that well dressed military looking man be gentleman that have only

friend mr wilks father of poor boy wife impression made be generally favourable none have ever known exact story of herbert marriage be generally supposed that have married beneath opinion now be that must have be mistake for there be nothing in way vulgar about quiet military looking gentleman with whom squire be evidently on term of warm friendship only person somewhat dissatisfied with arrangement be james walsham loved mother so much that have never offered slightest dissent to plan that must follow in father footstep be so much set on matter that must never bring to utter word in opposition at heart however longed for more stirring more adventurous life such a of soldier sailor have along cherished secret hope that something might occur to prevent preparing for medical profession so enable to carry out secret wish present arrangement seemed to put end to such hope although grateful to squire for sending to good school wished with heart that have chosen other way of manifesting gratitude four year passed quietly james walsham worked hard when at school during holiday spent time for most part on board fisherman boat sometimes went up to hall generally at invitation of mr wilks why come oftener jim latter asked one day aggie be saying only yesterday that used to be such friend with now hardly ever come near squire be a pleased a be to see know jim

white line with came gust of wind to have already be blowing be trifle there be more talking for nothing le than shout must have be heard above roaring of wind be scarcely possible to stand against fury of squall be driven across road took shelter at corner of house where fisherman have already retired squall lasted few minute be soon succeeded by almost equally furious seemed to increase in strength until wind be blowing perfect hurricane fisherman now struggled across road again for between rain squall glimpse have be caught of two of fishing boat be now approaching shore mere rag of sail be set on yet tore over wave at tremendous speed one be two hundred yard ahead of other by course be making must come ashore nearly at same spot news that two boat be in sight spread rapidly many of fisherman wife with shawl over head ran down stood peering out from behind shelter for be well nigh impossible to stand exposed to fury of gale old fisherman stood with coil of rope in hand close to water edge several of others stood close to four of have hold of other end of rope when boat be within fifty yard of shore sail be lowered still drove straight on before wind with scarce abatement in speed man stood in bow also with coil of rope in hand a approached threw far ahead fisherman rushed waist deep into water caught end of in moment be knotted to one in hand run along with shouted for moment boat towered on top of wave raced in towards shore next a came took stern be in act of swinging round when strain of rope came upon brought straight again higher higher wave rose then crashed down boat shot forward like arrow in foam fisherman rushed forward caught on board leapt out waist deep be taken off foot by backward rush clung to side of boat while men at head rope with

remain with james latter must not hear of lad be indeed well pleased to hear that be going up to hall a thereby escaped hearing more of own praise besides be most anxious to get down to beach again for one must say what might take place there before morning a soon therefore a heard door close jumped out of bed when peeping through blind saw carriage drive off with four occupant at once began to dress felt bruised sore from blow have received red wheal round chest beneath arm showed where rope have almost cut into flesh however soon dressed descended stair went into kitchen told astonished girl that be going out then having made hasty meal of bread cold meat put on oilskin again started for shore did not however wait long so heavy be sea now that nothing must be done must vessel drive ashore a for fisher boat sailor shook head a spoke of be farther away to west so chap a got ashore tell may have got in somewhere before got to worst if not must have gone hard with finding that there be nothing to be done that be much more stiff bruised than have believed jim made way back again turned into bed where soon fell asleep did not wake until following morning one of groom have come down from hall at six o'clock to inquire how be message given by girl that have be out that have come back be now sound asleep satisfied mr walsham enabled to devote undivided attention to charge who needed care more than son before night indeed squire have sent down to sidmouth for dr walsham successor who said that aggie be very feverish must be kept perfectly quiet for day sent up soothing draught mr walsham sat up with night slept little talked almost incessantly sometimes rambling little first thing in morning doctor be again sent for on recommendation squire at once sent off man on horseback to exeter for leading physician of town when arrived late in afternoon aggie be somewhat quieter report be more cheering pulse be very high said mr langford tell that be not so rapid a be in morning that think symptom be abating undoubtedly be sharp feverish attack brought on by excitement exposure very little more must have be case of brain fever trust now that will soon pas off sedative have be administered be taking effect trust will soon fall asleep a requested have made arrangement for staying here tonight trust by morning will have convalescent mr wilks have gone down first thing in morning to see james found up about a usual be very greatly concerned at hearing that aggie have passed bad night came four time up to hall during day to inquire about on last visit late in evening be told that be sleeping quietly that doctor have hope that must wake in morning free from fever proved to be case be ordered to keep bed for day two on morning after storm wind have gone down much although tremendous sea be still breaking on shore message arrived in course of day to say that missing boat with one exception have succeeded in gaining shore before storm be full on missing boat be never heard of again two day later james walsham have strolled up hill to east of town be lying with book before in favourite nook of looking over sea be one of lovely day sometimes come late in autumn a if summer be determined to show at best before leaving must not be said that james be studying for be watching vessel passing far out at sea inwardly moaning over fact that be destined for profession for have real liking instead of being free to choose one of travel adventure presently heard voice behind position in be lying be little distance down on slope on seaward side of path a screen of bush grew behind must not be seen by anyone passing along men with pistol cutlass be to assemble here at ten o'clock tonight johnson give order till late let come up one by one so a not to attract attention lipscombe men be to assemble at same hour march to meet time think there be mistake cargo be to be landed where told will be high tide at twelve o'clock be sure to choose that hour so that cutter can run close in have sent off man on horseback to weymouth for revenue cutter to come round if be in time will catch that troublesome lugger a well a cargo have be thorn in side for last year time do hope will have speaker then moved on out of hearing james walsham recognized voice a of revenue officer commanding force at sidmouth smuggling be at time carried on on large scale along coast there be frequent collision between engaged in revenue officer sympathy of population be wholly with smuggler cheating of revenue be not at considered in light of crime many of fisherman from time to time took hand in smuggling cruise country people be always ready to lend assistance in landing carrying cargo when out in boat at night james have often heard fisherman tell story of smuggling adventure more than once have be with when have boarded lugger laden with contraband to warn that revenue cutter be on cruising ground must not be safe to attempt to run cargo at present now determined at once that must warn smuggler of danger question be where be cargo to be run officer have not mentioned spot a force from next station to east be to cooperate must be somewhere between two waiting till speaker must have gone well along cliff rose to foot returned to sidmouth thought at first of telling of fisherman what have heard a in event of affray might come out how smuggler have be warned of intention of revenue officer thought there must be le risk in giving warning knew path down cliff for mile trusted that must be able to make way down give boat notice of danger before revenue men reached shore at nine o'clock dressed in rough sailor suit wore when went out with fisherman started along cliff for distance kept well inland a officer might have placed man on lookout to stop anyone going towards scene of action spot thought most likely be mile half along shore there be good landing place easy path up cliff knew that cargo have be more than once run here accordingly when reached spot sat down among bush on edge of cliff waited for sort of signal half hour later heard tramp of number of men passing along behind there go revenue men thought to suppose be going to meet coming other way hour passed without further sound james began to get uneasy if be spot fixed for landing of country people ought to be arriving by time to help to carry off cargo might for aught knew be already near waiting for signal before descended path doubt revenue men must be lying in wait short distance off must allow friend of smuggler to go down to water without letting know of presence kept eye fixed on water to east watching anxiously for appearance of light presently started immediately in front of about mile at sea bright light be shown in second disappeared three time flashed out then be dark night be very dark one there be moon star be obscured although strained eye to utmost must not make out vessel from light have be shown how foolish to show such bright light said to must have be almost sure to attract attention of anyone on watch made way to path descended to edge of water waited expecting momentarily to be joined by people from above one came strained ear listening for fall of approaching oar be silent hour passed then flashed across that signal must have be made to deceive revenue men to cause to assemble at spot so leave point really determined upon free for operation with exclamation of disgust at own stupidity in having be deceived james ran up path again at top of speed then took road along cliff for two mile ran without interruption then saw dark mass in front of turned off instantly to left doubtless have be heard approaching for two three men detached from rest started to cut off james ran straight inland in darkness soon lost sight of pursuer then turned made for cliff again two three hundred yard farther along there be path to shore have doubt now be one smuggler be about to use struck cliff within few yard of spot in instant two men jumped up seized who be for instant james thought that assailant be revenue men even in darkness saw that be countryman said revenue men be close at hand be watching two three hundred yard along listen here come tramping of foot coming rapidly along cliff be clearly heard men with oath released hold ran off giving loud whistle made for cart be stationed few hundred yard inland james dashed down path shouting at top of voice have not gone many yard before met number of men coming up with tub of spirit on shoulder throw down cried make along shore revenue men be close behind advice be taken at once tub be thrown down went leaping bounding down to shore while men followed james at full speed down path pursuer be close behind there be longer use in concealment officer shouted to to press forward at full speed while from beach below hubbub of voice suddenly broke out at same moment blue light be lit on cliff above beat back lad one of smuggler be shouting a james ran down to little crowd of men standing near two boat be five to one against come on surrender in king name revenue officer shouted a rushed forward followed by men answer be pistol shot in moment furious melee began advantage in number be on side of smuggler who have landed with keg be armed with pistol cutlas countryman have heavy stick bludgeon ten revenue men must have be overpowered suddenly shout be heard party of sailor ran up along shore joined in fray be detachment from other station have be waiting at little distance along shore for signal from above to boat lad leader of smuggler shouted be caught in trap smuggler rushed to boat james who be standing by water edge leaped on board with most of country people fled at once along shore pursued by of revenue men while others made rush for boat have be kept afloat few yard from shore grapnel have be dropped over stern a men in charge hauled out moment fight began be in water shoulder deep when smuggler scrambled on board revenue men dashed in after strove to hold boat be beaten off with oar cutlass boat be soon hauled out into deep water grapnel be lifted men many of whom be wounded more le severely in fray got out oar pulled to lugger amid dropping fire of pistol shot from shore chapter pressed many deep be malediction uttered a smuggler climbed on board vessel captain said cheerily never mind lad might have be worse be only first cargo of tub half of be ashore lace silk be right so no great harm be done set to work get up sail a soon a can likely enough there be cutter in offing that blue light must have be signal seem to have got news of landing somehow crew at once set to work to get up sail three four of countryman who have like james got on board boat stood in group looking on confused helpless james lent assistance until sail be hoisted craft began to move through water now then captain said let go below look at wound dare show light here on deck wound be for most part slash blow with cutlass for in darkness confusion of fight only two of bullet have taken effect one of smuggler have fallen shot through head while one of on board have arm broken by pistol ball now for passenger captain said after wound have be bandaged who be lifted lantern to james face why be young mr walsham exclaimed in surprise james knew man now for lugger have several time put in at sidmouth where coming in a peaceable trader revenue officer although well aware of nature of vocation be unable to touch a vessel must only be seized when have contraband on board why what brings into affair young master james related conversation have overheard determination to warn smuggler of danger must have managed in plenty of time if have known exact spot on be going to land saw signal light two mile down coast kept there for hour struck then be ruse to attract officer from real spot of landing though ran a hard a must be only just before thank heartily smuggler said expect saved from much worse mess than got into have doubt meant to capture tub a be loaded without raising alarm fellow on shore must have come up quietly taken by surprise a be landing last boat load thanks to have got well out of have only lost one of hand score so of tub ca put ashore suppose james said that ca smuggler replied have doubt that cutter from weymouth be somewhere outside must get well off coast before morning if give slip will send off in boat sometime tomorrow must go ashore to make fresh arrangement for getting cargo landed james went on deck again breeze be light lugger be slipping along quietly through water must faintly see loom of cliff on right knew that lugger be running west keeping a close inshore a must to avoid cutter watching for outside wondered what must say at home when be found that be missing consoled by thinking that mother who be still up at hall must doubt suppose that have gone out for night fishing a have often done before that a be away have forgotten to leave word with servant suddenly blue light burned out on top of cliff angry exclamation broke from captain who be standing at helm confound exclaimed have caught sight of from cliff be signalling whereabouts to cutter a spoke turned vessel head seaward for quarter of hour sailed straight out now said quietly think must be out of sight of fellow on shore get on other tack lad be a quiet a can about there be saying how close cutter may be to great sail be lowered a boat head paid off to east yard be shifted to other side of mast sail hoisted again lugger began to retrace way back along coast be just chance now captain said to james who be standing close by whether commander of cutter guess not that will change course will know be likely enough to do must do if be in place james said must run straight out to sea lay to eight ten mile off must be able to make out then at daylight course take whereas by trying to follow in dark must run chance of missing altogether wish wind must get up bit be not moving through water more than three knot hour be dying away however fancy will blow up again in morning do know whether be faster than be james asked there be not much difference captain replied if wind be strong have leg of in light breeze be fastest have chased dozen time already have always given slip then even if doe run out to sea a say james said ought to be safe a must be dozen mile so along coast yes not that ahead of captain answered for must be so much to seaward still must be far enough will begin to fire long before be in range will bring other king ship within hearing down on however daresay will give slip a have done before hour passed slowly wind continued to drop until vessel scarcely moved through water after while sweep be got out be worked until day broke eye be on lookout for cutter a day dawn began to steal over sky there be sure enough captain exclaimed at length lying to on watch eight mile to west must have seen for be against light sky like be becalmed be quarter of hour however before position of cutter be seen to change then head be suddenly turned east have got wind captain said now only want good breeze will have lively day of lad from time when have turned lugger have made only about eight mile along coast to east equal distance seaward for tide have set against morning be bright clear sea be perfectly smooth a yet sail hung idly down there be dark line on water showed that breeze be coming will have plenty of wind presently skipper said see how light sky be to south there will be white top on wave in hour two here come flaw haul in sheet lad now begin to move puff did not last long dying away to nothing in few minute then lugger lay immovable again men whistled stamped deck impatiently cast anxious glance back at cutter be walking along fast skipper said a examined through glass have got wind steady must be slipping along at six knot hour be hard luck on if get breeze soon will be close thing of quarter of hour passed without breath of wind ruffling water cutter be fully two mile nearer to than when have first be seen be holding wind steadily here come lad skipper said cheerfully ten minute will have share time seemed long indeed before dark line on water reached lugger there be something like cheer from crew a craft heeled slightly over then began to move through water be true breeze time increased moment in force till lugger be lying well over with white wave at bow cutter have first gained by freshening breeze james walsham looking back at judged that there be not more than four mile of water between boat breeze be nearly due west a lugger be headed a close a must lie to cutter have hauled in sheet lay up on same course so that be now sailing almost parallel to other if must change place skipper said must be safe can sail nearer wind than can can edge away now have advantage of james have already perceived wondered that lugger did not pay off before wind so a to make stern chase of want to get few mile farther out skipper said likely enough there be cutter somewhere inshore be quite enough to have one of fellow at one heel half hour cutter edging in be little over three mile distant then skipper gave word helm be put down sheet slackened off in minute lugger be running dead before wind with sail boomed out one on side cutter followed example hoisted large square sail wind be blowing fresh now sea be getting up not cloud be to be seen in sky sun shone brightly on white head be beginning to show on water lugger be tearing along occasionally throwing cloud of spray over bow leaving track of white water behind think still gain on captain said to mate who have taken helm ay be gaining sailor agreed wind be freshening minute ca carry that topsail much longer be pressing bow under now will go almost a fast without skipper said commander of cutter seemed to be of same opinion for just a spoke topsail be seen to flutter then descended to deck be quarter of hour before skipper spoke again think just about hold own said did think polly must have held running must in light wind mate replied with wind will want fast boat to beat hand be now set to work shifting keg further aft be better skipper said presently be sure be gaining ground mast will stand if cutter will with stern low in water lugger be now tearing along at tremendous pace stout a be mast strong stay james walsham wondered at standing strain of great brown sail a seemed at time almost to lift bodily out of water buoyant a craft be wave broke over bow flooded deck sheet of spray flew over cutter with sharper bow sail forward be feeling still more severely spirit of on board lugger rose rapidly a be evident that be dropping pursuer suddenly gaff of cutter mainsail be seen to droop boom be hauled on board thought must be too much for skipper said exultantly be going to reef have better reef down too think mate said have have a much a must bear for time will hold on ten minute longer skipper said half mile count before time be up sail be one after reefed for wind continued to freshen sky be still cloudless there be misty light in air heavy sea be beginning to run suddenly gun flashed out from cutter skipper uttered oath pursuer be more than three mile astern knew that must only be firing a signal there be several large ship in sight on way up down channel to little attention have be paid skipper shaded eye with hand gazed earnestly at large ship on weather beam four mile away be frigate sure enough exclaimed be fairly caught between haul in sheet lad will have try for yet lugger be brought sharp up into wind be soon staggering along seaward with lee bulwark almost under water cutter instantly lowered square sail followed example continuing to fire gun minute eye be turned towards frigate be now on port beam will cross two mile to windward of skipper said if keep on course quarter of hour will do be sure to notice gun wind will take down to ah there go a spoke puff of smoke darted out from frigate bow sail fluttered head bore round until be on same tack a lugger latter be now about equidistant from two pursuer cutter lugger be nearly abreast former being to windward must edge down frigate be three mile to leeward be fully mile ahead there be way out of skipper said bitterly in light wind must run away from frigate with breeze have chance with look how be piling on sail crew shared captain opinion shook fist cursed vainly at pursuer stood sullenly scowling while french portion of crew gave way to wild outburst of rage rapidly three vessel closed in towards other for cutter edged in so rapidly that lugger be obliged to bear off towards frigate again a last hope lugger course be changed again tried running superior weight power of frigate brought rapidly down presently heavy gun boomed out shot came dancing along water hundred yard away lower sail skipper said be use going farther inside of prison be better than bottom of sea anyhow down came sail lugger lay rolling heavily in wave a frigate bore down upon with white roll of water on stem get ready lad skipper said there be just one chance will run by instant be past up sail again will be mile away before can get round into wind again if doe cripple with shot may weather yet need mind cutter frigate came foaming along crew busy in taking sail off instant have passed be preparing to round to sail of lugger flew up like magic be soon tearing along almost in eye of wind a if to meet cutter be running down towards down below lad man of captain shouted will have broadside in minute in moment deck be clear of save skipper mate who stood at tiller frigate swept slowly round then a gun came to bear shot after shot be fired at lugger already three quarter of mile to windward shot hummed overhead one struck water alongside yard two away still be untouched of shot went a near cutter a did to skipper said wo fire again be now fast approaching cutter when be within quarter of mile changed course be brought up again into wind firing four gun carried on broadside a came round lugger head be paid off placed cutter on starboard quarter going free former be travelling faster gun be fired from cutter bow shot struck splinter from lugger quarter crew be on deck again now train that gun over stern skipper said if can knock mast out of be saved if not will have yet have scarcely spoken when there be crash shot from cutter have struck mizzen mast few foot above deck mast sail fell over to leeward there be cry of rage dismay luck against skipper said bitterly down with sail lad time be up with sail be lowered lugger lay motionless in water until cutter came up lay within fifty yard of boat be at once lowered officer be rowed to lugger so have caught friend at last said a sprang on board must have done if have not be for frigate skipper said will say craft sail like witch officer replied wish must have done without will make difference to frigate will get lion share of prize what be value of cargo two hundred keg of brandy skipper replied fifteen hundred pound worth of lace silk good prize officer said not own hope for have made brave chase of skipper answered fortunately only took very small share time be bad enough to lose boat own two third of be sorry for officer said for be in high spirit at success of chase must afford to be pleasant here come boat from frigate played rare trick might have got off if have be for lucky shot of ours see be just getting out stern chaser pointed to gun be well for that did fire a ca be charged with armed resistance wish have fired for that might have be luck to cripple must have made difference if have officer replied frigate must have overhauled with wind must sail five foot to four boat from frigate now came alongside how be cotterel officer said a stepped on board be lucky shot of yours think be lucky for lugger that hit for captain be so savage at trick played that believe must have sunk when came up to again heard say to first lieutenant wo give chance to play such trick again what order have brought other asked be outward bound so be to put crew on board take into port a be very short of hand will relieve of prisoner on board lugger be at once ordered into frigate boat be rowed off to ship on gaining deck be drawn up in line captain first lieutenant came up good humour of former have be restored by capture of lugger hallo said looking at bandaged head arm of of men so have be having fight trying to run cargo suppose will make worse for when get on shore now might press without giving choice want unwilling hand so will leave to be to be english prison for two three year cruise on board thetis greater part of men at once stepped forward announced willingness to volunteer who have here captain asked looking at three countryman be passenger sir skipper of lugger said with half smile few question brought to light fact of surprise while cargo be being landed well lad captain said be in same boat with rest be engaged in unlawful enterprise in resisting majesty officer will get month in prison anyhow if go back have better stay on board let make men of countryman however preferred prison to man o ' war james have be turning over matter in mind have certainly taken part in fray must be difficult to prove must not account for presence except by acknowledging that be there to warn must certainly be case of imprisonment surely must be better to volunteer than have be longing for sea here opportunity opened for for abandoning career mother intended for without setting in opposition to wish surely must prefer that must be at sea for year two to being disgraced by imprisonment therefore now stepped forward belong to lugger crew sir have nothing to do with running cargo though own be on spot at time be not sailor though have spent good deal of time on board fishing boat mr horton whom see there know will tell that be son of doctor in sidmouth a have got into scrape must rather serve than go back stand trial very well lad captain said like spirit will keep eye on three countryman four of french sailor who declined to join thetis be taken back to cutter thetis at once proceeded on way down channel james have given hastily scribbled line on back of old letter happened to have in pocket to men who be to be taken ashore have very little hope that must ever reach mother indeed did ever do so when cutter reached weymouth with lugger men captured in be at once sent to prison where remained until be tried at assize three

though might have come to warn be to say to warn mean just to do em good turn a be always ready to do if have chance must have have anything to do with scrimmage might have be standing quiet like near boat when other lot came along shore then seeing a game be up might likely enough have jumped on board gone off to lugger be possible mr wilks said anyhow will go off at once make inquiry at house within mile so of landing place chapter discharged contrary to usual habit of punctuality mr wilks did not return to luncheon at hall be two hour later before came in looking fagged anxious have be to farm house within two mile of scene of fight have ascertained for certain that jim be not lying wounded at of at first inquiry have everywhere be coldly received there be scarce farm house near coast occupant have relation with smuggler assisting with cart men at landing having hiding place where good must be stowed away at first therefore professed entire ignorance of event of previous night when persuaded by earnestness of old soldier manner that mission be friendly one became more communicative even owned that of men have be taken prisoner marched to weymouth none of have heard of wounded man being in hiding convinced at last that james must have gone off to lugger mr wilks returned to sidmouth prey to great anxiety everything depended now on whether lugger be captured if so james must have to stand trial for being concerned in fight on beach a two of revenue men have be killed sentence might be heavy one if got away must be well must doubtless hear by letter from jim must be better that must not return at present to sidmouth must at once take up residence in london commence study there met squire just a latter be starting for sidmouth well wilks began to think that be lost said cheerfully aggie be downstairs to lunch be mightily offended that must not be there at first appearance look tired fagged have anything gone wrong thing have gone very wrong squire related to friend news that have gathered conviction that james be on board lugger be pretty kettle of fish squire said irritably what on earth did boy mean by getting mixed up with such affair a that be foolish business squire old soldier agreed ca expect wise head on young shoulder suppose somehow other learnt surprise revenue men intended a most of friend fisherman must probably be concerned in went to give notice intending doubt to go quietly back again before revenue men arrived know that be altogether to be blamed in matter most young fellow must do same well suppose must squire agreed reluctantly be most awkward business if lad get caught get two three year imprisonment will ruin prospect in life mother will be broken hearted over business be sure aggie will take terribly to heart be great friend of old though have seen much of for last two three year of course that affair of other day have made quite hero of must hope lugger will get safely over to france companion said then great harm will have be done must hope so squire assented moodily confound young jackanapes turning everything upside down upsetting with mad brain freak mr walsham be greatly distressed when news be broken to by mr wilks aggie cried so that squire at last said must go straight up to bed unless stopped for must be making ill again when be somewhat pacified matter be discussed in light only conclusion to be arrived at be that sole hope rested in hugger getting safely off of course dear madam squire said if be taken will do best to get pardon for son be afraid will have to stand trial with rest think that with representation will make a to good character may get mitigation anyhow of sentence if find out that be who gave alarm there will be hope of pardon if doe come out one must represent being there a mere boyish freak of adventure in case might get free pardon must not take matter too seriously to heart be foolish business be worst can be said of think be grand thing aggie said indignantly for to risk being shot imprisoned sort of dreadful thing just to save other people think be goose aggie squire said if everyone be to go mix up in other people business there must be end of trouble suppose next will say that if heard arranging with constable to make capture of burglar must think grand thing to put on hat to run off to warn oh grandpapa how can say such thing girl said burglar smuggler be quite different burglar be wicked men thief robber smuggler be not be only trying to get good in without paying duty try to rob king dear in eye of law be just a criminal a burglar of be leagued to break law will resist take life if be interfered with allow that in general estimation smuggler be looked upon in more favourable light that great many people who ought to know better be in league with that doe not alter fact of case girl did not argue question squire be perfectly aware that have in way convinced that feeling that james walsham action be highly meritorious one be in way shaken be agreed that nothing be to be said about james absence after taking refreshment mr went down into sidmouth again to tell girl at mr walsham that be not to gossip about james being away three day later letter be received by squire from richard horton be taking opportunity of writing few line to dear uncle a have chance of sending ashore by revenue cutter thistle be lying alongside of between have just captured rascally smuggling lugger with cargo of lace silk spirit will be sure be surprised grieved to hear that among crew of lugger be james walsham must hardly believe eye when saw in such disreputable company will be sad blow for poor mother a be short of hand captain offered crew of lugger choice of shipping with being sent on shore for trial most of chose former alternative among james walsham of be glad a mother will be spared disgrace of being placed in dock with associate need not say that if must have obtained release must have done so knowing that have high opinion of be of course out of power to interfere squire be alone in study when received letter for be midday before post arrived at sidmouth when man from hall went down day with bag to fetch letter rang bell ordered servant to tell mr wilks must be glad if must step in to when friend came handed letter without word settle matter said a threw letter angrily down upon

line of speaks of men a james associate talk about disgrace must bring on mother there be malice squire in line of be afraid be bad letter squire assented gravely be natural letter mr wilks said savagely be written in hurry be have time to pick choose word round off sentence a generally doe in letter to be so full of malicious exultation that did not think how much be showing feeling a wrote be bad letter nasty letter squire assented let that pas now first question be how be to tell jim mother do think will be relief to otherwise will be blow to know that lugger have be captured mr wilks said severe blow doubt for escape be what have be building hope upon will be heavy blow too for to know james be seaman before mast that will be year before will see again that plan for future be upset think will be much better for than if knew be prisoner must have to stand trial between ourselves squire a far a lad be concerned be not sure that will be altogether sorry that event have turned out a have in talk together have often confided to that own inclination be altogether for life of activity adventure that a mother heart be so set upon following father profession have resolved upon never saying word to must lead to suppose that own wish lay in other direction business will give opportunity have longed for to see world without appearing in way to thwart mother plan at rate squire said be heartily glad have got off being tried even if have got free pardon for must have be serious slur upon that have be imprisoned must have be awkward for in future think wilks will leave to to break to mother very well other agreed be unpleasant business squire perhaps have better do may console if tell at heart always wanted to go to sea accustomed a be to knock about in fisherman boat will find hardship on board man o war will come back in course of two three year none worse for cruise may think will take up doctoring again after though have doubt whether will do however there be use in telling so will show that letter squire squire replied of course can tell what be in will keep letter must give good deal if have not written be certainly badly worded though why must feel malice towards other be more than can tell companion be about to speak thought better of without word went to break news to mr walsham mr walsham be terribly upset after suffering to cry for time in silence mr wilks said dear madam know that news must distress terribly may be that in a in thing providence have overruled plan for son for own good will tell now what must never have known have affair never occurred jim at heart hate father profession be dutiful son rather than give pain be prepared to sacrifice own feeling wish lad be full of life energy dull existence of country surgeon in little town like be last must adopt a own choice own be not surprised that lad of spirit must long for more adventurous life must have told long ago advised that must be well for to put frankly to that although must naturally like to see following father profession still that felt that must choose for must select other mode of life must not set wish against lad must not hear of doing so said that rather than upset cherished plan must gladly consent to settle down in sidmouth for life honoured for filial spirit frankly think be wrong eagle be not made to live in hen coop spirited lad to settle down in humdrum village own that although regret manner of going can not look upon a unmixed evil that force of circumstance have taken out of course marked out for that will have opportunity of seeing life adventure mr walsham have listened with surprise too great to admit of interrupting old soldier remark never dreamed of said at last when ceased can not remember now that ever asked took for granted that must like nothing better than to follow in father step have known that objected to must not for moment have forced against inclination of course be natural that being alone in world must like to have with still must never have be so selfish a to have sacrificed life to mine still though must be hard to have parted from in way be harder still to part like if be to go need not have gone a common sailor squire who have done so much for must no doubt instead of sending to school have obtained midshipman berth for commission in army be dreadful to think of a common sailor liable to be flogged well mr walsham perhaps may set matter partly to right will speak to squire be sure will write to friend at admiralty have order sent out at once for jim discharge at same time must be better that must not return here just at present name may come out at trial of smuggler a being concerned in affair must be better that must stay away till matter blow over at rate if be must

disadvantage fortnight after arrival of thetis at hampton order be issued among ship of war for thirty volunteer for braddock expedition of thetis be to furnish ten so many sent in name that first lieutenant have difficulty in choosing ten who be looked upon with envy by rest of ship company for there seemed little chance at present of fighting at sea excitement of march on shore with adventure of sort encounter with french indian ally seemed delightful to tar upon following day ship arrived from england hour afterwards order be passed forward that first lieutenant wanted james walsham upon quarterdeck walsham said order have just come from admiralty for discharge be to have passage in first ship returning if choose to take be sorry be leaving ship for have noticed that show great

occur of distinguishing at same time sighed a thought that must now return take up profession for mother have intended quarter of hour later however ship corporal came round distributed mail james to delight found there be three letter for tore open that from mother began by gently upbraiding for getting mixed up in fight between smuggler revenue men in next place dear boy said must scold even

something of world inclose bank note for hundred pound so that if like can stay for few week month in colony then take passage home from new york boston by time too talk about affair with smuggler

felt when be first missed be glad indeed said when letter be received from richard horton saying that be on board thetis mr wilks tell be abominably spiteful letter be sure squire think so too from tone in spoke afternoon about nephew can quite forgive for if have not be for letter must not have known what have become of many month might have passed before might have heard from in america a be only four five day have be lost squire be writing tonight to obtain discharge assures there will be difficulty about squire be very cordial letter too enclosed note for hundred pound mr wilks tell

sidmouth tell frankly when write what must like be of course too old for royal navy if like to enter merchant service have doubt must arrange with shipping firm in bristol must take care by time get to be captain must also be part owner of ship if on other hand must like to enter army seems to that there be stirring time approaching think that through one other of friend in london must obtain

never otherwise have freed must not be angry with said for having betrayed confidence told truth to mother did in order to console by showing that thing be after for best must say that madam took news in very best spirit be sure will see by letter to there be one honour esteem more than do be sure all along that be making mistake in not telling frankly what wish be now have got roving commission for time will be own fault if make best of there be likely to be exciting time in colony be not lad take for if dawdle away time in town instead of seeing what be going on in forest letter filled james with delight without hour delay sat down to answer in letter to squire thanked most warmly for kindness said that above thing must like commission in army wrote very tender affectionate letter to mother telling how much felt goodness in so promptly relinquishing own plan in allowing to choose life liked thank aggie concluded for message sent by give love let forget to old soldier wrote

enemy against invisible foe like present be virginian alone be equal to emergency at once adopted familiar forest tactic taking post behind tree began to fight indian in own way have braddock be man of judgment temper fortune of day might yet have be retrieved for virginian must have checked indian until english troop be rallied prepared to meet difficulty to braddock idea of men fighting behind tree be at once cowardly opposed to military discipline dashed forward on horse with fierce oath ordered virginian to form line body of however under captain waggoner made dash for huge fallen tree far out towards lurking place of indian crouching behind opened fire upon regular seeing smoke among bush took for enemy firing killed many forced rest to return few of soldier tried to imitate indian

have not seen single indian discharged gun aimlessly among tree be half stupefied now with terror confusion of scene rain of bullet wild yell burst ceaselessly from savage foeman while horse wild with terror wound added to confusion by dashing madly hither braddock behaved with furious intrepidity dashed hither thither shouting storming at men striving to get in order to lead to attack enemy four horse be one after other shot under officer behaved with equal courage self devotion in vain attempted to lead on men sometimes advancing in party towards indian in hope that soldier must follow sir

unharmed james have be riding by side of washington when fight began followed closely a galloped among troop trying to rally lead forward washington horse be pierced by ball staggering fell james leaped from horse gave to colonel then seeing that there be nothing for to do withdrew short distance from crowd of soldier crouched down between trunk of two great tree growing close to other one of protected for most part from fire of indian other from not le dangerous fire of english presently seeing soldier fall at short distance from ran out picked up musket cartridge box began to fire at bush where puff of smoke showed that men be in hiding after three hour passive endurance of terrible fire braddock seeing that be lost commanded retreat such officer a be left strove to draw off soldier in semblance of order at moment bullet struck passing through arm penetrated lung fell from horse demanded to be left where lay captain stewart of virginian one of men bore between to rear soldier have now spent ammunition longer kept in place by general broke away in wild panic washington second horse have now be shot a trying to check men passed tree where james have taken up position latter joined in vain washington other officer tried to rally men at ford dashed across wild with fear leaving wounded comrade cannon baggage military chest prey to indian fortunately only about fifty of indian followed a far a ford rest being occupied in killing wounded scalping dead duma who have now twenty frenchman left fell back to fort remnant of braddock force continued flight unmolested chapter fight at lake george fortunate be for remnant of braddock force that indian be too much occupied in gathering abundant harvest of scalp too anxious to return to fort to exhibit trophy of bravery to press on in pursuit for have done so few indeed of panic stricken fugitive must ever have lived to tell tale night continued flight expecting moment to hear dreaded war whoop burst out again in wood round colonel washington have be ordered by dying general to press on on horseback to camp of dunbar to tell to forward waggon provision ammunition panic have seized main force have already be spread by flying teamster to dunbar camp many soldier waggoner at once took flight panic be heightened when remnant of braddock force arrived there be reason to suppose that be pursued even have be so force be ample to repel attack must be made upon probably commander saw that in present state of utter demoralization must not be trusted to fight that first indian war whoop must start again in flight still be clear that retreat must leave whole border open to ravage of indian colonel dunbar be greatly blamed for course took hundred waggon be burned cannon shell burst barrel of powder emptied into stream store of provision scattered through wood then force began retreat over mountain to fort cumberland sixty mile away general braddock died day that retreat began last word be will know better how to deal with next time news of disaster came like thunderbolt upon colonist success have be regarded a certain news that fourteen hundred english troop have be utterly routed by body of french indian of strength seemed almost incredible only consolation be that hundred fifty virginian who have accompanied regular have a be acknowledged by english officer fought with greatest bravery have kept coolness presence of mind till last on shadow of discredit of affair rested indeed be said that greater part be killed not by fire of indian by of troop who standing in mass fired in direction regardless of what be in front of colonel dunbar not satisfied with retreating to safe shelter of fort cumberland to amazement of colonist insisted upon withdrawing with own force to philadelphia leaving whole of frontier open to assault of hostile indian after waiting short time at philadelphia marched slowly on to join force operating against french in region of lake george more than two hundred mile to north took with only regular provincial regiment being under control of governor of own state washington therefore remained behind in virginia with regiment of colony blank made in braddock fight be filled up force raised to thousand strong with be to protect frontier of three hundred fifty mile long against active enterprising foe more numerous than who acting on other side of mountain in shade of deep forest must choose own time of attack launch suddenly upon village throughout whole length of frontier be troop at disposal material commander must wish to have in hand individually be brave being recruited among poor white most turbulent troublesome part of population be wholly unamenable to discipline washington have mean for enforcing applied to house of assembly to pas law enabling to punish disobedience for month hesitated to pas such ordinance on excuse that must trench on liberty of free white men service indeed be most unpopular washington whose headquarters be at winchester must hing to assist settlement on border officer be a unruly a men be further hampered by having to comply with order of governor dinwiddie at williamsburg two hundred mile away what do mean to do have asked james walsham day that beaten army arrived at fort cumberland know james said certainly will not continue with dunbar who seems to to be acting like coward do wish to go into action with regular again not at least until have be taught that if be to fight indian successfully in forest must abandon tradition of drill must fight in indian fashion must like to stay with if will allow must be very glad to have with washington said think that will see much action here will be war of foray indian will pounce upon village solitary farm house murder scalp inhabitant burn building to ground in hour be far away beyond reach of pursuit can do be to occupy chief road by can advance into heart of colony people of settlement lying west of must perforce abandon homestead fly east until be strong enough to again take up offensive be in place must at once take horse ride north will then be in plenty of time if inclined to join in expedition against french on fort george in be going to march on niagara fancy former will be ready first will find thing better managed there than here colonist in part have for many year be accustomed to indian fighting will not be hampered by having regular troop with whose officer only idea of warfare be to keep men standing in line a target for enemy there be many body of experienced scout to can attach will see that white men can beat indian at own game although sorry to leave young virginian officer james walsham thought that must not do better than follow advice accordingly next day having procured horse set off to join column destined to operate on lake prevision of washington be shortly realized cloud of red warrior descended on border settlement carrying murder rapine ruin before

colonist on frontier held sin to fight above to fight with indian a long a be free from danger turned deaf ear to tale of massacre to pitiful cry for aid came from frontier even greater than objection to war be passion of resistance to representative of royalty governor petition after petition came from border for arm ammunition for militia law to enable people to organize defend quaker resisted declaring that braddock defeat be just judgment upon soldier for molesting french in settlement in ohio passed indeed bill for raising fifty thousand pound for king use affixed to condition to knew

against four thousand frontiersman started on march to philadelphia to compel to take measure for defence body of massacred men be brought from frontier village paraded through town so threatening became aspect of population that assembly of quaker be at last obliged to pas militia law be however absolutely useless one specially excepted quaker from service constrained nobody declared lawful for such a chose to form into company to elect officer by ballot company officer might if saw fit elect also by ballot colonel lieutenant colonel major last might then in conjunction with governor frame article of war to however officer man be to be subjected unless after three day consideration subscribed in presence of justice of peace declared willingness to be bound by mockery of bill drawn by benjamin franklin while savage be raging in colony smoke of hundred village be ascending to sky be received with indignation by people rose to such height that assembly must have yielded unconditionally have not circumstance occurred gave decent pretext for retreat governor informed that have just received letter from proprietor a penn heir be called giving to province five thousand pound to aid in defence on condition that money must be accepted a free gift not a proportion of tax be might be laid by assembly thereupon assembly struck out clause taxing proprietory estate governor signed bill small force be then raised enabled indian to be to extent kept in check there be safety for unhappy settler in west of pennsylvania during next three year while french from

table on line of march officer who happened to pas by be invited to share be contrast indeed to discipline have prevailed in braddock column james felt a if be starting upon great picnic rather than upon arduous march against superior force after hesitation a to course army must take be resolved to march for lake george gang of axemen be sent to hew way on th men marched for lake while colonel blanchard of new hampshire remained with to finish defend fort lyman march be made in leisurely manner force took two day to traverse fourteen mile between fort lyman lake be now in country hitherto

of repeating defeat of braddock believing assertion of canadian that colonial militia be contemptible determined to attack early in morning column moved along road towards lake when within four mile of johnson camp entered rugged valley on right be gorge hidden in bush beyond rose rocky height of french mountain on left rose gradually slope of west mountain ground be thickly covered with thicket

one towards fort lyman other to catch enemy in retreat hendrick chief of mohawk expressed strong disapproval of plan accordingly be resolved that thousand men must go a one body hendrick still disapproved of plan nevertheless resolved to accompany column mounting on gun carriage harangued warrior with passionate eloquence at once prepared to accompany be too old fat to go on foot general lent horse mounted took place at head of column colonel williams be in command with lieutenant colonel whiting a second have idea of meeting enemy near camp moved forward so carelessly that not single scout be thrown out in front flank sharp eye of old indian chief be first to detect sign of enemy almost at same moment gun be fired from bush be said that iroquois seeing mohawk who be allied tribe

shouting yelling colonel whiting however bravely rallied portion of williams regiment aided by of mohawk by detachment johnson sent out to aid covered retreat fighting behind tree like indian falling back in good order with face to enemy so stern obstinate be resistance that french halted three quarter of mile from camp have inflicted heavy blow have altogether failed in obtaining complete success

of veteran officer saint pierre who commanded who have be killed in fight at length however persuaded to move forward regular leading way james walsham have not accompanied column be sitting at breakfast with general johnson on stump of tree in front of tent when on still air rattling sound broke out musketry be general exclamation instantaneous change came over camp sound of laughing talking be hushed man stopped at work louder louder swelled distant sound until shot must no longer be distinguished apart rattle have become steady roll be regular engagement general exclaimed enemy must be in force must have attacked williams column general johnson ordered one of orderly to mount ride out at full speed see what be going on quarter of hour passed one returned to work men stood in

be lost let axemen fell tree lay end to end to make breastwork rest of range waggon in line behind lay boat up in interval carry line from swamp on right there to slope of hill in instant camp be scene of animation forest resounded with stroke of axe shout of men a dragged waggon to position be fool johnson exclaimed not to fortify camp before who must have supposed that french must have come down from crown point to attack here in few minute terror stricken men white indian arrived at run through forest reported that have be attacked surprised by great force in forest that hendrick colonel williams be killed number of men shot down reported that be lost heavy roll of fire in distance contradicted word showed that portion of column at least be fighting sternly steadily though sound indicated that be falling back two hundred men have already be despatched to assistance only effect of news be to redouble effort of rest soon party arrived carrying wounded be not until hour half after engagement began that main body of column be seen marching in good order back through forest by time hasty defence be well nigh completed men be employed in cutting down thick brushwood outside so a to clear ground a far a possible so prevent enemy from stealing up under shelter to felled tree three cannon be planted to sweep road descended through pine be dragged up to ridge of hill two hundred fifty men be now placed on flank of camp main body stood behind waggon lay flat behind log boat massachusetts men on right connecticut men on left now lad johnson shouted in cheery voice have got to fight remember if get inside not one of will ever go back to family to tell tale while if fight bravely will beat back sure enough in few minute rank of white coated soldier must be seen moving down road with bayonet showing between bough at same time indian war whoop rose loud in forest then dark form must be seen bounding down slope through tree towards camp in throng there be movement of uneasiness among young rustic few of whom ever heard shot fired in anger before morning officer standing pistol in hand threatened to shoot man who moved from position must dieskau have launched whole force at once upon camp at moment must probably have carried be powerless to do regular troop be well in hand mob of canadian indian be scattered through forest shouting yelling firing from behind tree thought however that if led regular to attack others must come forward therefore gave word for advance french soldier advanced steadily until tree grew thinner be deployed into line opened fire in regular volley scarcely have done so however when captain eyre who commanded artillery opened upon with grape from three gun while from waggon boat fallen log musketry fire flashed out hot bitter reeling under shower of iron lead french line broke up soldier took shelter behind tree thence returned fire of defender johnson received flesh wound in thigh retired to tent where spent rest of day lyman took command to credit of victory be entirely due for four hour combat raged young soldier have soon got over first uneasiness fought a steadily coolly a veteran musketry fire be unbroken from tree bush rock rifle flashed out leaden hail flew in storm over camp cut leaf in shower from forest through lyman moved to fro among men directing encouraging cheering on escaping a by miracle ball whistled round save indian on english side not man be engaged waggoner taking gun joining in fight mohawk however held aloof saying that have come to see english brother fight animated doubt with idea that if abstained from taking part in fray day went against english friend iroquois must not harm french indian worked round on to high ground beyond swamp on left fire thence took defender in flank captain eyre speedily turned gun in direction few well directed shell soon drove indian from vantage ground dieskau directed first attack against left centre connecticut men fought so stoutly that next tried to force right where massachusetts regiment of titcomb ruggles williams held line for hour strove hard to break way through intrenchment massachusetts men stood firm although titcomb be killed loss be heavy at length dieskau exposing within short range of english line be hit in leg while adjutant montreuil be dressing wound general be again hit in knee thigh have

missing be two hundred sixty two for most part killed in ambush in morning french according to own account lost two hundred twenty eight probably exceeded four hundred principal portion of whom be regular for indian canadian kept so well under cover that provincial behind log be able to inflict little loss on other have johnson followed up success might have reached south bay before french in case whole of dieskau column must have fallen into hand did press forward against ticonderoga might easily have captured for ten day nothing be done except to fortify camp when at end of time thought of advancing against ticonderoga french have already fortified place so strongly that be able to defy attack colonist sent large reinforcement season be getting late after keeping army stationary until end of november troop having suffered terribly from cold exposure became almost mutinous be finally marched back to albany small detachment being left to hold fort by lake be now christened fort

in trap will stow away then take place in middle of boat here be paddle for when begin to feel comfortable can start to try with easy gentle to begin with must lay in when get near where may expect that redskin may be in wood for splash of paddle might cost scalp james took seat in middle of boat jonathan be behind nat handled paddle in bow there be brief delay in starting ten boat darted noiselessly out on to lake for time james did not attempt to use paddle canoe be of birch bark so thin that seemed to that incautious movement must instantly knock hole through once under weigh be steadier than have expected james must feel bound forward with stroke of paddle when became accustomed to motion of boat raised from sitting position in bottom kneeling a others be doing began to dip paddle quietly in water in time with stroke familiarity with rowing rendered easy for to keep time swing ere long found putting considerable amount of force into stroke nat looked back over shoulder well done young be first rate for beginner make deal of difference on arm others be paddling three though jonathan have beaten three before now when scalp depended on doing so make difference in work whether have sitter to take along extra paddle going be falling dusk when boat started be by time quite dark scarce word be heard in ten canoe a keeping near right hand shore of lake glided rapidly along in close body so noiselessly be paddle dipped into water that drip from a be lifted be only sound heard four hour steady paddling took to narrow about five twenty mile from starting point here on whispered order of nat james laid in paddle for careful a be occasionally made slight splash a put in water canoe now kept in single file almost under tree on right bank for lake be here scarce mile across watchful eye might be on lookout on shore to left ten mile be passed then canoe be steered in to shore gun blanket bundle be lifted out canoe raised on shoulder of men carried couple of hundred yard among tree then with scarcely word spoken man rolled in blanket lay down to sleep four being sent out a scout in various direction soon after daybreak be on foot again although have be arranged that move must be made till night set in fire be lighted for have brought with supply of biscuit dry deer flesh sufficient for week how did get on yesterday captain rogers asked a came up to spot where james have just risen to foot first rate captain nat answered for hardly believed that young fellow must have handled paddle so well at first attempt rowed way except just narrow though say a be noiseless did wonderfully well came along with rest a easy a may be thought heard little splash now then captain said smiling be very slight must do harm where lake be two three mile wide a be here will have to lay in paddle when get near other end for side narrow in there redskin must hear fish jump mile away during day men passed time in sleep in mending clothes in talking quietly together use of tea have not yet become general in america meal be washed down with water drawn from lake where over hanging bush shaded shore from sight of anyone on opposite bank mixed with rum from gourd scout carried nat spent time in pointing out to james sign by hunter found way through forest by moss lichen growing more thickly on side of trunk of tree opposed to course of prevailing wind by slight inclination of upper bough of tree in same direction old woodsman can tell said on darkest night on running hand round trunk of tree by feel of bark be north south must be long before can get to such nicety a if keep eye open a go along look at sign on trunk be just a plain when once know a mark on man face will be able to make way through wood in daytime of course when sun be shining get help for although be not often gleam come down through leaf sometimes come upon little patch be sure now then to strike on gap where tree have fallen give line again great help to young beginner be sun for young hand in wood get confused doubt sign of tree in course when come on patch of sunlight ca make mistake nohow a to direction james indulged in silent hope that if be ever lost in wood sun must be shining for look a earnestly a must must not perceive sign appeared so plain distinct to scout occasionally indeed fancied that there be slight difference between one side of trunk other be by mean sure that even in case must have noticed unless have be pointed out to while in greater part of tree must discern difference whatever be just habit lad nat said encouragingly to there be just a much difference between one side of tree other a there be between two men face come of practice now just look at root of tree see on one side run pretty nigh straight out from trunk while from other go down deep into ground speaks for tree have thrown out root to claw into ground get hold on side from wind come while on other side having such occasion have dipped root down to look for moisture food yes do see that james said that be easy enough to make out next tree next a far a see others seem to have difference in root one side other be so scout replied see be younger tree than be like enough did not grow under same circumstance when few tree fall small clearing be made by gale young tree grow up be well sheltered from wind by forest want to throw out root to hold up when great clearing have be made by fire other cause tree a grow up together have shelter must stretch out root to steady sometimes will find tree for long distance with root like sometimes only one tree among number perhaps when started that tree have more room deeper soil grew faster than rest got head above so felt wind more have to throw out root to steady while others growing same height did not need to do so thank james said understand now will bear in mind be very interesting must like above thing to be able to read sign of wood a do will come lad be sort of second nature thing be gift redskin think just a wonderful that white man must be able to take up piece of paper covered with black mark to read off sense out of a do that must be able to read mark sign of wood can see a plain a if man be still standing on mark of footprint can tell if be made by warrior squaw how long have passed by whether be walking fast slow while ordinary white man might go down on hand knee stare at ground must be able to see slightest sign mark for white man eye be good be not patch on redskin have lived among wood since be boy even now redskin lad can pick up trail follow when look a will ca see a blade of grass have be bruised no thing be partly natur partly practice practice will do lot for white man wo take up to redskin natur not until night have fallen did party again launch canoe on lake then paddled for several hour until a james imagined have traversed greater distance by mile than have made on previous evening knew from what have learned during day that be to land six mile below point where lake george join lake champlain where on opposite side on promontory stretching into lake french be constructing new fort canoe be to be carried seven eight mile through wood across neck of land between two lake be then to be launched again on lake champlain so that by following east shore of lake must pas ticonderoga at safe distance halt be made a noiselessly a before having hauled up canoe men slept till daybreak then lifting light craft on shoulder started for journey through wood be toilsome work for ground be rough broken often thickly covered with underwood ridge have to be crossed deep ravine passed although canoe be not heavy greatest care have to be exercised for graze against projecting bough edge of rock must suffice to tear hole in thin bark be not until late in afternoon that arrived on shore of lake champlain fire be lighted now greatest care being taken to select perfectly dry stick for iroquois be likely to be scattered far wide among wood risk however be far le than when in sight of french side of lake george after darkness fell canoe be again placed in water striking across lake followed right hand shore after paddling for about hour half work suddenly ceased lake seemed to widen on left for have just passed tongue of land between two lake on opposite shore number of fire be seen burning brightly on hillside be ticonderoga be now abreast of advanced post of french lingered for time before paddle be again dipped in water counting fire making careful note of position paddled on again until twelve mile beyond fort then crossed lake landed on french shore canoe did not approach shore together a have done on previous night halted mile out captain rogers went forward with own canoe landed be not for hour that signal be given by imitation of croaking of frog that careful search have ascertained forest to be untenanted landing safe sooner be signal given than canoe be set in motion be soon safely hauled up on shore five men went out a usual a scout rest fatigued by paddle hard day work be soon asleep in morning be about to start rogers ordered canoe to be hauled up hidden among bush where having done work must for present be abandoned to be recovered made useful on future occasion men charged with work gave sudden exclamation when reached canoe what be rogers said angrily do want to bring redskin in forest upon canoe be damaged one of scout said coming up to there be general movement to canoe be lying on bank few yard distance from water edge one of have be rendered useless thin birch bark have be gashed slit piece have be cut out not one of have escaped injury be fit to take water beyond few low word exclamation of dismay not word be spoken a band gathered round canoe who be on watch on side rogers asked nat jonathan took first half of night one of scout said williams relieved a four be men of greatest skill experience rogers felt sure that neglect carelessness on part must have led to disaster did of see passing boat hear sound on lake four men who have be on guard replied in negative will swear one landed near canoe nat said there be glimmer on water night canoe must not have possibly come near bank anywheres here without seeing then must have come from land side rogers said skulking indian must have seen out on lake have hidden up when landed may have be in tree overhead time directly canoe be hauled up may have damaged made off there be time to be lost lad be five hour since landed if started at once redskin may be round now be question now of scouting round french fort be one of saving scalp how must have be done james walsham asked nat in low tone be sleeping within few yard of canoe of men be close to must have thought must have heard heard hunter said contemptuously why redskin must make more noise in cutting hole gash than must in cutting hunk of deer flesh for dinner must lie on ground wriggle from one to like eel reckon did begin till camp be still canoe be hauled up till have sarched wood a thought then be moving about close by till lay down be standing theer on water edge not six foot away from canoe never moved for two hour quiet a redskin may be must have taken time to do damage so a never heard sound a loud a falling of leaf reckon a be at very least two hour over job may have be gone four hour bit over not more that give much of start must take hour half to get to fort then must have to report to french chap in command then there might be talk before set out with redskin leaving french to follow be use thinking of mending canoe suppose james asked hunter shook head must take two three hour to get fresh bark mend hole said have got a many minute to spare there now be off while have be speaking rogers have be holding consultation with two three of most experienced follower have arrived at pretty nearly same conclusion a of rogers namely that indian have probably taken two three hour in damaging canoe getting fairly away into forest that even if have done so iroquois must be up in course of hour let man pack share of meat on back rogers said leave scrap behind quick lad there be not minute to be lost be case of leg now there be hiding trail of thirty men from redskin eye in couple of minute be ready for start rogers at once led way at long slinging trot straight back from lake first saying pick way lad tread on fallen stick there be just one chance of saving scalp only one depends upon silence a james ran along at heel of nat be struck with strangeness of scene noiselessness with band of moccasin footed men flitted among tree not word be spoken have implicit confidence in leader most experienced bush fighter on frontier knew that if anyone must lead safe from peril surrounded be rogers james wondered what plan must be seemed certain to that indian must sooner later overtake must be aware of strength of band confiding in superior number must be able to push forward in pursuit without pausing for many precaution once overtaken band must stand at bay even must hold indian in check sound of firing must soon bring french soldier to spot have be gone twenty minute only when distant war whoop rose in forest behind have come down on camp nat said glancing round over shoulder find have left expect hung about little before ventured in knowing a must be expecting when found canoe be useless that war whoop tell a have gone will gather there then be after like pack of hound ah be thought captain be up to rogers have turned sharp to left direction in ticonderoga stood slacked down speed somewhat for perspiration be streaming down face even of trained hardy follower from time to time looked round to see that be keeping well together although in such emergency a none thought of questioning judgment of leader many of be wondering at unusual speed at be leading along have two mile start of pursuer have evening be at hand must have understood importance of keeping ahead until darkness came on to cover trail with whole day before felt that must be overtaken sooner later must not see object of exhausting strength before struggle began a ran on at somewhat slower pace now idea a to leader intention dawned upon most of scout who saw by direction be taking that must again strike lake shore near french fort nat who light wiry be running easily while many of comrade be panting with exertion be now by side of james walsham give rifle lad for bit be new to work weight of gun take out of have got nine ten mile before yet can hold on for bit james replied be getting wind better now why only ten mile must be seventy away from fort must never get there nat said few of might do redskin must be on in hour two thought when started a captain must have told to scatter so a to give of chance of getting off see plan now be only one a there be give real chance be making straight for french fort reckons doubt a best part of french troop will have marched out after redskin there must surely be enough left james said to hold fort against even if must take must not hold hour when came up ai thinking of fort boy be thinking of boat know a have lot of there if can get there few minute before redskin overtake may get off safe be chance think be good one others have caught leader idea repeated to comrade animating effect soon showed in increased speed with party hurried through forest before almost man have thought case hopeless have deemed that have only to continue flight until overtaken by redskin that must sooner later succumb to rifle of iroquois french ally prospect that after hour run mean of escape might be found animated man to renewed effort after running for distance longer rogers suddenly halted held up hand band simultaneously came to halt at first nothing must be heard save own quick breathing then confused noise be heard to left front deep trampling sound of voice occasional clash of arm be french column coming out nat whispered a rogers swerving somewhat to right making sign that must run a silently a possible continued course chapter commission presently noise made by column of french troop be heard abreast of fugitive then died away behind again directed course to left ten minute later heard loud succession of indian whoop knew that redskin pursuing have also heard french column on march must be warning of course band be taking scout be now four mile from ticonderoga man knew that be mere question of speed throw away meat rogers ordered will not want now pound tell men have already got rid of blanket be now burdened only with rifle ammunition ground be rough broken for be nearing steep promontory on french fort have be erected be still mile ahead of pursuer although latter have gained that distance upon since first start scout knew that now be exerting to utmost redskin must be gaining little upon for trained white man be in point of speed endurance fairly match for average indian have now descended to within short distance of edge of lake in order to avoid valley ravine running down from hill war whoop rose frequently in forest behind indian yelling to give at fort notice that chase be approaching if there war redskin left at fort nat said to james must guess what game be expect redskin started out on hunt french soldier when hear yelling wo know what to make of if do anything will shut up in fort great a be exertion scout be making must tell by sound of war whoop that at least of indian be gaining upon accustomed a man of party be to fatigue of forest strain be telling upon now for twelve mile have run almost at top of speed short panting breath set face reeling step showed that be nearly at end of power still held on with scarcely diminishing of speed man knew that if fell must die for comrade must hing for pause be possible until boat be gained be passing now under french work for must hear shouting on high ground to right knew that troop left in fort have taken alarm be still invisible for be only at point of promontory that clearing have be carried down to water edge low cry of relief burst from men a saw forest open before minute later be running along in open near shore of lake at extremity of promontory where hauled up upon shore lay number of canoe flat bottomed boat used for conveyance of troop number of boatman be standing near evidently alarmed by war cry in wood when saw party approaching at once made for fort quarter of mile away on high ground almost at same moment dropping fire of musketry opened from entrenchment smash canoe rogers said setting example by administering vigorous kick to one of others followed example in few second one of frail bark be stove in two of boat will hold well rogers said quick into water with out with oar ten row in boat let other five handle rifle keep back indian a come up never mind soldier for white coated troop perceiving scout intention be now pouring out from intrenchment couple of minute sufficed for men to launch boat take seat oar dipped in water just a three four indian dashed out from edge of forest have won race by three minute rogers said exultantly stretch to oar lad get out of range a soon a can indian began to fire a soon a perceived boat be scarcely two hundred yard away like white men be panting with fatigue bullet flew harmlessly by answer yet rogers ordered a of scout be preparing to fire wait till hand get steady then fire at french there wo be many of redskin up yet boat be not two hundred yard from shore when french soldier reached edge of water opened fire at distance weapon be of little avail though bullet splashed thickly around boat one be injured while several of french be seen to drop from fire of scout hundred yard boat be beyond danger save from chance shot indian still continued firing several of shot struck boat one of rower being hit on shoulder lay in rifle man other two oar in boat rogers said french be launching of bateaux have got fair start wo overtake before reach opposite point be fresher than be soldier be good rowing besides be sure to crowd boat so that wo have chance five six boat crowded with men started in pursuit be fully mile behind when two english boat reached shore now be turn rogers said a men leaping ashore took place behind tree a soon a french boat came within range steady fire be opened upon confusion be at once apparent among oar be seen to drop a fire continued rowing ceased minute boat be turned be soon rowing out again into lake there be end of rogers said close shave have be well youngster what do think of first scout in wood have be sharper than bargained for james said laughing be pretty near being last a well a first if have be for taking to boat think many of must have got back to fort henry to tell tale there be generally way out of mess rogers said if one doe think of if have not thought of french boat must have scattered few of must have be overtaken doubt even indian can not follow single trail a fast a man can run reckon most of must have carried scalp back to camp still with wood full of iroquois must have have of hate losing man if can be helped be well out of now lad have better be tramping there be lot more bateaux coming out expect by rowing be manned by indian redskin be first rate hand with paddle be good with oar man who have be hit in shoulder have already have wound bandaged there be minute consultation a to whether must continue journey in boat of men pointing out that have proved faster than pursuer may be rogers say indian will land follow along shore will soon get ahead of for can travel quicker than can row for aught know there may be whole fleet of canoe higher up lake george must cut off lad safest way be to keep on through wood decision be received without question party at once started at swinging trot be kept up with occasional interval of walking throughout day at course be changed after journeying two three mile halt be called for rogers be sure that indian must abandon pursuit when night came on without having overtaken fugitive before daybreak march be continued in afternoon party arrived at fort william henry james now determined to leave force return at once to new york where letter be to be addressed to took with letter from general johnson speaking in warmest tone of conduct on arriving at new york found at post office there great pile of letter awaiting have be written after receipt of letter at end of july telling at home of share in braddock disaster little thought boy mother wrote when received letter saying that have got discharge from ship be going with expedition against french that be going to run into such terrible danger fortunately same vessel brought news of general braddock defeat also brought letter learned news only few hour before letter reached be a may imagine time of terrible anxiety to squire aggie be almost a anxious a be mr wilks did best to cheer must see that too felt very greatly however when letter came be made happy again though of course can not be anxious a say be just going to join expedition still must hope that will do better a wo be managed by regular soldier mr wilks be quite angry at what said about folly of making men stand in line to be shot at think so much of drill discipline squire have be arguing quite fiercely about squire get best of argument for dreadful way in soldier be slaughtered show that though sort of fighting may be good in other place be not suited for fighting wicked indian in wood squire have be up to london about commission have arranged have a will tell in letter got commission in regiment commanded by colonel otway be to go out next spring be introduced to commander in chief by friend told that have be acting a colonel washington aide de camp with general braddock that have now gone to join general johnson army so duke said that though must be gazetted at once must belong to regiment might a well stay out there see service until arrived that must be great advantage to regiment to have officer with experience in indian fighting with cried when brought back news for have hoped to have back again with for bit before went soldiering for good however squire seems to think be capital thing for mr wilks think so too so suppose must put up with aggie agrees with say be too bad that must never have seen once from time when saw in storm be dear little girl be growing fast think must have grown quite inch in five month have be away sends love to say must take care of yourself for sake squire in letter repeated news mr walsham have given be now ensign said if go into more fight before regiment arrives must mr wilks said get proper uniform made for fight a king officer send copy of gazette where will see name mr wilks letter be long one felt horribly guilty dear jim said when news came of braddock dreadful defeat must hardly look dear mother in face though kind lady must not know say word to hurt feeling for world yet must see that regarded a monster for be on advice that instead of coming home when got discharge remained out there took part in unfortunate expedition must see aggie felt same though did best to keep up spirit have terrible time of until letter arrived saying be safe if have not come do believe must have gone quietly off to exeter hunted up box again hired boy to push for for be not so strong a be must rather have tramped about for rest of life than remain there under mother reproachful eye however thank god came through right after such lesson must hope that will never have repetition of such disaster a that a old soldier can not agree with what say about uselessness of drill even for fighting in forest must accustom men to listen to voice of officer to obey order promptly quickly can not think that if troop have gone forward at brisk double must have driven indian before a to whooping yell talk so much about must think nothing of be more to be regarded than shriek of woman braying of donkey james smiled a read thought that if old soldier have heard that chaos of blood curdling cry break out in still depth of forest must not write of with such equanimity will have heard from squire that be gazetted to otway regiment with others be to cross atlantic in few week when be generally supposed war will be formally declared experience will be of great use to ought to get good staff appointment expect that in course of year there will be fighting on large scale on side of water english ought to get best of for france seems at present to be thinking great deal more of affair in europe than of colony in america so much better for if can take canada will strike heavy blow to trade day north america be going to be important place in world letter have be lying there several week james knew that otway regiment have with others arrived few day before have already marched for albany thinking entitled to little rest after labour remained for week in new york while uniform be being made then took passage in trading boat up to albany scarcely have landed when young officer in same uniform met looked surprised hesitated then stopped see belong to regiment said have just arrived from england what ship did come in have be out here time james replied name be walsham believe be gazetted to regiment month ago only heard news on arrival at new york last week oh be walsham young officer said name be edward be glad to meet have be wondering when must join envying luck in seeing so much of fighting out here regiment be encamped about mile from here if will let will go back with introduce to fellow james thanked two walked along talking together james learned that there be already five ensign junior to new acquaintance being one of a regiment have be somewhat short of officer vacancy have be filled up shortly before sailed of course must call on colonel first mr edward said be capital fellow very much liked in regiment colonel otway received james with great cordiality be very glad to get with mr walsham said consider credit to regiment to have young officer who have be three time mentioned in despatch will too be great service to will be able to give good many hint a to indian method of fighting braddock men found so terrible be not formidable sir when be accustomed to unfortunately general braddock forced men to fight in regular fashion be to stand up be shot at that mode of fighting in wood be fatal hundred redskin must be more than match in forest for ten time number of white troop who persisted in fighting in such ridiculous way fighting in own way white men be match for redskin indeed frontiersman can thrash indian even if be two three to one against have be in last affair on lake have not mr walsham heard be with johnson yes sir be at beginning be very nearly repetition of braddock disaster after being surprised at first beaten column went out made stout fight of that gave time to put camp in state of defence have indian made rush think must have carried a contented with keeping up distant fire provincial who be young troop quite unaccustomed to fighting wholly without drill discipline gradually got steady at length sallied out beat decisively will not detain now colonel said hope ere long will give full detailed account of fighting have be in with idea of best way of training regular troop for sort of work have before mr edward will take over to mess introduce to brother officer james be well received by officer of regiment soon found perfectly at home with have to devote hour day to acquiring mystery of drill be to somewhat funny to see pain expended in assuring that movement must be performed with mechanical accuracy understood that although useless for such warfare a have before great accuracy in detail be necessary for ensuring uniformity of movement among large mass of men in open country otherwise time passed very pleasantly james soon became favourite in regiment young officer be never tired of questioning concerning redskin manner of fighting there be plenty of amusement snow be deep on ground now officer skated practised with snowshoe drove in sleigh occasionally got up dance people of albany settler round vied with other in hospitality to officer one day in february orderly brought message to james walsham that colonel wished to speak to walsham said may tell privately that regiment be likely to form part of expedition be being fitted out in england against louisbourg in cape breton key of canada considerable number of troop from province will accompany will leave frontier here altogether open to enemy james said in surprise be own opinion walsham louisbourg be altogether outside range of present struggle seems to that british force must be employed at striking at vital point however be not to purpose be earl of loudon plan however be manifest a say that frontier will be left terribly open therefore two company of of regiment going will be left naturally a be only officer in regiment who have have experience in forest warfare must be one of left here a ensign must not have much influence think that must be at once more useful to service more pleasant for if can obtain for something like roving commission what do think of must greatly prefer that sir james said gratefully general be little vexed know colonel went on at numerous success daring feat gained by rogers other leader of company of scout while regular have not have opportunity to fire shot think that must at once accept proposal be to make to that company to be called royal scout must be formed of volunteer taken from various regiment that must have command thank sir james said must like above thing fear that must have chance whatever of rivalling work of rogers other partisan leader men be trained to work of wood accustomed to fight indian equally at home in canoe in forest have have a be good enough to say experience in work be mere child by side be to lead fifty english soldier in forest fear that none of must ever return yes must not propose that must engage in enterprise of sort walsham idea be that although must have independent command with very considerable freedom of action must act in connection with regular troop scout be often far away when wanted leaving post open to surprise be so impatient of discipline that be adverse to going near fort except to obtain fresh supply on contrary must act a eye of post might think threatened by enemy at present for instance fort william henry be most exposed to attack must take command there must report to major eyre who be in command a for service there letter of appointment must state that be authorized to act independently that while must be duty to obey order of commanding officer will be authorized to offer such suggestion to a experience in indian warfare must lead to make must train men a scout must be special duty to guard fort against surprise of course in case of attack to take part in defence in event of provincial scout making concerted movement against french post must be authorized to join must then have benefit of skill experience in case of success army must get share of credit what do think of plan must like above thing james replied must be precisely duty must select have choice thought so colonel said have formed very high opinion of judgment discretion from talk have have together have spoken strongly in favour to general who have promised that in event of army moving forward must have appointment on quartermaster general staff a intelligence officer since heard that main portion of army be to sail to louisbourg have be thinking plan over certainly seems to that corp such a that have suggested must be of great service must think that strength must be fifty men will of course have officer with be there anyone must like to choose a may a well take whole scheme cut dried to general must like mr edward sir be junior to in regiment be very active zealous in service must greatly like to be allowed to enlist temporarily two of scout have served with in force with power for to take discharge when wished must be of immense utility to in instructing men in new duty must add greatly to efficiency so be colonel said will draw out scheme on paper lay before general today in afternoon james be again sent for earl have approved of scheme will have temporary rank a captain given in order to place corp on equal footing with provincial corp of scout mr edward will also have temporary rank a lieutenant men of six company of three regiment will be paraded tomorrow asked for volunteer for special service if there be more than fifty offer can select own men accordingly next morning troop to be left behind be paraded order be read out saying that corp of scout for special service be to be raised that volunteer be requested upwards of hundred men stepped forward being formed in line james selected from fifty who appeared to most hardy active intelligent looking have that morning be put in order a captain of new corp have assumed insignia of temporary rank colonel have placed at disposal two intelligent young non commissioned officer next morning marched with command for fort william henry sooner have left open country entered wood than began to instruct men in new duty whole of be thrown out a skirmisher taught to advance in indian fashion man sheltering behind tree scanning wood carefully ahead then fixing eye on tree ahead to advance to at sharp run shelter there be new to soldier hitherto drilled only in solid formation in skirmishing in open when at end of ten mile skirmishing through wood be halted ordered to bivouac for night james felt that men be beginning to have idea of forest fighting men be greatly pleased with day work be welcome change after long monotony of life in standing camp day work have given high opinion of fitness of young officer for command work instruction be not over for day hitherto none of men have have experience in camping in open james now showed how to make comfortable shelter against cold with two forked stick one laid across with few bough blanket laid over with dead leaf heaped round bottom end how best to arrange fire cook food during following day same work be repeated when after week marching force issued from forest into clearing around fort william henry james felt confident that men must be able to hold own in brush with indian major eyre to whom james reported showed appointment defining authority duty expressed much satisfaction at arrival of reinforcement there be rumour brought here by scout said that strong force will ere long come down from crown point to ticonderoga that will be attacked now that lake be frozen regular troop must march without difficulty force here be very inadequate considering strength with french will attack none of officer men have experience of indian method of attack experience will be very valuable be pity that give one of company of scout permanently sometimes one other of be here often be without of provincial although have confidence in officer men one can not feel that be great disadvantage to be exposed to attack of enemy of whose tactic one be altogether ignorant will of course encamp men inside fort see have brought baggage with have spare tent here be at service thank sir james replied will be glad to put men under cover while be here intend to practise a much a possible in scouting camping in wood although will always be in neighbourhood of fort propose always to return here at night be of captain rogers corp at present at fort of came in last night major eyre replied have authority james said to enlist two of in corp major eyre smiled think will find of ready to submit to military discipline to put on red coat be accustomed to obey order promptly enough when at work james said though there be attempt at discipline when off duty see at worst here there be of course nothing like military order in wood obedience be just a prompt a among troop a to uniform agree with on head must not be particular can hardly fancy of scout buttoned tightly up with stiff collar a after although be to be enlisted will be attached to corp rather than be regular member of think need insist upon uniform after leaving major james saw to pitching of tent comfort of men when have done so strolled off towards group of scout who be watching proceeding among whom recognized two men for whom be looking received cordial greeting from who have taken part in previous adventure with captain rogers band so be in command of party nat said asked one of men just now said be captain be young to be captain at rate be good thing to have king officer here who know something about wood rest ai no more idea of than nothing want to chat to nat also to jonathan if will come across with to tent be agreeable nat said two scout walked across to tent with james lieutenant edward who shared tent with be inside arranging few thing major eyre have sent down for use edward be two scout nat jonathan of whom have often heard speak now let sit down have chat there be first rate rum in bottle nat there be two tin pannikin there be water in keg now nat went on when party be seated on blanket laid on ground corp of mine have be raised specially to act a scout round other fort may be threatened to act a advanced guard of column of troop what do know of scouting nat said contemptuously know more than child know much be active fellow ready to learn think will find already have pretty fair idea of fighting in indian fashion in wood a have authority to draw extra supply of ball cartridge hope in few week to make fair shot of have taught something of forest way will teach know want better teacher want to propose to jonathan to join corp what put on red coat choke up with stiff collar nat laughed nice figure must look captain must never do propose that must wear uniform nat have got special authority to enlist jonathan with understanding that can take discharge whenever like there will be drilling in line anything of sort will be just scouting work same a with captain rogers except that will not make long expedition a doe keep in neighbourhood of fort must want to act a scout instructor to teach men a have taught something of woodcraft how to find way in forest how

cannon on side facing lake at once opened fire with grape round shot in direction of sound after firing for few minute be silent sound on ice must no longer be heard have taken to wood nat who have taken up station next to james said ai likely must stop on ice with ball pounding up do think will attack before morning james asked ai likely nat replied wo know position dark night a must be able to make out anything about if must have come straight along ice to head of lake here must have made dash doubt now find ai to be caught asleep expect will wait till morning again sound of ax be heard in wood glare of light appeared above tree there must be tidy lot of 'em nat said do think will be use to go out try to surprise not bit captain be sure to have lot of redskin with will be lurking in wood in hope that may try move no have got strong position here can lick three to one in wood except stark men perhaps yours none of others must be no good at mayor eyre shortly afterwards sent for

george brought to english fort weak point of expedition be leader for vaudreuil who be canadian have greatest jealousy of french officer have intrusted command of expedition to brother rigaud fire did damage a garrison lay sheltered behind entrenchment replying occasionally whenever enemy mustered in force a if with intention of attacking think mean business time captain nat said in tone of disgust why there be enough of to eat if must make up mind to come on suppose be going to take william henry by blazing way at mile off perhaps be going to make night attack james said will have learned about position of work maybe so nat replied think so when chap attack at once when there be four five to one reckon that ai likely to attack at meant to surprise have seems to a have taken heart out of a evening approached fire ceased at nightfall strong guard be placed round entrenchment troop retired to quarter ready to turn out at minute notice about midnight be called out there be again sound on lake cannon at once opened a before be silent again look walsham look edward exclaimed have set fire to sloop a spoke tongue of flame started up from one of two vessel lying in ice close to shore almost simultaneously flame shot up from among boat drawn up on beach be redskin work nat exclaimed come lad james cried leaping down from low earthwork into ditch let save boat if can scout followed ran down to shore indian have done work well two sloop many of boat be well alight be evident at once that long before hole must be broken through ice bucket brought down from fort must be beyond hope of saving french too opened fire from wood bordering lake a light of flame exposed men to enemy marksman james at once called back to fort sloop boat burned out at noon next day french filed out from wood on to ice at distance of over mile now edward exclaimed surely mean to be fool enough to march across ice to attack in broad daylight look to james replied a if wanted to make full show of force see there be white flag party be coming forward officer several men advanced towards fort major eyre sent out one of officer with equal number of men to meet there be short parley when party came together then french officer advanced towards fort with english follower remaining on ice on nearing fort french officer le mercier chief of canadian artillery be blindfolded led to room where major eyre with british officer be awaiting handkerchief be then removed from eye announced to commandant that be bearer of message from officer commanding french force who being desirous of avoiding effusion of blood begged english commander to abstain from resistance against force so superior to own must be useless offered most favourable term if must surrender place peaceably said that if be driven to make assault indian ally must unquestionably massacre whole garrison major eyre quietly replied that intended to defend to utmost envoy be again blindfolded when rejoined french force latter at once advanced a if to attack place soon halted leaving ice opened fusillade from border of wood kept up for hour garrison contemptuously abstaining from reply at night french be heard advancing again sound coming from side garrison stood to arm believing that time real attack be about to be made nearer came sound garrison who must see nothing in pitchy darkness fired wherever must hear sound presently bright light burst up redskin provided with faggot of resinous stick have crept up towards building consisting of several store house hospital saw mill hut tent of ranger having placed torch against set on fire instantly retreated garrison must hing to save building a effort in absence of water must be unavailing must have be shot down by foe lying beyond circle of light therefore remained lying behind entrenchment firing wherever heard slightest sound momentarily expecting attack morning came without french advancing garrison be then able to give whole attention to saving building in fort great wood stack have now ignited burning ember fell thickly on hut for hour be only by greatest exertion that troop be able to save building from destruction moment expected to be attacked for have french advanced hut must have be left to in case garrison must have found shelterless provision store must have be consumed before noon danger be over for not only have fire begun to burn low heavy snow storm set in day continued now must be time for to attack james said to lieutenant can scarce see twenty yard away now be chance edward agreed believe in attacking ca think who have got in command ought to be shot man with force a have hanging about here for four day when must have carried place with rush moment think will attack james replied men who will stop to light fire to warm within sight of enemy fort want to surprise be not likely to venture out of shelter of blanket in such snow a day night snow came down till ground be covered to depth of over three foot early on tuesday morning twenty volunteer of french regular made bold attempt to burn sloop building on stock with several storehouse other structure near water hundred of boat canoe be ranged near succeeded in firing sloop building james with scout sallied out forced to retreat with loss of five of number by pulling down of hut prevented fire spreading next morning sun rose brightly white sheet of lake be dotted with french in full retreat for canada total loss have be eleven killed wounded while on english side seven men have be wounded slightly never be worse conducted more futile expedition after affair time passed slowly at fort william henry until sun gained strength enough to melt thick white covering of earth james practised men in use of snowshoe a soon a spring have fairly commenced resumed work of scouting be done only a exercise for there be fear that after humiliating failure french must for time to come attempt expedition against fort in autumn of general montcalm have come out from france to take command of french troop few of superior officer of french army cared to take command in country where work be hard rough little glory be to be obtained therefore minister of war be able for once to choose officer fitted for post instead of being obliged a usual to fill up appointment by court favourite marquis of montcalm be born at chateau of candiac near nimes on th of february at age of fifteen up to time have studied hard entered army two year later became captain be first under fire at siege of philipsbourg in married mademoiselle du

of brigadier general being exchanged for officer of similar rank rejoined army be again wounded by musket shot shortly afterwards peace of aix la chapelle be signed montcalm remained living quietly with family to whom be tenderly attached until informed by minister of war that have selected to command troop in north america with rank of major general chevalier de levi be appointed second in command sooner did montcalm arrive in america than difficulty arose between marquis de vaudreuil governor who have hoped to have received appointment of commander of french force who in virtue of office commanded canadian militia from first to last man opposed thwarted montcalm doing in power to injure by report to france in disfavour misfortune befell france during war be in slight degree due to divided authority to obstacle thrown in way of montcalm by governor montcalm first blow against english be struck in august six month before attack on fort william henry have be arranged by vaudreuil three battalion of regular troop with canadian indian with strong force of artillery be quietly concentrated at fort frontenac be intended for attack upon important english post of oswego fighting have be going on in neighbourhood for time be from oswego that shirley have intended to act against niagara frontenac that enterprise have fallen through owing to shirley having be deprived of command sharp fight have taken place between colonel bradstreet armed boatman french who be beaten off oswego be place of extreme importance be only english post on ontario situated a be towards southwest corner of lake so long a remained in possession be standing menace against whole line of communication of french with south owing to gross neglect fort have never be placed in really defensive condition garrison be small crippled with fever have carried off great number of remainder be ill fed discontented on th of august earl of london sent colonel webb with th regiment of bradstreet boatman to reinforce oswego must have started month before have done so must have be in time confusion misunderstanding have arisen from change in command webb have scarcely made half march when tidings of disaster met at once fell back with greatest precipitation at midnight on th montcalm have landed force within league of first english fort four cannon be at once landed battery thrown up so careless of danger be garrison that be not till morning that invader be discovered two armed vessel at once sailed down to cannonade light gun be match for heavy artillery of french be forced to retire attack be commenced without delay indian canadian swarming in forest round fort kept up hot fire upon by first parallel be marked out at yard from rampart fort ontario considered strongest of three fort at oswego stood on high plateau on right side of river where entered lake be in shape of star formed of palisade of trunk of tree set upright in ground hewn flat on side closely fitted together excellent defence against musketry worthless against artillery garrison of fort in number have eight small cannon mortar with next day kept up brisk fire against battery french be throwing up arming with twenty six piece of heavy artillery colonel mercer commandant of oswego saw at once that french artillery must a soon a opened fire blow stockade into piece thinking better to lose fort alone than fort garrison sent boat across river after garrison having spiked gun thrown ammunition into well crossed river unperceived by french oswego be in position for defence fort pepperell stood on mouth of river facing fort ontario towards west south place be protected by outer line of earthwork mounted with cannon side facing river be wholly exposed in belief that fort ontario must prevent attack in direction montcalm lost time next evening whole force set to work throwing up battery at edge of rising ground on fort ontario stood by daybreak twenty heavy gun be in position at once opened fire grape round shot swept english position smashing down mud built wall crashing through stockade carrying destruction among troop latter made shelter of pork barrel three high three deep planted cannon behind returned enemy fire canadian indian have crossed river by ford two mile up soon opened fire from side colonel mercer who have bravely led men inspired by example be cut in two by cannon shot garrison be seized with despair council of officer be held garrison surrendered a prisoner of war to number of sixteen hundred included sailor belonging to shipping labourer upwards of hundred woman have greatest difficulty in preventing indian by mean of threat promise present from massacring prisoner oswego be burned to ground fort vessel on stock destroyed place having be made desert army returned with prisoner spoil to montreal loss of oswego have inflicted very severe blow to influence prestige of england among indian of lake district be partly restored by failure of french expedition against william henry early in following spring expedition against louisbourg to strengthen western frontier have be denuded of troop proved failure great delay have taken place at home in consequence of ministerial change be not until th of may fifteen ship of line three frigate under admiral holbourne with troop on board sailed from england for halifax where loudon be to meet with force from colony while english fleet have be delaying french government have obtained information of destination have sent three french squadron across atlantic to louisbourg be th of july before united english force assembled at halifax there fresh delay arose troop nearly twelve thousand in number be landed week be spent in idle drill at beginning of august force be again embarked when sloop came in from newfoundland bringing letter have be captured on board french ship from appeared that there be twenty two ship of line besides several frigate in harbour of louisbourg that troop be in garrison in what be by far strongest fortress on continent success be now impossible enterprise be abandoned loudon with troop sailed back to new york admiral holbourne who have be joined by four additional ship sailed for louisbourg in hope that french fleet must come out fight cruised for time off port lamotte french admiral must not come out in september tremendous gale burst upon british fleet one ship be dashed on rock short distance from louisbourg only sudden shift of wind saved rest from total destruction nine be dismasted others threw cannon into sea have lamotte sailed out on following day english fleet be at mercy fortunately did not do so holbourne returned to england french in canada be aware that loudon have gathered troop at new york be preparing for expedition be to be aided by fleet from england thinking probable that be directed against most vital point in canada since occupation by english must entirely cut colony off from france montcalm be obliged to keep force in hand near town be unable to take advantage of unprotected state in loudon have left frontier of colony a soon however a by despatch received from france by statement of prisoner captured by indian on frontier montcalm learned that expedition have just left new york be destined for louisbourg be at liberty to utilize army for invasion of defenceless colony determined to commence campaign by capture of fort william henry james walsham with company of royal scout have spent spring at fort william henry loudon have at first sent order for corp to be broken up men to rejoin respective regiment to accompany on expedition earnest representation of colonel monro of th regiment who be now in command of total inadequacy of garrison to defend must serious attack be made from ticonderoga of great value to of corp under captain walsham be now thoroughly trained in forest fighting induced to countermand order james be glad that be not obliged to rejoin regiment independent command be pleasant one although life at fort william henry have since french repulse be uneventful one there be plenty of fishing in lake shooting in wood to vary monotony of drill edward be now expert canoemen often ventured far down lake taking with one other of scout keeping sharp lookout among wood on side for sign of enemy once twice be chased by indian canoe always succeeded in distancing news have just come in expedition have sailed james said a one day towards end of july entered hut now occupied with edward for corp have long since be put under hut being better suited for hot season than tent be rather nuisance edward grumbled being kept here instead of going taking share in big siege be impatient edward james replied if be not greatly mistaken will have quite a much fighting a want here before long montcalm sudden attack on oswego last autumn showed that be enterprising general have doubt that a soon a learns that loudon expedition be not intended for quebec will be beating up on frontier with vengeance montcalm indeed have already prepared to strike blow thousand indian lured by prospect of gift scalp plunder have come in from west north be encamped near montreal besides there be mission indian of five nation who adhered to france early in july movement began day after day fleet of boat canoe rowed up lake champlain towards end of month whole force be gathered at ticonderoga here be now collected eight thousand men of whom two thousand be indian representing forty one tribe sub tribe among be iroquois huron nipissings abenaki algonkin micmac malecite be nominal christian counted eight hundred warrior with be western indian ojibwa mississagas pottawattamies menomonies sac fox winnebagoes miami iowa be still unconverted french held savage ally in abhorrence drunkenness turbulence contempt of order cruelty to captive cannibalism disgusted shocked montcalm officer be powerless to restrain for without a scout guide eye in forest french must have done nothing at slightest remonstrance indian be ready to take offence to march away to distant home letter of montcalm officer to friend be full of disgust at doings of savage ally of regret that must not dispense with service restrain ferocity vaudreuil canadian on other hand accustomed to tradition of savage warfare made attempt to check ferocity of indian be indeed instigator of raid savage made upon unprotected village settlement on frontier offered reward for scalp wrote talked gleefully of horrible atrocity committed upon colonist chapter scouting on lake champlain one morning colonel monro sent for james captain walsham said there be rumour that french be gathering at crown point in considerable force captain rogers be still disabled by wound band have suffered so heavily in last affair with enemy for time be out of action be important must learn truth of rumour for if be true must communicate at once to general in order that may get together sufficient force to relieve if montcalm come down lay siege to fort will undertake business will do best sir james replied do propose must take company only picked party will leave to captain walsham want trustworthy news how obtain for matter little then will take only small party james said fifty men must be useless for purpose of fighting if enemy be numerous while with number must be hopeless to attempt to escape detection by indian fewer better for such enterprise on leaving commandant james at once summoned two hunter to hut told mission have received be ready captain be if jonathan make up party a to going trapezing about round crown point with fifty soldier thing ai to be thought of must be there more than hour before indian must know of must have show either for fighting running away captain lad be good enough for scouting about round camp here a for expedition of sort might a well start with drove of swine be just what thought nat one canoe may escape even eye of indian dozen must have chance of doing so might get up lake scout said mischief must be in wood never must do captain if go must be three of more when do think of starting sooner better nat very well captain will go get grub ready a soon a get dusk will get canoe into water suppose ca take with lieutenant edward said when james told of duty have be requested to perform be dismal here not exactly james laughed what must become of company if be to lose two officer two scout at blow edward will command during absence think will soon have more lively time here for if be true montcalm will command troop coming against will be different business altogether from last now leave alone for hour have letter to write before start will be for to send off in case come back again look serious have intention of falling into hand of montcalm savage still there be doubt expedition be risky one be just a well to be prepared just a sun be setting nat came into officer hut everything be ready captain said hope have made good dinner for be last hot meal will eat till get back have cooked enough meat for next four day be about a long a will keep good after dried deer flesh will have to do for expect tell will have to be pretty spry time if be coming down in force be sure to send lot of indian through wood on side of lake water will be swarming with canoe jonathan have be talking over trying to settle must be safest to foot way to go by water concluded a there ai much difference canoe will be quickest easiest so have best keep to plan must certainly rather go way nat if think that danger be greater think there be much difference captain at rate may a well go way like enough will have to tramp back by wood hour later canoe put out although have little fear that of indian canoe must be so far up lake george there be scarce word spoken in boat for hour after starting jonathan be always silent nat although talkative enough when in camp be man of few word when once embarked upon serious expedition a for james have little inclination for conversation enterprise be knew one of extreme danger have be only french force be about to reconnoitre even one composed of french canadian together must have thought little of knew that redskin must be roaming thickly in forest ahead of army much a relied upon skill experience of two scout knew must be difficult indeed to elude watchful eye thought of letter have be writing wondered whether must return to tear up whether must be read at home time be thinking worked paddle vigorously at high rate of speed light canoe bounded noiselessly over water impelled by three vigorous pair of arm when approached narrow connecting lake george with lake champlain boat head be directed towards shore for must not get past ticonderoga before daylight broke be likely that good watch must be kept in narrow by enemy must be dangerous to try to effect landing there canoe be carried ashore hidden in bush lay down to sleep when day broke nat rose went down to water to see that in landing have left mark upon shore might betray to eye of passing redskin going down on hand knee obliterated sign of footprint raised herbage upon have trodden cut short to ground such stalk a have bruised broken in passage then when confident that be safe returned to camp when again became dark canoe be carried down replaced in water continued passage james have at nat request laid by paddle paddle wonderfully well captain say for delicate piece of work like one ca be too careful ai often can hear paddle dip in water not once in hundred time then see once might cost scalp have got to go along a silent a duck swimming speed ai object for will be mile down lake champlain before daylight if french know business will have dozen canoe in narrow to prevent scouting on lake champlain see have got advantage of 'cause have got just to lie quiet listen have got to row on a far a seeing go can make out a soon a can make out can hear while wo give ear chance tell captain expect to get through narrow without chase for if come to running of course will take paddle again three can show heel to canoe on lake perviding of course a be only starn chase if there be three four of then say a wo be close thing james accordingly lay quietly back in boat while companion took paddle be not necessary for to look out to listen for knew that companion eye ear be quicker than own have be agreed before starting that must go along close to tree on left hand side of passage because keenest lookout must be kept on right hand side a must naturally be chosen by boat going up a being farthest from french fort there be fear whatever of being seen from land nat have said redskin must know that so well that must trouble to look out be only canoe have got to be afraid of a to be just chance might see out in light water in middle under tree ca make out thirty yard off will be lying there quiet if be there at will get past safe will pretty nigh run into be just chance there be nothing to do for to paddle a noiselessly a fish trust to luck having crossed lake to left shore entered narrow paddle be dipped so quietly into water even james must scarcely hear sound few stroke scout stopped paddling altogether sat listening intently be keeping close to tree so close that at time seemed to james that by stretching out hand must touch bush after hour paddling stopped longer than usual what be james whispered in jonathan ear for nat have taken bow paddle there be men ahead scout whispered back heard speak just now presently boat began to move again so quietly that be only by looking at dark mass of bough stretched out overhead that james knew boat be in motion jonathan now crouched in bottom of boat placed hand on nat shoulder a sign for to do same time seemed endless to james a lay there be too dark under tree for even to see outline of nat figure boat be be sure moving for occasionally a lay on back grew lighter overhead a passed under opening in tree suddenly heart gave bound nearly started for guttural voice spoke seemingly within few foot of canoe placed hand on rifle in readiness to sit up fire be still again be passing remark made by one redskin to in canoe for sound be to right long period passed then jonathan sat up took to paddle again james judged that danger be over raising head must see nothing except vague light of sheet of water on right boat be still keeping close under tree on left shore of lake lay back again dozed off to sleep be awoke by jonathan touching foot can take paddle now captain sat up at once looked round be far out now on broad sheet of water there be faint light a of fire burning low high up to left behind knew that have already passed ticonderoga be making way along lake champlain paddled for hour then landed on right hand side of lake be not likely to be disturbed here nat said a lifted canoe from water indian coming down from crown point must keep on other side of lake will make for ticonderoga will not think of keeping lookout for anyone a far down lake a be close shave with canoe nat startled when voice close to must have be within ten yard of about nat said be lucky spoke when be coming along expect have be watching for night have much idea anyone must come else must have spoken a be be easy enough to pas on dark night of course be looking outside just kept along a close a must to bush only just giving light stroke now then to take along being inside got sight of distance away knew must see sharp a eye be only chance be hearing a there be noise for to hear felt safe enough after have once caught sight of 'em saw be lying out at edge of shadow if have be close under bush a ought to have be must have be in for fight for might have seen other till boat touched let that be lesson to captain when be on lookout for canoe at night lie in among bush must pas between light then a ca see can either grapple shoot just a like if have seen must have have hot time for must hear by call right along other side that be looking out for in earnest if rifle have be fired must have have dozen canoe down upon in time like enough must have have to leave boat take to wood how far be crown point away not more than ten mile nat said be thirty mile from ticonderoga lie out on point just where champlain widens out reckon safest way tonight will be to scout along side till be well past point then to paddle out well across lake come up again land to left of crown point will then be in track of boat coming up from lower end of lake can paddle boldly on one must be keeping lookout way danger wo begin until get ashore in course then must act according to sarcumstances manoeuvre be carried out started a soon a became dark after paddling along eastern shore for nearly three hour struck out into wide lake till approached opposite shore then heading south again paddled boldly down towards spot where at end of sweep of land seemed to close in lake stood french fort of crown point before starting two scout have stripped to waist have laid aside cap fastening strip of leather round head have stuck feather into then painted face body need be particular about flourish jonathan be only redskin outline a one want to get if run against other canoe coming up lake get sight of a near shore so a look something like redskin be near enough of course can speak mohawk well enough to pas muster captain will lay down in bottom captain will do well enough for canadian when have once landed there ai much difference between hunter one side of frontier other be a well that must be seen till land le question asked better mohawk good enough with of other tribe must pas with mohawk if got into long talk with fortunately however precaution proved unnecessary other canoe be seen on lake landed unnoticed at spot mile half to west of crown point before starting from fort william henry james have laid aside uniform have dressed in hunting shirt legging similar to worn by scout have adopted various little detail in canadian hunter differed from on english side of frontier latter wore hunting shirt loose in indian fashion while canadian generally wore leathern belt outside theirs at waist cap be made of squirrel skin must pas equally well on side of frontier fire bag in tobacco tinder other small matter be carried be of indian workmanship a be cord of powder horn bullet pouch altogether get up be somewhat brighter more picturesque than of english scout who a rule despised anything approaching to ornament knew that by disguising must be liable if captured to be shot at once a spy must not be considered under circumstance to add to risk ran for in case be certain to be killed if detected must have be out of question to attempt to approach french camp in uniform of british officer must have spoken canadian french mission must have be comparatively easy knew only few word of language must be detected instant opened lip canoe be hauled up carefully concealed on land then lay down until daylight for information a to strength of enemy must be gained in dark in morning two scout very carefully made toilet have brought necessary with soon in indian hunting shirt fringed legging with carefully painted face be in position to defy keenest scrutiny when after careful survey of other felt that disguise be complete moved boldly forward accompanied by james after hour walking emerged from forest strong fort of crown point lay before be constructed of stone be capable of withstanding long siege by force must be brought against round be camp of french troop james judged from number of tent there must be french soldier there short distance away be large number of roughly constructed hut roofed with bough of tree be canadian jonathan said redskin never build shelter while on war path there be heap of redskin about indeed even at distance of several hundred yard must be easily distinguished from white ally by plumed headdress by blanket long robe of skin hung from shoulder must put down at three thousand be big army nat said must think there must be quite a many canadian a french how many redskin there be there ai no knowing may be sure that will have got together a many a must put down at that make altogether enough to eat up fort william henry to march to albany to new york if be well led take fancy to be if colonist bestir smartly well so far have found out what came to seek captain what be next thing must discover if can whether mean to go up lake in boat to march through wood james replied will have tremendous job getting gun through wood if be going by water of course can bring very well nat replied in case captain advice be stop in wood jonathan will go down past fort to shore see what provision be making in way see place swarm with canadian must be sure to be spoken to redskin talk much to other unless there be need for word can go right through french camp without fear only danger be of loping mohawk coming up to reckon there be many of 'em in camp perhaps nary one although james did not like follower to go into danger without sharing saw that presence must enormously add to risk therefore agreed to plan withdrawing distance into wood choosing thick growth of underwood entered lay down in bush while two scout walked quietly away towards camp two hour passed several time heard footstep in wood near peering through leaf caught sight of party of indian going towards camp late arrival from montreal band have be out scouting hunting at end of two hour to great relief saw two figure coming from other way through wood at once recognized scout crawled out joined a came up thank god be back again have be in fever time have be away wish have known precise place where be hiding must have made sign to to keep quiet ai of use now what be matter then nat ai quite sure a anything be matter scout replied be feared of a bad luck must have just a be coming back through camp came upon mohawk chief looked hard at then came up said 'the owl thought that knew brother here be two whose face be strange to ' of course told that have be living hunting for year in english colony that hearing that mohawk have joined french have come to fight beside brother asked few question then passed on must see varmin be not satisfied though in course pretended to be glad to welcome back to tribe so hung about camp for half hour then made sweep before came out here did look round jonathan stooped a if lace of moccasin have come undone managed to look back in course did see anything then have reason to believe be followed nat tell have reason nat said if redskin owl have got suspicion suspicion may be sure be got wo rest till be cleared matter up be after sure enough then have not better make for canoe at full speed nat said if be behind will be watching trail if see change pace will be after like pack of wolf while a long a walk slowly carelessly will let go if be dark might make run for there ai chance at present if took to lake must have hundred canoe after while wood be full of indian whoop of owl must bring hundred of down onto track why must owl have denounced at once if suspected james asked because ai redskin nature to do anything till be sure scout replied there be nothing redskin hate so much a to be wrong must rather wait for week to make sure of thing than run risk of making mistake suppose take for white expects belong to other tribe come in a spy then what be thinking of doing james asked will go on bit further nat said in hope of coming across stream where may hide trail if ca find that will sit down before long eat a if be careless in hurry for time walked on in silence do think be close to james asked presently not far away scout said carelessly so long a see ai hurrying will go easy will know by time that have white man with like enough owl will have sent back for one two more of warrior likely enough only took one with at first seeing be two that reckoned on taking by surprise when saw joined must send back for perhaps couple more then what must suggest james said be that must at once stroll down to canoe put in water paddle out few hundred yard there let down line have got on board begin to fish a long a be quiet there redskin may not interfere with when get dark can make off at worst have chance for seems to anything must be better than sort of wandering about when know at time may have down upon perhaps be best plan nat said what do think jonathan jonathan gave assenting grunt turned face towards lake still walking at same leisurely pace not once did of three look back a neared water james found temptation very strong to do so restrained sauntered along a carelessly a ever canoe be lifted from hiding place put in water a be about to step in bush parted owl stood beside where be brother going asked quietly be going fishing nat answered noise in wood will have frightened game away there be food in camp owl said french give food to brother redskin white brother want fish nat said quietly have told will catch will owl go with indian shook head in moment canoe put off from shore indian standing watching at edge of water be badly puzzled redskin nat said with low laugh brave have not come up yet must not have let start there be far enough be out of range of indian gun now lay in paddle begin to fish there be several canoe fishing further out redskin will feel safe can cut off providing go beyond indian be a nat have said puzzled that something be wrong be sure a be alone be unable to oppose departure watched closely a paddled out in readiness to give war whoop must have brought down fishing canoe outside given warning to indian within sound of voice when saw stop begin to fish hesitated if gave alarm might prove to be mistaken shrank from facing ridicule false alarm must bring upon must really prove a believed to be spy must if gave alarm lose honour glory of capture scalp must fall to other hand risk not to be thought of therefore waited until six of brave came up have already retired among tree before joined canoe be still visible through branch men tracked have taken to water be fishing owl be sure that be not of tribe must wait till see what will do let three of brother go get canoe paddle out beyond there fish will remain with others here if come back again will seize if go out further brother will call to redskin in other canoe will cut off owl friend will soon be with there be canoe coming out nat james said have better make run for at once not bit of captain dear how difficult be to teach men to have patience have looked upon a promising pupil there be just a hasty impatient a if have never spent day in wood where must run to must go up lake for must not pas point for fifty canoe must be put out before got there must land side because wood be full of redskin if led for ten mile down lake landed t'other side score of must land between here there must cut off lad have got to wait here till be getting late say till be dark till within hour so of nightfall a long a show sign of going chance be a wo interfere with be part of redskin natur to be patient a long a see a try to make off will leave alone be how read agrees with jonathan in course do went on a companion grunted assent say a may ask question so believe a will interfere with there be fish on line captain seem to to be attending to business james indeed found difficult to fix attention on line when knew that be watched by hostile eye at moment conflict might begin canoe have come out last have shaped course so a to pas close to fishing outside few word have be exchanged with occupant of warning no doubt a to suspicious character of fishing party near beyond nothing have happened indian in canoe have let down line seemed a intent a others upon fishing hour passed slowly under other circumstance james must have enjoyed sport for fish bit freely considerable number be soon lying in canoe nat jonathan appeared a interested in work a if other boat own be afloat on lake never once did james see glance towards canoe did not talk much when spoke be always in indian tongue time seemed endless before sun began to sink beyond low hill on left be intense relief to james when nat said at last time be just at hand now cap redskin be tired of waiting at least think that have better not put off longer know a well a do that wo do to wait till get dark do see that canoe came out last be paddling down towards look a if be drifting have seen dip paddle in several time others be pulling up line so a to be in readiness to join in get piece ready to pick up aim moment give word think be going to surprise must be first with go on with fishing just drop line overboard when pick up gun canoe approached slowly until be within thirty yard james companion went on with fishing a if did not notice approach of other canoe until one of indian spoke have indian brother caught many fish goodish few nat replied one two of be large one see here stooped a if to select large fish now said suddenly in instant three rifle be levelled to shoulder pointed at indian latter taken completely by surprise finding with three barrel levelled at a by one accord dived overboard now paddle nat exclaimed three stroke sent canoe dancing up to indian have just left struck on broadside rolled instantly over redskin gun be out of way anyhow nat said now have got to row for gave sharp turn to canoe a spoke bounded away towards right thereby throwing outside on quarter simultaneously with upset of canoe dozen rifle rang out from shore indian war whoop rose at edge of wood minute later dozen canoe shot out from shore chapter through many peril course nat be taking be not parallel to of boat outside be sheering gradually out into lake although boat be travelling somewhat faster than pursuer james saw that course must carry across bow at dangerously close distance indian be not long in seeing that canoe be outstripping in of boat one of redskin laid aside paddle began to fire ball struck water near canoe one be hit let fire jonathan said ai man a can shoot straight from canoe going at racing pace more fire better will only fall further behind after firing two three shot indian appeared to be of same opinion resumed paddle have lost so much ground that canoe be in chase of shot out into lake fifty yard ahead of nearest more shot be fired then indian began hastily to throw fish with canoe be laden into water after paddling two three hundred yard farther nat laid in paddle out with fish said can leave one two for supper rest must go overboard be quick about for canoe from shore be coming up fast work be concluded just a canoe with owl warrior came up with others having now got rid of fish again set out in close body ten canoe started in pursuit paddle steady nat said do be keerful of blade if one be to break now must mean loss of scalp gain on a long a redskin on shore think a friend be going to catch wo care to put out join in chase if thought be getting away might launch canoe ahead of cut off nearer be to better a long a be keeping ahead for hour chase continued indian although straining nerve did not gain foot upon fugitive who although paddling hard have still reserve of strength sun by time be touching top of hill now cap nat said be time to teach a can bite bit wo be quite so hot over if give lesson now do turn round pepper bit now old ho must row know for bit turning in canoe resting elbow on knee to steady rifle james took a careful aim a dancing motion of boat permitted fired dull sound came back like echo to crack of piece paddle in leading boat fell into water yell arose from indian answering shout came back indian be now paddling even harder than before in hope of overtaking canoe now that be impelled by two rower scout be rowing hardest proved justice of fame a best paddler on lake by maintaining distance from pursuer again again james fired several of bullet taking effect be now rapidly becoming dusk will do captain have best be showing heel now get a far ahead a can by time be quite dark james laid by rifle again took paddle a be rowing at top of speed gradually increased distance between pursuer rapidly gap of water widened when darkness fell on lake fugitive be more than mile ahead of pursuer night be dark light mist rising from water further aided when night have set in pursuing canoe must no longer be seen for half hour paddled on without intermitting effort then to james surprise nat turned head of canoe to western shore asked question however having perfect faith in nat sagacity be nearly in middle of lake when altered course took hour hard paddling before dark mass of tree loomed up in darkness ahead of ten minute before nat have passed word that must paddle quietly noiselessly be certain that chase must be eagerly watched from shore that indian there might be in wood must be closely watching near water edge accordingly a noiselessly a possible approached shore gliding in between overhanging tree laid canoe alongside clump of bush then without word being spoken laid in paddle stretched full length in canoe james be glad of rest for trained hard a be muscle be exhausted by long strain of row for life guessed that nat must calculate that indian canoe must scatter when lost sight of that must seek for more closely on eastern shore at same time be surprised that after once getting out of sight of pursuer nat have not immediately landed on opposite shore started on foot through wood after recovering breath james sat up listened attentively once twice thought heard sound of dip of paddle out on lake must not be sure of while from time to time heard croak of frog sometimes near sometimes at distance along shore must have thought little of have not slight pressure of jonathan hand against foot told that be indian signal hour passed before nat made move then touched jonathan sat up in canoe signal be passed on to james paddle be noiselessly taken up without sound must be detected by most closely listening ear canoe stole out again on to lake until distance from shore paddled very quietly then gradually stroke grew more vigorous until canoe be flying along at full speed up lake course being laid so a to cross very gradually towards eastern side be not until a james judged must have be several mile from point at have started that approached eastern shore did so with same precaution have be adopted on other side sat listening intently before gave last few stroke took to shore quietly stepped out two scout lifting canoe on shoulder carried fifty yard into forest laid down among bush then proceeded on way nat walking first james following so close that be able to touch for in thick darkness under tree must not perceive even outline of figure jonathan followed close behind progress be slow for even trained woodsman must with difficulty make way through tree nat only index a to direction to be taken lay in feel of bark of trunk after hour progress whispered will stop here till daylight ca do good at work have made mile since started be positive relief to james to hear scout voice for not single word have be spoken since lost sight of pursuer in darkness fact that have ventured now to speak showed that believed that be comparatively safe may speak nat asked after have seated on ground ay may speak captain raise voice above whisper there be saying what redskin ear may be near guess forest be pretty well alive with may bet there be redskin one of irregular canadian band be out arter tonight war whoop rifle will have put on lookout will have seen that be pretty well holding own will guess that when night came on must give canoe slip guess will have placed lot of canoe flatboat across lake opposite crown point for will know that must head back take to wood guess most of redskin near crown point will have crossed over at point a in course be more likely to land on side have mighty good mind to land whar be over there there be sure to be such heap of indian making way up side from montreal that judge will be best will have can do to get free of why did land at once nat after lost sight of instead of crossing over because be where will reckon will land captain be where will look for track first thing in morning will know that ca travel far such dark night a will search inch of shore for three four mile below where lost sight of to find where landed must know well enough must get ashore without leaving track a must make out must reckon to pick up trail fast enough in wood to overtake before have gone many mile now see have doubled on varmint in wood will search edge of lake in morning be good long stretch to go over if have luck may strike on landing place for hour after daylight in course may hit on earlier still give chance anyhow thing be have twenty mile le to travel through wood than if have to start up there that make difference when have got redskin at heel if have bad luck to come across of varmint in wood expect will carry scalp back to fort william henry now have best sleep till daybreak sha' get chance till get into fort again with first dawn of morning be on way striking straight back into wood walked fast with greatest care caution occasionally making bend detour to prevent redskin following trace at run must have be able to do have walked in straight line whenever ground be soft walked without trying to conceal track for nat knew however carefully progressed indian must be able to make out trail here when however came to rocky broken ground walked with greatest caution avoiding bruising of plant growing between rock after walking ten mile in direction turned to south ought to be pretty safe now nat said may be three four hour before hit on landing place find canoe say a wo be able to follow trail there ai saying what redskin eye can do 'ull take long time anyway there ai much risk of running against of in forest now guess that most of followed canoe down lake last night anyway be well out from lake champlain now when have gone fifteen mile sha' be far from upper arm there be canoe be lying hidden there for last two year unless tramping redskin have found ai likely twenty mile further walking brought to shore of lake following for hour came upon spot where little stream ran into lake here be nat said fifty yard up here will find canoe followed stream up for little distance then nat leaving edge made for clump of bush few yard away pushing thick foliage aside made way into centre of clump here be said just a left canoe be lifted out carried down to lake taking seat paddled up lake champlain keeping close under shore have have good luck captain nat said hardly thought must har got out without scrimmage expect a best part of redskin did trouble very much about expect to get such lot of scalp plunder when take fort that chance of three extra be enough inducement for to take much trouble over redskin in canoe who chased must be hot enough over for picked out two if not more of who started from fort must have particular reason to trouble much especially a think likely that who be chasing must get scalp when redskin blood up there ai trouble too great for will follow for week to get revenge take in be lazy varmint a long a there be plenty of deer meat on hand will eat sleep away time for week by night reached upper end of lake champlain canoe be carefully hidden away again struck through wood in direction of fort william henry be now safe from pursuit after walking two three mile halted for night made fire cooked of dried meat when have finished meal nat said now will move away bit then stretch out why must lie down here nat because must be foolish thing to do captain there ai saying what redskin may be wandering in wood in time of war thousand night might pas without one of happening to come upon fire if did be lying beside trouble have taken to slip through hand must be chucked clean away can not be too careful in wood started early next morning before noon arrived at fort william henry where james at once reported to colonel monro what have learned of strength of french force gathering at crown point thank captain walsham commandant said be greatly indebted to for having brought certain news of what be coming will write off at once ask for reinforcement be serious expedition colony will have to make great effort speedy one if be going to save fort for from what hear of montcalm be not likely to let grass grow under foot will report service have rendered a soon a colonel monro received report james have brought sent to general webb who with two thousand six hundred men chiefly provincial be at fort edward fourteen mile away on th of july that general visited fort william henry after remaining there four day returned to fort edward whence wrote to governor of new york telling french be coming urging to send forward militia at once saying that be determined to march with troop to fort instead of doing so three day later sent up detachment of two hundred regular under lieutenant colonel young eight hundred massachusetts men under colonel frye raised force at fort william henry to two thousand two hundred men reduced that of webb to sixteen hundred have webb be brave determined man must have left few hundred men only to hold fort edward marched with rest to assist monro when on morning of d of august received letter from saying that french be in sight on lake a be neither brave determined remained at fort edward sending off message after message to new york for help must not possibly arrive in time already garrison of fort william henry have suffered one reverse three hundred provincial chiefly new jersey men under colonel parker have be sent out to reconnoitre french outpost scout under james walsham be of party be to proceed in boat down lake like business way captain nat said a company took place in boat ai one thing other if monro want to find out about enemy jonathan kin do if want to fight enemy lot ai enough besides new jersey men know more about forest than so many child mark word be going to be bad business why can see boat halfway down lake with redskin about will ambush a soon a try to land look here captain know ai coward think one can say that of be ready to fight when there be chance of fighting see good in getting killed off when there ai no good in so what say be be in hurry captain with boat of ours must obey order nat james said smiling yes must obey order captain doubt there be two way of obeying order one be to rush in front to do little more than be told other be to take thing quiet just do what be told more now advice be on here expedition go on last plan if be ordered to land first why land first must be if get order to land first just let a be in hurry land afore ai be teaching lad to know something about wood for last six month jest to see killed off like fly because blundering wrong headed colonel sends out with two hundred fifty plowman for redskin to see attack jest when fancy very well nat will take advice for once wo put in front unless be ordered satisfied with nat passed quietly round among men a be taking place in boat told that there be occasion for to row a if be racing will be in captain boat said keep close to try to push on ahead when be once fairly in wood then will do scouting for rest there ai hurry for to begin till be on shore look at nat grumbled in james ear a boat started down lake there be rowing along middle instead of sneaking along close to shore doe parker think that redskin be a blind a be that 'cause be night lot of big boat like ca be seen out in middle of lake tell captain if ai ambushed a soon a land will grant know nothing of redskin way james have in fact before starting suggested to colonel parker that must be well to keep under shelter of bush officer have replied stiffly when want advice captain walsham will ask for after rebuff james be more willing than have hitherto be to act in accordance with advice of scout accordingly a rowed down lake boat with royal scout although keeping up with others maintained position in rear of column towards daybreak boat head be turned to shore when neared colonel parker gave order for men to lay in oar while three boat happened to be in advance be told to advance at once land boat passed through thick curtain of tree hung down over water edge minute passed then three others be ordered to follow did hear nothing nat whispered to james did hear anything nat did well think did hear something captain seems to a heard sort of scuffle never must surprise thirty forty men without alarm being given depended what sort of men be nat said scornfully must surprise men that knew business chap must just jump out of boat a if be landed on quay at new york must scatter about among bush why lord bless indian might ambush tomahawk lot before have time to think of opening lip to give shout second three boat have now disappeared among tree colonel parker gave word for rest to advance in body look to firelock lad james said happens keep perfectly cool at oar especially sit still be ready to obey order boat be within fifty yard of tree when from beneath drooping bough volley of musketry be poured out moment later swarm of canoe darted out from beneath branch terrible indian war whoop rang in air appalled by suddenness of attack by deadly fire terrible yell greater portion of men in boat be seized with wildest panic many of jumped into water others threw down in bottom of boat tried to row be impeded by comrade steady men steady james shouted at top of voice get boat head round keep together can beat off canoe easy enough if do keep head order be obeyed promptly coolly by men of company boat be turned with head to lake a canoe came dashing up men who be not employed in rowing fired so steadily truly that redskin in several of leading canoe fell upsetting boat hurry james shouted there be occasion for haste can go faster than can have got to do be to beat off lay in oar except two bow oar in boat rest of men stand to arm let boat follow other in file bow of one close to stern of ahead check volley have given to canoe gave time to men in several of boat close to of scout to turn be rowing past james slowly moving boat when shouted to steady men only chance of escape be to show front to a be doing can overtake easily will row down one after other fall in ahead of line do a be doing need not be afraid must beat off if be ten time a many reassured by calmness with james issued order boat took up position assigned to james who be in last boat in line shuddered at din going on behind yell of indian scream cry of provincial mingled with sharp crack of rifle duller sound of musket work of destruction be soon over save own company fifty of provincial in boat ahead whole of colonel parker force have be killed be prisoner in hand of indian who having finished work set off in pursuit of boat have escaped james at once changed order front boat be halted others formed in line beside presenting broad side to approaching fleet of canoe when latter came within hundred yard stream of fire opened from boat men aiming with greatest coolness canoe be checked at once score of paddler have sunk killed wounded into bottom several of frail bark be upset a fast a men must load continued fire in two minute from first shot canoe be turned paddled at full speed towards shore pursued by hearty cheer from english oar be then manned again remains of parker flotilla rowed up lake to fort william henry several of prisoner taken by indian be cooked eaten by few day afterwards party of indian following route from head of lake champlain made sudden attack on house round fort edward killed thirty two men be imposing spectacle a french expedition made way down lake george general levi have marched by side of lake with twenty five hundred men canadian regular redskin while main body proceeded troop in two hundred fifty large boat redskin in many hundred of canoe boat moved in military order there be six regiment of french line la reine languedoc la sarre guienne bearn roussillon cannon be carried on platform formed across two boat slowly regularly procession of boat made way down lake till saw signal fire of levi who with command be encamped near water at distance of two mile from fort even then english be not aware that near eight thousand enemy be gathered close to monro be brave soldier wholly unfitted for position held knowing nothing of irregular warfare despising trained soldier at daybreak be bustle at fort henry party of men went out to drive in cattle others to destroy building must interfere with fire from fort english position be now more defensible than have be when be attacked in spring forest have be cleared for considerable distance round building have served a screen to enemy have for most part be removed fort lay close down by edge of water one side rear be protected by marsh so that must only be attacked from one side beyond marsh lay rough ground where johnson have encamped two year before while on flat hill behind be entrenched camp beyond again be marsh a soon a sun rose column of levi moved through forest towards fort followed by montcalm with main body while artillery boat put out from behind point have hid from sight of english surrounded by hundred of indian canoe moved slowly forward opening fire a went soon sound of firing broke out near edge of forest round fort a indian with levi opened fire upon soldier who be endeavouring to drive in cattle hitherto james walsham with edward two scout be standing quietly watching approaching fleet of boat canoe nat expressing in measured term utter disgust at confusion reigned in around fort look more like frontier settlement suddenly surprised said than place filled with soldier who have be for week expecting attack nothing done nothing ready cattle over place tent on open ground there still standing store about in open of pig headed obstinate ignorant old gentleman ever see colonel beat one might a well have old woman in command indeed know score of old woman on frontier who must have be deal better here than if monro be obstinate prejudiced be brave cool determined now that danger have come felt secure of ground took proper measure for defence moving calmly about abating disposition to panic by calm manner in gave order nat have scarcely finished grumbling when colonel approached captain walsham said will take company at once cover party driving in cattle will fall back with when see in safety retire into intrenched camp company be already under arm waiting for order at double james led up sloping ground towards forest whence war whoop of indian sharp crack of rifle be now ringing out on side james made for spot where score of soldier be driving number of cattle before hurrying beast on across rough ground others firing at indian who a number increased be boldly showing behind tree advancing in pursuit a soon a neared spot james scattered men in skirmishing order placed behind one of blackened stump of roughly cleared forest opened fire upon indian several of fell rest bounded back to forest whence opened heavy fire now company showed advantage of training have gone through fighting with greatest steadiness coolness keeping well in shelter until when soldier cattle have got well on way towards fort james gave order to fall back band crawling among stump pausing to fire at opportunity made way back without having lost man although several have received slight wound chapter massacre at fort william henry when skirmishing round fort henry be over la corne with body of indian occupied road led to fort edward levi encamped close by to support check sortie english might make from intrenched camp montcalm reconnoitred position have at first intended to attack carry intrenched camp found that be too strong to be taken by rush therefore determined to attack fort by regular approach from western side while force of levi must intercept succour might come from fort edward cut off retreat of garrison in direction gave order that cannon be to be disembarked at small cove about mile from fort near placed main camp now sent one of aide de camp with letter to monro owe to humanity said to summon to surrender at present can restrain savage make observe term of capitulation might not have power to do so under other circumstance obstinate defence on part must only retard capture of place few day endanger unfortunate garrison can not be relieved in consequence of disposition have made demand decisive answer within hour monro replied simply that soldier must defend till last trench be opened on night of th work be extremely difficult ground being covered with hard stump of tree fallen trunk night long men toiled at work while gun of fort kept up constant fire of round shot grape by daybreak first parallel be made battery on left be nearly finished one on right begun men be now working under shelter gun of fort must do little harm while french soldier worked indian crept up through fallen tree close to fort fired at of garrison who might for moment expose sharpshooter in fort replied to fire day fort be fringed with light puff of smoke whilst cannon thundered unceasingly next morning french battery on left opened with eight heavy cannon mortar on following morning battery on right joined in with eleven other piece fort only mounted in seventeen cannon for most part small a of be upon other face english fire although kept up with spirit must reply weakly to of french fort be composed of embankment of gravel surmounted by rampart of heavy log laid in tier crossing other interstice filled with earth must ill support heavy cannonade to be exposed roar of distant artillery continuing day after day be plainly audible at fort edward although monro have at commencement of attack sent off several messenger asking for reinforcement did not move on third day of siege have received men from new york by stripping fort below must have advanced with men deserter from french told that montcalm have men webb considered task of advancing through intervening forest defile between fort henry far too dangerous operation to be attempted undoubtedly must have be dangerous one for indian pervaded wood a far a fort edward messenger must have got through to inform monro of coming montcalm must therefore have attacked on march with greater part of force still brave determined general must have made attempt webb did not do so left monro to fate even added to certainty by sending off letter to telling that must hing to assist advising to surrender at once messenger be killed by indian in forest note taken to montcalm who learning that webb did not intend to advance be able to devote whole attention to fort montcalm kept letter for several day till english rampart be half battered down then sent in by officer to monro hoping that must induce latter to surrender old soldier however remained firm in determination to hold out even though position be now absolutely hopeless trench have be pushed forward until within yard of fort indian crept up almost to wall on side two sortie be made one from fort other from intrenched camp be repulsed with loss more than of defender have be killed wounded smallpox be raging casemates be crowded with sick large cannon have be burst disabled only seven small piece be fit for service french battery in foremost trench be almost completed when be done whole of montcalm thirty one cannon fifteen mortar must open fire a breach have already be effected in wall further resistance must have be madness on night of th be known in fort that council of war must be held in morning that undoubtedly fort must surrender james with company have after escorting cattle to fort crossed marsh to intrenched camp a fort be already crowded with troop company therefore avoided horror of siege when report circulated that surrender must probably be made next morning nat went to james what be going to do captain do nat why have nothing to do if monro council decide to surrender there be end of propose that company be to fight montcalm army alone do nat said testily there have be deal too much fighting already understand holding out till last when there be hope of somebody coming to relieve what be use of fighting getting lot of men killed raising blood of redskin devil to boiling point if colonel have given up place at once must have saved loss of men montcalm must have be glad enough to let march off to fort edward probably will agree to let do now james said may agree nat said contemptuously how about redskin do think that after losing lot of brave be going to see march quietly away go home without scalp tell captain know redskin nature a sure a sun rise tomorrow there will be massacre for one ai going to lay down rifle let first redskin a take fancy to scalp tomahawk well what do propose nat well captain have heard say yours be independent command that can act with company wherever like while be here know be under order of colonel if have chosen to march away on expedition of own must have done be so nat now siege be once begun know must be justified in marching away even if must be going to surrender tell nat insisted see a how can be duty to hand over company to french if can get clear away so a to fight for king again what do say edward james asked lieutenant see why must march away if must edward said now that game be quite lost here think anyone must blame for saving company if possible agree with nat that montcalm will find difficult if not impossible to keep indian in hand french have never troubled much on score well nat what be plan james asked after pause plan be simple enough nat said there ai plan at have got to do be to march quietly down to lake to take of canoe be hauled up at mouth of swamp to paddle quietly off keeping under tree on right hand side there ai many redskin in wood way night be a dark a pitch can land eight ten mile down lake then march away to right so a to get clean round redskin altogether very well nat will do james said be chance think be better chance than staying here if must get into row about ca help be doing for best corp be quietly mustered marched out through gate of intrenchment on side of lake question be asked for corp have several time gone out on own account driven back indian french picket men have from first arrival at fort laid aside heavy boot taken to moccasin a being better fitted for silent movement in forest therefore not sound be heard a under nat guidance made way down slope into swamp here be halted for moment told to move with greatest care silence to avoid snapping bough twig however be le important a cannon on side be still firing constant rattle of musketry be going on round fort presently reached point where canoe be hauled up be told off three to canoe follow canoe in single file james said not word be to be spoken remember that single splash of paddle will bring redskin down upon likely enough there may be canoe out upon lake there be sure to be indian in wood think there be much fear captain nat whispered there be tiring redskin when be out on scout on own account when be acting with white be just a lazy a hog a must be sure fort ca hold out many hour longer will be too busy feasting counting scalp mean to take to think much about scouting tonight will go very slowly let man stop paddling instant canoe ahead of stop be james last instruction a stepped into stern of canoe while nat jonathan took paddle edward be to take place in last canoe in line without slightest sound canoe paddled out into lake then made for east shore be soon close to tree slowly noiselessly kept way just outside screen afforded by bough drooping down almost into water only now then slightest splash be to be heard along line might well have be taken for spring of tiny fish feeding several time when thought heard slight sound in forest on right nat ceased paddling lay for minute motionless canoe behind doing same so dark be that must scarce see tree close beside while bright flash from gun from fort battery only seemed to make darkness more intense be upwards of hour before james felt from greater speed with canoe be travelling that nat believed that have got beyond spot where indian be likely to be watching in forest faster faster boat glided along scout be still far from rowing hardest for although whole of men be accustomed to use of paddle other boat must be unable to keep up with driven by practised arm of leader of file after paddling for hour half scout stopped be far enough away now nat said there ai chance in world of redskin being in wood so far out a hope of scalp will have taken down close to fort can land safely now word be passed down line of canoe boat glided through screen of foliage men landed better pull canoe ashore captain if left in water one might break adrift float out beyond tree redskin other must make out must have troop of on trail before hour have passed there be marching through forest now nat james said ca see own hand close to face be so captain 'd best halt till daylight must make way along easy enough of fellow must be pitching over stump catching foot in creeper like enough letting off piece a went down may just a well stay where be ai likely to miss even in camp sartin redskin ca have known have gone so there be chance whatever of pursuit there ai nothing to be gained by making haste james gave order men felt about till found space of ground sufficiently large to lie down upon soon be asleep except two scout who said at once that must watch by turn till daylight a soon a be sufficiently light to see in forest band be again in motion made due east until crossed trail leading from head of lake champlain to fort edward kept on for hour then turning to south made in direction of albany for must have be dangerous to approach fort edward round indian be sure to be scattered thickly for first two hour after starting distant roar of gun have gone on unceasingly then suddenly stopped have hoisted white flag edward said be over thank god be well out of mind fighting walsham to be massacred by indian be hideous idea be glad be out of too james agreed can not think that montcalm with so large force of french regular at command will allow fiendish indian to massacre prisoner hope not edward said will be disgrace indeed to officer if doe know what indian be better than do have heard nat opinion see if montcalm be to use force against indian whole of must go off then there must be end to hope of french beating colonist in long run montcalm dare break with be horrible position for officer gentleman to be placed in montcalm did manage to prevent redskin from massacring garrison of oswego be a much a must do will be ten time a difficult now that blood be up with week of hard fighting loss of many of warrior anyhow be glad be out of even if bigwig consider have right to leave fort break for must rather lose commission than run risk of being massacred in cold blood james agreed with for two day continued march through forest using precaution against surprise saw however nothing of enemy emerged from forest on evening of second day march at distance of few mile from albany have not reached that town many hour when learned that nat sombre prediction have be fulfilled council of war in fort agreed that further resistance be impossible lieutenant colonel young went out with white flag to arrange term of surrender with montcalm be agreed that english troop must march out with honour of war be escorted to fort edward by detachment of french troop that must not serve for eighteen month that french prisoner captured in america since war began must be given up within three month store ammunition artillery be to be handed over to french except one field piece garrison be to be allowed to retain in recognition of brave defence before signing capitulation montcalm summoned indian chief before asked to consent to condition to restrain young brave from disorder gave approval promised to maintain order garrison then evacuated fort marched to join comrade in intrenched camp sooner have moved out than crowd of indian rushed into fort through breach embrasure butchered wounded who have be left behind to be cared for by french having committed atrocity indian many of canadian rushed up to intrenched camp where english be now collected french guard who have be stationed there did nothing to keep out wandered about threatening insulting terrified woman telling men that everyone must be massacred plundering baggage montcalm did best by entreaty to restrain indian took step to give effectual protection to prisoner that did not do so will remain ineffaceable blot upon fame seeing disposition of

inaccessible always so difficult that few men must hold army in check montcalm be perfectly confident of ability to resist attack british might make bougainville have long before examined position in view of possibility of english expedition against reported that with few intrenchment city must be safe if defended by three four thousand men sixteen thousand be now gathered there montcalm might well believe position to be impregnable be determined to run risk by advancing to give battle to remain upon defensive till resource of english be exhausted till approach of winter forced to retire only source of uneasiness lay in south for feared that amherst with army might capture ticonderoga advance into colony in case must weaken army by sending force to oppose on day after army landed on island sudden very violent squall drove several of ship ashore destroyed many of flatboat on following night sentry at end of island saw vessel coming down river suddenly burst into flame be fire ship vaudreuil have sent down to destroy fleet be filled with pitch tar sort of combustible with shell grenade mixed up with while on deck be number of cannon crammed to mouth with grapeshot musketballs fortunately for english french naval officer in command lost nerve set fire to ship hour too soon other captain following example gave english time to recover from first feeling of consternation at seeing fire ship pillar of flame advancing with tremendous explosion noise against troop at once got under arm lest french must attack while vessel lowered boat sailor rowed up to meet fire ship when neared threw grapnel on board towed towards land until be stranded then left to burn out undisturbed finding that must be impossible to effect landing under fire of french gun wolfe determined a first step to seize height of point levi opposite quebec from point must fire on town across saint lawrence be here le than mile wide on afternoon of th monckton brigade crossed in boat to beaumont on south shore advanced guard have skirmish with party of canadian soon fell back further opposition be offered to landing in morning proclamation issued by wolfe be posted on door of parish church called upon canadian to stand neutral in contest promising if did so full protection to property religion threatening that if resisted house good harvest must be destroyed church sacked brigade marched along river to point levi drove off body of french indian posted there next morning began to throw up intrenchment to form battery wolfe did not expect that gun here must do serious damage to fortification of quebec object be partly to discourage inhabitant of city exposed to fire partly to keep up spirit of own troop by setting to work gun of quebec kept up continual fire against working party battery continued to rise citizen alarmed at destruction threatened house asked governor to allow to cross river dislodge english although have belief that must succeed thought better to allow to try accordingly fifteen hundred armed citizen canadian from camp with few indian hundred volunteer from regular marched up river crossed on night of th of july courage of citizen evaporated very quickly now be on same side of river a english although still three mile from in short time wild panic seized rushed back in extreme disorder to boat crossed river returned to quebec english gun soon opened carried destruction into city in one day eighteen house cathedral be burned by exploding shell citizen soon abandoned home fled into country destruction of city however even if complete must have advanced wolfe plan little be moral blow at enemy nothing more on th of july several frigate took station before camp of general levi who with division of canadian militia occupied height along saint lawrence next to gorge of montmorenci here opened fire with shell continued till nightfall owing to height of plateau on camp be situated did little damage intention of wolfe be simply to keep enemy occupied under arm towards evening troop on island broke up camp leaving detachment of marine to hold post brigade of townshend murray three thousand strong embarked after nightfall in boat of fleet landed little below montmorenci at daybreak climbed height routing body of canadian indian who opposed gained plateau began to intrench there company of ranger supported by regular be sent into neighbouring forest to prevent party from cutting bush for fascines to explore bank of montmorenci if possible to discover ford across river levi with aide de camp jacobite scotchman named johnston be watching movement of wolfe from height above gorge levi believed that ford existed johnston found man who have only that morning crossed detachment be at once sent to place with order to intrench levi posted eleven hundred canadian under repentigny close by in support four hundred indian passed ford discovered english detachment in forest langlade commander recrossed river told repentigny that there be body of english in forest who might be destroyed if must cross at once with canadian repentigny sent to levi levi to vaudreuil then three four mile distant before vaudreuil arrived on spot indian became impatient attacked ranger drove back with loss upon regular who stood ground repulsed assailant indian however carried thirty six scalp across ford if repentigny have advanced when first called upon have be followed by levi with whole command english might have suffered very severe check for canadian be a much superior to regular in forest a regular to canadian in open vaudreuil called council of war montcalm agreed not to attack english who be on part powerless to injure be position on height be indeed dangerous one third of force be six mile away on other side of saint lawrence detachment on island be separated from by wide arm of river of three be liable to be attacked overpowered before others must come to assistance wolfe indeed be soon well intrenched although safe against attack be powerless to take offensive fact however that have taken up position so near camp have discomfited canadian battery played with considerable effect on left of camp time passed slowly deep impassable gulf of montmorenci separated two enemy crest of opposite cliff be within easy gunshot of other men who showed near edge ran strong chance of being hit along river from montmorenci to point levi continued fighting went on between gun of frigate gunboat battery on shore indian swarmed in forest near english camp constant skirmishing went on between ranger steady work of destruction going on in city of quebec by fire from point levi ceaseless cannonade kept up by ship wolfe battery added to inactivity to be condemned began to dispirit canadian militia many desertion took place men being anxious to return to village look after crop many more must have deserted have not be for persuasion of priest fear of being maltreated by indian whom governor

burning mass towed on shore be now end of july wolfe be nearer taking quebec than upon day when first landed there in vain have tempted montcalm to attack french general confident in strength of position refused to leave therefore determined to attack camp in front plan be desperate one for after leaving troop enough to hold two camp have le than five thousand men to attack position of commanding strength where montcalm must at hour notice collect twice a many to oppose at spot about mile above gorge of montmorenci flat strip of ground two hundred yard wide lay between river foot of precipice at low tide river left flat of mud nearly mile wide beyond dry ground along edge of high water mark french have built several redoubt from river wolfe must not see that redoubt be commanded by musketry of intrenchment along edge of height above also swept with fire whole face of declivity be covered with grass be extremely steep wolfe hoped that if attacked one of redoubt french must come down to defend that battle might be so brought on that if did not do so might find spot where height must be stormed with chance of success at low tide be possible to ford mouth of montmorenci wolfe intended that troop from camp on height above river must cross here advance along strand to cooperate with monckton brigade who be to cross from point levi on morning of st of july centurion of gun two armed transport with gun stood close in to one of redoubt opened fire upon while english battery from height of montmorenci opened fire across chasm upon french line at eleven o'clock troop from point levi put off in boat moved across river a if intended to make landing between beauport city for hour montcalm remained ignorant a to point on english attack be to be made became presently convinced that must be delivered near montmorenci massed whole of army on flank of position at half past five o'clock tide be low english boat dashed forward troop sprang ashore on to broad tract of mud left bare by tide while at same moment column strong moved down from height towards ford at mouth of montmorenci first to land be thirteen company of grenadier detachment of royal american who without waiting for two regiment of monckton brigade dashed forward against redoubt at foot of hill french at once abandoned grenadier have sooner poured into than storm of bullet rained down upon from troop who lined height above without moment hesitation grenadier american dashed forward strove to climb steep ascent swept a be by terrific hail of bullet buckshot from french canadian number rolled dead wounded to bottom of hill others struggled on at moment cloud have be threatening day suddenly opened rain poured down in torrent grassy slope instantly became so slippery that be absolutely impossible to climb fire from above died away a wet rendered firelock unserviceable grenadier fell back into redoubt wolfe who have now arrived upon spot saw that be absolutely impossible to carry height under present condition ordered troop to retreat carrying off many of wounded with fell back in good order of grenadier american who survived recrossed in boat to island th regiment rowed back to point levi th highlander who belonged to monckton brigade joined column from below montmorenci slowly retired along flat across ford loss fell entirely upon grenadier american be in proportion to number enormous four hundred forty three including one colonel eight captain twenty one lieutenant three ensign being killed wounded missing blow to english be severe one even wolfe began to despair meditated leaving portion of troop on isle aux coudres fortifying there sailing home with rest to prepare expedition in following year in middle of august issued third proclamation to canadian declaring a have refused offer of protection have practised most unchristian barbarity against troop on occasion must no longer refrain in justice to army in chastising a deserved barbarity consisted in frequent scalping mutilating of sentinel men on outpost duty be perpetrated alike by canadian indian wolfe object be twofold first to cause militia to desert secondly to exhaust colony accordingly ranger light infantry highlander be sent out in direction to waste settlement resistance be offered farm house village be laid in ash although church be generally spared wolfe order be strict that woman child be to be treated with honour if violence be offered to woman offender will be punished with death order be obeyed except in one instance none armed men in act of resistance be killed vaudreuil in despatch home loudly denounced barbarity be answerable for atrocity incomparably worse on far larger scale for have for year sent savage red white along frontier of mile to waste burn murder at will a be perfectly aware spared age sex montcalm be not to be moved from position by sight of smoke of burning village must not risk loss of canada for sake of few hundred farm house seeing impossibility of successful attack below town wolfe determined to attempt operation on large scale above accordingly with fair wind tide ship transport ran gauntlet of battery of quebec covered by hot fire from point levi generally succeeded with more le damage in getting above town fleet of flatboat be also sent up troop marched overland under brigadier murray to embark in to meet danger above town bougainville be sent from camp at beaufort with men murray made descent at pointe aux tremble be repulsed with loss tried second time at place body of ambushed canadian poured so heavy fire into boat that be forced to fall back again with considerable loss third attempt be more successful for landed at deschambault burned large building filled with store with spare baggage of officer of french regular troop vaudreuil now regretted having sent french frigate up river withdrawing crew to work in battery have be kept just above town must have overpowered english vessel a passed up

broken out in english camp number of effective men be greatly reduced upon other hand french be suffering from shortness of supply english frigate above town prevented food being brought down from montreal in boat difficulty of land carriage be very great canadian deserted in great number montcalm force have be weakened by despatch of levi to assist in checking advance of latter have captured ticonderoga crown point niagara have also be taken by english amherst however fell back again levi be able to rejoin montcalm greatest misfortune befell english be dangerous illness of wolfe who always suffering from disease be for time utterly prostrate at end of august however partially recovered dictated letter to three brigadier general asking to fix upon one of three plan laid before for attacking enemy first be that army must march eight ten mile up montmorenci ford river fall upon rear of enemy second be to cross ford at mouth of montmorenci march along shore until spot be found where height must be climbed third be to make general attack from boat upon beauport monckton townshend murray met in consultation considered plan to be hopeless proposed that attempt must be made to land above town so to place army between quebec base of supply thereby forcing montcalm to fight to surrender attempt seemed desperate one determined to adopt have not much hope of succeeding must not do so there be nothing for to sail with weakened army back to england therefore determined at last to make attempt implored physician to patch up so that must in person take command know perfectly well that can not cure wrote pray make up so that may be without pain for few day able to do duty be want on rd of september wolfe took first step towards carrying out of plan by evacuating camp at montmorenci montcalm sent strong force to attack a be moving monckton at point levi saw movement embarking two battalion in boat made feint of landing at beauport montcalm recalled troop to repulse threatened attack english be able to draw off from montmorenci without molestation on night of th fleet of flatboat passed above town with baggage store on th infantry marched up by land united force of men embarked on board ship of admiral holmes french thought that abandonment of montmorenci embarkation of troop be sign that english be about to abandon enterprise sail for england nevertheless montcalm did not relax vigilance being ever on watch riding from post to post to see that be in readiness to repel attack in one of letter at time mentioned that have not taken off clothes since d of june now reinforced troop under bougainville above quebec to men have little fear for height near town believing to be inaccessible that hundred men must stop whole army said especially in reference to one spot presented at least possibility of being scaled here captain de vergor with hundred canadian troop be posted battalion of guienne have be ordered to encamp close at hand post be called anse du foulon be mile half distant from quebec thus although hoping that english must soon depart french knowing character of wolfe made preparation against last attack before started from th to th holmes fleet sailed up down river threatening landing now at one point now at wearing out french who be kept night day on qui vive be exhausted by following ship up down so a to be ready to oppose landing wherever might be made james walsham regiment formed part of monckton brigade colonel have frequently selected to command party who went out to canadian village a from knowledge have acquired of irregular warfare must be trusted not to suffer to be surprised by party of canadian indian who be always on watch to cut off detachment sent out from british camp there be still ten men in regiment who have formed part of band on lake be drafted into company force went out always accompanied although james have seen much heard more of terrible barbarity perpetrated by canadian indian ally on frontier lamented much necessity compelled wolfe to order destruction of canadian village when engaged on service whether in command of detachment a subaltern if more than one company went out never superintended painful work with ten men scouted beyond village kept vigilant lookout against surprise in way have several skirmish with canadian latter never succeeded in surprising force to be attached walsham scout be often sent out with party from other regiment general monckton be so pleased with vigilance activity that specially mentioned to general wolfe at same time telling of service have performed on lake very favourable report have be made by johnson monro lord howe abercromby of work done by corp have organized commanded wish have few more officer trained to sort of warfare general wolfe said send on board sutherland tomorrow have service be well fitted to carry out james accordingly repaired on board sutherland be conducted to general cabin general monckton have spoken to in high term of lieutenant walsham tell that have be several time mentioned in despatch by general under whom served be with braddock a well a with johnson howe abercromby with monro at siege of fort william henry how be that so young officer must have seen so much service james informed how having be pressed on board man of war have be discharged in accordance with order from home hearing that friend be going to obtain commission for in regiment under order for america have thought best to utilize time by accompanying general braddock a volunteer in order to learn something of forest warfare that after disastrous affair have served with johnson in similar capacity until on regiment arriving have be selected to drill company of scout have served with on lake until corp be broken up when regiment sailed for canada in fact have seen more of kind of warfare than officer in army general wolfe said special service ought to have be recognized before will have put in order tomorrow a promoted to rank of captain now be about to employ upon service if be successful will give brevet majority there must be point at precipice can be climbed want to find out where be be service of great danger will go in uniform otherwise if caught must meet with fate of spy at same time even in uniform must probably meet with little mercy if fell into hand of canadian indian must be willing to undertake duty will try sir james said do wish to start tonight no general replied have better think matter over let know tomorrow how have best proceed be not enterprise to be undertaken without thinking over in light will have to decide whether will go alone take anyone with when how will land how will regain ship will of course have carte blanche in respect after james have returned on shore thought matter over in light knew that french have many sentry along edge of river for boat at night went over towards side of river be always challenged fired upon chance of landing undetected therefore seemed slight even did land must be likely at night to discover path must be little more than track up height have be able to speak canadian french matter must have be easy enough a must have landed higher up river dressed a canadian farmer have made way through french line without suspicion knew nothing of french even have spoken language fluently there be sufficient difference between canadian french language of old country for first canadian who spoke to to have detected difference must pas a indian for although have picked up enough of language to converse with redskin ally of english on lake first indian who spoke to must detect difference indeed needed far more intimate acquaintance with various tribe than possessed for to be able to paint adorn so a to deceive vigilant eye of french indian have two follower nat jonathan be with must have painted dressed so that must have passed muster in absence abandoned idea a out of question prospect certainly did not seem hopeful after long thought seemed to that only way promised even chance of success must be for to be taken prisoner by french soldier once fairly within line difficulty be over have learned to crawl a noiselessly a indian doubted not that must be able to succeed in getting away from place of confinement in might place then must follow top of height position of sentry of body of men encamped there must in be guide to a to existence of path to strand below first step be most difficult how must manage to get taken prisoner be more difficult a be absolutely necessary that must fall into hand of french regular not of canadian who must finish matter at once by killing scalping next morning again went off to sutherland be in high spirit for name have appeared in order a captain a appointed assistant quartermaster general on headquarter staff on entering general cabin thanked for promotion have earned over over again general said there be thanks due to now have thought out plan james briefly stated difficulty perceived in way of other scheme than of getting taken prisoner by french showed that be only plan seemed to offer even chance of success may not be able to escape wolfe said may not james replied in case sir must of course remain prisoner until take quebec be exchanged even then must be worse off than be at present for must of course be taken prisoner at point where french be in force where mean to land presence there must give clue to real intention be taken prisoner anywhere along shore must naturally redouble vigilance a must guess be looking for way of ascending height how do propose being taken wolfe asked idea be james replied that must land with party near cap rouge a if to reconnoitre french position there must of course be speedily discovered must then retreat to boat must naturally be last to go might well manage to be cut off yes wolfe replied might also that far more easily manage to get shot think must do captain walsham risk must be twenty to one against escaping being shot can think of other plan only other plan can think of james said might involve others being taken prisoner might row in towards cap rouge in broad daylight a if to examine landing place must of course draw fire upon boat before starting must fire two three shot into boat close to water line afterwards plug up with rag then when fire became heavy must take plug out let boat fill a did so must shout that surrendered then must drift till neared shore in water logged boat swim ashore can swim well must of course want four men who must swim well also picked out a crew plan be dangerous one wolfe said le so than other one can not win battle without risking life sir james said quietly of might of course be hit a risk life whenever get within range of enemy see that need be considered at rate sir be ready to make attempt if plan have approval tell frankly captain walsham that think chance of success be absolutely nil at same time there be just faint possibility that may get ashore alive escape from french discover pathway bring news a only chance of expedition being successful now depends upon discovering such path be not justified in refusing even faint chance general touched bell stood on table before will ask captain to come here said to officer who answered summons captain peter said when captain appeared want to pick out for four men upon whom can thoroughly rely in first place must be good swimmer in second place must be able to hold tongue lastly must be prepared to pas month in french prison midshipman with same qualification will be required to go with captain naturally looked surprised at so unusual request captain walsham be going to be taken prisoner by french general wolfe explained only way can be done be for whole boat crew to be taken with then detailed plan have be arranged of course can offer men reward may think fit can promise midshipman early promotion concluded very well general have doubt can find four men midshipman willing to volunteer for affair especially a if succeed imprisonment will be short one when will attempt be made if can drift up river a far a cap rouge before daylight james said in answer to inquiring look from general will attempt tomorrow morning must say that best plan must be for to appear opposite camp when day break a if be trying to obtain close view of in early morning sooner better general wolfe said day be of importance how do propose to get back again that be supposing that everything go well propose general must conceal somewhere on face of height will spread handkerchief against rock tree so that will not be seen from above below will be visible from ship in river can not say of course whether will be near cap rouge quebec if will have sharp lookout kept through glass a ship drift up down be sure to see can let know that do so by dipping ensign at night will make way down to shore if at midnight exactly will send boat for will be ready to swim off to when show lantern a approach shore of course can not say on what day may be in position to show signal at rate if week pass without seeing will know have failed to make escape have be killed after getting out chapter dangerous expedition detail of proposed expedition being thus arranged captain left cabin with james latter paced to fro on quarterdeck while captain sent for boatswain directed to pick out four men who must swim well who be ready to volunteer for desperate service while captain be so engaged james saw naval officer staring fixedly at recognized instantly though more than four year have elapsed since have last seen at once stepped across quarterdeck how be lieutenant horton be long time since last parted on potomac horton must have refused proffered hand have already injured very sorely in eye of squire by outburst of ill feeling against james so shook hand said coldly yes position have changed since then yes james said with laugh be only temporary eclipse two month before mast be sort of interlude for be deeply thankful have not be for getting into smuggling scrape must have be at present moment commencing practice a doctor instead of being captain in majesty service word be not calculated to improve horton temper what mistake have made have interfered on james walsham behalf word from saying that james be son of medical man be assuredly mixed up in smuggling affair only by accident must have be released have not spoken that word consequence be have fallen into bad odour with squire james walsham instead of drudging away a country practitioner be officer of rank equal to for a second lieutenant in sutherland ranked with captain in army not only whenever went to sidmouth have heard how james have be mentioned in despatch how much be distinguishing everything seemed to combine against have hated james walsham from day when latter have thrashed have acted a aggie champion against have hated more when found aggie installed a squire heiress saw how high james stood in good grace that have be taken up by squire have hoped that have gained advantage over when have come back naval officer while james be still schoolboy have kept aloof from house while devoted to young heiress everything have seemed going on well with plan until very circumstance at time seemed so opportune namely pressing james a seaman on board thetis have turned out so disastrous letter in have suffered exultation to appear have angered squire have set mr walsham friend ex sergeant against have deeply offended aggie have too enabled squire to take instant measure for procuring james discharge have now placed latter in position equal to own james on part did not like richard horton felt active animosity against have got best of in first quarrel of theirs although have certainly felt very sore angry at time richard be staying at hall seemed to have taken place altogether a aggie friend feeling have long since died away for knew from letter of mr wilks aggie have liking whatever for richard horton be at sidmouth in spring heard said found mother looking well hope yes be there fortnight before sailed richard said think be looking about a usual for few minute talked in stiff somewhat constrained tone for richard must not bring to speak cordially to man whom regarded a dangerous rival presently captain came up to have picked four volunteer for work captain walsham be somewhat surprised at first to find that be required for bout in french prison sailor be always ready for hare brained adventure made objection whatever when explained what must have to do next to fighting frenchman there be nothing sailor like so much a taking in young middleton go in command of boat be regular young pickle be a pleased at prospect a if french prison be most amusing place in world know of course that there will be considerable danger of being shot before be taken prisoner need hardly say that danger add to interest of scheme be risky business have undertaken captain walsham terribly risky if succeed will have saved expedition from turning out failure will be under obligation to for rest of life have captain walsham told what be undertaking mr horton sir be going to get taken prisoner in gig in order that may if possible give french slip again find out way down line of cliff so enable general to get into heart of french expedition be grand scheme risky one chance be hundred to one against captain walsham be just what general said james replied with smile think be more than five to one against even if be thousand must be worth trying for thousand life must be cheaply sacrificed to ensure success of expedition there be not many men who must like to try captain said say honestly must myself anything in nature of duty whether be laying ship alongside frenchman of twice weight of metal boat expedition to cut out frigate from under gun of battery must be ready to take share in expedition like yours to be carried out alone in cold blood in dark must have stomach for want to discourage honour courage in undertaking be heartily glad that general did not propose to instead of to to undertake must have done if have sir james said smiling so must officer of expedition consider most highly honoured in general entrusting with mission besides must remember that be not so strange to a must be to most men have be for four year engaged in forest warfare scouting at night in wood keeping ear open to slightest sound might tell of skulking redskin being at hand eye have become so accustomed to darkness that although still very far short of of indian can see plainly where one unaccustomed to such work must see nothing be accustomed to rely upon own sens to step noiselessly to crawl along on ground like indian therefore see to enterprise doe not present in same light a naturally must to may make light of captain said be dangerous business look at a will well if go through safely captain walsham will be hero of campaign late in afternoon tide turned vessel began to drift up river four sailor have of course mentioned to comrade service upon be about to be engaged captain have not thought necessary to enjoin secrecy upon for there be communication with shore fear of knowledge spreading beyond ship besides boat have to be damaged alone must tell sailor when be lowered in water that be intended to be captured marine be called up to where captain gig be hanging from davit james pointed out spot just below waterline man standing yard two away fired at ball making hole through side of boat shot be fired two three inch higher four hole be then plugged up with oakum be now in readiness for attempt james dined with captain peter first lieutenant four officer of general staff being also present general wolfe being too ill to be at table admiral holmes having early in morning gone down river to confer with admiral saunders drink good health safe return to captain walsham for sake a well a yours a general thing when officer be chosen for dangerous service be object of envy by comrade for once think anyone on board must care to undertake mission why sir little midshipman be delighted at going with have be chatting matter over be in highest glee ah have only got first chance of being shot at captain peter said that come in line of duty hope there be officer on board ship must volunteer at once for service real danger only begin when end by way asked a after dinner be over be walking up down quarterdeck talking to james have lieutenant horton met before thought seemed to know other when came up since then have noticed that while other officer of ship have be chatting with have kept aloof knew other at home sir james said be never very good friend acquaintanceship commenced when be boy with fight got best of have never think quite forgiven like young fellow captain peter said shortly know be not popular in thetis say showed white feather out in east must have have on board first lord asked a personal favour to take have have reason to complain of since joined know that be more popular among other officer than be in thetis never heard word against sir james said earnestly uncle mr linthorne have large estate near sidmouth have be kindest friend to mine at one time be thought that horton must be heir granddaughter who have for year be missing be found still horton will take must think considerable slice of property must grieve squire terribly if horton failed in career think be only fault of manner sir if may say so certainly know nothing against know captain peter replied thoughtfully just before sailed happened to meet old friend over dinner mentioned name of officer told knew mr linthorne well that horton have gone to sea with for first time a midshipman that there be certainly something queer about a boy for linthorne have specially asked to keep eye upon have begged frankly to let know how conducted that rather set against know think be anything james urged much like horton must not like to have false impression of be mere boyish affair sir in fact be connected with fight with think gave very strictly accurate account of uncle who in matter be very strict although one of kindest of men took thing up sent away to sea horton be certainly punished severely enough for stupid business without counting against afterwards like way speak up in defence captain walsham especially a frankly say like henceforth will dismiss affair from mind must say that have never forgiven although may have done so that be natural enough james laughed because came best out of to richard news that james walsham be about to undertake desperate enterprise if succeeded in must bring great honour credit be bitter in extreme admiration expressed by other officer at courage in undertaking added to anger disgust walked moodily up down quarterdeck afternoon to think matter over at moment fury increased must in way have put stop to adventure must instantly have done so there be possible way of interfering thought annoyed most be of enthusiasm with news of successful termination of enterprise must be received at sidmouth already a knew aggie regarded james a hero squire be almost a proud of mention in despatch a if have be own son for cared little be aggie good opinion richard horton desired to gain james walsham still thought of a girl of twelve have last seen richard horton knew a almost woman although at first have resolved to marry a uncle heiress now really cared for for herself on visit before james have left home richard have felt certain that cousin liked since time have not only made progress felt that have lost rather than gained ground girl be always friendly with be cool friendliness of cousin somehow richard instinctively felt james be cause in vain have angrily told that be absurd to suppose that cousin must care for fellow whom have only seen a awkward boy who have be content to stop away from house never go near for week still though told be absurd knew that be so when conversation happened to turn upon james seldom took part in richard knew that be not from indifference a to subject there be soft flush on cheek light in eye have never be able to call up many time have ground teeth in silent rage when squire mr wilks be discussing news received in james last letter expressing hope that ere long must be back from foreign service although by mean fond of encountering danger richard felt that must gladly pick open quarrel with man regarded a rival shoot like dog for in day duel be matter of everyday occurrence there be possibility of doing at present juncture moreover knew that must be worst possible way of ridding of for be james to fall by hand chance of winning aggie must be hopelessly extinguished said to be out of question will do something come what may will never go back to sidmouth squadron drifted up beyond cap rouge anchored at top of flood hour before daybreak gig be lowered james walsham amid many good wish hearty farewell from officer took place in by side of midshipman look out for signal said time after today may see will see if make boy said captain who have come on deck to see off fear about if make signal may rely upon boat will be ashore for night moment boat pulled away from side of ship take easy lad young middleton said only just dip oar in water have three mile to row with stream want to be there till day begin to show oar have be muffled noiselessly boat dropped down stream until neared cap rouge then rowed in towards french shore day be just beginning to break in east a neared spot where french camp be situated stood high up on plateau there be small number of tent on low ground by river a battery have be erected here be two hundred yard from shore when french sentry challenged gave answer soldier at once fired keep about distance out james ordered row quietly will stand up a if be watching shore a soon a shot be fired be answered by shot from other sentry minute later drum be heard to beat sharply then in faint light number of french soldier must be seen running at full speed towards shore shot fell thickly round boat one of men dropped oar a bullet struck on shoulder pull out plug james said oakum be pulled out thrown overboard water rushed in now turn head from shore a if be trying to escape so rapidly did water rush in through four hole that in minute gunwale be nearly level with water turn over now james said in moment boat be upset men clinging to bottom shout of exultation rose from shore a boat be seen to upset firing at once ceased swim towards shore push boat before young midshipman said wo fire more now have finished first part of business pushing boat before men made way slowly towards shore striking land mile below point where have overturned french soldier have followed down bank surrounded a landed hole in boat explained for cause of disaster officer stepped forward be prisoner said to james latter bowed be fortune of war said men be better shot than gave credit for pointed to hole in boat spoke in english officer guessed meaning of indian canadian soon came flocking down with angry gesture demanded that prisoner must be shot french officer waived off placed strong guard of own men around to prevent being touched by indian young midshipman spoke french fluently having be specially selected by captain for reason have be agreed between james that must not betray knowledge of language a might thereby pick up information might be useful be at once conducted before bougainville do speak french asked james shook head midshipman looked a if have not understood question be clear french officer said to standing around that came in to reconnoitre landing place thought in dim light must run gauntlet of sentry fire be more accurate than gave credit for boat be struck twice say yes general officer who conducted into tent replied two ball right through one of men be hit on shoulder reconnaissance look a if wolfe meant to attempt landing here bougainville said must keep sharp lookout will send on to quebec for general to question will find someone there who speaks language will send at once to tell have captured ca very well do so till have convoy going with regular to guard if be to go in charge of canadian chance of arriving alive in quebec must be slight let sailor be placed in tent in line chateaudun place sentry over to see that indian get at two officer can have tent le boeuf gave up yesterday can put sentry there can go in out a like there be fear of trying to escape for if once went outside line of regular indian canadian must make short work of officer led james midshipman to tent in staff line whose owner have ridden to quebec on previous night with despatch motioned to that be to be also made sign to that must move about a chose significantly warned by gesture that if ventured beyond tent indian must make short work of for time prisoner made attempt to leave tent for indian stood scowling at short distance off must have entered have not sentry on duty prevented from doing so talk too loudly james said be probable that in camp like there be someone who understands english very likely be playing same game with that be with pretend there be one who can speak to very likely there may be someone standing outside now trying to listen to what say then raising voice went on what abominable luck have who must have reckoned upon boat being hit twice at distance thought have fairly succeeded general will be in nice way when find come back yes middleton rejoined to think that be likely to spend winter in prison at quebec instead of old england be half inclined to try escape nonsense james replied must be madness to think of thing indian can see in dark moment put foot outside line of french regular must be carried off scalped boy must be simply throwing away life there be nothing for to wait quietly till wolfe take quebec be exchanged prisoner be treated with courtesy by french officer comfortable meal be provided in evening went outside tent for short time did not venture to go far for indian be still moving about hostile glance threw at prisoner be sufficient to indicate what must happen to latter if be caught beyond protection of sentry bougainville be right in supposing that prisoner must not be likely to attempt to escape james said in low voice look of indian must be quite sufficient to prevent anyone from attempting under ordinary circumstance be well that business will take down river towards quebec while will make sure that will have made up river with view of making way off to ship next time go up above cap rouge will be risky work getting through midshipman remarked same wish be going with instead of having to stick here in prison must be running too great risk of spoiling chance of success james said be accustomed to redskin can crawl through a noiselessly a must besides one can hide where two must not only hope that when find have gone wo take into head to revenge escape upon there be fear of that midshipman said will be sound asleep in tent when wake up find be gone will make tremendous fuss pretend to be most indignant that have deserted two prisoner have eaten little of meal served to day putting greater portion aside hiding in straw served for bed in order that james might take with supply for might be three four day before must be taken off by ship boat suppose wo go very far tonight midshipman said suddenly james replied will hide somewhere along face of cliff mile so away be not likely to look for down river at if do will think have gone a far a can away nearer be to place safer look here midshipman said be going strictly to obey order at same time be just possible that something may turn up that ought to know that might make want to bolt suppose for instance heard say that meant to shoot in morning be not likely know still be always a well to be prepared for might happen if so must crawl out of camp make way along after if so will walk along edge sometimes give two little whistle like if hear answer be foolish middleton james said seriously must only risk life mine by nonsense of sort there ca be possible reason why must want to go away have undertaken to carry out knowing that must have perhaps to remain prisoner for time having undertaken must keep to plan laid down be going to captain walsham still know something might turn up see that anything possibly must turn up james insisted if at future time do think of mad brained attempt of escaping must take off shoe must put foot down time a gently a if ground be covered with nail for if be to tread upon twig there be indian within mile of must hear crack attempt such folly good must possibly come of must be sure to fall into hand of savage canadian know how treat prisoner know boy said have wish to have scalp hanging up in of wigwam be midnight before camp be perfectly still then james walsham quietly loosened one of peg of canvas at back of tent with warm grasp of midshipman hand crawled out lad listened attentively must not hear slightest sound sentinel be striding up down in front of tent humming air of french song a walked hour passed without slightest stir midshipman be sure that james be by time safely beyond enemy camp be just about to compose to sleep when heard trampling of foot sentry challenged password be given party passed on towards general tent be thirty yard distant sentry posted there challenged wonder what be up midshipman said to lifting canvas put head out where james have crawled through men have halted before general tent boy heard general voice from inside tent ask sharply what be regret to

adopted precaution james have suggested felt ground carefully for twig stick time moved still glowing ember of campfire warned where indian canadian be sleeping carefully avoiding made way up beyond limit of camp there be sentry posted here for french be perfectly safe from attack from quarter once fairly beyond camp midshipman rose to foot made way to edge of slope above saint lawrence walked for about mile then paused on very edge of sharp declivity whistled a agreed upon hundred yard further repeated signal fourth time whistled heard just below answer minute later james walsham stood beside young scamp what be doing here be not fault captain walsham be indeed must have be tomahawked if have stayed there moment longer what do mean by must have be tomahawked james asked angrily for be convinced that midshipman have made up mind along to accompany pilot of sutherland swam ashore with news that have be taken prisoner on purpose be really spy how on earth did know that james asked took care man be not on deck when made hole in boat doe not understand word of english so must not have overheard what men said be sorry to say sir that be case of treachery that one of officer be concerned in man said that officer released from cell took to cabin then lowered by rope through porthole impossible james said sound impossible sir be afraid be for officer gave note to bring to general telling about that note have got in pocket now midshipman then related whole circumstance of discovery be extraordinary affair james said however be certainly not to blame for making escape when did must not have got back into tent till too late even must have done so might have gone hard with for of course must have known that be what must call accomplice in affair will go on if like sir boy said hide somewhere else so that if track will not find james said think there be fear of being tracked indian eye be sharp ca perform miracle in forest must be hopeless to escape here grass be short ground dry without boot can not have left track must be followed especially a body of french troop have be marching backwards forward along edge of height for last fortnight wo say that be impossible that can find will not be by track now come down to bush where be lying will wait there till daylight break be a far down a dare go by light when can see will find safer place further down cautiously made way down to clump of bush twenty foot below edge there lying down dozed until became light enough to see ground slope be very steep bush grew here there upon by mean of projecting rock worked way down thirty foot lower then sat down among bush screened from sight of anyone who might be passing along edge of river while steep slope effectually hid from anyone moving along above be there signature to letter james asked presently midshipman took piece of paper out looked at there be signature said know handwriting have seen in order over over again james be silent few minute wo ask who be though fear know too well look here middleton must like to tear that letter up say more about sir boy said putting paper in pocket ca do of course be under order for expedition be not affair in consider that be bound to obey concern honour of officer of ship must not be doing duty if did not upon return place letter in hand of captain man who must betray general plan to enemy must betray ship must be traitor if did not inform captain be sorry awfully sorry that must happen to officer of sutherland will be for captain to decide whether will make public not there be one thing if be to be anyone must rather that be than anyone else for there be man on board can abide sir be sorry can not give up letter even if have torn up when have in hand just now must have reported whole thing to captain say must swear to handwriting james be silent boy be right be only doing duty in determining to denounce act of gross treachery have be perpetrated be deeply grieved however to think of consequence of discovery especially of blow that must be to squire to hear that nephew be traitor indeed murderer at heart for have not flight taken place before discovery be made must certainly have be executed a spy day passed quietly that indian be searching for far wide james have doubt indeed from hiding place saw several party of redskin moving along on river bank carefully examining ground be lucky did move along there said to companion for ground be so soft that must assuredly have found track expect that think possible that may have be taken off in boat during night hope will keep on thinking so midshipman said then will give up looking for wo do james replied for will be sure that must have seen track have passed along muddy bank fortunately have clue to where really be might have gone east west north country be so covered with bush that anything like regular search be absolutely impossible hope ai going to be very long before get on board again midshipman said a munched small piece of bread james served out to for dinner grub wo last more than two day even at starvation rate that one bottle of water be mockery must finish straight off why will be a badly off a if be adrift at sea in boat not quite so bad james replied can chew leaf of of bush besides people die of hunger thirst in four day hope before to be safely on board not until be perfectly dark did leave hiding place by aid of bush worked way up to top of ascent again james have impressed on companion that on account be to speak above whisper that be to stop whenever did must turn off descend slope be at once to follow example midshipman kept close to companion marvelled how assuredly latter walked along for must see nothing several time james stopped listened presently turned off to right saying hush in lowest possible tone proceeding few pace down slope noiselessly lay down behind bush midshipman imitated example though wondered why be so acting for must hear nothing two three minute later heard low footfall then sound of men speaking in low voice in strange tongue must not see held breath a be passing not till have be gone minute did james rise pursue course two indian said on search for one be just saying to other expected when got back to camp to find of other party have overtaken mile further saw light of several fire ahead be french battery james said must make detour get to other side of then will crawl back see if there be path down to river detour be made then leaving midshipman in hiding few pace from edge james crawled back soon saw by fire that battery be manned by sailor from french fleet have little fear of discovering keeping well below came presently upon narrow path above must hear french sentry walking followed path down with greatest caution stepping with most extreme care to avoid displacing stone found path be excessively steep rugged little more indeed than sheep track took hour to reach bottom found that in place sapper have be lately at work obliterating path that must scarcely be considered practicable for men hampered with arm ammunition half hour work took to top again few minute later rejoined companion wo do said must try again there be path troop must scarcely climb if unopposed certainly must not do so without making such noise a must attract notice of sentinel above be battery call midshipman said have fired at over over again from there a went up down river there be about mile further on be called samos upon reaching samos battery james again crept up reconnoitred way down however be even more difficult than at sillery there be indeed regular path so steep be descent that doubted whether must be possible for armed men to climb even exceptionally strong active a be unencumbered with arm have greatest difficulty in making way down up again indeed must only do so by grasping trunk of tree strong bush ca be done there said to midshipman when joined again now must look for hiding place must have be five six hour since started night be very short at rate can not attempt exploration before morning wish must explore inside of farm house light upon something to eat drink midshipman said be use wishing james replied ca risk anything of sort probably farm house be full of troop have got little bread left will hold over tomorrow comfortably may hold middleton said certainly wo hold comfortably idea of comfort at present time must be round of beef gallon of ale ah be epicure james laughed if have have three four year of campaigning in forest a have have must learn to content on something good deal le than might boy said have doubt about there be one comfort will be able to sleep day tomorrow so sha' think about a indian did not find track yesterday be not likely to do so today be time before found hiding place for descent be so steep that have to try several time before must get down far enough to reach spot screened by bush hidden from sight of anyone passing above at last did so soon lay down to sleep after partaking of mouthful of water tiny piece of bread passed day for most part in sleep midshipman woke frequently being now really parched with thirst time chewed few leaf from bush in be lying derived small comfort from be awful to think of tomorrow said a evening approached even supposing find way down tonight must be midnight tomorrow before be taken off if find way down james said will if possible take down with then can take long drink at river at rate will take bottle down with bring up full for next place to try be spot where saw tent a went up river there be battery there tent can only have be pitched there because there be way down to water can not be more than mile away for be not more than mile from fort samos ca go with midshipman said will be a quiet a cat if find be good path come up to fetch down see there will be treble risk of being seen very well james agreed only mind if set stone rolling break twig will cost life to say nothing of failure of expedition will be a quiet a mouse see if ai midshipman said confidently will try not to think even once of water below there so a not to hurry together crept cautiously along edge of ridge until came to clump of fifteen tent a approached must see by light of fire that encampment be one of canadian troop james have not intended to move forward until be asleep men be chatting round fire did not seem to that sentry have a yet be placed on edge of descent therefore crept forward at once followed closely by midshipman keeping a far a possible down beyond slope of descent presently came to path saw at once that be very different from others be regularly cut sloping gradually down face of sharp descent be wide enough for cart to pas at once took way down moving with greatest caution lest sentry must be posted distance below be very dark for in many place tree met overhead about halfway down suddenly came to stop for in front of rose bank breast high here if anywhere sentry must have be placed holding companion arm james listened intently for time mind what be doing said in whisper be breastwork probably path be cut away on other side fortunately be so far down hill now that there be not much risk of hearing slight noise might make stand here till find out what be on other side james climbed over breastwork cautiously let go on other side fell five six foot come on said in low voice lower down by arm can reach leg then gap cut in path be ten foot across six foot deep when with difficulty clambered up on other side found path obstructed by number of felled tree forming thick abattis managed to climb steep hillside kept along until past obstruction then got on to path again found unbroken to bottom so far so good james said now do stop here while crawl forward to water first thing to discover be whether have sentinel stationed anywhere near bottom of path time seemed terribly long to middleton before james returned though be really few minute right said a approached there be one here though can hear sentry farther up river now can come forward have drink fortunately river be high after having satisfied thirst middleton asked where be going now care how far have got to march for after drink feel ready for anything wo do to hide anywhere near james said for if boat come to take off be to be seen must put on guard there must be plenty of sentry about here in future will keep along at foot of precipice till be about halfway a far a can tell between samos sillery then will climb up a high a can get show signal in morning must be careful a walk for a told there be sentry posted by water edge higher up will be careful fear midshipman said there be not much fear of fellow walking about in dark without boot not being careful knocked toe against rock just now be a much a must to halloa will be careful in future can tell hour walking brought to spot where hill be rather le steep than usual climbed up until gained spot fifty foot above level of river there sat down in clump of bush a soon a be daylight will choose spot where can show signal without risk of be being seen from below james said must go to sleep for must move directly dawn commences else sentry below might make out at daybreak shifted position gained spot completely hidden from below from entire view of river must be obtained tide will be low in couple of hour midshipman said there be fleet below will come up with first flood so in three four hour will be abreast of hope will make out signal have fear of james replied be sure to keep sharp lookout for presently tide grew slacker hour later ship be seen to hoist sail soon began to drop slowly up river when approached james fastened handkerchief against trunk of tree well open to view from river then stood with eye fixed on approaching ship just a sutherland came abreast of spot where be standing ensign be dipped james at once removed handkerchief now said middleton can turn in take sleep at twelve o'clock tonight there will be boat below for two three hour after darkness have fallen james companion made way down slope crawled out to water edge there be sentry within hearing sat down by edge of river until suddenly light gleamed for instant low down on water two three hundred yard from shore at once stepped into river wading out for little distance struck out towards where have seen light few minute swimming saw something dark ahead few stroke took alongside be hauled into boat slight noise attracted attention of sentry little distance along shore qui vive came sharply across water followed few second later by flash of gun crew now bent to oar quarter of hour later boat be alongside sutherland with consort be slowly drifting up stream general wolfe admiral be on deck anxiously waiting arrival of boat former in anxiety hailed boat a approached be captain james walsham on board yes sir james replied bravo bravo general cried delighted bravo repeated seizing james walsham hand a stepped on deck did not expect to see again captain walsham at least until took quebec now come to cabin at once tell about perhaps be hungry be rather hungry general james said quietly have have nothing to eat crust of bread for three day who be general asked quickly mr middleton sir escaped after have left joined galley fire be out admiral said will have cold meat in cabin instantly james be at once led to cabin where in two three minute food bottle of wine be placed before general must not allow to speak word till hunger be satisfied then when saw lay down knife fork said now captain walsham in first place have succeeded have found practicable path down to river have found path sir be cut in one place blocked with felled tree obstacle can be passed there be canadian in tent near top of path seem to keep very careless watch sentry be placed at bottom on edge of river anywhere near admirable admirable wolfe exclaimed at last there be chance of outreaching montcalm be not seen examining path nothing occurred to excite suspicion lead to keep better lookout in future sir james replied have have suspicion of presence anywhere near spot where be taken off be two mile higher moved away in order that if be seen swimming off to boat suspicion must occur that have be reconnoitring pathway be right general said now tell whole story of what have be doing in own way james related adventure up to time when be joined by midshipman what made mr middleton escape admiral asked thought that instruction be precise that be to permit to be taken prisoner be to remain quietly in quebec until must either exchange take place be how understood instruction sir james said must rather that must question a to reason for escaping may say appear to to be perfectly valid a occurrence took place upon be impossible for captain peter to calculate when gave james then finished report of proceeding general wolfe expressed great satisfaction at result will put in order tomorrow for brevet majority said never be rank more honourably earned admiral rang hand bell send mr middleton to where be be having supper in captain peter cabin ask captain peter if will be good enough to come in with minute later captain peter entered followed by midshipman suppose peter have be asking young middleton reason why did not carry out instruction have admiral captain peter said gravely be only waiting until be disengaged to report circumstance to have better tell sir own way captain peter then took seat at table while midshipman related story in nearly same word in have told to james when told of account canadian pilot have given of escape admiral exclaimed seems altogether incredible that one have unbolted man cabin from outside seems manifest be clear that gross treachery gross carelessness enabled to get free own although sergeant of marine declares positively that fastened bolt think that must not have done so for treachery seems almost out of question that officer must have done seems impossible yet what man say about cabin being let out by rope must seem to show that must have be officer be sorry to say sir middleton said that man gave proof of truth of what be saying officer said gave paper heard saw general reading aloud be warning captain walsham have purposely allowed to be captured that be in fact spy french officer in haste laid down paper on table when rushed out have just time to creep under canvas seize make off with here be sir have showed to captain peter admiral took paper read handed without word to general wolfe be proof conclusive said peter do know handwriting yes captain peter said gravely recognized at once a did mr middleton be handwriting of lieutenant horton what on earth must be motive of unhappy young man admiral asked imagine sir from what saw on evening before captain walsham set out indeed from what captain walsham said when questioned that be case of private enmity against captain walsham be so captain walsham general wolfe asked have enmity against sir james said though own that manner impressed with idea that regarded a enemy fact be lived near other a boy have fight got best of gave account of affair be not exactly correct to uncle mr linthorne wealthy landowner magistrate latter have up at justice room brought forward witness who gave account of affair mr linthorne considered that nephew whom have at time regarded a heir have not given correct account be so angry that sent to sea must say sir said earnestly be possible must have wished unhappy affair to be passed over impossible admiral general said together fear be impossible now sir james said gravely might have be stopped before captain walsham wanted to tear up note midshipman put in though be awfully sorry such thing must happen to officer of sutherland be obliged to refuse to do so a thought be duty to hand note to certainly be mr middleton admiral said there can be question about wonder that even suggested thing captain walsham general remarked be not private affair whole success of enterprise be jeopardized be sir james said quietly must remember that at time asked mr middleton to tear up note have ceased to be jeopardized for have got fairly away be under great obligation to mr linthorne must do much to save pain regarded act not a one of treason against country a one of personal enmity to myself be sure that lieutenant horton did not think of harm that letter might do to cause be blinded by passion against conduct doe credit to heart captain walsham if not to head general wolfe said admiral rang bell tell lieutenant horton wish to speak to order corporal with file of marine to be at door messenger found lieutenant horton pacing quarterdeck with hurried step on receipt of message instead of going directly to admiral cabin ran down below caught something from shelf by berth placed in breast of coat then went to admiral cabin corporal with two marine have already taken station there young officer drew deep breath entered deadly fear have seized from moment saw signal of james walsham although seemed impossible to that treachery must have be discovered sudden summons at hour of night confirmed fear be with face almost a pale a death that entered cabin lieutenant horton admiral said be accused of having assisted in escape of pilot who be prisoner on board ship be further accused of releasing with special purpose that plan general wolfe have laid to obtain information might be thwarted who accuses richard horton asked captain walsham be enemy have for year intrigued against sought to do harm be companion of smuggler be captured by thetis have choice of being sent to prison tried for share in killing of of coast guard of going before mast be lieutenant in thetis at time suppose because did not then interfere on behalf have now trumped up accusation against accusation defy to prove be mistaken lieutenant horton admiral said captain walsham be not accuser nay more have committed grave dereliction of duty in trying to screen by endeavouring to destroy principal evidence against mr middleton overheard conversation between canadian pilot french general former described how have be liberated by english officer who assisted to escape by rope from porthole in cabin see that be evidence against richard horton said in first place man may have be lying in second place unless mentioned name why be suspected more than other officer even if did mention name word be surely a good a of canadian prisoner be probable that man be released by one of crew man perhaps who owed grudge who told to say that be who freed in hope that day outrageous story might get about suggestion be plausible mr horton admiral said coldly unfortunately be not on word of canadian that have to depend there sir said holding out letter there be chief witness against captain peter instantly recognized handwriting a mr middleton have done before richard horton stood gazing speechlessly at letter so confounded be by unexpected production of fatal missive that be unable to utter single word of explanation excuse lay sword on table sir admiral said retire to cabin where will remain under close arrest till court martial can be assembled richard horton unbuckled sword laid on table left cabin without word must have be better to send guard with captain peter said might jump overboard blow brain out quite so peter admiral said very thing be in mind when told to retire to cabin very best thing must do for for service nice scandal must be to have to try hang naval officer for treachery be sure agree with general thoroughly general said let blow brain out desert have best keep sharp lookout that doe not desert at present after have once effected landing must say keep a careless watch over a possible let go before be bad enough that french know captain walsham went ashore for purpose of discovering landing place must be worse be to become aware that have rejoined ship that be taken off by boat within couple of mile of spot where mean to land admiral be right richard horton have when summoned to cabin hastily placed pistol in bosom with intention of blowing out brain must find that discovery dreaded have be made have marine posted outside cabin be ordered to accompany must at once have carried purpose into execution finding free walked to cabin still determined to blow out brain before morning impulse once past must not summon up resolution to carry resolve into effect must do said to before court martial came on must be time enough be decision arrived at when morning dawned upon lying despairing in cot chapter capture of quebec on day on received james report wolfe issued order for attack colonel burton at point levi be to bring up man who must be spared to assist in enterprise officer accordingly marched to spot indicated for embarkation after with men a night approached main fleet under admiral saunders below quebec ranged opposite beauport opened tremendous cannonade while boat be lowered filled with sailor marine montcalm believing that movement of english above town be only feint that main body be still below massed troop in front of beauport to repel expected landing to colonel howe of light infantry be given honour of leading little party who be to suddenly attack vergor camp at head of path james walsham knowing way be to accompany a second in command twenty four picked men volunteered to follow thirty large troop boat boat belonging to ship be in readiness men took place in tide be still flowing better to deceive french vessel boat be allowed to drift upwards for little distance a if to attempt to effect landing above cap rouge wolfe have day gained intelligence must assist to deceive enemy for learned that number of boat laden with provision from quebec be coming down with tide wolfe be on board sutherland be somewhat stronger than have be for day felt presentiment that must die in approaching battle about two o'clock tide began to ebb two lantern signal for troop to put off be shown in rigging of sutherland fortune favoured english bougainville have watched vessel until saw begin to drift down again with stream thinking that must return again with flood a have done for last seven day allowed weary troop to retire to camp battalion of guienne instead of encamping near height have remained on saint charles vergor incapable cowardly officer have gone quietly to bed have allowed number of canadian under to go away to village to assist in getting in harvest for two hour english boat drifted down with stream a neared destination suddenly be challenged by french sentry officer who spoke language replied france quel regiment de la reine officer replied knowing that part of regiment be with sentry believing that be expected provision boat allowed to pas on few hundred yard further sentry challenged same officer replied in french provision boat make noise english will hear few minute later boat rowed up to strand at foot of height vergor have placed no sentry on shore troop landed unchallenged guided by james walsham colonel howe with twenty four volunteer led way a silently a must moved up pathway until gained top saw before outline of tent went at with rush vergor leaped from bed tried to run off be shot in heel captured men taken by surprise made little resistance one two be caught rest fled main body of troop be waiting for most part in boat by edge of bank not word be spoken a men listened almost breathlessly for sound must tell whether enterprise have succeeded suddenly stillness be broken by musketry on top of height followed by loud british cheer then leapt from boat man with musket slung at back scaled rock a best might narrow path have be made impassable by trench abattis obstruction be soon cleared away stream of soldier poured steadily up a soon a sufficient number have gained plateau strong party be sent off to seize battery at samos sillery have just opened fire upon boat ship be easily done english footing on plateau be assured a fast a boat be emptied of men rowed back to ship to fetch more whole force be soon on shore day began to break few minute after advanced troop have gained height before be fairly daylight first party be drawn up in line ready to resist attack enemy be in sight body of canadian who have sallied from town on hearing firing moved along strand towards landing place have be quickly driven back for present other sign of enemy be to be seen wolfe reconnoitred ground found suitable place for battle at spot known a plain of abraham from pilot of name who have owned piece of land there in early day of colony be tract of grass with cornfield here there studded by clump of bush on south be bounded by steep fall down to saint lawrence on north sloped gradually down to saint charles led troop to spot formed in line across plateau facing city right wing rested on edge of height along saint lawrence left did not extend far enough to reach slope down to saint charles to prevent being outflanked on wing brigadier townshend be stationed here with two battalion drawn up at right angle to rest facing saint charles webb regiment formed reserve d battalion of royal american be left to guard landing howe light infantry occupied wood far in rear of force to check bougainville must approach from direction wolfe with three brigadier commanded main body when troop have arrived numbered le than three thousand five hundred men quebec be le than mile distant from spot where troop be posted in order of battle intervening ridge hid from sight of troop at six o'clock white uniform of battalion of guienne have marched up in hot haste from camp on saint charles made appearance on ridge halted there awaiting reinforcement shortly afterwards there be outbreak of hot firing in rear where light troop under colonel howe repulsed detachment of bougainville command came up attacked montcalm have be on alert night gun of saunders fleet thundered unceasingly opposite beauport boat hovered near shore threatening landing night french troop remained in intrenchment accompanied by chevalier johnston remained night in anxious expectation felt that critical moment have come must not tell from direction blow be to arrive have sent officer to vaudreuil whose quarter be near quebec begging to send word instantly must anything occur above town just at daybreak heard sound of cannon from direction be battery at samos opening fire upon english ship word came from vaudreuil about six o'clock montcalm mounted accompanied by johnston rode towards town a approached bridge across saint charles country behind town opened to view presently saw red line of british troop drawn up on height above river two mile away instantly sent johnston off at full gallop to bring up troop from centre left vaudreuil have already ordered up on right montcalm rode up to vaudreuil quarter after few word with governor galloped over bridge of saint charles towards seat of danger must have be bitter moment for fruit of long care watching be in moment snatched away just when hoped that enemy foiled exhausted be about to return to england found that have surmounted obstacle have deemed impregnable be calmly awaiting on fair field of battle one who saw said that rode towards field with fixed look uttering not word army followed in hot haste crossed saint charles passed through quebec hurried on to ridge where battalion of guienne have taken up position nothing must have be stronger than contrast two army afforded on one side be red english line quiet silent save that war pipe of highlander blew loud shrilly on other be white coated battalion of regular army of france blue clad canadian band of indian in war paint feather hurried excited by rapid march by danger have so unexpectedly burst upon now evil of divided command be apparent vaudreuil countermanded montcalm order for advance of left of army a feared that english might make descent upon beauport be garrison of quebec available for ramesay commander be under order of vaudreuil when montcalm sent to for twenty five field gun from one of battery only sent three saying that wanted rest for own defence montcalm held council of war with officer determined to attack at once for have be blamed that must have fought be certain for english in position occupied cut off from base of supply might have waited for few hour in time must have sent messenger brought up force of bougainville must have marched by circuitous route have joined without coming in contact with english upon other hand montcalm have reason to believe that thirty five hundred men saw before formed portion only of english army that rest be still on board fleet opposite beauport that delay must bring larger reinforcement to wolfe than must receive be a know mistaken reasoning be sound have along believed english army to be far more numerous than really be be doubtless influenced by fact that troop be full of ardour that delay must greatly dispirit canadian indian therefore determined to attack at once three field piece sent by ramesay opened fire upon english line with canister while fifteen hundred canadian indian crept up among bush knoll through cornfield opened heavy fire wolfe threw out skirmisher in front of line to keep assailant in check ordered rest of troop to lie down to avoid fire on british left attack be most galling band of sharpshooter got among thicket just below edge of declivity down to saint charles from from several house scattered there killed wounded considerable number of townshend men howe be called up with light troop from rear two flank battalion of townshend dashed at thicket after sharp fighting partially cleared took burned of house towards ten o'clock french advanced to attack centre be formed of regular troop only with regular canadian battalion on flank two field piece with enormous labour english have dragged up path from landing place at once opened fire with grape upon french line advance be badly conducted french regular marched steadily on canadian firing a advanced threw on ground to reload broke regularity of line english advanced little distance to meet foe then halted not shot be fired until french be within forty pace then at word of command volley of musketry crashed out along whole length of line so regularly be volley given that french officer afterwards said that sounded like single cannon shot volley followed then continuous roar of independent firing when smoke cleared off little effect must be seen french have halted where stood among dead wounded be thickly strewn order regularity have be lost under terrible fire in three minute line of advancing soldier be broken up into disorderly shouting mob then gave order to charge british cheer mingled with wild yell of highlander rose loud fierce english regiment advanced with levelled bayonet highlander drew broadsword rushed headlong forward charge be decisive french be swept helplessly before battle be at end save that scattered party of canadian indian kept up for time fire from bush cornfield fire be heaviest on british right where wolfe led charge at head of louisbourg grenadier shot shattered wrist wrapped handkerchief around kept on shot struck still advanced when third pierced breast staggered sat down two three officer men carried to rear then laid down asked if must send for surgeon there be need said be over with moment later one of standing by cried out run see how run who run wolfe asked enemy sir give way everywhere go one of to colonel burton wolfe said tell to march webb regiment down to charles river to cut off retreat from bridge then turning on side said now god be praised will die in peace few minute later expired montcalm still on horseback be borne by tide of fugitive towards town a neared gate shot passed through body needed hard work before canadian who fought bravely must be cleared out from thicket french troop did not rally from disorder till have crossed saint charles canadian retired in better order decisive a victory be english for moment be in condition to follow up while on french side montcalm be dying second in command be mortally wounded on english wolfe be dead monckton second in rank badly wounded command have fallen upon townshend at moment when enemy be in full flight knowing that french must cut bridge of boat across saint charles so stop pursuit that bougainville be close at hand halted troop set to work to intrench on field of battle loss have be six hundred sixty four of rank killed wounded while french loss be estimated at about double that number in point of number engaged in total loss on side fight on plain of abraham doe not deserve to rank a great battle result be of most extreme importance for victory transferred canada from france to england vaudreuil after joining force with of bougainville must have still vastly outnumbered english must by taking up fresh position in rear have rendered impregnable until winter forced english to retire while latter have mean of investing besieging quebec weakness be now a great a presumption have be before on evening of battle abandoned line of beauport leaving tent store behind retreated hastily rather may be said fled for a chevalier johnston said of be not retreat abominable flight with such disorder confusion have english known three hundred men sent after must have be sufficient to have cut army to piece soldier be mixed scattered dispersed running a hard a must a if english army be at heel flight be continued until reached impregnable position of jacques cartier on brink of saint lawrence thirty mile from scene of action montcalm died in quebec next morning levi soon arrived at jacques cartier from montreal took command at once attempted to restore order persuaded vaudreuil to march back to join bougainville who have remained firmly with command at cap rouge while horde of fugitive swept by vaudreuil before leaving have given order to ramesay to surrender if quebec be threatened by assault levi on march to relief be met by news on morning of th ramesay have surrendered garrison be utterly dispirited unwilling to fight officer be even more anxious to surrender than men on fleet approaching wall ramesay obeyed vaudreuil order surrendered
