foolish a to make proviso two person who be a yet so young who may not in way be suitable to other must marry nothing must please so much a that must take fancy to other thrown together a must be here for mabel be constantly at house be just possible that one of boy girl affection do sometimes although perhaps rarely culminate in marriage might spring up between whether may be so in present case must leave to fate must at rate like to pave way for such arrangement by bringing young people together need not say that will be best that of must have slightest idea of what be in mind for must be almost certain to defeat object if proposal be agreeable to hope that will let ralph come to at beginning of holiday must fancy be now near at hand think will be a well that must not know of intention

expressed wish for meeting have never year made effort to see must read in wording of letter that have be principally deterred from making attempt to see by feeling that have entirely forfeited regard have offended beyond chance of forgiveness have be asked day before must doubtless have replied that have wish whatever ever again to meet herbert penfold whereas now felt almost aggrieved that must express wish to meet must have stayed away so long without making one effort to bring about reconciliation of fault that man can have said pettishly think there be one so detestable a of self distrust

school be taught to sit upright to behave discreetly to be general unnatural mabel have be brought up at home allowed to do a liked have consequently grown up what nature intended to be perhaps day girl will be allowed same chance of being natural that boy have backboard other contrivance for stiffening turning into little wooden figure will be unknown will be good thing in opinion when time arrives ralph be often down at rectory where be always made welcome mr withers wife being anxious to learn a much of disposition a must be well satisfied with result fancy know what be in penfold mind rector have said to wife few day after ralph came down believe have already quite settled in mind that day mabel lad will make match of how absurd john why mabel be only child quite so dear in three

gentleman be quite good enough to begin with at rate there be nothing for to trouble about if day young people get to like other prospect be good one for child if not there be harm done at present there can be objection to yielding to penfold request letting ride about country together mabel be a say little more than child be evident that lad regard rather in light of boy companion than a girl be bit of tomboy know mary have very few girlish notion idea evidently get on capitally together need not trouble head about let thing go own way with clear conscience at end of time agreed upon ralph returned home so ralph have found better than expected mother said to at conclusion of first meal at home much better mother mr penfold be awfully kind let one do just what one like sister be hateful woman if have not be staying in house must certainly have played trick other just to pay out wonder why disliked so much must see directly arrived after did matter much except just at meal in evening

gentleman be never content unless boat be heeling over gunnel under passing everything come across what be good of ere to fisherman go out to catch fish not to strain craft over by running race against now hour faster slower make difference heartsease be fast enough for anyhow be joe have heard use bad language enough when anything overhaul pass on way back to port ay may be fisherman admitted on way home grant that little more speed might be advantage for first comer be sure to get best market heartsease ai very fast own up to be safe steady have plenty of storage room good roomy cabin a can stand upright in need break back by stooping a have to do on board craft must name be true enough joe boy said what be more be lucky boat for be seldom that go out without getting good

before afternoon much expect so joe have got to call at other place suppose will have time to get down before if be coming will be sure to be punctual so if be not here by four go off without mr conway made objection when ralph proffered request have sacrificed greater part of holiday to carrying out wish paying visit to mr penfold although did not like being out night fishing must not refuse request indeed a knew that joe knight be steady man not fond of bottle there be good reason why must object therefore cheerfully assented saying at same time will pack basket for before start ralph there be nice piece of cold meat in house will have loaf of bread cheese put up for know what fishing excursion be intend to be back at certain time then wind fall tide turn something of sort ca make harbor know what fright gave very first time went out fishing with joe knight be to have be back at five o'clock in afternoon did not get in until three o'clock next morning remember mother there be on quay when came in be awfully sorry about well have learned better since ralph know now that there be not necessarily danger even if come back by time expect of course time have fidgeted have come back safe have learned certain amount of sea knowledge have come to know that sailor fisherman be not accountable for time that if wind drop tide turn be helpless in matter have only to wait till breeze come up again think mother ought to like going out at night better than in daytime why ralph because mother if go out in daytime get back until after dark worry having one to talk to sit here wondering wondering until fancy sort of thing now if go out in evening come back in morning at hour expect see that be fine bright that there be nothing to make uneasy if do feel fidgety can walk down to beach talk to boatman fisherman of course can tell at once that there be nothing to worry about very likely point boat out to in distance well ralph perhaps be so although own never looked at in light before chapter iii run down there be nice breeze ralph said a joined fisherman at appointed hour yes be just right too light too heavy be rather thick must be surprised if get thicker again matter for in day not one ship plowed water of coast for fifty now make way along there be steamer fear of collision be not ever in mind of at sea where bill joe young scamp fisherman said angrily nothing will do for to go climbing up cliff morning just after left news come that young varmint have fallen down twisted foot doctor say will be fortnight afore can put boot on then old woman began cry over while a told if one ought to cry must be who be got to hire boy in place to do work touch of strap must be best thing for young rascal be not going to take boy out to night be joe master conway know like doing thing have be out enough with to know a much about a bill after there ai very great deal to do trawl ai heavy one a be accustomed to work with bill can do with heartsease be good sized half decked boat of twenty six foot long eight foot beam be very deep carried three ton of stone ballast in bottom drew about six foot of water have lot of freeboard carried two lug sail small mizzen got in small boat rowed off to there be call for to bring basket master conway know be fond of fish fried just when be taken out of water have got bread keg of beer to say nothing of mouthful of spirit in case get wet not that look likely will for doubt if there will be rain to night think there will be more wind perhaps that will get thicker view of weather sailed straight out to sea joe have fitted boat to be worked with aid of boy only have handy winch by hoisted heavy lug sail when weather be rough hauled up trawl of carried two fourteen foot long fished with one out on quarter when reached fishing ground six mile out joe lowered mizzen lug reefed main for there be plenty of wind to keep boat going at pace required for trawling under reduced sail then trawl be got overboard being fastened to end of stout spar lashed across deck projecting eight foot on side by arrangement trawl be kept well apart be hauled alternately once hour two hour being allowed after be put down before first be examined by time first net came up sun have set wind have freshened bit since have started there be sea to speak of night have set in thick star must only occasionally be seen joe have picked out two three fine fish from first haul took down soon have frizzling in frying pan over fire have lighted a soon a boat be under sail be for master conway said with permission will stick to ere piece of beef mother be good enough to send fish ai no treat to often get meat keep eye lifting while be down below there ai many craft about in day still might tumble against one must not see light far in mist joe must what be worse many of carry light at must be good thing joe if there be law to make vessel carry light ay ay lad see in war time ai always convenient peaceful merchantman want to show light to privateer may happen to be cruising about may be sure that privateer want to attract attention of peaceful trader until be close upon to come under eye of of cruiser there ai many light shown now not in water folk prefer to risk chance of running into other rather than of being caught by french privateer now that trawl be out there be occasion for one to attend to helm consequently when joe announced that fish be ready ralph went down joined in cabin first hour of night passed quietly once hour trawl be hauled in got on board a catch be satisfactory joe be in capital spirit have brought good luck master conway notice generally do well when be out with be getting more fish to night than have night for week if go on like till morning will make good thing of want bad enough for be in arrears bit with rent war have made everything so terrible dear that be a much a poor man can do to keep head above water what time be now joe do think about two o'clock reckon will begin to get light in couple of hour at five will up net make way back have scarcely spoken when shouted ship ahoy look out for lad startled by suddenness of cry ralph looked round saw crest of white foam few yard away in darkness moment later something dark passed over head rope brushed cheek a did so black mass struck boat there be crash shock heartsease after first heeling deeply over under pressure suddenly sank down like stone ralph have staggered under force of collision must have fallen back a boat heeled over instinctively threw up arm hand came in contact with rope have instant before touched cheek seized with hand threw leg round a boat went down from under foot whole thing being so sudden that be nearly minute before must realize what have happened then heard voice talking close by a seemed above hullo shouted help few second later light of lantern be flashed down upon then figure crawled out on spar projecting above head seized by collar lifted from bobstay to be clinging on to bowsprit minute later be standing on deck thank exclaimed have seen anything of man who be with there be two of on board if not please look for at once be afraid be use one of men said with strong foreign accent have gone down will never come up again come along with to captain uneasy feeling seized ralph a listened must see nothing for lantern have be placed in bucket moment that touched deck at moment hail came from stern of vessel ralph fear be at once realized for be in french reply be in same tongue be led aft take down below jacques let see what be like have suffered damage hope not a far a must see by light of lantern carpenter have gone below to see if be making water captain led way down into cabin be comfortably furnished lighted by swinging lamp do come down jacques will want to interpret captain be surprised when saw by light of lamp that person have rescued be lad well dressed evidently above condition of fisherman now young sir who be asked what have to say for question be translated by jacques like that lad said indignantly what have to say for think be what have to say for yourselves be quietly fishing when ran over sank boat drowned friend joe have even stopped for moment to see if must pick up call shameful inhuman french captain laughed a jacques translated speech purport of have indeed made out for for although did not speak english understood to extent tell be fault a much a ours did not see till struck a for companion what chance be there of finding on dark night a why by time have hove round got back again might not have hit within quarter of mile besides if have be alive must have shouted ralph saw when understood what captain said that there be truth in word that chance of discovering joe must indeed have be slight even have vessel headed round may ask said what ship be what be going to do with ship be la belle marie of dunkirk a to what be going to do with be not so easy to say of course can jump overboard again if like if not can stay on board until have opportunity of putting ashore somewhere how did come to be on board fishing smack for suppose be smack that run down live at dover ralph replied have only come out for night fishing well be out of luck captain said will do jacques take forward sling hammock for hang up clothes in cook galley will be dry by time wake ralph asked question a be taken forward a to character of la belle marie six gun be ranged along on side of deck appearance of captain cabin be sufficient to inform that have fallen into hand of french privateer craft have indeed left dunkirk soon after be making way down channel with sail set when have run down unfortunate fishing boat jacques a hung up hammock explained to sailor who crowded round character of passenger who have so unexpectedly come on board poor lad one of sailor said good naturedly will be time before see mother again have got very bright lookout before long voyage then prison will go see if cook have got water hot glass of spirit will do good few minute later ralph be wrapped up in blanket warm glow produced by glass of strong grog soon sufficed to send soundly to sleep in spite of painful uncertainty of position of sorrowful thought of mother who must in morning be inquiring for in vain be nearly midday before woke looking round saw that have forecastle to clothes be lying on chest close by in few minute be on deck sense of disappointment stole over have while be dressing entertained hope that on going on deck must see english cruiser in pursuit wind have dropped be still thick vision be confined to circle quarter of mile in diameter jacques nodded to good temperedly for on board privateer be in high spirit voyage have begun propitiously darkness of preceding night have enabled to run gantlet of british cruiser in narrow part of channel be now well down coast of france fog reduced chance of being seen by enemy to minimum where about be ralph asked be somewhere off mouth of seine guess fifteen mile from land oh be working down channel then ralph said where be going to ah question be for captain to answer if chooses jacques said be going to touch at next french port ralph asked anxiously not that know of unless have luck to pick up one of merchantman might then escort into port unless do that touch anywhere luckily for because after be good deal pleasanter cruising in belle marie than kicking heel inside prison know pretty well for be for four year prisoner in english town of dorchester be how came to speak language be weary time of though be not badly treated not so bad a have heard that men in other prison be so owe english ill will on account from what have heard of prison be worse than of yours used to knit stocking wrap for neck old mother taught when be boy a be allowed to sell thing made got on pretty comfortable beside what be use of making unhappy have wife child to be fretting about at home so kept up spirit how did get back ralph asked be exchanged jacques answered might have waited long enough before ca make out why two government agree to exchange prisoner more quickly suppose take about equal number men of war ship capture more prisoner than ours make up for by number privateer bring in at rate might exchange a many a can say once in six month one must have thought must be glad to do so so a to save trouble expense of looking after feeding such number of useless mouth government always have curious way how did get away from prison ralph asked be woman man replied be always woman who help men out of scrape be wife of one of jailer used to bring husband dinner sometimes when be exercising in yard when first went there have child in arm little thing about year old be always fond of child for have lot at home brother sister be eldest saw look at one day suppose guessed reminded of home so stopped let pat cheek talk to then knitted sock little jacket other thing that made sort of friendship between can always win woman heart by taking notice of child then got to letting carry about on shoulder while took husband dinner in to if did not happen to be in yard when little thing be able to totter must hold on to finger be always content to stay with while be away so went on till child be four year old one day be running across court to mother a came out from prison two of men be what call skylarking running one way while child be running other one of knocked down heavily be accident if have picked up be sorry there must have be end of instead of that brute burst into loud laugh by time be a fond of child a if have be own rushed furiously at knocked down a sprang to foot drew knife used in wood carving came at caught blow on arm closed with fell together guard in yard rushed up pulled apart got fortnight close confinement for fighting first time came into yard again met woman with child little one ran to woman little to surprise said nothing a passed lifted child up after giving hug kiss said beammy gave to give to ' put little note into hand took first opportunity to read in quiet corner be a follows 'dear jacques saw how nobly stood up for carrie other day how got wounded in protecting have always be good to have often thought might help to escape be afraid to try now will do so will not be easy will manage be impatient child will give note when have quite arranged thing will not talk much to in future else when have got away may be suspected so be surprised at seeming cold ' after that woman only brought child once week so to prison only gave nod a passed through yard upon third visit of child gave little packet containing two three small steel saw little bottle of oil on paper held be written 'for bar will have rope next time sure enough next time child have hidden in frock hank of very thin cord managed a be playing with to slip unobserved into breast say more next time next time hank came there be third note 'twist three rope together will be strong enough to bear on third night from saw through bar lower into court there will be moon go to right hand corner of court in rear of prison fasten knife to one end of cord throw over wall will be waiting there with friend directly feel cord jerked climb up to top of wall if can find something to fasten end of rope to can slide down if not must jump there will be boat ready to take away ' turned out well be pitch dark night raining blowing sentry kept inside box got up to top of wall right be able to fasten rope on to spike slide down on other side woman be there with man whom told be brother took to creek two mile away there put on board boat be rowed out to smuggling craft at once set sail two day later be landed at cherbourg so be how came to learn english did ever hear whether woman who helped be suspected saw brother two month afterward on one of trip that craft belonged to made said that of course there be great many inquiry made sister have be questioned closely swore that have hardly spoken to for last two month that have given nothing in way be true enough for have not handed to prisoner bore out about not coming near for have be noticed that be not a friendly a have be have thought ungrateful while others have fancied that be angry at interfering making tumult about child anyhow suspicion might have have must prove nothing forbade entering prison in future did mind so long a husband who have be employed good many year there did not lose situation have be kept by in entire ignorance of whole affair be very indignant at having be suspected sent letter of thanks by brother little present for one for child brother be to give to a if from so that husband must not smell rat of course to make understand who came from well only hope jacques ralph said that when get shut up in one of prison will find french woman to aid to escape just a found english woman to help only hope wo be four year coming about think look sharper after prisoner than do still may be will be time before be in prison if play card well learn to speak language make useful think captain be likely to hand over to authority when get back to french port again be quite ready to do best to learn language to make useful ralph said be always good thing to know french especially a be going into army day be if get back again in time oh think will do so man said keep up spirit well be great thing there be many boy must sit down cry if found in scrape a have got into cry ralph repeated indignantly suppose boy of age be going to cry like girl english boy must be ashamed to cry especially when frenchman be looking on jacques laughed good temperedly there must be nothing to be ashamed of be not like cold english frenchman laugh sings when be pleased cry when be sorry why must oh ca tell why ralph replied only do say must halloo out if be hurt very much though must try best not to feel sure must cry like great baby why what must be good of jacques shrugged shoulder people be different said man be not coward because cry have seen two boy fighting pulling other hair cry time fought on did not cry because be afraid pulling other hair ralph repeated contemptuously ought to have be ashamed of of call that fighting at must call disgusting why in england even girl must hardly pull other hair have seen two three fight between fishwomen in dover even did not go on like if be way french boy fight wonder soldier sailor here struck ralph that remark be about to make must be altogether out of place under present circumstance be therefore seized with opportune fit of coughing then turned conversation by asking jacques at what rate thought vessel be slipping through water few minute later first mate came up told jacques to inform ralph that captain have ordered to be supplied with clothes similar to worn by rest of crew that be to be told off to take post regularly a boy in starboard watch ralph be well pleased at news felt that best chance be to make useful on board to become one of crew a soon a possible so that in case english merchantman be met with captured must not be sent with crew a prisoner to french port a long a be on board various opportunity of escape might present might slip away in port brig might be captured by english cruiser privateer whereas once lodged in french prison chance of such good fortune a have befallen jacques be slight indeed therefore at once turned to with alacrity that must have hard time of for bit felt sure for although in jacques have evidently found friend saw by scowling glance of several of men a passed near that national feeling told heavily against be surprising that must be so animosity between two nation have lasted so long that have extended to individual englishman despised a well a disliked frenchman be ready to admit that might be brave considered a altogether wanting in personal strength popular belief be that be half starved existed chiefly upon frog hot water with few bit of bread scrap of vegetable in called soup that upon sea especially be almost contemptible certainly long succession of naval victory that fleet have won afforded justification for sailor opinion of enemy in fight between detached vessel french showed many time that in point of courage be in way inferior to own men indeed victory be mainly due to two cause in first place superior physique stamen of men result partly of race partly of feeding be consequently able to work gun faster longer than must adversary in second place british sailor went into battle with absolute conviction that be going to be victorious while frenchman on other hand although determined to do best to win have from first doubt whether british must not be a usual victorious be probable that french sailor hated far more than men did have lowered national prestige have defeated whenever met have blockaded port ruined trade inflicted immense damage upon fishery subsidized other nation against be heart center of coalition against france be struggling to maintain be not therefore surprising that among hundred ten men on board la belle marie there be many who viewed ralph with hostile eye who only refrained from personal violence owing to strict order captain have given that must be well treated toward midday fog lifted suddenly wind freshened lookout be stationed in top there be little hope indeed of english merchantman having come over so far toward french coast british cruiser might be anywhere few distant sail must be seen far out on horizon proceeding up down channel captain of la belle marie have idea of commencing operation until very much further away from shore of england day vessel ran down french coast although be captive mile reeled off log took further from home ralph must not help admiring speed at brig slipped through water cutting wave with sharp bow leaving scarcely ripple behind so fine clean be run very different be smooth gliding motion from quick plunge shock of bluff bowed fishing boat to be accustomed sail have be scrubbed until there be not speck upon mast be lofty tapering rigging neat trim stay a taut a iron must fight ship better than french a far a building rigging went be vastly superior la belle marie looked to ralph almost like gentleman yacht in cleanness order in respect vied with men of war that have so often watched from height of dover have however little time for admiration for be kept at work rubbing polishing gun brass work be not idle for minute from time came on deck dressed a cabin boy on morning after be picked up until sunset there be two french boy about own age forward a soon a work be done evening watch set began to torment for acting a did a servant to officer did not take share in watch fortunately jacques have gone below at same time a ralph when boy finding that taunt have effect upon ralph began to get bolder one of snatched off cap jacques interfered at once look here youngster said young english boy be at present one of crew of brig have just same right to fair treatment a one else so warn if interfere with will have to fight fairly know enough of english boy to know that with hand must not have least chance with must thrash at once for even little english boy wrestle tear kick hit straight out just a men do with sword must be different in row between must be just naked hand so advise to leave alone for if make fight will see fair play time be prisoner in england be well treated by people just a be treated saw other french prisoner treated so will see treated before voyage be over be not impossible table will be turned that may find yourselves prisoner in hand of english so recommend to behave to in same way must like to be treated yourselves if be taken prisoner can see lad be good tempered willing be stranger here among ca speak word of language have right to fair treatment when get to know language will be able to shift for until doe mean to look after one who play trick on have got to talk to a jacques clery be one of most powerful active men on board brig assertion be sufficient to put stop to practical joking with ralph lad have much easier time of than expected men finding willing to work anxious to oblige in way soon took to by paying attention to talk asking french name of object on board ship be not many day before ralph found able so far to understand that must obey order pull haul on sheet needed handling upon second day wind having dropped again more sail be set when word be given to go aloft went up with rest although be of little practical use in loosing gasket soon shook off first feeling of discomfort nervousness on seeing how carelessly unconcernedly men on side of did work before have be many day at sea be a quick active aloft a of hand on board brig after running down nearly a far a bordeaux vessel head be pointed west by french coast be out of sight vigilant lookout be now kept one man being constantly stationed aloft by increased animation of crew ralph judged that must soon arrive at point where must be on course of homeward bound merchantman have quite made up mind that although ready in other matter to do duty a one of crew of la belle marie nothing must induce to take part in fight against own countryman a soon a night fell sail be reduced in morning when at eight bell ralph came on deck with watch found that whole of upper sail have be taken off topsail lowered on cap brig be only moving through water at rate of two three knot hour guessed that must be just upon track of ship that object in thus taking off sail be to catch sight of vessel in distance while must be unobserved by during course of day several sail be seen passing at considerable distance captain did not think that be safe to commence operation at present did not like look of of passing vessel at rate made movement to close with of be not until nightfall that sail be again hoisted brig proceeded on course ralph noticed that carried light that even binnacle be carefully shaded so that light must not be seen except by helmsman at midnight watch went on deck ralph perceived that while have be below sail have again be greatly reduced noticed that from time to time officer on watch swept horizon with night glass apparently observed nothing until about two o'clock when stood for time gazing intently astern then turned gave order to sailor who went below two three minute later captain came on deck after speaking to officer too gazed intently astern then ship course be suddenly changed sheet eased off for hour ran at sharp angle to course have before be following then be brought up into eye of wind laid to although ralph strained eye in direction in captain have be looking must see nothing have doubt sail have be seen coming up astern that object of change of course be to let pas without being seen rather wondered that instead of running off wind captain have not put about so a to take position to windward instead of to leeward of vessel behind soon arrived at object of maneuver there be star to be seen bank of cloud overhead stretched away to east horizon there be entirely obscured to west sky be lighter vessel must be clearly visible to eye brig therefore in position have taken up must not be seen while must obtain full view of other a passed in hour other ship came along be large ship full rigged french sailor who have come on deck now clustered against bulwark eagerly discussed be about two mile to windward opinion differed a to whether be man of war indiaman ralph rather wondered that privateer have not tried to get alongside in darkness take vessel by surprise understood now that there be strong probability that belle marie might have caught tartar have suddenly run under gun of british frigate a soon a vessel have passed brace be manned yard swung round brig continued course be brought up almost to wind eye sailed a closely a possible so when morning broke must have recovered leeway have made must be to windward of vessel be pursuing matter how much astern chapter iv privateer rendezvous when morning broke vessel that privateer have be watching in night be seen to be three mile directly ahead be large vessel for time opinion differed a to whether be frigate indiaman when became quite light patch two in canvas showed that must not be man of war sail be at once crowded on to privateer other ship at once shook out more canvas hour sufficed to show that privateer be much faster vessel stranger took in extra canvas have set continued course a if altogether regardless of privateer have made up mind to fight jacques said to ralph now find that ca outsail have got on to easy working canvas be big ship expect carry heavier metal than do may be that have troop on board brig kept eating out to windward until gained position about mile upon starboard quarter of indiaman then long pivot gun be leveled first shot fired crew have by time taken place by gun ralph other boy brought up powder shot from magazine be not without struggle ralph brought to do saw that refusal must probably cost life a one else must bring up cartridge in place refusal must not benefit countryman have just come on deck when gun be fired saw water thrown up just under ship stern shot be dancing away to leeward next shot struck merchantman on quarter moment later vessel be brought up into wind broadside of eight gun fired two of struck hull of privateer wounded mainmast while rest cut hole through sail struck water quarter of mile to windward with oath captain of privateer brought vessel up into wind then payed off on other tack merchantman carried much heavier metal than have given credit for a came round too redcoat be seen on deck apparently well satisfied with display have made of strength ship bore off again went quietly on way while privateer be hove to preventer stay put to mainmast ralph remained below for time heard men savagely cursing thought be best for not to attract attention at present sail be lowered brig drifted quietly day about ten o'clock ralph heard creaking of block knew that sail have be hoisted again hour later watch below be ordered to come quietly on deck ralph went up with rest for quarter of hour must see nothing then made out dark mass few hundred yard to leeward immediately afterward helm be put up brig run down toward stranger two minute later there be sharp hail followed instantly by shout sound of foot before crew must gain deck prepare for defence brig be alongside moment later crew sprang upon deck of stranger few blow be given resistance offered be slight in very short time crew be disarmed driven below vessel in possession of privateer proved to be small bark on way out to mediterranean carried only twenty hand four small gun be laden with hardware privateer crew at once set to work upon at first ralph must not understand what be about be not long in discovering wedge round mainmast be knocked out topmast lowered to deck shroud stay slacked off then mast be lifted carried on board brig a soon a be done second mate of brig with eight sailor went on board a prize crew everything be made taut trim for by brig crew english prisoner have already be disarmed battened down in hold prize crew then hoisted sail prepared to take under mizzen foremast only to french port if have luck must reach in safety if on way fell in with british privateer cruiser must of course fall easy prey sooner be bark on way than privateersman set to work to lift out injured mainmast to replace with have brought on board from bark when daylight broke anxious glance be cast round horizon although few distant sail be seen none of be following course must bring near brig latter without sail with foremast alone standing must not be likely to be noticed ralph must not help admiring energy with crew worked ordinarily be by mean smart crew did work in slow slovenly manner man now felt importance of getting everything into order before enemy appeared so well did work by midday new mast be in place before sunset topmast with yard gear be up sail ready for hoisting ralph have be in state of anxiety in early part of night lest must be sent on board bark carried a prisoner to france one seemed to give thought to be not until far on in morning that captain happened to notice hard at work with rest ah be there said if have thought of must have sent into best in bark ralph did not understand word guessed at meaning said smiling be quite content to remain where be tell jacques clery have noticed that work willingly a long a behaves well will have same treatment a if belonged really to crew warn that if be caught at time making signal doing anything to warn vessel may be approaching brain will be blown out at once jacques translated warning be right ralph said of course must expect nothing else a soon a repair be completed sail be hoisted brig proceeded on way in day followed seemed to ralph that tactic of privateer have changed that there be longer idea of making prize sharp lookout be indeed kept for english cruiser attention be paid to sail in distance a soon a be determined that be not ship of war four day later instead of there being a before five six sail in sight at one point other of horizon sea be absolutely deserted remarked upon to friend jacques latter laughed be out of course now lad passed latitude of cape st vincent yesterday evening be now pretty well off coast of africa nine out of ten of ship have seen be either bound to mediterranean on way home now that have passed mouth of strait will not run across many sail where be going to then ralph said well think there be harm in telling now that be bound south how far be more than know expect first will go west try pick up prize among island after perhaps go round cape lie in wait for indiaman on way home see one of ship be worth dozen of mediterranean trader one be not bothered down there a one be between strait channel with cruiser privateer swarm so there that one can hardly fire gun without bringing down on suppose captain must have meddled with indiaman if have be that thought owner must be pleased by prize being sent in so soon a to bark be obliged to take to get new mast must never have done to have started on long cruise with badly injured spar must think must be difficult to send home prize from west indie ralph said well see although have taken most of island there be still two three port can take prize into beside can take best good out if ship be worth risk of sending to france burn then too one can spare hand for prize better there because one can always ship few fresh hand spaniard mulatto black in place ca do in case of indiaman single laden indiaman be enough to pay well for trouble can put crew of thirty hand on board send home there be little risk of recapture till get near france have only to hoist english flag if do happen to meet anything ralph be glad to hear that ship be bound for west indie a thought opportunity for escape must be likely to present among island madeira be sighted three day later after running south for four five hundred mile brig bore away for west by dint of getting jacques clery to translate sentence into french of hearing nothing language spoken round ralph have by time begun to make considerable progress in language not only be anxious to learn for sake of passing away time making understood effort be greatly stimulated by fact that if of crew addressed in french cuff on head be generally penalty of failure to comprehend consequence be that when six week after sailing cry of land be shouted by lookout in top ralph be able to understand almost everything be said to reply in french with fluency a brig sailed along wooded shore of first island fell in with ralph be leaning against bulwark watching with deep interest object be passing can guess what be thinking about jacques clery said taking place quietly by side have be through can guess feeling be thinking how can escape now take advice hurry about be doing well where be now begin to talk french understand order be good deal easier for than be men be beginning to regard a one of may be sure that will be watched for time see dare let go if be to get to one of english port here must have five six of men of war after in time if be not for suppose captain must object to put ashore have evidently taken fancy to be pleased with way in have taken thing with smartness willingness beside think considers altogether a prisoner running down in way did in channel be like capturing in prize think if captain must see way to letting go without risk to must do a ca do that will have sharp watch kept on advise not to be in hurry to try to escape must remember if be caught trying must shoot to certainty must be in hurry at jacques if be not that brig be hunting for english vessel know what must feel if be on board ship be capturing french craft yes be hard doubt jacques agreed say to escape when get chance only say wait until chance be good one just at present be not specially on lookout for prize be going to join two other vessel belonging to same owner have be out here time have got snug hiding place somewhere though think one on board except captain know where for three week brig cruised among island have picked up prize in time a captain did not wish to commence operation until have joined consort obtained information from a to british men of war on station have overhauled one two native craft purchased fish fruit cautiously asked question a to cruiser answer be not satisfactory learned that owing to number of vessel have be captured by privateer very vigilant lookout be being kept that two three french craft have be captured by cruiser have be bought into service be constantly in search of headquarters of privateer be bad news for although brig with great spread of canvas must in light wind run away from of ship of war be by mean certain must be able to do so from converted privateer one morning two vessel schooner brig be seen coming round headland captain officer examined with telescope flag be run up to masthead almost immediately two answering flag be hoisted by stranger exclamation of satisfaction broke from captain be in luck said if have not run across might have have to search for rendezvous have got spot marked down on chart told before sailing that understood be very difficult to find entrance might pas by within hundred yard without noticing in hour ship closed up together captain of other craft came on board in boat hearty greeting be exchanged between captain of la belle marie three then descended to cabin after time reappeared visitor returned to respective ship five minute later schooner got under way la belle marie followed leaving other brig to continue cruise alone toward evening schooner ran in toward precipitous cliff brig keeping close in wake ralph have doubt that be now close to spot privateer used a rendezvous must detect opening into cliff ahead looked a if schooner be leading way to destruction not until within cable length of shore must opening be discovered by keenest eye then when schooner be within own length of cliff helm be put about came round in moment later disappeared exclamation of surprise broke from on board brig for now saw that instead of cliff stretching in unbroken line projected out at one point precipitous headway concealed extremely narrow passage behind moment later brig imitated maneuver of schooner passed in between two lofty cliff so close that there be few yard to spare on side of fifty yard ahead channel made sharp turn again entered basin of tranquil water three four hundred yard across at further end shore sloped gradually up here several large storehouse have be erected way laid down for convenience of hauling up repairing vessel what do think of youngster jacques said exultantly grand hiding place be not be indeed ralph replied why might cruise outside for week looking for place must find unless boat happened to row along at foot of cliff a soon a anchor be down crew be at once given leave to go ashore ramble about to stretch leg after two month confinement on board ralph be proceeding to take place in one of boat when captain eye fell upon come below with young fellow said in french jacques clery will want too think there be much need of interpreting captain sailor said a followed others into cabin lad can get on very fairly in french now will certainly understand sense of anything may say to look here lad captain began have be fairly treated since came on board brig have be very kindly treated ralph said have nothing to complain of saved life did not yes sir after first nearly taking ralph said with smile ah be just a much fault a ours little fish ought to get out of way of great one consider be in way to blame in matter still there be fact in first place saved life in second treated kindly acknowledge that sir ralph said earnestly feel very grateful might have sent with crew of bark to prison have chosen be thankful to that kept on board have treated a one of crew now what have to say to be lad know that be comfortable enough on board have noticed that jacques here have taken specially under wing work willingly well have making of first class seaman in still can understand that must much rather be with own people must be rather aiding in capturing than in aiding to capture consequently will if see opportunity probably try to escape will take a good care a can to prevent from doing so will shoot without hesitation if catch at still may escape can not run risk of having place discovered trade knocked on head therefore offer alternative will either give solemn oath not in case to reveal existence of place will put on shore in charge of party who remain here will stop with prisoner till sail away from cruising ground may be in three month may be in year what do say answer hastily take oath unless be convinced can keep however great temptation held out to to betray ralph needed minute to consider proposal oath did not bind in way to abstain from making attempt to escape simply to guard secret of privateer rendezvous if remained here on shore must have chance whatever of escape might moreover meet with very rough treatment from left in charge of be quite ready to take oath not to reveal secret of place captain said think that in case after having be so kindly treated by must have be inclined to betray however a offer alternative be ready to take oath like of silence oath will assuredly keep whatever pressure may be laid upon being understood of course that oath in way prevents taking opportunity may present of making escape be quite understood captain said be mere matter of business try to escape if can shoot if catch at think be likely to succeed in justice to employer friend must not be justified in running even slight risk unless convinced that if succeed will keep silence a to now what oath will take oath can be more binding to than promise sir at same time swear upon word of honor will never give information hint will lead one to discovery of harbor will do captain said have liked face from moment came on board feel can trust word be sure can do captain jacques put in from what have seen of boy be certain will keep promise have made very well then captain said be settled can go on shore in next boat will advise to take opportunity for warn that will not get chance of rambling on shore again until return here next time need not come on board before to morrow morning hour later ralph went ashore with last batch of sailor soon found that general license have be granted barrel of rum several cask of wine have be broached men be evidently bent upon making up for spell of severe discipline that have lately gone through jacques clery have gone ashore in same boat with ralph what be going to do lad be going for walk ralph said in first place everything be new to want to see vegetation in second place can see in very short time most of hand will be drunk dare say quarrelsome want to drink quarrel think be better away from be right boy care if go too will take drink of wine before start fill up pocket with biscuit will get storekeeper to give bottle of wine to take with then will be set up for day be first voyage in part have heard from others of doings care about getting stab with knife in drunken brawl can do share of fighting when fighting have got to be done care for row of sort still know men look forward to what call spree on shore captain might find difficult to preserve discipline if did not let have fling occasionally ralph sailor took biscuit draught of wine soon afterward started on ramble provided with food a arranged be delighted with luxuriant vegetation wandered for hour through wood admiring flower fruit abstaining however from tasting latter a for aught knew of specie might be poisonous presently however came upon banana of have ever seen fruit before ralph have read description of in book jacques have heard of from sailor who have visited west indie before therefore cut bunch now will bring to anchor dine time must be getting on appetite tell that must have struck eight bell jacques sat down on ground be about to throw full length when ralph observed movement among dead leaf instant later head of snake be raised threateningly within striking distance of jacques clery neck a sank backward ralph gave short cry too late however to arrest sailor movement at same moment sprang forward came down with foot upon snake what on earth be doing jacques asked a scrambled to foot answer be made to question saw at once ralph be stamping upon writhing fold of snake in minute motion ceased be close shave jacques ralph said smiling though face be pale with sudden excitement did not see until too late to give warning be just fraction of second even a jumped thought must strike neck before boot came on saved life lad other said huskily trembling from head to foot a saw how narrowly indeed have escaped from death have be in hard fight in time know that ever felt a feel now feel cold from head to foot believe that child must knock down give hand lad be splendidly done if have stopped for moment to think must have be dead man good heaven what escape have be glad to have be of service for once have be so kind to since came aboard brig that be fair must do good turn for once be not surprised be shaken for feel so have better have drink of wine then can see about meal more lying down on ground for sailor said once be enough of such thing a however hand bottle will feel better after ralph looked about presently discovered open space free from fallen leaf other shelter for lurking snake persuaded jacques to sit down eat biscuit banana in comfort sailor did so manner in glance kept wandering round in search of snake showed that have not yet recovered equanimity when have finished meal ralph proposed that must climb up to highest point of ground must find take view over island two hour walking took to top of lofty hill from summit be enabled to obtain distant view island be judged seven eight mile across fully twice that length several small island lay within few mile distant high land rose twenty mile off must be large island ralph said do know where be jacques have idea whatever sailor said suppose one on board except officer have more than chart be in captain cabin know more of geography of island than do of south sea be nothing be quite right to keep dark because though suppose many fellow on board of three craft must split upon if be captured because see have share in profit of voyage a well a regular pay of course must lose that if storehouse be pretty well choked up with good be to get taken there be never saying what mean scamp might do if be offered handsome reward so fewer a know secret better look jacques look at full rigged ship have just come out from behind island look to like frigate that be sailor replied carry forty gun must say by size english doubt well have better go down again lad must report to captain that craft be cruising in water will be dark before be back want to be in wood after dark there be saying what one might tread on thought that must stretch out under tree for to night go aboard in morning feel different now bless must never close eye so propose a go down so a not to be noticed by chap up at store then get hold of boat row on board quiet be quite willing to do jacques think must get much sleep in wood guess not lad come along sun be halfway down already must not be left in wood after dark not for six month pay thought of snake make crawl over who must have thought now when lugged in over bowsprit of la belle marie night in channel that be going to save life day well suppose lad will ever get quits with if there be chance can count upon come to night say be going to escape jacques will help to do even if riddle with bullet five minute afterward will never ask that of jacques ralph said warmly consider be quits now though may not indeed can tell that consider two month of kindness be wiped out by just taking jump on to back of snake there be loud sound of shouting singing quarreling a passed near great fire be blazing near storehouse reached waterside without notice taking boat rowed off to brig captain looked over side who be that jacques clery english lad captain got tired of noise on shore suppose captain said not exactly that captain for have not be near others at took long walk through wood up to top of hill in middle of island came back for two reason first because have be so badly scared by snake who must have bit have not young fellow leaped on to back just a be about to strike in neck must not have slept on ground for anything in second place came to tell that from top of hill saw large frigate english must say from cut of sail five six mile off on other side of island thought ought to know about at once thank jacques be important be going to sail in morning must not stir a long a be in neighborhood so young fellow saved life did that did captain be quickest thing ever saw be just lying down at full length when caught sight of snake there be time to stop time even to cry out just jumped on sudden came down on brute a be on point of striking have stopped for one quarter of second must have be dead man hour ago be near escape indeed jacques be pretty quiet there on shore heard shouting several time seem quarreling bit captain be sure to do with liquor on hand wo come to much harm captain said gave strictest order that weapon must be left behind before landed that man carrying even knife must have leave stopped during rest of cruise beside first mate be there to look after will go ashore at daybreak take look round from top of hill if frigate be still cruising about near island must be because have got sort of idea of whereabouts of hiding place must wait till move away wo do to risk anything upon following morning captain jacques accompanied by ralph landed passed close by storehouse saw men still asleep round extinguished fire captain called out storekeeper can serve out one pannikin of wine to man said more will want that to pull together tell first mate to get on board a soon a possible set to work to tidy up ship get everything ready for setting sail at moment notice tell english frigate be reported a close to island be going up to look after two hour steady walking took to top of hill there be sign of vessel a far a must see captain who have brought glass with carefully examined island in sight presently uttered exclamation there be three boat rowing together close under cliff there said pointing to nearest island doubt frigate be lying behind must be searching for concealed harbor like ours peste be awkward what do think jacques must say be right in what said last night captain must have got idea that rendezvous be somewhere hereabouts though know for certain where be searching island round if come along here like that will be caught in trap vessel might sail close by without suspecting there be entrance here however hard might be looking for if send boat rowing along shore must help finding still there be nothing to prevent sailing away now a island be between be so captain said if come while be away in first place must capture booty in store in second place might lie quiet in harbor must sink other ship when returned will go down to port again jacques will send up two of men from storehouse to keep watch here turn turn about do remain here until be relieved will leave glass with if there be anything fresh leave boy on watch come down with news must talk matter over with mate have direct interest in store must do best can for owner jacques ralph watched distant boat through glass until disappeared round end of island then turned glass seaward jacques be using at time see exclaimed there be three sail together there can see plainly enough ralph said what do make out to be schooner brig three masted vessel be lying close together fancy boat be passing between however must swear to must be fifteen mile away expect be consort merchantman have captured can see from other side of island ralph asked excitedly must say must jacques replied after pausing to calculate line of sight depends how far round frigate be lying how close in shore if have sent one up on hill there of course can make out a plainly a can jacques handed glass to ralph yes think can make out boat jacques what do suppose be doing most likely be transferring valuable part of cargo on board what will do with then expect will let go of course that depends whether be new ship worth taking risk of carrying to france burn sink then there must be no good in for must know what to do with crew of course want bother of prisoner here must want to turn adrift in boat might land on island near see going coming here carry news to of cruiser expect will take what be valuable let go be if ship be worth sending home suppose be so in case for if be going to put prize crew on board send to france must not be transferring cargo well will see in half hour chapter v british cruiser hour passed during time watcher on hill saw that brig have be lying alongside three masted vessel felt sure that cargo be being transferred then merchantman sail be hoisted slowly sailed away for hour other two craft lay motionless then hoisted sail headed for island there be brisk steady wind blowing came along fast through water will soon see now whether frigate have made out jacques said will not wait longer will go tell captain what be going on in hour others will be up here to relieve then can bring down latest news left alone ralph watched anxiously progress of distant vessel turning glass frequently toward other island beyond end of momentarily expected to see white sail of frigate appear hour passed schooner brig be now within about four mile of nearest point of island still there be sign of english ship presently heard voice behind two french sailor came up ralph be now free to return thought have better wait until brig schooner reached point where must be hidden by island from sight of one who might be watching on hill six mile away in half hour have reached point sign have be seen of frigate ralph felt sure that must have be anchored in bay whose headland prevented seeing approaching craft for have noticed must assuredly have set out to intercept before reached island lay almost dead to windward of be just turning to go when one of men gave sudden exclamation turned round again saw frigate just appearing from behind other island be close hauled be soon evident by course that be beating up for point round other two ship have disappeared ralph be puzzled at for if have made out brig schooner natural course must have be to have made for other end of island so a to cut off a sailed past whereas must now when gained extremity of island find five six mile astern of other two craft french sailor be equally puzzled there be hot argument between finally concluded that appearance at moment must be accidental must not have made out privateer have just told ralph to run down with news to harbor when light be thrown upon mystery for from other end of island from frigate have emerged large schooner appeared sail be set course be directed toward other end of island upon watcher be standing two french sailor burst out into torrent of oath expressive of surprise alarm for be evident that from course schooner be taking intended to intercept two privateer engage until frigate came to assistance run boy run for life one of exclaimed tell captain wait moment directed glass upon schooner thousand curse exclaimed be cerf schooner english captured from six month ago be fastest craft in water tell captain that be coming after leg will beat mine ralph dashed off at full speed a soon a have fairly distanced french sailor began to run more slowly for moment have so entered into feeling of companion that have identified with now have time to think sympathy swung round to english ship did not particularly want la belle marie to be captured for have be so well treated on board that felt ill will toward capture meant deliverance thought over matter a ran wondered first why frigate did not take line to cut privateer off instead of going round by other end of island must only suppose that be because schooner be fastest vessel be more likely to arrive in time at point beside if showed there before privateer reached point might double back again frigate must make other end of island before be halfway back might be too that captain have suspected truth knowing that privateer have rendezvous somewhere in neighborhood that object in remaining so long behind island be to give time to enter port in ignorance of being in neighborhood at rate great thing be that schooner brig must enter little harbor before knowing that be pursued once in must be impossible for to get out again beat off shore with wind blowing dead on land before schooner frigate have rounded respective end of island therefore although ralph ran fast enough to keep well ahead of sailor made effort to keep up greater rate of speed than be necessary for a soon a reached shore boat rowed off from brig to fetch saw with satisfaction although men be on board preparation be made for getting under way at once indeed captain must have anxiety for own ship a must know that privateer if saw frigate coming out to meet must sail right away from island frigate must be sure to pursue until out of sight of land what news boy captain asked a boat came close alongside be frigate in chase of others yes sir ralph replied frigate schooner be in chase way be bearing privateer know be chased sir frigate did not show round island over there until schooner brig be hidden behind end of island made toward western end schooner be making for eastern end sailor who came up told to tell that schooner be cerf one of fastest vessel out here captain uttered exclamation of dismay be echoed by standing round row out through entrance shouted to coxswain of boat warn others of danger tell to make straight out if come in here will be caught in trap together oar dipped in water before boat be fairly in motion there be exclamation for head sail of schooner glided in past projecting cliff moment later whole vessel came into view bring boat back alongside captain shouted will go on board at once may get out in time yet a schooner rounded up sail came down headed straight toward brig captain of belle marie stood up in stern sheet of boat shouting waving hand gesticulating to to get up sail again on board schooner looked on in surprise unable to guess meaning there be two english cruiser one coming round end of island shouted a approached schooner get out again if can otherwise must catch in here captain in schooner at once saw emergency roared out order boat be lowered at once men tumbled on board hawser be lowered from bow began at once to tow head round for there be not breath of wind in land locked harbor how much time have got captain asked a schooner head came slowly round know other captain replied be question of minute anyhow ah here be brig boat dashed forward gave similar order to have be given to schooner get round captain shouted will row out through entrance give warning if accursed cruiser be in sight boat dashed through narrow entrance at once felt full force of breeze dead on captain muttered bitterly will have to work right out into arm of one other of rowed hundred yard out when beyond furthermost point must see to east sail of schooner be perceived take round captain said sharply be too late now have got to fight for rowed back through entrance schooner slowly towed by boat be approaching be use captain said be too late schooner have rounded end of island with breeze will be here in hour never can work out in time beside must see come out even if got away must do must come back capture depot have got to fight for be evident boat of fleet must hardly make way in here have best get three craft moored with broadside to entrance will blow boat to tinder if try to come in then can load up with most valuable good slip out at night time be only chance captain of schooner jumped into boat again rowed out into entrance saw at once that other advice be only one to be followed must be impossible to beat off shore before schooner came up while be talking frigate appeared round other end of island therefore returned into harbor belle marie anchor be raised three vessel moored head stern across harbor hundred yard from entrance a soon a be done strong party be sent ashore from of vessel six heavy ship gun have be landed from captured vessel be dragged from place near storehouse planted on height so a to sweep narrow channel be late in evening before be finished earthwork thrown up to shelter men working gun from musketry fire in meantime two ship of war have met outside again separating cruised several time from end to end of rocky wall evidently searching for entrance through privateer have be pursuing have so suddenly disappeared in morning french sailor be at work early two three strong chain be fastened across mouth of passage now captain of belle marie said exultantly a regained deck of ship be ready to give warm reception boat of british cruiser on station must never force way through gap ralph have not be called upon to assist in work of preparation jacques having done day work on journey to top of hill back saw from exultation in face of frenchman that considered position be impregnable shuddered at thought of terrible carnage must ensue if boat of english vessel must try to force entrance following morning lookout on cliff reported that two boat have left ship be rowing toward shore on reaching foot of cliff rowed along abreast at distance of thirty forty yard of shore stopped rowing at mouth of entrance be suddenly hailed by captain of schooner who be standing on cliff above if try to enter said will be destroyed at once want to harm if will leave alone have gun enough to blow whole fleet out of water will use if be driven to thank for warning voice shouted back from boat then order be given rowed back to ship well have found place lieutenant pearson captain of frigate asked a young lieutenant stepped on deck yes sir have found be just where boat turned came out again can see sign of now captain said examining shore with telescope sir must until be within hundred yard of rowing close in a be saw time before got there rock overlap other there be narrow channel fifty yard long between apparently make sharp turn at other end open out saw nothing of vessel be chasing yesterday on high ground facing channel there be battery of six gun planted so a to rake anything coming in there be chain across end while be lying on oar there be hailed then repeated warning have be given nasty place to get into captain said thoughtfully very nasty sir see gun must play right down into channel then there be chain to break down perhaps more battery certainly ship to tackle when get inside be there width for frigate to enter captain asked just width must say more sir must certainly have to get yard braced fore aft ship must go through with something to spare must say what depth of water be there close in shore plenty of depth sir right up to foot of cliff of course can say nothing a to depth in channel of course not captain said well be something that have run pest to earth at last see be going to be easy matter to get at captain now signaled to captain of schooner to come on board when did so two officer retired to cabin together have long consultation young officer on coming on deck got into boat taking lieutenant pearson with rowed for cliff few hundred yard to west of inlet here must obtain view of channel surroundings not man be to be seen muzzle of six gun pointed menacingly down into passage chain must be seen just above water edge think will go back now mr pearson really think ought to be very much obliged to fellow for not sinking wonder what be motive in letting off so easily suppose feel pretty confident that report be not likely to encourage attack think that if be to blow to piece must only make captain wilson more determined to destroy at least be conclusion came to a rowed back last time yes must think be young captain said be certainly a awkward looking place to attack in boat a ever saw of course be not for chain vessel must get in dare say have be in there many time before captured must be very risky thing to take frigate in without knowing anything of depth of water in channel inside returned to frigate mr pearson report be fully borne out captain wilson must be most desperate enterprise to attack with boat half of must be sunk before got to chain even if got past doubt there be saying what difficulty obstacle may be inside now about frigate captain chamber well sir be for to decide be quite ready to take schooner in though with plunging power of battery raking fore aft say fairly that must be desperate enterprise if have not sufficient way upon to carry away chain nothing must save a to frigate seems to that must run equal risk with schooner with additional danger that there may not be water enough for well certainly doe seem to be easy nut to crack captain wilson said a agreed before started must not be justified in risking vessel in assaulting place be certainly extremely formidable where there may not be water enough for frigate to float still question remains what be to be done be use anchoring here trying to starve out may have provision enough to last for year for anything know if weather be to turn bad must have to make off at once must never do to be caught in hurricane with coast a on lee might send to port royal with letter to admiral asking to send two three more ship like doing that when be mere question of capturing two rascally privateer think admiral must be glad to send younger captain said for two vessel have done tremendous lot of damage during last year believe that upward of twenty ship have reported being boarded stripped by if came what must do captain wilson asked see consider be not worth risk of throwing away two ship two force passage still le must be to risk four be so no doubt captain chamber agreed must suggest that however many of there may be must draw off keep watch at distance of course must be necessary to approach at night to lie behind island somewhere in daytime just a did yesterday for from top of hill can see distance round yes a soon a be dusk will have two three hour to get away before can come round here beside with night glass from top of cliff will be sure to be able to make out there be only one other way can see of getting at be to find landing place attack from on shore ah be much more hopeful business a far a saw yesterday there be cliff round island be hard indeed if can not find place where can manage to effect landing be plan must follow out afternoon hour before get dark get up sail make away a if be bound for port royal will keep station here will think have gone off to get more ship a soon a be thoroughly dark bear round come back to island bring schooner in close to cliff on other side get into bay if can find one will then be out of sight altogether unless somebody happens to look down from edge of cliff above then search whole of back of island with boat keeping at oar length from cliff there must be place where man can climb up probably gulleys worn by stream then to morrow night sail round join again will be waiting for about two mile off land will show light to seaward so that will know where to find then can talk matter over can get back to other side again before morning while captain of two english vessel be holding consultation similar talk be going on between three captain of privateer conclusion arrived at be precisely similar to of english officer be agreed that attack be likely to be made by ship a must almost certainly be sunk by plunging fire of battery a came along channel while assault by boat must be sheer madness have only to wait tire out captain of schooner said rubbing hand first gale from north must run for shelter before can come back to station again will be gone of course will load well up beforehand with be really worth taking away can let have pleasure of destroying rest after have gone will know that a well a do captain of la belle marie said will never be fool enough to try starve out be quite mistaken if think be out of danger why what danger can there be others asked have agreed can not attack by channel can not attack from channel can attack from somewhere else now know be here will find place where can land take in rear exclamation of dismay broke from other captain sapriste never thought of of course can have never examined coast on other side there must be place where must land doubt there be may be quite sure be course will adopt english be slow be not fool will bet ten to one be next move will be up to if like will take score of men cross island afternoon to morrow will examine whole line of shore if there be only one two place can land at may be able to defend if there be four five place far apart force wo be sufficient to hold for must land two hundred fifty men from two ship perhaps hundred more be best thing to be done vipon of course will send word across directly see how land lie if find that can land in good many place there will be nothing for to do try make bolt for keeping close in under cliff at night may manage to give slip in case one if not two of may get away better than to run risk of being caught like rat in trap here hour afterward captain of belle marie started for other side of island with twenty picked men carrying with arm ax two day provision rest of crew be employed during day in filling up three vessel with most valuable portion of booty in storehouse care being taken not to fill vessel so deeply a must interfere seriously with sailing power arrangement have be made between captain that belle marie must transfer cargo to first vessel worth sending to france that captured receiving a share one third of value if reached port safely captain of belle marie be well content with arrangement for storehouse contained spoil of upward of twenty ship share must therefore be considerable one must only have to carry cargo till fell in with english merchantman speculation a to british schooner whereabouts be put end to next morning by message from captain vipon saying have be discovered lying close in under cliff at back of island that boat be already examining shore hour later captain arrived be a feared said when joined other captain there be three bay about two mile apart at of landing must be easily effected land slope gradually down to edge of sea might land at of of course gun of schooner must cover landing if opposed still might beat back one of others said can muster about three hundred men between be not likely to land more than think must be good plan captain vipon said to begin with ca tell of three place may choose for landing at certainly can not hurry through wood anything like so fast a can row along shore so must place at disadvantage in second place know very well that ca rely upon men defeating equal number of john bull in last place must not gain much if did must lose tremendous lot of men schooner must go off fetch two three more ship of war here so that in end must beat think that there be question that will be better for to take chance of escape now either schooner will come back to night tow boat of frigate round other side of island will send boat with news that have found landing place then frigate will send boat think attack will take place to night may be made certainly wo if schooner come round for wind be very light will not leave anchorage until be quite dark by time have got round to frigate boat crew be ready to start get to back of island will be morning if send boat must reach frigate after three hour rowing give hour to get ready start three hour to row back so that brings to nearly same thing beside suppose in case must land before morning for must run risk of losing way in wood so proposal be that at about two o'clock in morning make start separate a soon a get out of harbor shift for frigate will have more than half crew away being so short handed will not be so smart with sail will not be able to work half gun so at outside two out of three of ought to get safely off suppose that schooner happens to be round here make up mind to wait day before attacking must have two of after then that schooner sail like witch have thought of captain vipon said idea be to put man on top of cliff just above where schooner be anchored if be lying there be to light fire short distance back from edge of cliff there must be man on top of hill when see fire will show lantern three time will return signal to let know that see if schooner go away early in evening lookout be not to light fire until see returning at hour may be moment see light will set sail how about two signaller one of other captain said must be left behind might not get chance of rejoining again have thought of too captain vipon said have english lad on board whom picked up in channel be smart lad have be working a one of crew must of course be glad to stay behind because will give chance of rejoining friend must do capitally how about other man see if showed must be made prisoner sent to england if did show might be on island for year before got chance of joining french ship must need high bribe to induce anybody to run risk a that be so evident that there be silence for two three minute then captain vipon spoke again have man who must be more likely to do than one else think because have taken strong fancy to young english boy be good hand like losing still thing be so important must not hesitate at still must offer something good to run risk rather certainty of imprisonment propose that name will be put down on book of three ship so that if ever get back to france again will have fair certainty of good lot of prize money for will be hard luck if two out of three of manage to get back safely other captain agreed to will be here in hour captain vipon said men be sitting down to meal when came away ordered to make way back a soon a have done if refuse only other way can see will be for men to cast lot when of course whoever stay must get three share a agreed hour later twenty men arrived from other side of island a soon a came on board captain vipon called jacques into cabin told that must be necessary to leave two men behind explaining duty must have to perform now jacques said when have finished thought that perhaps must be more likely than other man on board three ship to volunteer for work volunteer jacques said in astonishment what must make think of thing captain for reason jacques have settled to leave english lad here a one of signaller of course will gladly undertake job a will enable to join friend when land a like like might be able to make thing easy for in second place have determined that name of whoever stop will be borne on ship book of three vessel to end of cruise so that there must be good bit of money coming even if only one out of three ship get back enough to set up for life if three get back safely of course may have spell of imprisonment be likely that one at least of ship may be caught going out to night if happened to be ours must get prison without prize money be so jacques agreed if give hour to think over will give answer be come upon sudden like will talk over with boy suppose can tell captain on regaining deck jacques looked about for ralph come sit along with out on bowsprit lad want to have private talk with somewhat surprised ralph followed friend out on to bowsprit now boy said have got bit of news to tell will be pleasant to be first thing next be want advice be sensible young chap be although be lad must like to know what think about well what be good news jacques good news be be likely before time to morrow to be with friend ralph gave start of delight that nearly slipped off bowsprit how be that jacques seems too good to be true be way of jacques said three vessel be going to cut run to night that schooner of yours be round other side of island want to be sure be stopping there then there will only be frigate to deal with in light wind dark night ought to be able to give slip only way to be sure schooner keep other side be to watch so one man be to be placed on cliff above at two o'clock in morning if be still there be to light fire well back from cliff so that light will not be seen by man be to be on top of hill where be together with lantern see can just see top of hill from here when see fire be to show light three time if see answered here will know be right work be done if not of course show light again until be answered now be going to leave a one of two signaller of course will have to do will be to wait for bit then come down join friend be capital ralph said nothing must be better now what be other matter that want advice about jacques well see will be awkward for other man for will either have choice of coming down giving up being carried off a prisoner of stopping on island perhaps for year till french ship happens to come along for once off marie will continue cruise to indian sea other two will make straight for france of course there be course might be taken boat might be hidden away for might go for cruise on own account take chance of being picked up well have offered to man a stop to put name down on book of three craft mean of course that will get share in prize money of three ship if get back be pretty good offer know see fellow on board may get captured killed in battle wrecked in case there must not be penny of prize money man who stop here be sure of prize money if only one of three craft get back to france now ask if will undertake must be better off than others because in first place will have to talk with till get to prison in next place a can talk english can get on good deal better in prison than other fellow must do now what be advice lad must say certainly accept offer jacques see can tell what good friend have be to maybe will let go free even if must make pleasant for with men may be sure that if take to english prison will do can to get out of see when get back to france must have really good sum coming to from three ship two have be out here have collected tremendous lot of valuable plunder bell marie be likely to get quite a much if a say be going to spend two year out in indian sea so really think must be wise to take offer thing if like will not show at will stop here with will take boat together make for port where can give out that be shipwrecked sailor lad must do though thank for offer might get ship back to england must have very little chance of getting one for france might get one together for america from there might get to france easily enough jacques thought for minute lad will give up with might get lost in boat seeing that of know geography of sea might get short of water caught in hurricane will give up know worst way anyhow spell in english prison from may either get exchanged escape war come to end so be best thing for to do chapter vi home again having decided to stay a one of signaller jacques proceeded at once to captain cabin be glad have decided so jacques must have be troublesome business to cast lot of men might have absolutely refused doing so so be glad be settled have arranged with other captain that will have advance of twenty napoleon have best hide about may find come in useful boy be to have ten of course be glad of chance at same time be doing good service have worked well since came on board will help to get passage home thank captain that twenty napoleon may help to get out of english prison will manage hiding place for now think captain will be off at once at least a soon a have have dinner be good long way across island to where schooner be lying will have to choose place for fire so that can be seen from top of hill at dinner jacques told comrade that be going to remain behind act a signalman for good deal of regret be expressed by shipmate many of whom came like from dunkirk have known from boy before starting went to sailmaker got to open sol of shoe then inserted ten napoleon in sailmaker sewed up again then making clothes into kit getting couple of bottle of wine from steward shook hand with messmate be with ralph rowed ashore on landing cut two stick hung kit upon ralph taking charge of lantern while be provided with tinder steel walked for mile together then jacques said here path separate lad ca miss way to top of hill go almost other way for schooner lie short distance from end of island if be must lie up for sleep a soon a get there remember will not see fire till two o'clock if see then must keep watch till morning for there be saying when may be lit a soon a see show light three time in direction of creek if see answered will have nothing more to do if not must keep on showing light till do get answer in morning wait till sun have be up hour then come to spot wait for will start at daybreak have lot further to walk than have so sha be there before if find people have come into harbor will wait till do so then when find that there be one there can show quietly if got there first might begin to shoot directly saw without stopping to ask question ralph made way up to top of hill threw down under tree near summit be soon fast asleep when awoke be already dark lit lantern covered up in jacket took station at highest point have plenty to think about twelve hour must be with friend have reason to complain of treatment have received on board privateer have remained with might not have returned to france for couple of year must then have have difficulty in crossing to england beside be painful to to be with men fighting against country prize taken instead of causing delight to a to comrade must have be source of pain most of thought of mother of how must have grieved for a dead of joy there must be at reunion hour therefore passed quickly must scarcely believe to be two o'clock when suddenly saw light of fire far way toward end of island glance at star showed that time be correct rose to foot taking lantern held aloft then lowered behind bush twice raised again knew exactly direction in harbor lay sooner have put down lantern for third time than three flash of light followed in close succession knew that everything must be prepared in afternoon for start order have be issued before left that oar of boat be to be muffled that chain at entrance of channel be to be removed ship got in position with shortened cable for start must picture to a stood there gazing into darkness that men must be already in boat awaiting signal a soon a be seen must begin to tow vessel out of harbor during daytime frigate cruised backward forward under easy sail two mile off entrance sailor believed that at night came very much closer to shore lookout with night glass having reported that have be seen once twice within quarter of mile of entrance to channel hour passed without sign that frigate be aware that ship be leaving harbor then ralph heard sound of distant musket shot followed by several others have doubt that one of frigate boat on watch near channel have discovered few minute later there be flash distance out at sea followed after interval by deep boom of gun then came broadside followed by steady fire of heavy gun be evidently fired on board frigate answering sound from french ship meeting ear must see by direction of flash that frigate be under way firing continued for two hour becoming more more distant then ceased altogether when sun rose saw frigate twenty mile away there be smaller craft two three mile further off two others be visible ten twelve mile further away to west two of privateer have evidently made escape third seemed to be leaving pursuer behind for wind be exceedingly light mile nearer to island than frigate schooner be visible be heading for two vessel have gone toward west a be fully fifteen mile to windward chance of overtaking appeared to be slight ralph waited hour then proceeded at leisurely pace toward spot where be to meet jacques be five minute at spot agreed upon when saw coming through tree heard nothing of landing party said a french sailor approached reason be not far to search for replied did not land at did not much expect that must boat from frigate arrived few minute before lighted fire be lying down at edge of cliff looking right down upon deck came up in body rowing with muffled oar must just hear sound of talking when came on deck a soon a have fire fairly alight saw signal then went back to watch everything be quiet till heard boom of first gun then heard beilence ordered on schooner suppose one have said that heard gun other did of course sound did not come to under shelter of cliff a did to then came sound of gun then three four close together then order be given sharply capstan be manned anchor run up be not minute getting sail set under shelter of cliff there be not enough wind to fill so boat be manned went gliding away until must no longer make out guessed of course that craft be making off went to help frigate be too late to be of use jacques ah have seen from top of hill did not think of be news frigate be in chase of one of be too far for to see must say be two three mile ahead certainly well out of gunshot a far a must see during hour be watching be increasing lead unless wind freshens think be safe other two be on opposite tack ten twelve mile away to west schooner be heading after be at least fifteen mile from be very fast in light wind like say well if must catch ought to be able to beat off jacques a be two to one so far think chance of getting three share be good one maybe lad have not have much luck so far began on sea when be eleven at twenty one have to go into navy be seven year later when got back to dunkirk after spell in prison did not report for have wish to do more man of war work now have have six year privateer work have not made much by if get back time get three share will buy fine fishing smack for myself snug little house on shore there be one promised if

of privateer not oh yes will be safe now will be on beach when come in when see that be alone unarmed there be chance of firing can go up occasionally to cliff watch for be not until following evening that frigate be seen approaching island will take four five hour to work in jacques said be not likely to try to land till to morrow morning boat men be away in schooner must think must be back to morrow morning caught before got dark last night think likely will have given slip in night in case might look about for day then make sail to rejoin a jacques predicted schooner be seen by daylight eight ten mile away may a well hoist white flag jacques captain of frigate will be savage that privateer have escaped may put into good temper if take possession here before schooner arrives ralph ran down to storehouse got hold of sheet oar white flag be soon hoisted on top of cliff five minute later two gig be seen rowing off from frigate ralph jacques took place on battery when boat reached mouth of narrow entrance order be given for men to lay on oar ralph shouted at top of voice can come on sir be only two here order be given to row on ralph companion at once went down to meet at end of harbor captain be in stern of own gig while young lieutenant held line in other boat who be captain asked a stepped ashore on little wharf be english by speech be english sir be on board fishing

extremely kind to during voyage kept others from persecuting how be be left behind captain asked be round other side of island watching schooner ralph replied others sailed away without for ralph have agreed with jacques that be better to say nothing about signalling have done fighting since be on board privateer captain asked sternly no sir have only exchanged shot with one ship since sailed fired one broadside privateer drew off good deal damaged be surprised by night took part in know what be laden with what be name well lad story sound truthful will of course be inquired into when get to england a to man be of course prisoner hope not sir ralph pleaded have not be taken with arm in hand be in fact castaway mariner captain face relaxed into smile see be sort of sea lawyer well will see about what be there in storehouse quantity of thing sir took away great many with there must be ten time a much left heard say have cargo of more than twenty ship here be satisfactory at rate captain said mr wylde will just take look round storehouse see what there be worth taking away have better take boat crew a well a own to help to turn thing over be quite sure lad that there be one beside yourselves on island ca say that sir order be for hand to embark last night so far a know none of be left behind except jacques clery have be here for two day now have seen one so think one else can have be left how did get on on board brig captain asked suppose can not speak french must speak french when first be got on board sir picked up great deal on voyage out jacques speaks english very well be prisoner in england for three year learned there be that caused to speak to directly have got on board for one else understood so set to work at once to help in french so must get along captain be very kind too said that a have be picked up in way must not treat a prisoner expected to make useful of course did so be only way of having comfortable life be only place privateer have on shore here captain asked looking round only see one two hut storekeeper lived in sir stopped behind to look after thing when privateer be away men slept on board vessel only landing to disembark cargo have captured for drunken spree when first returned be sure have other place so brig only arrived here four day ago be puzzled in morning when saw there be two brig schooner when have only expected one brig of course arrival account for what be name how many gun men did carry be la belle marie of dunkirk ralph replied carried fourteen gun mostly eighteen pounder thirty two pounder on pivot have eighty hand at first eight of went away in prize do know whether have gone off straight for france whether be going to remain here from what gathered from men sir believe other two privateer be going straight home loaded up from storehouse taking of course most valuable stuff there be great deal of copper what rest be know brig be loaded up too believe intention be to transfer cargo into first prize took send to france know whether be going to cruise about here for time must rather think that now that consort have gone place be discovered will not stay here for never intended to cruise in water long know that destination be indian ocean intended to capture indiaman on way out home in case expedition have be more satisfactory than expected captain said will have discovered destroyed depot here captured anyhow valuable stuff caused two privateer that have be hunting for so long to leave island to say nothing of brig of yours of have not heard well mr wylde what be report will take long time to go through whole sir must say that have taken most valuable prize part of good consist of produce of part puncheons of rum hogshead of sugar in number then see have left good many ton of copper behind overlooked suppose in hurry of loading considerable portion of store consist of home produce cotton cloth silk furniture musical instrument mirror in fact good of kind be most satisfactory mr wylde sha' have have trouble for nothing ah here come other boat a spoke pinnace long boat cutter of two ship of war dashed into harbor in minute two reached landing place so gave slip a well a chamber captain wilson said confound yes be within about four mile of at sunset gave slip in dark mine fairly outsailed captain wilson said be afraid have made rather mess of affair though acted for best see how must have done otherwise however have learned that brig schooner have be chasing so long have made straight for france so that will have more trouble with other brig only arrived two day before chased others in here have be believed also gone off so sha have done so badly for can report that have found out destroyed nest here fancy from what lieutenant say have made very valuable capture enough to give round sum in prize money will be consolation other laughed must give share of if must have come up with engaged rascally craft have be hunting over island for last two year whom have got here two prisoner well hardly know whether can be called prisoner one be english lad who be in boat run down in channel who dare say be glad to get rid of seems that be gentleman son story be clear enough other belongs to brig chased seems only arrived here two day ago young fellow say that have be particularly kind to have begged to regard in light of castaway sailor seeing that be found here unarmed away from ship think there be something in plea a there be credit glory to be obtained from handing over one prisoner consider under circumstance will be justified in letting go ashore quietly in saying nothing about at one time man be prisoner of war in england have picked up language so dare say will be able to manage to find way home without difficulty what be thinking of doing with stuff captain chamber asked pointing to storehouse think have better take away with like turning alert into storeship must be better to do than to have expense of chartering two three ship to come here to fetch away beside if did that must have to stop here until be carried away to burn storehouse afterward then by mean let load up captain chamber said certainly have wish to be kept here for six week couple of month will go out bring seagull in at once sooner better chamber will set couple of boat at work at once to take sounding here in channel if can get alert in will must save lot of trouble time be found that channel harbor inside contained abundance of water for frigate width between rock be however only just sufficient to let through therefore while schooner sailed boldly in frigate be towed in by boat next morning work of shipping content of storehouse commenced so large be quantity of good stored up that took six day of hard work before be safely on board sailor however did not grudge trouble for knew that box bale meant so much prize money hope will meet nothing ought to chase on way to port royal captain wilson said looking with disgust at two vessel have brought alert nearly two foot lower in water while a to seagull be laden down like collier yes wing be clipped for present captain chamber replied of course rascal carried off pick of booty with may be well content with what left behind will be best haul that have made for year a rule most have to hope for be money fetched by sale of privateer may catch generally go for next to nothing retract what said must give share of prize money to come up with privateer certainly never calculated on haul a suppose intend to have gone on storing away booty till war came to end then to have chartered dozen ship to carry away captain wilson have introduced ralph to midshipman telling must be in mess till reached port be soon at home among clothes be replaced by lent jacques made equally at home among crew captain wilson have intimated to first lieutenant that man be not to be considered a prisoner a castaway picked up on island from cheery temper willingness to lend hand make useful in way knowledge of language be soon favorite with when good be on board fire be applied to storehouse hut two vessel be then towed out of harbor hoisting sail made for port royal wind be light be six day before entered harbor signal be at once hoisted from flagship there for captain to come on board have doubt be in towering rage at appearance captain wilson said to first lieutenant fancy will change tone pretty quickly when learns what have got on board share of prize money will come to pretty penny next morning number of lighter came alongside ship work of discharging cargo commenced after breakfast ralph jacques be rowed ashore will want money to pay for passage young gentleman captain wilson said to ralph before leaving ship will authorize to tell agent will be security for payment of passage money be very much obliged to sir ralph replied will work way home if can have learned to be pretty handy on board privateer must a lief be working forward a dawdling about aft way home beside want to inconvenience mother by being called upon suddenly to pay thirty forty pound directly get home have caused trouble enough a be be right lad captain said like spirit have money enough to pay for hotel expense while be waiting for ship yes thank sir french captain said have fairly earned wage gave ten napoleon when started must have be good sort of fellow captain said though wish have caught for well good by pleasant voyage home ralph put up at quiet boarding house kept by mulatto woman jacques got fresh rig out of clothes at once

schooner be about to return to new york while ralph obtained berth before mast in fine bark must sail for england in few day next morning said good by to other for jacques have to go on board after breakfast made many promise to see other again when war came to end will never forget kindness jacques if be still at dover when peace be proclaimed will run over to dunkirk by very first vessel sail a for kindness be nothing jacques replied beside that saved life from snake dream sometimes of beast still be really owing to that be here now that will get round sum coming to when return home if have be for must not have be chosen to stop behind get three share instead of one of prize money in next place be doing that be free to start at once to make way back a soon a can instead of spending four five year may be in english prison why louise will be ready to jump for joy when see arrive instead of having to wait two year for with chance of never coming back at will hardly believe when tell that will be able to afford to buy that fishing boat set up in house of own at once will be most surprised of when tell that be owing to english boy fished on board on dark night in channel well jacques wo dispute a to owes other most anyhow except for mother be not sorry have made trip in belle maire have seen lot of life have have rare adventure have learned so much of sailor work that if be ever driven to can work way anywhere before mast in future ralph went on board own ship a soon a have seen jacques off be soon hard at work assisting to hoist on board hogshead of sugar other produce be startled by sound of heavy gun be answered presently by ship of war in harbor by fort on shore for five minute heavy cannonade continued captain who have be on shore crossed gangway on to ship a crew be gazing in surprise at cannonade exchanging guess a to cause have great news lad said peace be proclaimed have surrendered be to be shut up in isle of elba in mediterranean more fear of privateer french prison crew burst into hearty cheer be indeed surprising news be known that wellington be gradually driving back french marshal in south of france that ally be marching toward paris napoleon have be so long regarded a invincible that one have really believed that downfall be imminent four day later cargo be on board fanny sailed for england voyage be accomplished without adventure a soon a vessel entered dock crew be discharged ralph landed having purchased suit of landsman clothes presented kit to lad of about own age who have be special chum on board fanny then made way to inn from coach for dover started having secured place for next day dined ordered bed passed evening strolling about street of london next morning at six o'clock took place on coach going back from school suppose young gentleman military looking man seated next to on coach remarked a soon a have left street behind be rattling along old kent road be not going home from school ralph said with smile at least not from sort of school mean though have be learning good deal too arrived yesterday from west indie indeed gentleman said scrutinizing closely see look sunburned weather beaten now that look at somehow must not have put down a sailor well be not exactly sailor though may say have worked a one before mast out home be first experience suppose one take longer than to get regular nautical manner before mast be then suppose have be getting into scrape at home young sir run away for from appearance must hardly have be before mast otherwise boy never know what be good for suppose after experience will be inclined to put up with disagreeables may have at home rather than try running away again be mistaken ralph said with laugh did not run away be run away with kidnapped gentleman said in surprise know that merchantman have often difficulty in getting hand owing to need of men for navy did not know that have taken to press gang on own account know that have come to ralph replied fact be sir be out fishing few mile off dover when smack be in be run down in dark by french privateer be hauled on board a be bound for west indie have to make voyage whether liked not how long ago be that be run down about five month ralph replied why be not son of mr conway of dover be yes be sir do know can tell how be ralph asked eagerly believe that be well although of course must have suffered very greatly at disappearance have pleasure of knowing personally several friend of mine be acquainted with heard matter talked about at time boat be missing portion of be picked up by other fishing boat by shattered state of of plank said that have be run down beside there have be no wind about time disappeared so that there be little doubt vessel other have cut down happened to hear of from colonel bryant who be friend of mother yes know ralph put in have heard colonel bryant say that have not altogether abandoned hope still cling to idea that may have be run down by outward bound ship that have be saved carried away that declares that will not give up hope until ample time have elapsed for ship to make voyage to india return be very glad of ralph said have be great trouble to that must be thinking time be dead must not have minded having be carried away so much if have have chance of writing to to tell about never did have chance for came home by very first ship left port royal after arrived there how did get away from french privateer be captured well be rather long story sir ralph said modestly better gentleman replied have got fourteen hour journey before story will help pas time so try to cut short let have in full ralph thereupon told story lasted until coach reached tunbridge where stopped for passenger to dine well be adventure worth going through officer who have already mentioned that name be major barlow said be well for lad that possessed good spirit courage man who be cheerful willing under difficulty will always make way in world while one who repines kick against fate only make harder for have doubt that if instead of taking matter coolly when found on board privateer have fretted grumbled must have be made drudge kicked cuffed by everyone on board must not have have chance of landing at island of being chosen to make signal when went away must now be leading life of dog on board that brig cheerful willing be two of great watchword of success in life certainly have found so be eight o'clock when coach rattled up street of dover major barlow have already offered ralph to take to colonel bryant quarter to ask colonel to

return willingly agreed to accompany to mr conway quarter of hour walk took to house ralph remained outside when two officer entered colonel bryant lost time in opening subject have brought friend

chair sat for short time with face in hand cry happy tear thanking god for mercy then with great effort aroused will excuse emotion gentleman be sure can understand feeling be thankful indeed for news have brought have never ceased for moment to hope that boy must be restored to knowledge that be so that god have spared to be for moment overpowering where be ship met with major barlow where be

undress have be seized with sudden faintness have sunk into chair died without being able to summon assistance death be terrible shock to a will be to husband have long be aware that dear friend suffered from disease of heart that doctor consulted in london have told that death might take place at moment at same time have be so bright cheerful in london a indeed with be at time that death come almost with a great surprise to a if have not known that be in danger mr tallboy solicitor of weymouth who managed mr penfold affair called here last night funeral be to take place on thursday have ralph be in england said that must have written to to come down to must have done in time have started immediately received letter announcing event a be over in ireland of course nothing can be done said that have ralph come must have suggested that also must be present at reading of will that a matter stand did not think there be occasion to trouble must tell that mr tallboy appeared good deal worried one of reason for calling be to ask husband whether knew where mr penfold be in habit of keeping paper seems that upon day after return from london mr penfold called upon took away will saying that wanted to look over a have two three slight alteration that wanted to make must bring back in course of day two get to make change required from time mr penfold have not be in weymouth indeed have scarcely left house except to come down here for a said to husband did not feel quite supposed be reaction after late dissipation mr tallboy who be one of executor named in will have searched for in afternoon among mr penfold paper found that several other document lease so on of importance be missing have asked miss penfold if knew where brother be in habit of keeping important paper replied shortly that knew nothing whatever of brother business matter have therefore driven over to ask husband knowing how intimate have be with poor herbert knew seems that mr penfold have secure place for such paper because have one day spoken to upon subject saying must be more prudent for to leave lease in strong box in office at weymouth herbert replied that be stowed away in far safer place that have not least fear in world of being stolen now be just what husband knew also once when be chatting together herbert mentioned that house like many other old mansion contained secret chamber said ' ca tell where be withers for although be never likely to be used again knowledge of hiding place have be passed down from generation to generation a family secret gave solemn promise never to reveal when be first informed of existence although in day there be occasion to hide priest conspirator consider released from promise gave possibly day hiding place may prove of value again there may be price set on head of penfold who can tell anyhow be likely to remain secret a long a old house stand in meantime find useful place for keeping thing want lying about ' mr tallboy appeared very vexed at hearing what husband said 'it be very strange ' said 'that sensible men will do such foolish thing be probable enough that herbert penfold have placed will in hiding place speak of in case foresee that will have end of trouble know be aware of nature of mr penfold will may be sure that if sister of also know of whether do not ca say will bitterly resent know enough of family history to know that be evident by miss penfold answer to to day that doe not know secret of hiding place be of course possible that if doe know doe not mean to say must imagine that doe know 'have herbert penfold be of age when father died be likely enough that only a head of family must have be told by father of existence see be lad at time while miss penfolds be woman be therefore probably informed of secret be very awkward extremely awkward of course will may turn up between funeral if not hardly know what step have best be taken if penfold woman have made up mind that will will not see light be likely to carry through to end husband quite agreed with mr tallboy about so do have never be able to abide though a husband say be good woman in many respect always ready to help in parish matter still ca abide be sure have reason to do so for when husband first came here learned good deal of part have played in certain matter that of course set altogether against of course dear mr conway wish to alarm about will still ought to know how thing stand husband morning asked to tell there be to tell hope in few day to be able to write give better news thing may not be a fear mr conway sat for long time with letter before have not read straight through after glancing at first few line told of death of herbert penfold have laid aside be long time before took up again have be love of youth although have seemingly gone for so many year out of life knew that when have found how have time watched over so delicately aided that for sake be going to make ralph heir old feeling have be revived not that have thought that past must ever return letter indeed have shown that regarded life a approaching end since receipt of letter have always thought of with tender affection a one who might have be husband have not either evil fate malice stepped in to prevent fortnight have spent in london have brought very close together have assumed footing of brother have felt that pleasant kind a be to rest of party be for sake alone that festivity have be arranged have have one talk alone have then said that hoped expression have used in letter to with reference to health be not altogether justified for seemed so bright well have shaken head quietly said be just a well that must know mary have seen physician since came up to town think will last much longer little time ago did not wish to last now must be glad to go on until can see little scheme realized be quite sure that be not to be anyhow be ready to go when be summoned be happy in thought that few people care for be in fair way to be happy cry dear want single cloud to hang over memory of time be happier than have ever be in life want of to be very happy too have set mind upon if see cloud on face will spoil still in spite of have hoped doctor might have taken too gloomy view of case that herbert penfold death might yet be distant event now be over herbert penfold be dead heart have beat so kindly for be silenced forever be then long time before mr conway recovered sufficiently from emotion to take up letter again did so with air almost of indifference have learned news doubtless long epistle contained many detail of comparatively little interest a read air of languid grief gave way to expression of keen interest skimmed through last page two with anxious haste then reread more slowly carefully then throwing on table stood up walked up down little room so woman who have a believed ruined life herbert be now going to attack son rob of right must not do if must help never mary vernon have be high spirited girl although who have only known through widowhood must have taken for gentle quiet woman whose thought be entirely wrapped up in boy old spirit be alive yet a with head thrown back angry flush on cheek declared to herself that must defend ralph right to last how in what manner did not ask only knew that who must defraud be old enemy have be otherwise fact that be be sister must have softened toward now that fact only added to hostility bore nearest relation of blood have ruined life now must defeat dying wish must not be if must help must fight against to last day of life there be of course nothing to be done yet nothing until heard again nothing until knew that discovery of will be given up a hopeless then must be time for to do something thought barely occurred to that loss of will might make material difference in own circumstance that allowance herbert penfold have made have doubtless intended must continue to receive must cease be so secondary consideration that at present gave trouble be of ralph thought of ralph herbert be plan that latter have made plan have given happiness to last year of life of who have known so little happiness to be shattered to mind be even more than loss that ralph must suffer may have destroyed will said at last if not will find if take life to do so week later two letter arrived one be from mr withers will have not be found mr tallboy have searched in vain cabinet drawer in house have be ransacked sign have be found of will mr tallboy be perfectly convinced that must be hidden in altogether exceptional place will be not bulky document might have be stowed away in comparatively small hiding place such a secret drawer in cabinet lease be also missing be bulky must take up so large space that be convinced that have secret hiding place sufficiently large to hold existed in of article of furniture have searched must have discovered of course dear mr conway feel matter personally a mabel be a know made joint heiress with ralph of herbert property can not feel however that loss be greater in case than in ours mabel be never informed of herbert intention toward although must of course have be glad to know that child have such brilliant prospect loss of will not may hope in way affect happiness in case of son be different prospect in life will of course be seriously affected by loss husband begs to express to very deep regret at have talked over letter together while fully sharing indignation at conduct of miss penfold hardly see that anything can be done to discover will however must be able to point out manner in search for can be carried on will be happy to do what can to aid in matter a be clearly duty to endeavor to obtain for mabel fortune herbert penfold willed to mr tallboy tell that be clear miss penfold have quite determined upon line of conduct whatever may know have declined altogether to aid in search for will miss penfold saying in reply to request that must do so that have reason to believe from what brother have let fall that will be unjust iniquitous one if providence intended must see light must see at least must hing in matter asked plainly if be aware of existence of place in be likely that brother have placed to miss penfold who be a have always be spokesman of two sister said shortly that have never seen will that did want to see that did not know where brother have placed indeed for aught knew might have torn up a to hiding place knew of hiding place whose existence must in accordance with dictate of conscience divulge so be where be at present mr conway believe that mr tallboy be going to try get copy of will that have in possession admitted under circumstance a proof of herbert penfold intention owned to that thought be very doubtful whether must be able to do so especially a herbert have stated to that intended to make alteration must be quite possible that court might take view that in first place alteration might have be so extensive a to affect whole purport of will in second place that might have come to conclusion that must be easier to make whole will afresh so have destroyed one have by mr conway laid down letter after thinking for time opened other be in handwriting unknown to began dear madam mr withers tell that have informed of singular disappearance of will of late client mr herbert penfold beg to inform that will not let matter rest will apply to court to allow copy of will to be put in for probate if be refused for authorization to make closer search of hall than have hitherto be able to do supporting demand with affidavit made by rev mr withers ourselves of knowledge that late mr penfold be accustomed to keep document in secret receptacle in second place be glad to inform that annual sum paid by into kentish bank to credit will not be affected by loss of will for at time when payment first commenced mr penfold signed deed making payment first charge on rent of two of farm during lifetime assignment be of binding character of course continues to hold good will consider duty to acquaint from time to time with course of proceeding in matter of late mr penfold will little a mr conway have thought of from time when first heard that will be missing news that income must remain unchanged delighted have formed no plan for herself have vaguely contemplated necessity of giving up house a soon a be decided that will must not be found selling furniture for present taking small lodging be glad that there must be occasion for very much more glad that must be able now to make ralph allowance of seventy eighty pound year must make difference between living comfortably being obliged to pinch in way to subsist upon pay must also enable to carry out without difficulty plan might determine upon upon receipt of letter announcing mr penfold death have written to ralph telling of saying nothing about mr tallboy visit to withers report that be unable to find will now wrote to relating whole circumstance have not previously known mr penfold intention to make heir being only told that intended to push way in life have considered that promise be carried out by obtaining commission arranging allowance mother be glad of now of course loss of mr penfold will boy will make difference to a there can be doubt that have made provision in for regular payment of allowance have so kindly promised unless will be found will of course lose having be soldier daughter know that to live comfortably in army be necessary to have something beyond pay fortunately can assist little have now one le to feed clothe schooling expense have be calculating thing up find can allow seventy five pound year without making difference in manner of living will be able to see that for need therefore feel hesitation in accepting allowance be not large one know will make very great difference in comfort will be great pleasure to to know that will be able to enter into what amusement be going on not to look at penny make difference in world whether one have four sixpence nine shilling day to live upon wrote told of handsome present mr penfold made at parting boy must keep if be a reserve only to be touched in case of unexpected difficulty need one can ever say when such need may occur hope will not pain by writing to say want allowance because nothing can say will alter determination to pay allowance regularly quarter into agent hand will be of course very much more pleasant to to know that be a much pleasure to to be helped by a be to to help have heard several time from mr withers be well asked to send remembrance to when write give up hope that will may be found one of day be just a well that must not build in slightest upon ralph reply came in due time be in about fortnight afterward for mr conway letter have first to go by coach to london then two day journey by mail to liverpool then by sailing packet across to dublin then down to cork by coach have already written expressing regret at news of mr penfold death dear mother began be awfully good of to talk about making allowance to after what say of course can not think of refusing though must do so if thought payment must in slightest way inconvenience a say that now be away will make something like sum difference in expense must of course let do a like can only thank very heartily for must really have got on very well without fancy that good many men in regiment have nothing pay a manage very well there be reason must not manage too of course in war time thing be not kept up so expensively a be before lot of men get commission who must not have done so when army be only present size be considered a gentlemanly profession instead of real fighting machine however a say be great deal more pleasant having nine shilling day to live on instead of four sixpence be getting on capitally here of course there be lot of drill be a much a can to laugh sometimes sergeant who be fierce little man get into such wild rage over blunder say blunder for of course stapleton be drilled with recruit however think that in week will be over will then begin to learn work a officer be jolly set of fellow here always up to fun other always thought when fellow got to be men be rather serious seems to that there be ever so much more fun here among than there be at school of course newcomer get worried little just a do at school got off very well because see what with school privateer have learned to take thing good temperedly when fellow see that be a ready for fun a be soon give up bothering stapleton have have lot more trouble because see will look at thing seriously think be getting little better now used to get quite mad at first of course that made fellow ever so much worse must find door screwed up when went back after mess a soon a found that be awfully particular about boot filled full of water one night then one got ladder threw lot of cracker into bedroom in middle of night stapleton came rushing down in night shirt with sword drawn swearing must kill somebody of course have done can to get to leave alone for be really good fellow explained to that have never be to school have chance of learning to keep temper be getting on now will think soon be left alone have be awfully long letter there be only just enough candle left for to get into bed by anyhow mother be not bit upset about losing mr penfold allowance so worry at about week passed on mr tallboy wrote that have failed to induce court to accept copy of will admission be forced to make mr penfold have intended to make alteration in being fatal have however obtained order authorizing thoroughly to search house to take down wainscotting to pull up floor might appear likely to conceal hiding place fortnight later wrote again to announce failure miss penfolds said be so indignant that left house altogether may believe that ransacked from top to bottom have four carpenter two mason with think tapped square foot of wall in house took down wainscotting wherever there be slightest hollow sound lifted lot of flooring even wrenched up several of hearthstone must find nothing except that there be staircase leading from behind wainscotting in mr penfold room to door covered with ivy concealed from view by bush to left of house ivy have evidently be undisturbed for fifty year so passage even if known to mr penfold have certainly not be used in time truly regret dear madam that search must have be so unsuccessful can only say that must be done have be done that will be concealed somewhere have not shadow of doubt unless of course have be torn up before a to give opinion indeed a be matter in woman be concerned judgment a to probability be much more likely to be correct than mine a expected business connection with family have come to end miss penfolds have appointed agent who have written to requesting to hand over paper connected with property of course will do need hardly say that in case must have consented to act for whom consider to be unlawful possessor of property in conclusion can only say that service will at time be at disposal mr conway be scarcely disappointed at receipt of letter for have quite made up mind that will must not be found woman have clearly made up mind to deprive ralph mabel of right unless have felt perfectly satisfied that search must discover hiding place of will must not improbably have taken either destroyed concealed in fresh place where searcher must never be likely to look for did not think likely therefore that hiding place must be discovered felt assured that be discovered must be found empty very well said in quiet determined voice a laid down letter mr tallboy have failed now will take up matter dare say think that have won miss penfold that be now mistress beyond dispute of herbert property will see battle have only just begun will last can tell life mine week later altogether unexpected event took place when mr mr withers be at breakfast letter arrived from mr littleton now solicitor to miss penfolds upon opening be found to contain offer upon part of miss penfolds to settle sum of hundred year for life upon mabel upon condition only that allowance must be stopped upon marriage unless marriage received approval in writing of miss penfolds letter be addressed to mr withers after reading through passed to wife without word be too surprised to say anything for moment especially a mabel be in room laid letter beside until breakfast be over mabel have gone out well james what do think of asked what do think of replied mr withers hesitated then said well james be sort of thing requires so much thinking about have scarcely have time to turn over in mind yet especially with mabel there eating breakfast opposite having idea that letter contained anything of such importance to must really rather hear what think about mr withers remained silent went on of course must be very nice thing for mabel to have provision for life slight smile passed across mr withers face wife saw that be not at way in looked at be just like men james said little pettishly ask what think about thing when have perfectly made up mind what mean to do whether agree with not think that be often case with still did want to see whether matter must have struck at once in same light in see perceive that have not well james let hear view of matter dare say will agree with when tell what be well then amy mr withers said seriously appears to that can not accept offer for mabel mr withers looked little blank living be not rich one assured a have be by mr penfold that intended to provide for mabel have not endeavored to lay by anything for have freely dispensed surplus income among sick needy of parish disappearance of will have disappointed hope raised many anxious thought in mr withers mind respecting mabel future offer contained in letter have therefore filled with pleasure greatly valued husband judgment therefore only replied why dear well see wife be thoroughly agreed that lady be depriving mabel of fortune herbert penfold left be concealing have destroyed will be at present in what may call fraudulent possession of property now think that under circumstance can accept favor at hand to do so must be practically to acquiesce in what consider robbery of child acceptance must of course involve renewal of friendly relation with thing believing a do that be acting wickedly must be distasteful in extreme not to say impossible of course be right dear mr withers said rising from seat going over kissing husband tenderly have not thought of in light at in fact have hardly thought about at except that must be nice to see mabel provided for must be nice dear surely need not be anxious about may hope that will make happy marriage may hope too that may be spared long enough to make provision for for of course must now curtail expense lay by a much a can for lastly dear need not be anxious because trust god will provide for must not be enabled to do so even be sure that must be taken together must rather leave in hand than accept money wrongfully obtained condone abominable action there be too point from matter must be looked at see curious condition that propose that annuity will be forfeited unless marry with sanction why must propose condition be sure know james for of course must never give sanction to marriage unless approved of choice surely miss penfolds must not disapprove of choice that approved of well might dear know how bitterly disliked ralph conway how resented being at hall be quite possible may have have idea of herbert view about mabel be determined that will not benefit through mabel by one penny of brother property clause be specially designed so that in case two young people ever must come together may be able if not to stop at rate to stop annuity be only interpretation can give to condition very likely that be so james really woman seem to get more detestable day mr withers smiled at wife vehemence there be still reason why can not take money ralph conway have be a much defrauded a mabel mother a see by letter be determined not to sit down quietly under wrong what mean to do have not slightest idea do think that there be most remote probability will ever succeed in finding will tallboy appears to have made most thorough search of house do what will can not have opportunity of searching a have done still clearly have something on mind intends to make attempt other to discover will if found will benefit mabel equally with son therefore can not regard a friend ally now be to accept money for mabel must in fact be acquiescing not only in wrong done to in done to ralph must in fact be going over to enemy must not take money even tacitly connive in effort to find will agree with entirely james must be impossible only do wish have said before letting be so foolish a to say that thought ought to take did say so dear mr withers said smiling only gave expression to first natural thought of mother that must be nice thing for mabel have given matter further consideration than be quite sure that a soon a thought matter over must see in same light do think that before send off reply must put matter before mabel have doubt whatever what answer will be at same time ought to know of offer have be made to chapter ix mr tallboy visitor mr withers be fully justified in conviction that there need be doubt a to view mabel must take of miss penfold offer girl have hitherto be in entire ignorance a to will being missing of interest have in be now called in from garden be much surprised when father told to sit down a mother wished to have serious talk with do know little mabel began that have have narrow escape of being heiress heiress papa do mean of having lot of money yes of coming in day to fortune mr penfold time ago confided to mother intention of dividing property equally between ralph conway what penfold estate papa house everything yes dear everything including large sum of money have accumulated during year mr penfold have not be spending third of income then if meant that papa how be that be not going to be heiress simply dear because will by mr penfold left property to ralph be missing mr withers then told whole story of loss of will search have be made for strong ground there be for believing in existence of secret place in hall that place of concealment be known to mr penfold sister surely must never be so wicked a papa have always seemed to like not very much know because thought be quiet ladylike enough still think really disliked think in way liked mabel perhaps if mr penfold have half left property to divided other half between will must have be found certainly did not like ralph conway disliked partly doubt for principally on account of wrong believe once did to mother now be in human nature mabel that may forgive wrong done to be very hard to forgive person have wronged anyhow be convinced that be more to prevent mr conway son from getting money than to get that have concealed will rather that refuse to point out place of concealment doe seem hard papa mr penfold must have left everything to ralph nothing to sister miss penfolds have very comfortable income of own mabel brother might very well have thought there be occasion for to have more beside although lived in house indeed managed mr penfold have know strong reason to believe that have ruined life be matter into need not go well mabel miss penfolds have just given proof that dislike now will read letter because think ought to know have be written will then tell reason why mother think that offer can not be accepted mabel listened in silence until father have finished argument have used with wife with exception only of relating to miss penfolds motif in putting in condition concerning mabel marriage when ceased speaking exclaimed indignantly of course papa must not take money not if be ten time a much why must not look mr conway ralph in face again beside how must speak to people one belief to have done wicked thing very well mabel be quite sure that must agree with at same time thought be right before refused offer must know that be made sentiment on subject might be must not have be justified in refusing without knowledge offer might from worldly point of view be interest to accept why papa mabel said must rather go out weed turnip watch sheep like of girl in village than penny of miss penfolds money short time after mr tallboy clerk brought letter into private office lady asked to give sir solicitor opened contained only card show lady in how be madam be glad to have pleasure of making acquaintance suppose be staying with mr withers mr tallboy be at hotel here only arrived hour since by packet from dover dear be afraid have have very unpleasant voyage have not be pleasant mr conway said quietly preferred to long journey by coach up to london down here again be five day on way a vessel put in at so many port still be quite minor question with wanted to see have talk with personally there be saying into whose hand letter may fall one talk face to face doe more good than score of letter mr tallboy looked rather surprised idea flashed across mind that only business mr conway must want to see about must be proposal for raising money upon security of annuity presume mr tallboy from what hear that be a thoroughly convinced a be that will of mr penfold be in existence be hidden somewhere about hall yes think so mr conway be supposing have not be destroyed do think likely that have be destroyed mr tallboy well that can not say solicitor said gravely have of course thought much over matter be one naturally vexed much for several reason in first place mr withers have be good enough to place matter in hand to authorize to act for be always sort of vexation to professional man when client lose cause especially when be convinced that be in right in second place be much disturbed that wish of late client mr penfold must not have be carried out thirdly feel now that be somewhat to blame in matter in did not represent to mr penfold imprudence of placing valuable paper in place where must anything happen to suddenly might not be found of course must not have anticipated hostile action on part of miss penfolds still blame did not warn mr penfold of possibility of what have in fact happened taking place lastly smiled have personal feeling in matter have lost business added somewhat considerably to income think of have thought of blaming in matter mr tallboy be sure have not must not possibly have foreseen mr penfold sister be likely to turn out thief well be rather strong expression mr conway though natural enough must admit in position a mr ralph conway mother see there be difference between concealing not disclosing mr penfold concealed will miss penfolds simply refuse to assist in search for a nearest heir take possession of property quite so mr conway be not defending conduct morally be dishonest in extreme doubt whether court of law must find to be punishable offense well now mr tallboy want to let know whether suspect that have destroyed will suppose must be punishable offense certainly destruction of will in order that who destroyed might get possession of property must be criminal well know have thought over in sense think balance of probability be against having destroyed in first place miss penfolds doubtless consider that will be so securely hidden there be little if chance of being discovered that be so know from fact that although ransacked house from top to bottom pulled down wainscoting lifted floor tried imaginable point men who be working with suspected to be likely spot for hiding place did not succeed in finding now have noticed that lady have at time somewhat peculiar idea a to morality be apt to steer very close to wind miss penfolds may consider perfectly justified in declining to give assistance in finding will soothing conscience by reflection that by such refusal be committing offense of law take cognizance while doing might shrink from absolutely criminal offense of destroying will say now have entered upon path have that must not destroy will if thought there be chance of being discovered only say that thinking to be absolutely safe be unlikely to perform act if discovered must bring under power of law may consider free to believe if not actually to believe to try convince that for aught know brother may have destroyed will that be not for to prove whether did so not upon ground therefore seems to probable that will be still in existence acknowledge so far a utility be concerned might a well have be destroyed by mr penfold by sister well mr tallboy doubt be thinking that might a well have expressed opinion to on paper have troubled very unnecessarily in making journey to have from own lip well yes mr conway deny that be in mind must have be useless for to make journey have be mr tallboy be very glad to have heard opinion agrees exactly with have formed be scarcely with object of eliciting have made journey will now proceed to part of subject agree that will be probably still in existence that be hidden somewhere about hall next question be how be to be found ah be very difficult question indeed mr conway yes be difficult not think impossible have done best mr tallboy have failed have further suggestion to offer plan occurs to by might discover none mr tallboy said decidedly have done must do have in fact dismissed question altogether from mind have authority of court to search have searched very fully have reported failure to court power to search must certainly not be renewed unless upon very strong ground indeed suppose not mr tallboy be what expected well seems to that having done in power for client having now relinquished search be time for of to take matter in hand ' mr tallboy looked surprised quite understand mr conway how can take in hand no well can tell mr tallboy be going to do so be not going to sit down quietly see son robbed of inheritance have quite made up mind to devote life to matter have come not to ask advice for dare say must try to dissuade resolution be unalterable to ask to give what aid can in matter will be glad to give aid in way mr conway if will point out to direction in assistance can be of use suppose have formed sort of plan for own can see direction whatever in can set about matter intention be mr tallboy to search for hiding place mr tallboy raised eyebrow in surprise to search mr conway how do propose to gain admittance to hall how even supposing that gain admittance do propose to do more than have done even so much because fresh disturbance of fabric of house must be out of question that quite admit still know there be hiding place be morally certain that hiding place be opened approached by touching of secret spring be not by pulling down wainscoting by pulling up floor by force used in way that be to be found mr penfold must seem used habitually a depository for paper of value certainly therefore have not to break down to pull up anything opened a must open other cabinet cupboard by mean of key by touching spring agree with so far mr tallboy certainly mr conway there can be doubt in mind that hiding place whether chamber small closet be opened in way speak of very well then have to be looked for be spring force be requisite be to be done be to find spring yes how be to be found believe tried square foot of building have doubt did will be necessary to try square inch will not say of whole building of certain room passage think may assume that be not in upper room servant quarter hiding place must be contrived where must be used by owner of house without observation from dependant must therefore be either in drawing room dining room principal bed chamber passage corridor stair between adjoining quite follow in reasoning mr conway agree with doubtless place be so situated a to be what may call handy to owner of hall still see how be going to set about finding be going to set about by going to live at hall going to live at hall mr conway how be that possible under circumstance be must say last person whom miss penfolds must at present invite to take up residence there agree with if have idea of identity be just what intend will not have plan be to go there in capacity of servant once there will examine a say square inch of room place where hiding place be likely to exist knob knot inequality of kind in wood work stone work will be pressed pulled twisted until find be aware that task may occupy month even year for of course opportunity will be limited still whether month year intend to undertake to carry through if life be spared until have have time thoroughly completely to carry out mr tallboy be silent from sheer astonishment do realty mean that think of going there a servant mr conway certainly do replied calmly suppose work will be harder for than for other woman whereas do for ten twelve pound year will do for fortune see not slightest difficulty objection in part of business will of course let house at dover making arrangement for son letter there being forwarded for letter to being posted in dover will have satisfaction that while engaged upon work income will be accumulating for benefit own can see difficulty whatever in plan being carried out now a to assistance that wish to give must perhaps have be more readily given by mr withers for naturally must know personally most of servant of hall a majority of doubtless belong to village mr withers a clergyman might have conscientious scruple against taking part in scheme however righteous end must be conducted by what must consider underground method involving certain amount of deceit at rate think better that mr withers must have complicity whatever in plan therefore come to what want in first place be to find out when vacancy be likely to be caused by servant leaving secondly if such vacancy be likely to occur for vacancy to be manufactured by inducing servant to leave present of year wage must probably accomplish thirdly vacancy must occur in case of servant whose work must naturally lie in part of building have to examine finally must be arranged can be so recommended a to insure getting place mr tallboy be silent for time certainly plan doe appear feasible mr conway said at length doe seem to that if once installed in way propose at hall prepared to spend a say month even year in search be possible even probable that in end may light upon spring will open mystery must be prepared to face much unpleasantness will have for time to associate with servant to do menial work to relinquish luxury appliance to have life be accustomed possibly to fail at last still if be prepared to face there doe appear to to be possibility of enterprise being crowned with success have thought over mr tallboy be quite prepared to submit to sacrifice mention however will scarcely be felt by to be sacrifice working a will be for future of son now can rely upon assistance will have assistance can give assuredly mr conway matter be by mean simple one still can see reason why must not be successfully carried out must take time that quite anticipate mr tallboy time fortunately be of consequence well mr conway mr tallboy said after sitting for minute in thought be matter will require careful thinking over how long do intend staying here just a long a be necessary mr conway said day month have not given own name at 'george will be known there a mr brown a saw sent card in in envelope so that even clerk must not be aware that mr conway be in weymouth solicitor said suddenly surely miss penfolds knew in old time certainly did to begin with be nearly twenty year ago of course have changed very much since then not very much mr conway lawyer said for once have pleasure of seeing when went to hall to see mr penfold on business say must have known anywhere having have card remembered at once when came into room indeed if will excuse saying so might pas anywhere a thirty so much better for purpose at present mr conway replied thirty will do very well for age of housemaid at hall must imagine miss penfolds must prefer woman of age to young girl beside see must be upper housemaid in order to have charge of part of house want to examine a to knowing in first place miss penfolds will not have advantage of receiving card in second place be not very difficult for woman to alter appearance so a to be unrecognizable by who have not seen for twenty year hair be good deal darker now than be then wore altogether differently little black dye on eyebrow servant cap gown will so alter that who see now must hardly know certainly will not do so need not trouble about mr tallboy will answer for that will not know be possible just possible that mr mr withers might know if saw in church will without letting know plan guard against indiscretion now a have quite settled matter mr tallboy will go back to inn when have thought matter over decided upon best plan for carrying out wish will send note to mr brown at 'george making appointment for to meet here mr tallboy sat for time in thought after mr conway have left be certainly daring scheme requiring little courage resolution self possession to carry out client evidently possessed quality have clear head seemed to have grasped point in matter there be really reason why must not succeed there must be spring somewhere if be a patient a declared to be must surely find sooner later be if must carry out search without exciting suspicion first difficulty be to get settled at hall what be best way to set about certainly be not a easy a seemed to think still there must be way of managing at rate must act cautiously in matter must not appear in in way personally so sat thinking until at last clerk who have be good deal surprised at receiving instruction from a to several matter have in hand knocked at door came in with number of paper mr tallboy be obliged to dismiss matter from mind for time to attend to present business very next morning mr conway received note again went to office do know mr conway began a soon a client entered more think over matter more feel that be extremely difficult to manage from here must have to engage one to go over in first place must have to stay in village time before must make acquaintance of servant at hall must have to get very intimate with before must venture to broach thing for if made mistake woman told mistress that one have be trying to persuade to leave in order to introduce into place suspicion must be so aroused that scheme must become hopeless yes see difficulty mr tallboy for thought over in way before came to beside like thought of intermediate doubt must choose trustworthy man still like thought of one knowing secret especially a plan may take so long working out what have be thinking mr conway be doubt servant at hall have taken side on matter of course from search there know that mr penfold will be missing that be because be missing that miss penfolds be now mistress there without knowing anything about feeling of servant there beyond what must probably be case from difference of character between mr penfold sister must imagine that be fond of for be kindest most easy going of master not very fond of sister who be a have always observed in course of professional visit there reverse of agreeable if be case not improbably there may be one other of woman with whom might open direct negotiation what have struck be men who be over there with of course slept took meal in village still going about a did in house doubt talked with servant miss penfolds be away dare say woman have plenty of time to gossip be probable men gathered from talk something of sentiment toward miss penfolds brother side must be likely to go with might ask foreman about think idea be capital one mr tallboy there be one detail think might be improved imagine that if instead of asking foreman choose youngest best looking of men provided be unmarried be more likely to get at woman sentiment mr tallboy laughed doubt be right mr conway that will be done must get foreman first though for know name address of other men will tell frankly want to find out opinion of servant at hall about missing will ask of men be most given to gossip with tell to send here to at ten o'clock to morrow morning then when see hear what have to say can judge for how far care to trust in matter whether to trust at perhaps will come here few minute before ten then can tell what foreman have said first accordingly at quarter to ten next day mr conway be again at office think mr conway that thing be going even better than hoped foreman said that from what little talk have with servant thought have be attached to mr penfold that sister be by mean popular among said very often one other of must come into room where be working make suggestion hunt about to see if must find anything best part of be that one of carpenter steady fellow of twenty five took up a call with upper housemaid belief there be talk about being married day if be so must be very thing for must help to get married girl must help to get place very thing mr conway said nothing must have turned out better in few minute young carpenter arrived be pleasant looking young fellow mr conway be not surprised at impression have made upon housemaid at hall sit down johnson mr tallboy began know what asked to come here for mr peter told that be something to do with job have at miss penfolds sir yes be johnson know be looking for missing will there yes sir so understood now what wanted to ask specially johnson be whether can tell what servant at hall thought about young carpenter turned rather red in face twisted cap about in finger well sir know that can say much about think most of be overfond of miss penfolds must have be sorry if will have be found that must have given master mistress just so johnson be what thought be likely now point want to know johnson lady here be may tell interested in matter of will being found be a to whether there be in opinion one of maid at hall who must be trusted to aid in business of course must make worth while to do so again young carpenter colored fidgeted on chair examining cap intently suppose must depend on what wanted to do said at last hall be good service though like mistress of course none of must like to do anything might risk place be natural enough johnson see must perhaps more than make up to for risk well know sir man said after pause be only place see young woman must like to risk getting into row like being turned away in disgrace perhaps even worse know what want see sir mr tallboy looked at mr conway eye expressed question how far will go replied by taking matter in own hand can trust ca whether agree to help not yes ma'be said more decidedly than have hitherto spoken can trust if tell what want will tell straight whether can do anything if like matter sha go beyond very well then will tell exactly what want believe that will be still there believe that if one in house be to make thorough search might be found be right that must be found that property must go to to whom mr penfold left who be now being kept out of by miss penfolds be very much interested in matter because be son who be being cheated out of right have made up mind to find will now what want to know be do think that one of housemaid must be willing to give up place introduce a successor if gave twenty five pound must be nice little sum know to begin housekeeping with mr conway saw at once by expression of young carpenter face that have secured a ally think that might be managed ma'be said in tone showed be endeavoring to hide gladness yes think must be managed there be certainly young woman at hall stopped mr conway helped may tell mr johnson that foreman hinted to mr tallboy that thought upper housemaid be likely one of day to come together be principally why spoke to instead of to one of others who be there thought see that might probably be leaving place one of day perhaps twenty five pound might enable to marry earlier than otherwise must have done in case see must suit must moreover have satisfaction of knowing that be aiding to right great wrong to restore to who have be defrauded property mr penfold intended for what do say well ma'be think that a say must be doing right thing deny that martha have agreed to wait year two till must save up enough between for to start on own account for a long a be journeyman liable to lose work day must not ask to come to what with what have laid by money offer think might very well venture radiant face showed happiness prospect caused very well then may consider that a settled mr conway said what want be for to tell martha that be to give notice to leave at once that if have opportunity be to mention to miss penfold that have friend who be out of place at present whom be sure will suit of course a will say that be going to leave to be married miss penfold can not be vexed with a might be otherwise may take friend on recommendation suppose must ma'be young carpenter face fell considerably at thought where must martha be then will pay money of course mr conway said whether get place through not must think that miss penfold will very likely be glad to be saved trouble of looking for servant if not must try other way to get place what name be to say friend have let think ann sibthorpe suppose asks about where friend have be in service ma'be about character will settle afterward first thing to do be for to go over see ask if be willing to leave do think can answer for ma'be young carpenter said with quiet smile very well still have better have settled will go over to day see then by to morrow mr tallboy will have talked matter over settled about other point of course will tell not to give notice until have heard from a to what be to say about very well ma'be will start at once can arrange about character mr tallboy said when be alone have cousin in london to whom will write explain matter who will be sure oblige by writing to say that ann sibthorpe be can be desired a servant steady quiet industrious capable well really congratulate mr conway at first thought project hopeless one now think have chance of success chapter x on detachment ralph be soon at home in regiment found comrade cheery pleasant set of men ready to assist newly joined young officer a far a must few rough practical joke be played ralph took with such perfect good temper that be soon abandoned applied very earnestly to mastering mystery of drill be not long before be pronounced to be efficient be then at captain o'connor request appointed to company in there happened to be vacancy for ensign have have good luck to have excellent servant assigned to denis mulligan be thoroughly handy fellow must turn hand to anything be always good tempered cheery fellow be rather free easy in way captain o'connor told ralph when allotted man to will get accustomed to keep whisky locked up think will be safe in other respect with be servant to captain daly who be killed at toulouse know daly must have parted with on account master death almost broke denis ' heart have doubt will get just a much attached to in time fellow have fault want little humoring take a whole must rather have irish soldier servant than one of other nationality provided always that be not too fond of bottle about once in three month consider reasonable think will find mulligan break out more frequently than ralph never regretted choice o'connor have made for found denis excellent servant eccentricity opinion freely expressed afforded constant source of amusement few day later captain o'connor came into room pack up kit company be ordered on detached duty there be end to dancing flirting know about flirting ralph laughed a far a can see do enough for whole company in way where be going to be ordered to ballyporrit out of way hole a man must wish to be buried in seems that there be lot of still at work in neighborhood gauger have applied for military aid nice job have got before have have turn at before know what mean starting at nightfall tramping ten fifteen mile over hill through bog arriving at last at wretched hut only to find wretched old woman sitting by peat fire divil sign of still mash tub anything else start first thing to morrow morning so have better get kit packed flask filled to night have nineteen mile march before pretty bad road to travel have just be in to desmond quarter be tearing hair at thought of having to leave gayeties of cork think be nice change ralph said will be very glad to have done with party ball ballyporrit be near sea be yes about mile away believe nearly forty mile from here detachment marched next morning ralph enjoyed novelty of march be not sorry when at end of second day tramp reached village men be quartered in house of villager officer took room at inn except when engaged in expedition to capture still of succeeded in finding nearly score there be not much to do at ballyporrit gentry resident within wide circle called upon invitation to dinner dance flowed in rapidly a one officer be obliged to remain always in village with detachment ralph seldom availed of invitation o'connor lieutenant desmond be fond of society a ralph very much preferred staying quietly in quarter be always ready to volunteer to take duty upon occasion ballyporrit lay within mile of sea ralph when have nothing else to do frequently walked to edge of cliff sat there hour after hour watching sea breaking among rock three four hundred foot below sea bird flying here there over water occasionally dashing down to surface few fishing boat must be seen be seldom that distant sail be visible across water for not one vessel in day sailed for west to fifty now cross atlantic rock upon sat rose in most place almost sheer up from edge of sea occasionally fell away good climber must make way over rough rock bowlder down to water edge a however there be nothing to be gained by ralph never made attempt looking back over land view be dreary one there be not human habitation within sight hill be covered with brown heather while in bottom lay bog deep treacherous to who knew not way across be rarely that human figure be visible once twice day revenue man came along edge of cliff must generally stop for talk with ralph there be said good deal of smuggling carried on along part of coast during war there be not so much of now though doubt cargo be run now then doe not pay a did when french port be closed there be not drop of brandy to be have save that be run by smuggler now that trade be open again there be only duty to save fancy good many of boat have gone out of business see revenue have got agent in french port get news from what craft be over there loading what part of coast come from along english coast there be still good deal of there lace pay well there be not much sale for lace in ireland not much sale for brandy excepting in town peasant farmer must not thank for when can get home made whisky for next to nothing suppose that there be good deal of going on amount of sir for still be captured reckon there must be hundred at work that one dream of will be a long a barley grows there be bog hill over country safe hiding place where one not in secret must dream of searching boy know that be not in line of business mind own affair if be not for can tell must go along cliff at night for pay king must give for know before week must be out body must be found morning down there on rock coroner jury must bring in verdict of tumbled over by accident although there must be man of must know better well be sure want to find out anything about belong to detachment in ballyporrit of course if gauger call upon must march out aid in seizing still beyond that be affair of ours yet although so seldom saw one to speak to ralph have sometimes sort of uncomfortable feeling that be being watched once twice have caught glimpse of what thought be man head among rock on walking carelessly to spot must see sign of one time looking suddenly round saw boy standing at edge of boggy ground where land dipped suddenly away two hundred yard from edge of cliff directly saw that be observed took to heel speedily disappeared down valley ralph did not trouble about matter did see reason why one must interest in movement have wandered about among hill inland might be taken for spy trying to find out of hidden still sitting here at edge of cliff watching sea surely such absurd suspicion must fall upon have be there at night smuggler might have suspected of keeping watch for smuggler never attempted to run cargo in broad daylight never came down there after dark one day peasant came strolling along be powerful looking man carried heavy stick ralph be lying on back looking up at cloud did not hear man approach till be close to then with quick movement sprang to foot did not hear coming said have given quite start be fine day yer honor for sleeping on turf here man said civilly be not asleep ralph said though own be getting on for be yer honor expecting to meet one here man asked sure be mighty lonesome sort of place be not expecting one have only come out for look at sea be never tired of looking at that be big lot of water surely man replied looking over sea with air of interest a if sight be altogether novel to powerful lot of water have heard say that often come out here yes often come out ralph assented think now be dangerous so near edge of cliff yer honor just one step over must go must be ten chance to one that next tide must drift body away divil one know have become of mean to take false step ralph said sure there be many one take false step when be dreaming about if ye did tumble over by just push must do yes there be one to give one push ralph said maybe maybe not man replied say if be gentleman must spind time a liked must be sitting here on edge of cliff where might come to harm minute have fear of coming to harm ralph answered must be sorry for one who tried always carry pistol not that think there be chance of having to use be always a well to be prepared be that yer honor always a well think must be always coming out here if be why not good fellow harm one interfere with one surely be open to to come here look at sea without one taking offense at be a may be yer honor anyhow have told what think of good morning to wonder what that fellow meant ralph said looking after meant something feel certain though what be ca imagine thought be a well to let know have pistol handy though did look a if intended mischief suppose after have better not come here so often though have not remotest idea in world why must annoy one more by standing here than if be standing on cliff in front of dover castle however certainly be lonely place must have precious little chance if two three men took into head to attack here be queer people irish peasant of yours o'connor ralph said a sat at dinner that evening what be matter with now conway one ca even go look at sea from cliff without taking amiss ralph related conversation have have with peasant adding that be convinced have be watched whenever went there be curious certainly captain said when have finished no doubt think be spying after something must not trouble unless there be something be afraid of finding out there have be something going on there be hiding place down there on face of cliff where maybe have still at work anyhow think must neglect warning conway might be killed thrown over cliff one be wiser for must certainly advise to give up mooning about there be nothing to do in wretched village ralph said discontentedly not if stop in village grant might do a desmond do when be off duty go over take lunch at ryans burke of other family where have standing invitation be always glad to see one there be plenty of fun to be have be very well for o'connor be captain single man one of countryman with lot to say for be different thing with altogether ca drop in make myself at home a do why be not shy conway o'connor said in affected horror surely such disgrace have not fallen on majesty twenty eighth regiment that one of officer be shy such thing be not recorded in annals be afraid will have to be recorded now laughed ralph for own be shy if call shy feeling awkward uncomfortable with lot of strange people especially lady let be whispered outside o'connor said reputation of regiment be gone forever among irish girl desmond be sad business what be to do with man must consult together how thing be to be cured o'connor ralph said earnestly knowing how fond o'connor be of practical joke dreading that lieutenant must be putting in ridiculous position other will never cure if set about will get over in time be sort of thing becomes ten time worse if attempt to cure must think over lad o'connor said seriously be serious defect in character a commanding officer consider bounden duty for sake that of regiment to take into serious consideration see what be to be done may never have such chance again of being cured a have here for if man go away from ireland without being cured of shyness case be absolutely hopeless one desmond must turn matter seriously over in mind will do same now be time for to be starting for dance at regans be sorry ca go with desmond a be on duty will be very glad to take duty desmond ralph said eagerly told so morning thought agreed a commanding officer o'connor said gravely can not permit exchange to be made mr conway have duty to perform to regiment a well a mr desmond duty clearly be to go out make agreeable be surprised after what have just be saying that must think of staying at home well of course if want to go will go ralph said reluctantly know regans want to be very ungracious conway mr regan be retired pork merchant of cork

must buy three fourth of up money smell of pork still a election be coming on have relaxed bit be got militia band there will be lashing of everything girl be nice girl whether father sold pork not must be nothing short of cruel if representative of majesty army did not put in appearance especially a have doubtless eaten many barrel of salt pork at sea so put on number one coatee let be off with sign ralph rose to carry out order must have be still more reluctant to go have observed sly wink that passed between captain lieutenant be quite refreshing that boy o'connor said a door closed behind ralph that adventure in west indie showed have plenty of pluck presence of mind be a shy a girl though know why must say that for be mighty few of have shyness about will grow out of be just same myself when be age lieutenant desmond burst into roar of laughter must have liked to have known then o'connor o'connor joined in laugh be true though desmond be brought up by two maiden aunt in town

fool of myself in other direction think be likely to in sort of way prior attachment eh captain o'connor asked quizzically ah be secret o'connor ralph laughed be not going to lay heart bare to mocker a be when reached village found body of twenty men drawn up opposite quarter be that o'connor lieutenant asked a trap stopped just after have gone gauger came in requested that party might accompany at three o'clock morning to hunt up still among hill be glad be back in time a did not like going away without there being one in charge here be nuisance for be just beginning to rain however ca be helped will go if like desmond ralph said jumping down must like good tramp morning after hot room be quite sure must like lieutenant asked quite sure beside be turn for duty morning so that really be place to go with if captain o'connor have objection not least in world conway suppose desmond have fancy for tramping among hill if have there be reason in world why must not go couple of minute sufficed to exchange full dress regimentals for undress uniform covered by military greatcoat then ralph hurried out just a excise officer came up be going to have damp march of mr fitzgibbon ralph said better sir there will be thick mist on hill will hide better even than night there be moon at present a likely a not will have boy on watch be ready sir quite ready attention form four march little party started how far be going ralph asked revenue officer about seven mile sir be about half past three now will be there somewhere about six doe not begin to be light until seven so there be particular hurry hope know way mr fitzgibbon be so dark here can scarcely see hand if get into fog talk about will be a black a ink oh know way officer said confidently keep along road for two mile then turn up track leading up valley follow that for three mile then branch to right cross over one two slight rise then follow slight depression till be within hundred yard of place must find way there with eye shut that sound easy enough ralph said know how difficult be finding one way in fog however must hope will get there all right sergeant have men got anything in haversack yes sir captain o'connor ordered to take breakfast ration of bread told to see that water bottle be filled here moved closer up to ralph so that must not be heard by men gave couple of bottle of whisky to mix with water told to fill bottle so that men must know what be in till have breakfast otherwise there must be none left by time wanted to eat bread be always thoughtful captain be be very good plan sergeant will bear in mind for future will want something before get back after fourteen mile march fine mist continued steadily a tramped along night seemed to grow darker darker turned off from road a began to ascend track along valley cloud seemed to settle round excise officer walked ahead keeping upon path ralph followed a closely a must in footstep although almost touching must not make out figure in darkness tell men to follow in single file sergeant said keeping touch with other a long a be on beaten track know be right there may be bowlder anything else close by on one side other marching a closely a must to other party proceeded how on earth be going to find place where turn off mr fitzgibbon ralph asked will find easy enough sir path regularly fork there be pile of stone at junction make a good guide a can want on dark night ca miss even on night like ralph have struck light with flint steel looked at watch at point where turned off from road did same thing two three time a went along be hour twenty minute since turned off mr fitzgibbon even allowing for stoppage when have got off path ought to be near turning now yes fancy be not far off now sir can feel that be rising more sharply there be rise in last hundred yard so before reach place where road fork have better go little more slowly now sir five minute there be stumble fall in front of ralph halt exclaimed sharply what be mr fitzgibbon have fallen over pile of stone officer said hurt confoundedly think have better halt till daylight think can keep on nearer get there better if must miss path can halt then wait till daybreak well can do ralph agreed will go on ahead sir twenty thirty yard at time then speak can bring men on to then will go on again will be slow work can keep path better if go at own pace ralph agreed proceeded in manner for time think be on track now ralph said at last oh yes be officer replied confidently ralph stooped felt ground grass be very short observed be grass officer followed example oh be only track now said just footpath grass be not worn off be convinced be right well ralph said just go little way to right left see if grass get longer seems to same officer did so be obliged to own that must not perceive difference ralph now spread men out in line directed to feel on ground to see if must discover track failed to do so ralph then ordered together again will halt here sergeant till daylight be use groping about in dark for anything know may be going exactly in wrong direction men can of course sit down if like may a well eat piece of bread try water bottle tell not to eat more than ration may be longer before get out of than expect order be given men piled arm seated on short turf presently ralph heard sudden exclamation of surprise satisfaction a one of men tasted content of water bottle in minute there be buzz of talk before scarce word have be spoken men have be marching in sort of sulky silence disgusted at being taken from bed for work disliked at long march through damp night air satisfaction at unexpected comfort loosened tongue pipe be produced lighted discomfort of situation altogether forgotten desmond have handed to ralph flask packet of sandwich have prepared for too felt le strongly chilling effect of damp darkness after partaking of excise officer have also made preparation must be more certain a to whereabouts if have stopped at heap of stone a proposed mr fitzgibbon deny sir be right a have turned out only must have believed must have missed path did want to get close to place before be observed knew that must actually surprise till morning for hut lie distance in bog there must be crossing unless must see still if must have got to edge without alarm being given must not have time to hide thing before reached have ridden across place many time after dark never missed way be sagacity of horse more than own expect ralph said horse can find way along path have once traveled better than man can do in first place think can see better in night in second have sort of instinct to guide however suppose much matter will find path easily enough in morning a said mist will hide movement quite a effectually a darkness must do at last morning began to break in dim misty light a grew stronger be able to perceive how dense be fog surrounded at three pace distant be invisible to other doe not seem to that be much better off than be before so far a finding path lie what do think look bad certainly officer admitted reluctantly be awfully sorry have led into mess ca be helped ralph said must make best of matter at rate be better than be mist be not nearly a heavy a when be marching up valley chapter xi still hunting now sergeant men may a well fall in ralph said cheerfully then will set about finding path on side do think be most likely to lie mr fitzgibbon really ca give opinion sir see there be not breath of wind to help in sort of light there be telling where sun be so know at present moment way be facing well will try to right first sergeant ralph said will lead way let men follow at distance of about ten pace apart will keep on speaking do stand at left of file when last man have gone ten pace from pas word along by time will be about two hundred yard away if have not found path then will come back to do same thing on left if light upon path may come upon rise bog something will enable mr fitzgibbon to form idea a to where be be done beyond finding that ground on right be higher than on left index a to position be discovered see mr fitzgibbon be on sloping ground rising to right now doe that help at not much sir country here be undulating very well then must try march forward now sergeant place men five pace apart do put in center will move on three yard ahead of will go a straight forward a can if think be inclining to right left say so fact that ground be sloping ought to be help to to keep straight wish sloped little more then one must be able to tell directly whether one be keeping straight let men speak to other few pace so a to keep right distance apart mr fitzgibbon placed by ralph side started for hour kept on then ralph cried halt be certain be going downhill may be because have changed direction may be because there be change in lay of ground what do think be impossible to say mr fitzgibbon replied seems to that have be going straight when one ca see yard before one one may have turned direction how long do think that rascally fog be likely to last may clear up a sun get high sir must acknowledge that may last for day there be never saying among hill well at rate must give up idea of making raid on still mr fitzgibbon have become secondary object altogether now what have to do be to find way out of hitherto have tried what must do in silence now will give that up now sergeant get men together again will go ahead will if can keep on descending if one doe that one must get out of hill at last when get about fifty yard will shout then send man on to when reach will shout again go on fifty yard when shout send man forward when get to first man first man be to shout then come on to send off in way will make regular line fifty yard apart think one can get lost must one get confused stray ca do if keep head must shout till hears shout answered after time if doe hear answer must fire gun must answer till rejoins if order be observed see how one can miss way a there will be post stationed fifty yard remain till last see before quite understand when man come up to one in front of be to stop until next man join then move on to man ahead understand sir must not be in hurry sergeant because moving ahead a will will have to move to right left sometimes so a to make a sure a can that be still going down now mr fitzgibbon if keep with between ought to find road plan seemed good one be difficult to follow fall of ground be so slight that ralph officer often differed a to whether be going up down be only by separating taking short run right left forward backward that arrived at conclusion even then often doubted whether be right shouting a long line proceeded be prodigious must have astonished stray animal might have be grazing among hill so bewildering be fog that men sometimes went back to men behind instead of forward to men in front long pause be necessitated before got right again ralph finding cause of delay passed word down for first man to keep on shouting number one second number two so on facilitated matter line of shouting men have at least advantage that enabled ralph to keep fairly straight course a sound of voice told if be deviating much to right left may not be going right said to companion at least have satisfaction of knowing that be not moving in circle after hour marching ralph to great delight came upon hill rill of water thank goodness said have got guide at last if follow must get somewhere need not go on in tedious way will halt here till men come up be hour before sergeant arrived have got guide now sergeant can push on suppose have idea what stream be mr fitzgibbon not at present officer admitted there be score of little rill about make way down from bog at top of hill there be nothing to distinguish one from other now tramped on briskly keeping close to little stream sometimes ground became soft marshy be difficult to follow course went straight on after three more hour marching came upon road crossed stream over little culvert there be cheer from tired men a stood on hard ground again now question be will turn to right left for have not faintest idea a to point of compass what do say mr fitzgibbon must say that be even chance at rate whichever way go be sure to come in time upon hut village be able to find out where be very well then will take right ralph said form four sergeant will get on better by keeping in step now sergeant if of men can sing let strike up tune with chorus will help along there be little hesitation then one of men struck up song with renewed life energy marched along be nearly hour before heard welcome sound of voice close by ralph halted men proceeded toward sound then discovered what fog have prevented from seeing before that be passing through village voice being of woman who be brought to door by sound of music who be somewhat puzzled at to mysterious sound what place be ralph asked be kilmaknocket bless mr fitzgibbon exclaimed be twenty mile away from ballyporrit if be inch then be evident ca get there to day ralph said must have come more than distance since halted in night now

posted at spot where slight track be visible going down into sort of gulley captain o'connor then proceeded with company to right desmond taking remainder to left posting men at interval along edge of cliff placing party of four at point where there appeared smallest probability of ascent being practicable be ordered to load at once be to make prisoner one coming up cliff in case of resistance to fire without hesitation two officer then returned to spot where have left ralph be now nearly broad daylight leaving soldier went short distance to point where rock fell away precipitately from here have clear view of face of cliff have better wait here for time captain said chance be that before long one of will look out from hiding place perhaps make way up to top to look round if doe will give index a to direction at rate of hiding place now will take ground in front do watch to left conway to right desmond have better lie down on jutting point may catch eye of one down there before can see keep sharp lookout lad will save world of trouble if can see one of for hour lay quiet then desmond suddenly exclaimed there be man among fallen rock halfway up side there be gone perhaps will see again in moment for five minute lay with eye fixed on rock desmond pointed out there be sign of life be sure be not mistaken desmond o'connor asked quite certain suddenly appeared by side of gray bowlder stood there for moment sunk down again expect must have got view of one of men somewhere along top will wait ten minute o'connor said then will take party to spot search thoroughly there be coast guard boat so there be fear of getting away by water quarter of hour passed be use waiting longer go along line one way bring ten men from point where can be spared will leave at top of path take party there down with there be only four five of ten men beside ourselves be ample for business arrangement be soon made before starting on descent o'connor said to men wish to take fellow who be hiding down there alive if possible be gang of fellow known a bed captain ' have committed score of murder if be absolutely necessary will of course fire there be one man among who be there on compulsion be le guilty than rest be fair haired man must think must notice difference between rest resistance make be not probable that will join in at rate fire at unless be absolutely necessary to save life now see to priming before start fix bayonet mind how climb over rock because if of fall musket may go off shoot one in front of wherever be possible scatter out abreast of other so a to prevent possibility of accident now then march leading way captain o'connor descended little track extended short distance beyond chaos of fallen rock remains of landslip many year previously stretched away to shore there be working along sideways desmond captain o'connor said after have climbed along for little distance have better make straight down to shore follow for bit then mount again to spot where saw man be difficult work at last party reached shore lieutenant adcock who be in command of boat have watched party making way down rock now rowed in to within few yard good morning lieutenant captain o'connor said think have got fairly trapped doubtless must have made off if have seen on watch outside be that notorious scoundrel red captain of galway who be hear hiding here with gang indeed revenue officer said will be capture worth making will come ashore with four of men expect be more accustomed to climbing about among rock than yours be must like to lend hand do by mean captain o'connor replied see have got ten six will be quite enough in boat even if do manage to get down embark think will men be armed suppose yes have carbine cutlass now coxswain leave in charge row out quarter of mile if boat push off be to stop arrest on board will almost certainly resist in case must use arm now four bow oar get out step ashore when lieutenant four men have landed boat again pushed off party on shore made way along over rock at edge of water until be opposite rock where lieutenant desmond have seen man appear then ascent be commenced four officer went first men following in line bear little to left captain o'connor said be likely to lie somewhere in direction man saw must have be making toward path not from keep sharp lookout between great rock there be saying where entrance to hiding place may be almost a spoke there be sharp crack of rifle bullet struck rock on be standing come on lad shouted sooner be there le time have got to fire with cheer men hurried forward scrambling recklessly over rock again again puff of smoke darted out from rock in front one of soldier fell shot through heart stop to fire captain o'connor shouted a yell of rage broke from men will do good will only give more time dozen more shot be fired one of coast guard men be shot through shoulder be only casualty for quick movement of men a scrambled over bowlder disconcerted aim of above breathless panting four officer gained spot from shot have be fired men close up behind not soul be to be seen wait moment till get breath lad leader said ca be far from here will find hiding place presently never fear a stood panting there be shout from above soldier be standing along edge of cliff looking down upon fight sergeant morris waved arm have made away to left sir shouted at top of voice have just caught sight of among rock in two three minute captain o'connor led way in direction keep eye sharply about lad doubt place be cunningly hidden search among clump of bush between rock presently sergeant shouted down again from above think be far enough now sir did not catch sight of beyond for hour search continued without avail must be here somewhere lad captain o'connor said will find if have to stop here week have provision brought down from village be pretty evident there be opening between great rock must have found must examine smaller bowlder may have one so placed that can be dropped down over entrance flat slab be likely looking place for instance three four of get hold of heave up men gathered round to lift ralph stooped down peeped under a did so hurrah shouted there be opening here several of others now got hold of stone be up ended thrown backward entrance to passage three foot high two foot wide be revealed can smell peat fire one of men exclaimed be entrance doubt captain o'connor said see bottom be evidently worn by foot passage must have be used for long time be awkward place to follow desperate men into be indeed lieutenant adcock agreed must shoot down one after one a go in must see against light while must be able to make out nothing surrender in there captain o'connor shouted ca get away promise fair trial summons be followed by taunting laugh moment later there be sharp sound within rifle bullet struck side of entrance flew out must be throwing away one life to go in there captain o'connor said at rate have got secure must come out in time must be madness to crawl in there on one hand foot to be picked off by scoundrel at ease now lad two of stand by entrance keep out of line of fire be ready with bayonet to run one through who come out let rest scatter search round place may have entrance if so must find in first place may be easier of entry in second might escape from after dark again search began do think be likely to be higher up lower down o'connor lieutenant desmond asked there be saying desmond passage seems to go straight in must fancy above rather than below for long time searched without success then ralph who have gone higher up rock than rest came upon clump of low bush growing between large bowlder there be nothing suspicious about be just turning away when perceived slight odor of peat smoke silently made way down to captain have found entrance said at rate think so for certainly smelled smoke if go quietly may take unawares captain o'connor passed word along for men to gather silently ralph then led way up to clump of bush yes can smell peat plainly enough now conway do search among bush carefully lad know what place be like cautiously ralph pushed bush aside saw at once that have be carefully trained to cover large hole be about three foot wide descended at sharp angle forming sloping passage of sufficient height for man to stand upright captain o'connor knelt down looked in look more possible said be very steep must say be not used by act a sort of chimney to ventilate cavern let smoke out at rate will try must take boot off so a to get better hold on rock beside will make le noise blunt jervis do go down to other entrance again be likely enough that may try to make bolt way if hear coming keep sharp lookout down there be sure one escape think captain o'connor will be good thing to enter from there also moment row be heard going on within attention will be taken up with attack may get in without being noticed be very good idea conway will carry out take two more men with make way in a soon a hear engaged remember that be quite possible may not be able to get down passage may get almost perpendicular presently though mean to go if possible even if have straight drop for may close up be altogether impracticable so try to enter till be quite sure be engaged with otherwise will be only throwing away life understand sir ralph said a turned to go off if get in can reckon on assistance immediately if not will make move ralph now took up station at mouth of cavern with six men lay down just in front of opening listening attentively must hear continued murmur a of many voice get ready lad to follow instant see dive in said be sure by sound there be more than four men in there captain o'connor may want help badly grasping pistol in left hand sword in right ralph listened attentively suddenly heard shout followed by volley of imprecation then discharge of gun pistol in instant threw forward along low narrow passage have not gone more than three four yard when found that heightened be able to stand upright rushed on keeping head low in case roof must lower again after few pace entered large cabin be dimly illuminated by two torch stuck against wall in moment number of figure rushed toward with loud shout before reached two of soldier stood by side fire shouted a discharged pistol at same moment soldier beside discharged musket moment later be engaged in fierce hand to hand conflict several firearm have flashed off almost in face one of soldier fell with sharp cry who be following rushed forward ralph narrowly escaped having brain dashed out by clubbed rifle springing back just in time ran opponent through before must recover guard just at moment big man with shock of red hair huge beard leveled blunderbuss at flashed across that last moment have come when man behind leaped suddenly upon ruffian back fell to ground together blunderbuss going off in fall riddling soldier standing next to ralph with slug for two three minute desperate struggle went on between ralph six men who attempted to break through sturdily a soldier fought have be driven back toward entrance by assailant armed with pike clubbed gun there be sound of conflict at other end of cave ralph felt that attack there have for reason failed shoulder to shoulder lad shouted will have help in minute two have emptied double barrelled pistol sword have just broken short in hand while guarding head from heavy blow have be almost struck to ground when there be rush of men from behind rest of soldier poured in give volley lad shouted then charge with bayonet musket rang out then there be shout of surrender surrender minute later men be disarmed there be still desperate struggle going on on ground here lad ralph said to two of men secure red fellow be leader one of bring torch here light be brought be seen that man who have sprung upon red captain back have pinioned arm to side held there in spite of effort of ruffian to free two of soldier took off belt fastened together passed between back of man captor then strapped arm firmly to side man who held then released grip stand over with fixed bayonet if move run through now where captain o'connor know sir mr desmond naval officer went down hole in front of be following when naval officer shouted up to to run round to entrance make way in there for must go further be here conway faint voice said from other end of cabin have broken leg think desmond have knocked wind out of body ralph hastened to spot whence voice came found captain o'connor lying on ground lieutenant desmond insensible beside have happened ralph exclaimed have shot hold torch up will see way came soldier did so ralph looking up saw hole in top of cave twenty foot above mean to say came through there o'connor did worse luck to o'connor said passage got steeper steeper at last foot slipped shot down came plump into middle of peat fire moment later desmond shot down on to top of scattered fire over place a can imagine burned hand face believe leg of breech be on fire something be hurting confoundedly yes be smoldering ralph exclaimed putting out with hand have got captain o'connor asked everyone not one have made escape must have fared badly with though if lieutenant adcock have not sent down men to assistance where be leg broken o'connor above knee captain said here be whisky water ralph said handing bottle now will see what have happened to desmond stooped over insensible officer have got nasty gash on forehead think right arm be broken said will pour little spirit between lip then have better be carried out into air be done then ralph went outside shouted to sergeant morris to bring down twenty men if please sir one of coast guard men said touching hat see sign of officer have seen ralph said perhaps be still in passage have better run up to top see two minute later man returned be down there sir say ca get up down have better run down to boat at once ralph said see be close inshore bring couple more of men up with rope if tie that round body can go down bring up ralph then returned to cavern where men be still guarding prisoner can march outside now said then make sit down stand over with fixed bayonet till sergeant morris arrives now let look to wounded examination showed that two of soldier be dead three others badly wounded seven of party in cave lay on ground one only be alive rest have fallen either from bullet bayonet wound seeing that nothing must be done here ralph looked round cavern soon saw just where captain o'connor have fallen there be entrance into cave reloaded pistol before entered found deserted contained two large still with mash tub appliance two three hundred keg of whisky thirty sack of barley at once accounted for cave being known for number of men found in for in addition to seven have fallen six prisoner have be taken wall of cave be deeply smoke stained showing that have be used a distillery for great number of year be satisfactory captain o'connor said when ralph reported to discovery have made that place where came down be of course chimney peat doe not give much smoke making way out through screen of bush must be so light that must not be noticed by one on cliff well be be good morning work band of notorious scoundrel captured illicit still discovered in full work be cleverly contrived place of course be natural cavern be likely enough known before fall of rock from above so completely concealed entrance wish fellow must come though for leg be hurting amazingly burn on hand face be smarting horribly shout out to on cliff conway tell to send at once to fetch dr doran from village wounded ought to be seen to a soon a possible be likely enough that of can not be taken up over rock to top of cliff dread business in quarter of hour sergeant morris arrived with party by time lieutenant desmond have recovered consciousness although in great pain from broken arm be consoled upon hearing of complete success of expedition soldier be furious on hearing that three of comrade have be killed two of officer badly injured sergeant ralph said bring four of men into cave with now continued when entered there be pile of blanket in corner take one of fasten across two of men musket so a to make litter then must lift captain o'connor carefully put on get outside will be difficult business getting through narrow entrance must manage a well a can first let thoroughly examine cave there may be entrance somewhere searching carefully found passage behind stack of keg be eight foot high a much wide followed for short distance then saw daylight way be however speedily blocked by number of rock piled over entrance be evidently original entrance to cave ralph said be covered up when rock came down from above must account for place not being known to coast guard thought passage came in by looked a if have be enlarged by hand of man doubt be originally small hole when entrance be blocked men who made up mind to establish still here thought that must be best way to enlarge to leave original entrance blocked well be evident must take captain o'connor wounded out by small entrance must be tremendous business to clear great rock away captain o'connor two wounded men be with great difficulty taken through narrow passage soldier who be alive be one who have received charge of blunderbuss in leg be terribly injured below knee ralph have little doubt that amputation must be necessary other man lived short time after being brought into air ralph now turned to peasant who have saved life by grappling with red captain at moment be about to discharge blunderbuss who have by order be left unbound be sitting short distance from other prisoner name be denis moore said be honor man replied in surprise though how came to know beat entirely heard from wife last night ralph said from bridget man exclaimed why thought be hundred mile away came down here like brave woman to try save ralph said gave information brought to hiding place name be not to appear one will know how heard of promised that harm must come to if must help thanks to act by saved life have escaped for being down on ground be out of line of fire of bullet of course at present will treat a prisoner a be captured with others think will manage to let slip away wife be to remain at dunmanway till hears news of affair that be safe bade tell that must find at home so one will dream that have hand in affair now point out be four men belong to gang brought down here man who have just died be one of denis replied none of other three be here so expect fell in cabin be in front of fight saw one go down just a grappled with captain so much better ralph said a to leader there will be difficulty in getting evidence about regiment belonged to be in dublin can prove shooting of officer beside can get amount of evidence from galway ay will be ready enough to speak out now whole gang be down denis moore said must not have dared to open lip otherwise other prisoner belong about here one of party be captain brother be how be came to take in think must have be glad to get rid of for red captain lot be too bad for anything be because men be ready to cheat king revenue that be fond of such villain murderer a in short time doctor arrived have brought case of instrument with there be nothing for amputation here said when examined wounded soldier leg be just splintered sooner do better sergeant morris three of men held poor fellow while operation be performed a soon a be over doctor applied splint bandage to captain o'connor leg lieutenant desmond arm dressed wound of three of other men who have suffered more le severely chapter xiii startling news what do think be best thing to be done now doctor ralph asked replied see how on earth be going to get over rock up to top slip fall must cost of friend limb poor fellow life see how be to be managed be hard work for man to climb rock how litter be to be carried ca see if be anywhere else must say build hut for must be tremendous business getting material down think must possibly be managed by night be sure must ralph said shaking head think though if got two long pole slung piece of canvas like hammock between may possibly get down to shore see have plenty of strength to get over rough place must manage that easy enough lieutenant adcock who have time before joined party said there be sixteen foot oar in boat sail must easily rig up hammock suppose mean to take off in boat mr conway yes be what meant ralph said then can land in cove might stop in village till be fit to be moved must be excellent plan doctor said let set about at once in hour sailor brought up hammock will go first captain o'connor said a be heaviest will see how manage to get down if be done pretty easily can bring down two others if not have better stop in cave for to night will get hut for to morrow by way conway have better get dead carried out taken down to seashore have laid down out of reach of tide of belong about here friend will wish to give decent burial own dead have better be put in boat if mr adcock will allow taken to village with then can be carried over to ballyporrit for burial corporal with four men must be left for to night in charge of cave will want men to row boat lieutenant adcock said in morning will send over warrant officer four men to take charge of cave till can take content round to store captain o'connor be now lifted into hammock six sailor carried down to water managed excellently easing down with greatest care over rock succeeded in getting down to sea without single jerk lieutenant desmond wounded soldier be then taken down in same way while men carried down dead body of three comrade of peasant who have fallen will take charge of wounded lieutenant adcock said see comfortably housed cared for suppose dr doran will go with certainly doctor said stepping into boat will not give up charge of until see safely in bed will come over see o'connor ralph said a soon a get company back to village will write report of business do feel equal to doing so will manage conway can dictate if feel up to writing have better not come over to day there will be good deal of excitement over capture doubt several of killed prisoner belong to ballyporrit so must do for to leave detachment without officer be sure have strict guard put over prisoner keep eye upon can send over to inquire about till have got off hand have better not leave village if party be wanted for still hunting send sergeant morris with will dispatch report to night doubt colonel will send officer out to help a soon a get boat now pushed off corporal four men be told off to occupy cave until relieved by revenue men then with prisoner in center party climbed cliff again having be joined at top by rest of company marched to ballyporrit found village in state of excitement soldier who have gone to fetch doctor have brought news that fight have take place down on face of cliff must not say whether have be killed a soon a detachment returned with prisoner in midst many woman flocked round with cry lamentation exchanged greeting with prisoner ralph at once took possession of stable at inn saw that prisoner be handcuffed red ruffian leg being also securely bound then placed two sentry inside two out news that of men have be killed soon spread many of villager who did not see relation among prisoner hurried off toward scene of action ralph informed landlord that dead have be placed together on seashore that friend be at liberty to remove bury without question being asked then sent corporal over to bring back news how wounded men have borne journey how be disposed before return doctor drove up in trap that have borrowed adcock have put up two officer in own house said wife will look after so need not worry about other poor fellow be in cottage next door belongs to coxswain of boat who be also married man so need be under uneasiness about of a far a can see be likely to do well will go over first thing in morning will bring news of a soon a get back ralph have given order denis moore be not to be treated a prisoner now told sergeant to send in to have be thinking over moore said seems to best plan will be to allow to go quietly away conduct in fight in cave in showed that be not voluntarily with others think therefore that be necessary to report among prisoner suppose red captain gang have not done unlawful act beyond taking part in still business since took away from home honor just came straight down here traveling at night hiding away by day very well in case can give special evidence against be probable that at trial evidence may be required from galway a to deed that red bearded scoundrel committed there be possible that may be summoned with others must think that evidence of constabulary will be sufficient so if will give address there will take upon to let go at once in case can join wife evening travel back with thank sir denis replied have objection at to give evidence a to what know so that doe not come out be bridget who tould where be hiding need not be afraid of denis captain o'connor gave word that name must not be mentioned at same time have doubt will claim for hundred pound reward be offered if obtains will send to so that nobody will be wiser must not like to take informer money denis said not in ordinary case ralph replied see spoke out not for sake of money to get out of hand considering how much mischief fellow have done how much more must have done have not laid hand on be very different case from of ordinary informer none of neighbor will know that have have anything to do with capture of men therefore one will be wiser doubt hundred pound will be very useful to be sure deserve sort of compensation for being dragged away from home for risk ran in fight for bullet might just a well have struck a of others know that if be in place must accept without least hesitation now a suppose have left money on a wife be not likely to be very well provided will give five pound on account remember that will always feel debtor for manner in saved life by springing upon ruffian just at critical moment will deduct from other money honor denis said hesitating certainly will denis must not think of offering money for service a rendered now if will just give address in galway will make note of though think at likely will be wanted at trial will most likely proceed against on charge of shooting officer deserting for will have difficulty in proving that a regiment belonged to be in dublin denis started at once to rejoin wife highly pleased to have got away so quickly two day later captain morrison mr stapleton arrived from headquarters congratulate conway latter said heartily pitied being ordered away to dreary place now have be getting end of honor credit o'connor report speaks in strongest term of say be entirely owing to promptness courage that band be captured life that of desmond saved cork paper be full of affair capture of notorious scoundrel red captain created excitement can tell only bad part of affair be that have have to come out here for be afraid there be chance whatever of adventure like yours oh fancy there be plenty more still to be captured stapleton be good fun in way though involves good deal of marching hard work how be o'connor desmond getting on captain morrison asked have very good report of morning from doctor now that have come will take trap drive over see at once have o'connor order not to leave here till arrived be to go back to morrow morning conway captain morrison said be to take prisoner in with escort of corporal ten men to hand over to civil authority mean suppose that be to take to prison suppose will come straight out again ralph asked must think so for with still hunting business three officer be wanted here of course will report to colonel get order here be order gave to give be to start early make twenty mile march halt for night go on again first thing in morning be to hire cart for wounded prisoner to exercise utmost vigilance on way men be to carry loaded musket be not likely there will be attempt at rescue such thing have happened before now if anything of sort must take place find that be likely to get worsted order be that be not to let red captain be carried off alive put man specially over with instruction to shoot rather than let be taken away from colonel will hold harmless scoundrel have committed too many murder to be allowed to go free understand ralph said will carry out order now will be off at once for will be dark in hour ralph be glad to find that two officer be going on better than have expected lieutenant desmond be already up with arm in splint great patch of plaster across forehead o'connor be still in bed be likely to remain so for time regimental surgeon be with having left other two officer at turn of road leading to village be glad to see conway captain o'connor said cheerfully be expecting doctor said morrison stapleton have gone on to ballyporrit none worse for brush hope not bit ralph said bump on head caused by musket blow hurt bit first day two be going down now be glad to see desmond looking so well oh will soon be right though be afraid will be kept on back for little time desmond be rather in despair because be afraid beauty be spoiled for doctor say that cut on forehead be likely to leave nasty scar must not have minded if have be done by french dragoon saber to have got from tumbling down chimney trouble sorely will be very painful to when partner at ball asks sympathizingly in what battle be wounded to have to explain that tumbled head foremost into peat fire desmond laughed well be rather nuisance see conway ash have got so ground up in place that doctor be afraid will be black scar o'connor chaff about be sure must like why dear fellow be most honorable wound will be able to dilate upon desperate capture of noted ruffian red captain how that noble officer captain o'connor dashed alone into cavern tenanted by thirteen notorious desperado why properly worked up man there be end of capital to be made out of foresee that will be quite hero at tea fight battle be nothing to affair a of course will not be necessary to say that shot down into middle of like sack of wheat because must not help must speak of reckless spring of twenty foot from upper passage into middle of why properly told danger of breach at badajos must pale before be glad to see that be in such high spirit ralph said when laugh have subsided there be fear of being lame after hope dr doran say be clean snap of bone will think mend right a macpherson who have be examining say same hope be all right be very good of colonel sending doctor over to think doran understands business well have made capital job of of how be rawlinson going on oh think will do very well surgeon said of course be little down in mouth about be not pleasant prospect for man to have to go about on two wooden leg life still be be done in service a fight be sharp one important capture be made will get full pension will strongly recommend for chelsea hospital if like to take tell be by trade carpenter before enlisted expect must rather go down to live among own people wooden leg wo prevent earning living at trade a be rather good looking fellow dare say wo have much difficulty in getting wife maimed hero be irresistible to female mind be comfort for desmond anyhow o'connor laughed that black patch on forehead ought to add thousand year to marketable value next morning ralph marched with detachment arrived at cork without adventure here handed prisoner over to civil authority of jail then marched up to barrack at once reported to colonel who congratulated warmly upon success have attended capture upon own conduct in affair will not keep now colonel said for mess bugle sounded five minute ago will see again in morning a ralph entered messroom officer have just taken seat be greeted with boisterous outburst of welcome comrade got up shook hand warmly have to answer many inquiry a to how o'connor desmond be going on sit down gentleman major who be president of mess shouted conway have have twenty mile march be have doubt a hungry a hunter let eat dinner in peace then when wine be on table will relate adventure in detail by way conway hope have lodged that ruffian safely in jail yes sir have handed over glad be to get off hand for though have handcuffed foot tied brought along in cart never felt comfortable way fellow be a strong a bull a know what be before be capable of anything desperate to effect escape remember man well one of officer said for a know be in regiment before exchanged into twenty eighth be notorious character have strength of two ordinary men once twice when be drunk took eight men to bring into barrack be heartily glad be caught for poor fellow killed be one of most popular men in regiment with soldier a well a with if must have laid hand on fellow believe must have hung up without trial will have real pleasure in giving evidence against scoundrel for be present at time shot poor forrest be five yard away be over villain be off before have time to lift hand after dinner be over ralph gave full history of capture in cavern of captain o'connor have sent outline be sharp fight indeed major said when have finished for for time be greatly outnumbered in dark discipline be not of much avail think on whole got very well out of o'connor desmond be lucky in having got off with broken limb ralph be detained day in cork a have to be present at courthouse when prisoner be brought up before magistrate after giving evidence a to capture attendance be further required with exception of red captain be committed at once upon charge of working illicit still of offering forcible resistance with arm to authority of king officer red captain be charged with several murder be remanded in order evidence might be obtained from regiment to belonged in dublin of constabulary other people in county galway ralph then returned to ballyporrit fortnight later detachment be recalled colonel having received news that regiment must be shortly under order for america lieutenant desmond be able to travel to cork at once although still unfit for duty surgeon reported that in fortnight captain o'connor must be also fit to be removed ten day later definite order be received for regiment to be ready for embarkation a soon a two transport have be ordered round from plymouth arrived soldier be always fond of change although there be few more pleasant quarter than cork there be general feeling of animation excitement at thought of service at other side of atlantic officer men on furlough be at once recalled friend of many of officer came across from england to be with till sailed upon what be then considered long perilous voyage ball dinner be given to by regiment officer overhauled kit belonging getting what new thing be required bargaining with broker for furniture making preparation for prolonged absence from england ah stapleton ralph said a young ensign came into quarter one day in high spirit there will be sad change come over before long almost wished might die on way round here from london what will be feeling when have to face wave of atlantic talk about conway very thought make feel queer however expect will get on better now than did last time what as be to be sure on voyage well do think four month with regiment have done world of good stapleton certainly be stuck up sort of personage when came on board in thames think be awful mistake for fellow to be educated at home instead of being sent to school be sure to have to suffer for afterward well have suffered for to extent stapleton said lesson got at first be sharp one certainly did good there be doubt about ralph agreed think there be good deal of credit due to stapleton for having taken thing in right way wonder where will be stationed in america whether will have fighting upon whole have very great reason to be proud of feat of arm in america hope will do better next time see in last struggle knew nothing of tactic be at great disadvantage after fighting way through peninsular think there be fear of regiment not giving good account of if be called upon to do so out there next day orderly came into room just after mess dinner have commenced whispered to adjutant who at once rose mr president said to major who be at head of table must ask to excuse leaving table colonel wish to see immediately at quarter what can be matter now one of officer said must be something of importance colonel must never have called out in way heard of still away among hill suppose that mean night tramp for of too bad to be put to sort of work within week of sailing on foreign service grumbled various guess be made a to nature of business several wager be laid on subject in ten minute adjutant returned be evidently excited listened with great interest a instead of resuming seat remained standing gentleman said have great news for vessel have just come in from plymouth with dispatch napoleon have escaped from elba have landed in france be received with troop have joined be already close to paris be expected to enter without opposition king of france have fled for moment there be silence then major leaped to foot three cheer gentleman of present joined in hearty cheer then sudden silence fell upon first idea have struck man be that news meant again taking field for stirring campaign then dismal thought occurred to that regiment be under order for america soon found expression in word why major surely wo be sending across atlantic now news have arrived power will never permit work to be undone napoleon to mount throne of france again why in short time europe will be in blaze how be england to take field again greater portion of wellington army be scattered over world in america india colony believe there be dozen of old fighting regiment available even rank be filled with raw recruit almost regiment at home be mere skeleton surely will never be sending away at such moment can say nothing about adjutant replied certainly no counter order have reached colonel evening suppose anything will be decided upon for time power will exchange note hold council spend week in talk before make up mind whether anything be to be done if so what long before come to decision on subject will be on other side of atlantic then possibly after trial monotony of perhaps two month voyage may land there only to be fetched back again quite agree with that england can put nothing worth calling army in field that must be madness to send fine regiment out of country at present moment everyone know lack of wisdom with be governed miserable slowness of military authority be not likely even to occur to one to countermand order will certainly be disgusting in extreme to have to start just at present moment beside officer said will be maddening to be two month at sea without news to know perhaps europe be in arm tremendous event going on out of altogether must think nothing will be done just at present major said country in europe have be disbanding army just a have since peace be proclaimed will be long time before of be ready to take field in anything like force even napoleon great organizer a be will take time to put france under arm again army be machine can not be created in day soldier have to clothed arm to be manufactured cavalry to be mounted artillery to be organized field train got together must say that at least four month must elapse before fighting begin in earnest with anything like favorable wind must be across in america in month if order be sent out month after start may be back in time for opening ball judging from past be likely to be long business unseating napoleon again if be not in for first of may be in plenty of time for fair share of fighting always supposing that authority be sufficiently awake to merit of regiment to recall how be wind evening one of officer asked be westerly when came in lieutenant desmond said why do ask why a long a blow from west there be not much chance of transport getting in here be so major agreed question for to consider be whether ought to pray for fair wind foul fair wind will take quickly across atlantic will give chance of getting back in time foul wind may possibly give time to make up mind at horse guard to stop before start be nice question there be hope whatever major that government will make up mind before wind change not if blew in one quarter longer than have ever be known to do since beginning of world especially a not only government of europe have to come to decision oh if have to wait for must be hopeless at same time a must be evident to individual of meanest capacity that something other for troop will be required will have to be done surely month ought to be sufficient for idea to occur to one in authority that must be a well not to be sending soldier abroad until matter be finally settled agree with adjutant said therefore think have best decide hope wish will be unanimous in favor of continuance of westerly wind never be weathercock watched more anxiously than be by officer men of twenty eighth for next fortnight element certainly appeared favorable to wish wind blew steadily from desired quarter so that be not until ten day after be expected that two transport be to convey twenty eighth to america dropped anchor in cork harbor captain o'connor rejoined regiment on evening before transport arrived walked with two stick be measure of precaution rather than of necessity feel like impostor said laughing a replied to welcome of comrade believe must safely throw away stick dance jig doctor have laid command on man who have be ruling with rod of iron will not permit slightest infringement of seems to consider that be responsible for in respect if have be master man must not have behaved with grosser despotism be glad to see looking so well o'connor ralph said shaking captain warmly by hand know whether do right in shaking hand with conway o'connor said have be thinking over while have be lying there have come to conclusion that be have to thank for affair altogether there be general laugh how do make out ralph asked be clear enough now eye be opened be who discovered that passage when did so said at once to now will get o'connor desmond to go down place be safe to break neck then will get honor glory of affair so came about there be desmond lying on top of other with breath knocked clean out of body while be doing fighting getting credit of affair appeal to friend here if be not most suspicious affair there be chorus of agreement did not think of conway most disgraceful trick ought to be sent to coventry ought to be drummed out of regiment mingled with shout of laughter by way trial of fellow come on next week one of officer said when laughter subsided so if transport come in will be able to see last of o'connor will have objection to see that red rascal hung a to other poor devil must be glad enough for to get off irish peasant see harm in making whisky be only human nature to resist when be attacked beside be red captain gang set to fighting doubt if have be for suppose there must have be shot fired hope be view authority will take of a turned out be view taken by prosecuting counsel at trial red captain be tried for murder of officer for shooting of two constable in galway be found guilty hung others be put on trial together for armed resistance to majesty force for killing slaying three soldier counsel pleaded that be acting under compulsion of gang of desperado with that be only who have fired upon soldier a ascended rock that peasant have firearm indeed be proved that only five gun be found in cave admitted that in desperation at last moment men have defended with pike bludgeon urged be effort of despair not with premeditated idea of resisting troop pointed out that a soldier have fallen by gunshot wound none of prisoner at bar have hand in death counsel for crown did not press for capital sentence two of men who have before suffered term of imprisonment for being concerned in running illicit still be sentenced to transportation others escaped with term of imprisonment chapter xiv new housemaid what do think of new housemaid charlotte a have only be here twenty four hour miss penfold replied think can say anything about eleanor servant behave decently for first week two then fault begin to come out however seems quiet in way of going about be something room be carefully dusted morning be only two point on can at present say anything met in passage morning eleanor penfold said seemed to that face reminded of one did that strike not at elder sister replied decidedly be not given to fancy about such thing saw likeness to one if have done so must not have given second thought one point with be whether woman be clean quiet steady thoroughly up to work reference said be thing hope will prove so be older than like servant to be be when first come to young girl be teachable when servant have once got into certain way there be never altering however if know work doe not matter there be one comfort at age be le likely to be coming to one day other soon saying that want to leave to get married new servant anna a be called in house soon settled down to duty miss penfold allowed that knew work did carefully servant did not quite understand newcomer be pleasant friendly somehow be not a one of said of sort put down partly to fact that have be in service in london be not accustomed to country way however be evidently obliging quiet smoothed away slight feeling of hostility with under housemaid be at first disposed to feel against for coming in a stranger over head by saying that a have acquaintance in village have desire to go out that whenever turn came to do so other might take place a jane be keeping company with blacksmith son concession greatly pleased although at first have be disappointed that have not on martha leaving succeeded to place fact that be twenty one while newcomer be good many year senior went far to reconcile to being passed over mr conway have not be twenty four hour in house before discovered there be obstacle in way of search that have not foreseen have dusted drawing room dining room then went to door of room supposed to be library found locked at dinner asked other housemaid what room opposite dining room be where be key be master library girl said miss penfold always keep locked one be allowed to go in be just a left at least martha said so for have never be inside since on first day of month be opened dusted miss penfold always used to go in with martha stay there while did work said be to see that nothing be moved martha used to think there be reason what be mr conway asked jane shook head glanced at butler a much a to say did not care about speaking before presently when have opportunity of talking alone with newcomer said did want to say anything before james hold with miss penfolds only came month two before master death did not know much about will have have be ill treated that lawyer of ought to be punished for going on a if miss penfolds have done something wrong about will cook doe give opinion martha thought knew something about be keeping miss withers young conway out of right forgot that be stranger did know nothing about will then told conway about will being missing how mr tallboy who have made for mr penfold said that property have be left to mabel withers who be daughter of clergyman great pet of master to boy who have be staying there month before whose name be conway well martha believed that nodded toward drawing room must know something about for mr tallboy must have that be stowed away in secret hiding place have be looking for here pulling down wainscotting sort of course if there be secret hiding place miss penfolds must know of a well a brother martha used to think that reason why miss penfolds have room shut up must never let go into without one of being there to look after be that hiding place be somewhere in library that be afraid that when be dusting doing up might come upon will same conclusion have flashed across mr conway mind a soon a heard that room be kept locked if will be really hidden away said be likely enough to be a say must think two lady must do thing a oh know jane said sharply be two regular old cat be hunt one about over house a if thought one be going to steal something be fond of brother in way bless treated like child das'ent call soul own may be sure did like thought that have left money away from that one else must become master missis of hall while be living martha be of one mind that old woman be likely enough to do if have chance must give good deal if must find will myself just to see face interfering old thing be only two sunday ago told after came out of church that did approve of ribbon in bonnet just a if girl be to go about a if be convict say there be men searching here jane how be did find if be in library how be miss penfolds allowed to search must help jane replied there be order from court in london judge one must stop went away when men came did come back till be over know how be that did find in library for searched regular be in there two three time while be at work took out book from shelf pulled down lot of wood work turned upside down must find anything still see ai likely tale of theirs a keep door locked because want to be just a left when be be turned topsy turvy everything put out of place be what martha must get over though martha told done best to have put just a be there be paper pen on table just to pretend be exactly a used to be that one have be in a if cared so much about call sickening be what call withers come here now used to be often here in master time be not friend with now last sunday parson made hot for preached sermon about secret being known undiscovered thing coming to light of course did say nothing special about will felt must see pew on opposite side of church must see face miss penfold got white pinched up lip if must have given piece of mind to parson must have done so eleanor got red looked a if be going to cry be lot better than sister be if wrong be done be old one be done be sure martha always said so too must put up with younger one very well ca abide miss penfold be quite anxious to see room jane after what have be telling about well will see in about week be always on first of month that be done up will see old woman will go in with watch time like cat watch mouse martha used to say so there a be not from part of country wo think a know nothing about will care nothing about wo keep such sharp lookout after a did with martha upon following sunday mr withers on way home from church asked husband with anxiety whether be not well noticed be quite pale in church james lost place once twice seemed a if really be attending to what be doing then be afraid dear seemed what be for be tremendously surprised though tried hard to keep thought from wandering be afraid succeeded very badly surprised james what be will tell dear know that letter have fortnight ago from mr conway that puzzled over good deal after talking a usual about being determined to find will set matter straight said that might possibly see before long begged not to show surprise to seem to recognize well know talked over must make nothing of now know what mean what did see in church to day james did amy where do think be ca guess james why where must be where can be staying if not with did see be sure be not mistaken be sitting behind amy will account for not seeing be sitting in penfolds servant pew in plain straw bonnet quiet clothes like others among penfolds servant james be dreaming not at dear there be sure enough must not possibly be mistaken mr withers be silent for time with surprise what can be doing there james do mean to say that think that have really gone to service at hall be what do think clergyman replied know how said over over again that be determined somehow to find will well believe that have in way in pursuance of purpose gone a servant to penfolds now dear will not be surprised that found somewhat difficult to keep thought from wandering indeed james be sure if have be in place must have stopped altogether well if be so explains what said in letter about not recognizing how must do thing what will come of have idea how managed to get there amy certainly must have managed very cleverly somehow what be there to do be clear enough be going to search for will whether will ever find not be matter can hardly believe can succeed after thorough search tallboy said made of house still be what mean have not shadow of doubt about must never have thought for moment be sort of woman to undertake thing mr withers said why will have to do servant work to run sort of risk of being found out then know what might do to her see that must do much dear unless perhaps prosecuted for obtaining place with false character suppose must have done still required ordinary pluck for woman to undertake such scheme will require patience nerve to carry through know that agree with that be not sort of woman must have thought capable of undertaking such business be quiet enough when met in town believe from what have heard that be high spirited girl when saw know be on eve of parting with son a be evidently wrapped up in must of course make more quiet silent than usual thought bore up remarkably well admired effort made to prevent display of feeling marring pleasant time be having in london how about mabel james have better tell about see if happens to meet mr conway might betray secret might run up address by name be certainly difficulty dear quite know what to do about do think think have better postpone matter james by sending mabel away for bit know sister have asked several time to go stay with on visit at bath have never cared to let go away from do think now that will be good thing for to write to harriet tell that if will be convenient for to take mabel will be glad to send to for few month in order that may take lesson in french music there be of course plenty of good master there in way will get rid of necessity for speaking to mabel about at must think likely that mr conway must have left hall long before return perhaps will dear though must not count upon too much imagine that a mr conway have have nerve courage enough to propose so far carry out singular plan of hers will have resolution enough to continue to play part till find will becomes thoroughly convinced that be absolutely not to be found so mr withers wrote to sister ten day later mr withers started with mabel for bath mr conway have difficulty in restraining show of excitement in assuming passive indifferent air a upon first of month miss penfold unlocked door of library led way into room be brother library will understand anna that wish everything to remain exactly a be will therefore be careful to place everything a find article of furniture book paper on table will just sweep floor dust everything beyond wish nothing done to room mr conway began work quietly miss penfold watched for little time then said will leave door open anna be better to let air circulate a much a possible when weather get warmer will also leave window open while be at work air be too damp at present must like to light fire to air room miss penfold certainly not miss penfold said decidedly there be occasion for if have not returned by time have finished room come tell when have done always make point of locking door so saying miss penfold went out leaving door wide open behind have left alone there eleanor asked sister a entered sitting room certainly have miss penfold said coldly do wish must not be so nervous eleanor woman can have interest in matter may have heard of from other servant can be nothing to know a well a do that there be chance of stumbling upon by accident be different with last girl of course be always talking about will might have tried a matter of curiosity to find might have be bribed by withers by man tallboy be different now woman can have interest in will only want to get work done a soon a possible being always in room with a be with martha might excite comment must never have done in martha case if have not be so absurdly nervous for know very well there be real danger of ever finding place however closely looked for now there be change be quite time to drop rumor will be getting about that be afraid of of servant remaining for moment alone in library wish have never done do wish have never done eleanor murmured pitifully be ashamed of eleanor miss penfold said coldly be worse than child with lament complainings what have done nothing have certainty that there be will in existence if have be not business to assist to carry out monstrous wrong against to put woman son a master here how many time have talked over be always same keep on trembling at shadow must not care if be not for night charlotte be always dreaming that herbert be coming to bedside looking so stern angry saying justice be done bah miss penfold said contemptuously must eat le supper eleanor if be not such coward must not dream such thing have patience with folly know be foolish charlotte ca help nerve be never a strong a yours quite agreed with from first about think be infamous that herbert must have passed over that be not to be expected must aid in discovery of such wicked will still ca help being unhappy about lying awake at night dreaming one can help dream dream be mere repetition of thought miss penfold said scornfully if worry while be awake will worry while be asleep have done nothing criminal have meddled with will hidden one simply refuse to aid in discovery of unjust document by so doing prevent great wrong being done to ourselves to mind thing be perfectly simple conscience wholly acquits of wrong doing left to herself mr conway took earnest look round room somewhere doubt within limit lay key of secret must give wealth to ralph where be wall be completely covered by bookshelf be handsomely carved dark with age one of penfolds have evidently be bookworm have spared pain expense in carrying out hobby housemaid have said that book have be removed that nothing have be found behind still there might well be spring have escaped notice at rate ground must be gone over again then spring might lie among carved work of bookcase must be gone over inch by inch be evidently first work to be done mantel support be of richly carved woodwork too must be searched in first place however have to carry out work laying aside determinately thought of missing will began to dust sweep at end of hour when happened to turn round saw miss penfold standing in doorway have not heard footstep at once decided in mind that must be necessary to be extremely careful in search a at moment miss penfold might look in upon without warning have nearly finished anna miss penfold asked will take hour at least to dust woodwork properly miss penfold have done carpet furniture miss penfold made remark went away again be not likely to come back for few minute mr conway said to herself think can safely carry out one of plan took from pocket ball of thin string one end of be attached to tiny brad awl going into one corner of room fixed brad awl into woodwork then unwinding ball proceeded to other end of room straining string tightly tied knot to mark length then went back crossed room again make knot to mark width then hastily gathered up string pulled brad awl from woodwork put in pocket while have be carrying out retained duster in one hand dusted wood work a moved along trusting that if miss penfold must look in string be of dark color must be unnoticed by however gave sigh of relief when operation be complete string brad awl hidden away then continued work until in about three quarter of hour miss penfold again appeared think that will do very well anna be quite impossible to get dust out of carving must take day to go over must need step for upper part need only be done occasionally gave approving glance round a noticed that new housemaid have carefully placed article in exact place in have found mr conway gathered up broom duster left room miss penfold carefully locking door after be something done mr conway said to will think save immense deal of trouble to morrow will measure room next to passage run along side be hardly possible that there can be receptacle there wall be not thick enough for place of size must be at one end other else under floor following morning measured dining room what be now known a housekeeper room in year gone by have be called still room following day slipped out of door a soon a came downstairs took outside measurement of side of house marking on string position width of window have only now to make plan compare figure found that between back of bookcase for have taken out few book to ascertain depth panel of dining room there be thickness of two foot between library housekeeper room there be fully five foot unaccounted for in be deep old fashioned fireplace back to back even allowing six inch between depth there must be accounted for on side of fireplace there must be wide space there be certainly no cupboard visible in library for bookcase extended from fireplace to wall on side in housekeeper room there be cupboard on side of chimney piece be willow not being above nine inch in depth therefore behind there be considerable space unaccounted for be evident to mr conway that first search must lie in direction here might lie two chamber three foot wide by eight foot long mr conway spirit rose at discovery sighed impatiently at thought that month must elapse before must even commence search brooding over matter continually there be one point did not escape old hiding place be made to conceal proscribed priest hunted fugitive be constructed with greatest care a have so easily discovered spot where hidden room might be situated must be discovered with same ease by who be on search for fugitive who must naturally be well acquainted with position where hiding place must be likely to be situated moment looked into cupboard willowness must suggest to that there must be wide empty space behind by setting to work with ax pick crowbar must soon discover by force secret be trying to penetrate by stratagem reflection considerably damped hope thought that possibly from easily discoverable hiding place there might be access much more difficult to trace to lying below at rate determined that if did find secret entrance to little room found that be empty must not be disheartened must search further until found secret closet where will might be placed entrance to perhaps larger hiding place below subsequent search outside showed that there existed several small iron grating about six inch long three deep close down to soil of border doubt be intended to give ventilation underneath floor be two foot above outside level one of might also afford ventilation to underground chamber three month passed on occasion of of visit to room devoted time to examination of carved woodwork round fireplace that of bookcase without making discovery became evident to that far closer search must be needed than short hasty examination be dared to make with possibility at moment miss penfold might appear at door accordingly wrote to mr tallboy told that must be necessary for to obtain cake of very soft wax four inch long two inch wide asked to procure for to send in wooden box to by carrier cart once week journeyed from weymouth to village in neighborhood of hall ten day later received wax next time day for cleaning library arrived quietly withdrew key from door a soon a miss penfold have left laid on wax pressed steadily until deep impression be made upon surface then carefully examined key to see that particle of wax have stuck between ward replaced in door closed lid of little box in wax lay put in pocket then set to at work of cleaning upon occasion spent time in trying to find spring there be danger now a always of miss penfold coming a must soon have mean of entering room at will must run risk few day later asked for day to go to weymouth to purchase thing of have need when there called upon mr tallboy how be mr conway lawyer said when door have closed behind have come to tell that give up search a hopeless not at replied with decision told in letter have discovered probable position of hiding place told of difficulty there be in making thorough search for owing to room being always kept locked have come now to ask to get key made from produced wax must be suspicious if be to go to locksmith here ask for such thing must think at once be servant who wanted to rob mistress of course will be different with beside thought that if did not like to get done here might send wax up to london get key made there be becoming more more serious mr conway mr tallboy said gravely nothing very terrible must happen to beyond being turned out of house even be discovered who really be if be found at night suppose intention be to work at night in library with false key in possession might be arrested for attempt at theft must only clear by explaining before magistrate who be with what motive be acting must give rise to much unpleasant talk must render pursuance of plan impossible might not improbably induce woman to destroy will if have not already done so be quite convinced have not done that mr tallboy anxiety have about one entering room manner in miss penfold pop in occasionally to see what be doing be quite proof in mind that will be still in existence for if have destroyed must have further anxiety on subject have thought over must run risk there be other way of making complete search in one night there by must do far more than in twelvemonth visit a at present there be two three more thing wish must procure for want man coat cap rough one such a burglar might wear see if by chance be met by woman going downstairs returning to room must give start dressed up like with piece of crape over face must be taken for burglar think miss penfold be very easily frightened at same time fancy might alarm into returning to room must be able to get back to mine before house be roused will always unfasten window on ground floor lift little so that must be supposed that intruder entered escaped way mr tallboy smiled little said be very risky business mr conway miss penfold be just sort of woman to keep pistol in bedroom one must risk something when one be fighting for fortune mr conway said quietly hope that will not be heard there be always creaking noise in old house like that door be thick well fitting there be little chance of footstep being heard be only by accident such a one of being unable to sleep getting up walking over house that be likely to run against be not probable must have pistol in hand then think there be least fear of anything of sort only fear have be of being detected in other way before have done have to do risk of grows le le day have be there over four month now be perfectly at home be at first afraid of sudden meeting with mr withers wife mabel have passed away now saw recognized first sunday in church wrote to of course sending letter to dover to be sent back from there answered praying to give up what called mad brained attempt saying made wife quite unhappy to think of being at hall told that at present have not told mabel be there have sent away to school at bath be with aunt will not be home again for month so be safe from be not in least anxious about can not say a much about ralph regiment have just gone out to belgium suppose there will be fighting presently think of more now than do of will mr tallboy if have known what be coming must not have begun search until be over what use must be for to find will if anything happened to be clearly of use trying to dissuade from carrying out plan mr conway although can not altogether approve of will do best to help a far a lie in power will have key down very shortly how will send over have ordered dress other thing at wilson in high street dress have to be made up will not be ready for week have told there will be three four other parcel be to put in box send on by carrier have ordered pair of boot to be made for one two other thing told not to close box until day fortnight by time other thing have ordered will be sent in to hope will have got key before oh yes must think must be done in week at latest certainly deserve success mr conway for seem to provide for contingency chapter xv in belgium there be general feeling of depression in regiment when be known that transport have arrived in harbor a rule regiment embarking for service abroad start in high spirit private regret be felt at parting from friend troop march gayly down to point of embarkation be not case a twenty eighth with band at head playing

heavily brisk wind be blowing twenty eighth have not long before made voyage from south of france have be favored by exceptionally fine weather have experienced nothing like tossing be now undergoing consequence be that only about dozen officer obeyed bugle call to mess there be general feeling of satisfaction when low coast round ostend be sighted for voyage throughout have be rough one under certain circumstance sea voyage be delightful confinement in crowded transport in rough weather be reverse of pleasant experience space below deck be too small to accommodate whole of troop third of number have to be constantly on deck for ten day voyage in heavy sea with occasional rain shower be not under ordinary circumstance calculated to raise spirit of troop men bound on active dangerous service be always in highest spirit make light of disagreeables hardship of kind have expected to find ostend full of troop for several regiment have landed before soon found be to be marched inland a soon a regiment have landed marched to spot where standing camp have be erected for use of troop on passage through baggage be at once sent forward men have therefore nothing to do to clean up arm accoutrement to wander a pleased through town started early next morning after two day marching arrived at ghent where several regiment be quartered either in town in village round ralph company have billet allotted to in village mile from town cottage being placed at disposal of captain two subaltern next morning after parade of regiment be over most of officer many of men paid visit to town where fugitive king of france have now established court ralph who year before have read history of ghent be greatly interested in quaint old town though be difficult to imagine from appearance of quiet street that inhabitant have once be most turbulent in europe here von artevelde be killed street often ran with blood of contending faction be possible that father of quiet workman in blouse armed with ax pike have defeated chivalry of france annihilated force of duke of anjou what number of convent there be monk seemed full third of population be curious to hear everyone talking in french when french be enemy be going to meet populace be quite a interested in english visitor a latter be with english scarlet be altogether strange to dress of men of highland regiment who be encamped next to twenty eighth filled with astonishment for fortnight regiment remained at ghent then with others of same division marched to brussels took up quarter in village round town twenty eighth belonged to picton division formed part of reserve concentrated round brussels first army corp consisting of second third division of dutch belgian first third of british extended from enghien on right to quatre bra on left first british division be at former town third between soignies roeulx while belgian dutch lay between nivelles quatre bra second army corp held ground on right of first extended to oudenarde on scheldt cavalry with exception of brunswick brigade be posted at grammont mon roeulx outpost being thrown forward a far a maubeuge beaumont prussian be on left of wellington force extended from ligny through namur toward liege advanced post being at charleroi where zieten division have headquarters although allied army thus formed together arc of large circle covering brussels be entirely distinct british drew supply from ostend on right of position while liege on extreme left be base of prussian napoleon movement be uncertain might either advance upon namur cut off prussian from base between grammont oudenarde by measure must similarly cut british off from ostend might advance from charleroi direct upon brussels breaking through at point where wellington left joined prussian right duke of wellington believed that must attempt second of alternative a in case must fall upon british before prussian must come up to assistance if successful must not only cut off from base of supply must be able to march straight upon brussels be to defeat plan that duke posted largest proportion of british troop along frontier holding however two british division brunswick nassau troop in round brussels where be nearly equidistant from point must be attacked must be moved forward a soon a enemy intention became manifest by time that whole of force be assembled wellington have ninety thousand men under order blucher prussian general have one hundred sixteen thousand while napoleon have one hundred twenty five thousand with to encounter vastly superior force upon other hand napoleon be veteran troop french have for long time be accustomed to victory over prussian of wellington force fully half be of mixed nationality belgian dutch brunswickers hessian while british division consisted chiefly of young troop so hastily raised that great number of absolutely fought at waterloo in uniform of militia regiment from have be drafted seemed however well nigh desperate enterprise for napoleon to attack so greatly superior force have in fact choice to do so for russia austria be arming force must soon be advancing upon france be therefore necessary if possible to defeat british prussian before must arrive must succeed in doing enthusiasm must be excited in france must enable vastly to increase army in meantime confidence in own military genius be unbounded history of past be contained many triumph won under circumstance far le favorable than present during week elapsed while three great army be assembling taking up position troop stationed round brussels have pleasant time of city be crowded with visitor here be number of wife friend of officer of various army here be many of french nobility who have abandoned france upon landing of napoleon here be number of people attracted by curiosity desire of being present at theater of great event together with crowd of simple pleasure seeker for europe have for many year be closed to englishman a soon a peace have be proclaimed great number have crossed channel to visit paris have traveled in germany italy switzerland news of napoleon return to france have occasioned great scare among tourist very few day sufficed for desertion of paris other french town so great be crowd that packet boat between calais dover be insufficient to carry many of visitor to paris instead of leaving for england made for belgium be joined there by traveler hurrying back from austria germany other part of europe for none must say what course event must follow napoleon return from elba might take at brussels however felt safe distance to england be short must if necessary leave at time beside between belgium france twelve thousand british troop have be stationed in strong place in accordance with term of treaty of fontainebleau agreement made with ally after fall of napoleon street of brussels be ablaze with bright color staff officer in uniform of number of nationality dashed through street followed by orderly now then two three general officer riding at slower pace engaged in earnest talk passed along while pavement be occupied by crowd of men officer in variety of british dutch belgian brunswick hanoverian hessian prussian uniform although belgium have cast in lot with ally people be by mean unanimous in sympathy indeed majority from similarity in religion tongue to french sympathized with rather than with ally who be for most part protestant foreigner who entertained sentiment however kept to while rest fraternized to best of power with troop many of whom be quartered in town a for amusement there be for officer theater opera while many of lady staying in brussels kept almost open house race athletic sport be got up for men weather at latter end of may during early day of june be delightful although knew that storm might at moment burst be difficult to believe while so enjoying that to morrow might be called upon to meet enemy in deadly conflict even denis mulligan have nothing to complain about in ration allowed to ralph that belgian be much more decent people than have expected to find month of april may have passed quietly on frontier cavalry of allied army on one side french mounted gendarmerie on other maintained vigilant watch over others movement endeavored to prevent passing out of person who might carry news of intention position of army line be far too long to be strictly watched french loyalist on one side belgian sympathizer with france on other managed to pas with sufficient regularity to keep general informed of movement of opponent wellington then be perfectly aware of gathering of napoleon force upon other side of frontier like own troop be scattered over long front yet there be indication whatever a to point where napoleon be likely to break through during past three month large body of men have labored to restore ruined fortification of frontier town moat have be cleared out deepened wall repaired sluice restored so that in case of necessity wide tract of country must be laid under water precaution have be specially taken on right of british position where wellington expected napoleon attack general calculated that with aid of obstacle so interposed to napoleon advance troop stationed there must be able to check tide of invasion until whole army arrived to assistance country between brussels frontier be reconnoitered engineer officer be employed in making sketch of position appeared likely to offer special advantage a battlefield for army standing on defense among others field lying in front of village of waterloo be mapped spot be specially marked by duke a one to be occupied in case enemy forced way between british prussian army on th of june duke of wellington learned that napoleon guard have left paris for north next day officer in command of cavalry outpost reported that picket of french cavalry have so long faced have disappeared that have learned from french custom house officer hostility be about to commence on th of june ralph conway have gone with stapleton into brussels a usual everything be going on with accustomed regularity military band be playing in park number of well appointed carriage filled with well dressed lady drove to fro crowd of officer civilian strolled under tree greeting acquaintance discussing latest gossip of town a to coming of french topic be so threadbare that one alluded to stranger must have imagined from aspect of scene three great army be lying thirty forty mile away in readiness to engage

put in store need bother about especially when for aught know may never come back to claim although o'connor did not know duke have by time received news indicating that attack upon prussian outpost be beginning of great movement that whole french army be pressing forward by road where prussian british army joined hand at daybreak french have advanced in three column right upon chatelet five mile below charleroi on sambre center on charleroi left on marchienne zieten who be in command of prussian corp d'armee defended bridge at three point stoutly then contested foot of ground cavalry making frequent charge so that at end of day french have only advanced five mile stout resistance enabled blucher to bring up two out of other three corp bulow whose corp be at liege forty mile away receiving order too late to march day rest of prussian army concentrated round village of fleurs ligny accordingly at ten o'clock in evening order be issued by wellington for third division to march at once from braine le comte to nivelles for first to move from enghien to braine le comte for second fourth division to march from ath grammont on enghien fresh order be issued to troop round brussels although be known at ball that troop be in readiness to march at moment notice there be none except general few member of staff who have idea that moment be so near at hand regiment stationed at distance from brussels be assembled in park by ten o'clock in evening then arm be piled men permitted to fall out only few lighted fire for night be warm artillery however who have along be bivouacked in park have fire going a usual round many of troop gathered greater part wrapped in cloak went quietly to sleep ralph strolled about for hour two chatting with other officer looking at group of sleeper listening to talk of soldier gathered round fire among be many old peninsular men whose experience now rendered authority among younger soldier who listened eagerly to detail of desperate struggle at terrible storming of fortress lighter tale of life adventure in spain many of men whose quarter lay near scene of assembly have be permitted to return to with strict order to be ready to join rank must bugle sound chapter xvi found at last a soon a mr conway received box set to work in earnest directly house be still sufficient time have elapsed for miss penfolds to have fallen asleep rose from bed on have lain down without undressing put on coat hat made way noiselessly down to library a kept lock well oiled entered noiselessly then locking door behind lighted candle commenced search on fifth night be rewarded by finding that center of what looked like solidly carved flower in ornamentation of mantelpiece gave way under pressure of finger at same moment heard slight click beyond nothing be apparent after trying everything within reach came to conclusion that needed second spring to be touched to reveal entrance took three week before found be slight projection about a large a button in inside of chimney behind mantel pressing other spring simultaneously bookcase on left of fireplace suddenly swung open three four inch for moment stood breathless with excitement hesitating before entered then swung bookcase open there a have expected be little room seven foot long by four deep to bitter disappointment be bare empty few scrap of paper lay on ground there be furniture chest box in room revulsion be so great that mr conway returned into library threw into chair have long cry then went back into room carefully examined piece of paper lying on ground one of be portion of letter recognized at once handwriting of mr tallboy contained only word dear mr penfold in accordance with request send above be date be ten day only anterior to mr penfold death mr conway have doubt that word must have followed fragment be will that be letter mr tallboy have sent over with document be important evidence a showed that mr penfold have be in habit of using place during lifetime that have entered after have received will from solicitor few day before death why must have entered except to put will in place of security where place be did not know felt certain that be somewhere within reach of hand if be here must be found said resolutely wo begin to look for to night must be three o'clock already will think matter over thoroughly before begin again be something to have found out a much a have ought to be encouraged instead of being disappointed that day wrote to mr tallboy giving full account of discovery have made inclosing fragment of letter did not renew search for next two night for long watchfulness excitement have told upon felt that needed rest before set about second part of search received letter from mr tallboy in reply to that have sent dear mr conway congratulate most heartily upon great success have met with own have never be very hopeful for after thorough search made of room hardly thought likely that must succeed when have failed however have done so can not doubt that similar success will attend further effort in small bare room such a describe difficulty in way of finding hidden receptacle can not be so great a have already overcome be perfectly correct in supposition that fragment sent be part of letter sent over with will to mr penfold by clerk have compared with copy in letter book find that be same a say letter prof conclusively that mr penfold be in secret room after received will one can assign reason for going there unless to put will away in what considered secure hiding place that be still somewhere there have doubt whatever will await with much anxiety news a to further progress thinking matter over mr conway have come to conclusion that hiding place must only be under one of stone flag of floor in wall against fireplace rather in part of above fireplace there must not be thickness enough in wall separating secret chamber from passage room on side of chimney must not be of same width a open fireplace below there might well be space there sufficient for good sized closet be here therefore that determined to begin search next night then after touching spring entering secret chamber began carefully to examine stone in wall next fireplace at distance about four foot above ground in five minute uttered exclamation of satisfaction one of stone above eighteen inch square although like rest fitting closely to adjoining be not like others bedded in cement so close be join that needed close inspection to see that be different from around still upon close examination be evident that be not cemented in taking out penknife from pocket found that joint be too close even to allow to be inserted for distance there be keyhole other visible mean of opening searched wall in vain for hidden spring for whole week continued search without slightest success at last began almost to despair for at end of time be convinced that have passed finger again again over square inch of floor wall within reach completely worn out with sleepless night determined to take little rest to abstain altogether for few night from search on third night however idea suddenly occurred to rose at once dressed herself be about to go downstairs when thought that heard noise below returned at once to room hid away hat coat again went to top of stair listened yes have not be mistaken distinctly heard sound below thought murmur of men voice after moment thought returned again to room took off dress threw shawl round shoulder then stole quietly down stair to next floor knocked gently at miss penfold door repeated knock two three time then heard miss penfold voice asking who be there did not speak knocked again time voice came from other side of door be miss penfold anna sibthorpe door be unlocked opened what be anna there be one in house ma'be can hear moving about down below think can hear men voice miss penfold came out listened yes there be one there said go call butler others will be ready by time come down in two three minute servant headed by butler who have armed with blunderbuss always hung in room ready for action came downstairs miss penfold came out to meet dressed have pistol in hand maid have armed with poker broom have looked to priming of blunderbuss miss penfold asked quietly ma'be well then look now said sharply what be use of having weapon if see that be in order be right ma'be butler said examining priming well then come along make noise went downstairs noiselessly paused when reached hall sound came from drawing room miss penfold led way to door turned handle flung open three men be seen in act of packing up of valuable started up with exclamation miss penfold fired there be cry of pain moment later there be roar a blunderbuss went off content lodging in ceiling without hesitating for moment three men made rush to open window be gone john wilton miss penfold said sternly be fool give month notice from to day fasten up shutter again go off to bed without word turned went upstairs a reached landing sister ran out of room in great alarm what be matter charlotte heard two explosion be nothing eleanor men broke into house have gone down frightened away did not think be worth while disturbing a be so easily alarmed be over now servant be shutting up house again will tell about in morning go to bed again at once will catch cold good night directly miss penfold have gone upstairs hubbub of talk burst out from female servant be disgraceful john with great gun ought to have shot dead went off by john said just a be going to level went off by cook said scornfully never went off of when be hanging above bed gun never go off by more than girl do be surprised at john why have heard talk score of time of what must do if burglar came now here have be knocked big hole in ceiling why missus have twenty time a much courage a have shot straight did for heard one of men give squalk oh men be pitiful creature after must have be so mighty brave cook if miss penfold have be in front of lot of use be cook retorted six foot one of flesh heart in why must have knocked down with broom if have be within reach of yes that must cook under housemaid said have got poker ready must have given nicely if must have got within reach miss penfold be just a cool a if have be eating breakfast so be except john john have by time fastened up shutter again feeling that persecutor be too many for slunk off at once to room others beginning to feel that garment be scarcely fitted for cold night air postponed discussion of affair until following morning next morning after breakfast servant be called into dining room miss penfold interrogated closely a to whether of have seen strange men about have be questioned by one knew a to valuable at hall if have not be for anna said when have finished without eliciting information house must have be robbed not of must have be wiser be most fortunate that a say happened to be awake heard sound acted very properly in coming quietly down to wake if one man in house looked scornfully at unfortunate butler have be possessed of courage of man whole of must have be shot for be standing close together must hardly have missed if have tried if weapon have be in hand of anna instead of of john wilton result must have be very different however john wilton have be good servant generally suppose be not fault if have not courage of mouse therefore will withdraw notice for to leave will make arrangement for gardener to sleep in house in future will hand blunderbuss over to will write to day to ironmonger at weymouth to come over fix bell to shutter to arrange wire for bell from room to gardener will occupy at breakfast miss penfold informed sister of what have taken place night before will write of course to head constable at weymouth to send over to inquire about have very little hope that will discover anything eleanor why do think that charlotte said that be convinced have wounded one of men so ought to be able to trace dare say must if have be ordinary theft be convinced that be not not ordinary theft what do mean have doubt in mind eleanor that be attempt to discover will do think so eleanor said in awed voice be terrible said men be engaged in packing up candlestick ornament oh believe be mere blind of course must wish to believe be simply burglar therefore acted a such to begin with there have never be attempt on house during forty year have lived here why must there be so now if anna have not fortunately heard men believe that when have packed up few thing to give idea that be burglar must have gone to library set to to ransack find will must never have found charlotte be too well hidden for there be knowing miss penfold said gloomily so long a be in existence will never feel comfortable will be much better to destroy eleanor exclaimed agreed charlotte that there be reason why must assist to find be altogether different thing from destroying must never feel happy again if did a for miss penfold said somewhat scornfully seem very happy now be always fretting fidgeting over be not who be fancying that burglar came after will eleanor answered in aggrieved voice be way with timid people miss penfold said be often afraid of shadow see danger where danger really exists at rate be determined to see whether will really be where suppose to be if be will take out hide in mattress of bed know that will be safe there at rate a long a live though think wiser to destroy eleanor exclaimed anything that sleep badly enough now be always dreaming that herbert be standing by bedside with reproachful look upon face must never dare sleep at if be to destroy have patience with such childish fancy a told over over again miss penfold said sharply if be ready to take risk of doing see that need fret about however be ready to give in to prejudice indeed must rather not destroy if can be safely kept elsewhere at rate will move from hiding place know that be there nowhere else that will be searched for with in room need have more uneasiness can unsew straw pailliasse at bottom of bed when be safely in there will have fear whatever of course can do a like charlotte eleanor said feebly for part must much rather go on a be know now that will really exists must much rather go on thinking that there be doubt about very well then go on so eleanor need ask question of will tell nothing only remember if die before part with pailliasse on bed mr conway thought good deal during day about event of night before determined to be more cautious than ever in operation for thought probable that miss penfold must be even more wakeful suspicious than before must have left search alone for few day have not be for idea have taken from bed night before have struck then a possible that spring opening secret closet might be in chimney behind that be necessary to touch from outside before opening door of secret room be convinced that have there be spring in room must have discovered never before struck that might be at back of closet felt that must satisfy on point whatever risk of discovery accordingly at usual hour made way downstairs have put key in door be in act of turning when heard noise upstairs opened door stood looking up stair in moment saw light directly afterward miss penfold appeared at top holding candle in hand knowing be a yet unseen mr conway entered library closed door behind then hurried to fireplace touched two spring pulled bookcase open entered secret chamber closed bookcase behind have often examined lock thinking that secret spring of closet might be concealed here be large old fashioned one moved two bolt one at top of door one at bottom have already discovered must be easily opened from inside imagined that miss penfold be merely going round house to see that be secure have contrary to practice taken key from door of library in order that miss penfold might enter if chose thought now flashed across possibly might intend to open secret room to prevent now thrust barrel of pistol carried in between back of bolt piece of iron against shot so that action of spring must not throw out of place breathlessly listened presently heard sharp click in wall behind have scarcely time to wonder what meant when heard sound in lock close to be repeated again again then felt slight tremor of door a if somebody be trying to shake heart almost stood still miss penfold be evidently trying to open chamber though knew lock must not open so long a held pistol in place felt breath coming fast heart beating for five minute attempt to open door continued then be still again for hour remained without moving then a continued quiet guessed that miss penfold finding spring did not act have returned to room now rose to foot drew out dark lantern turned to wall by side gave exclamation of joy stone that have so long vainly endeavored to move be swung open miss penfold who of course have secret have touched spring outside before attempting to open chamber stone be set in iron have swung open on hinge in moment mr conway explored content closet be about two foot square by nine inch in depth contained two shelf there be several paper in very first upon placed hand be marked last will testament of herbert penfold so overwhelmed be mr conway at termination to long search that sank on ground be time before must collect sufficiently to consider what be best course be evident that for reason miss penfold have be about to visit secret room to see that will be still in safety failure of spring to act have of course disconcerted might try again in morning must then be able to enter room must discover that will be missing be clearly best course to make off at once remembered now that have noticed tiny hole no bigger than nail hole in door have found that upon other side be just above row of book in shelf somewhat lower in height than rest be evidently intended to enable occupant of chamber to obtain view of library see whether room be occupied applied eye to at once saw that be dark concealing lantern again beneath coat drew back bolt gently stepped out then went to one of window took down bell carefully unbarred shutter threw up window stepped out sped cross garden down drive through gate then hurried at top of speed toward village have gone about distance when heard horse footstep approaching road ran between two high hedge there be place for concealment therefore walked along by edge of road close to hedge hoping that horseman must pas without noticing eye however be too much accustomed to darkness reined in horse when came to moment later light of small lantern fell on face who be voice asked where be going be going to vicarage said to see mr withers likely story that said what be woman with man hat coat there be something wrong here leaning down caught by collar saw by light of lantern that be mounted patrol be quite true constable said have put thing on in hurry be going to see mr withers on question of life death take to vicarage if when get there find story be not true can lock up if like constable be puzzled voice be apparently that of lady yet attire presence abroad at two o'clock in morning be suspicious in extreme paused irresolute like to disturb vicar at time of night said will take to village lockup go up to in morning please do that said be lady have very good reason for what be doing can promise that mr withers will not be angry at being called up indeed will be greatly pleased come constable went on seeing that hesitated will give couple of guinea to take direct to vicarage well ma'be constable said if be sure mr withers will not be angry at being called up at hour will take know be magistrate must never do to play trick upon there be trick constable know very well will be pleased to see even at hour greatly puzzled over whole proceeding constable turned

replied knowing a do that in twenty four hour may be engaged that in forty eight greatest battle of age may take place be horribly sad to look on at scene wonder how many of men laughing flirting dancing so gayly there must be so soon lying stark cold how many broken heart there must be among woman felt heartily glad that have wife sweetheart there be not often feel in low spirit for once one must not help thinking here be different thing be soldier come must do duty take chance gayety of scene jarred upon must see there be many especially older men who be thinking a did dare say if have found partner gone in for dancing must have thought little about standing looking on thought came think be right conway not to go have heard news of what have taken place to day yes be standing by colonel when picton came up to said 'there be be sharp fighting on frontier zieten gave french deal of trouble only fell back about six mile other corp except bulow will join to night 'it be thousand pity zieten did not send off mounted messenger to directly became engaged if have done so might have started at one o'clock to day must have be in line with prussian to morrow suppose thought blucher must send blucher thought have sent so between nothing be done only got news at seven o'clock evening nine precious hour thrown away be just blunder of sort make difference between failure success in war have message be sent dutch division troop from braine le comte might have be up by morning a be blucher with only three out of four army corp have whole of french army facing must either fall back without fighting fight against superior number be if napoleon throw whole force upon a suppose will be enough to provoke saint will blucher do do think general colonel asked sends word that will fight where be in case if napoleon throw whole force on be nearly certain to be beaten then will have napoleon on next day now conway think better to get few hour sleep if can for to morrow will be heavy day for unless be mistaken be time before ralph slept when did so slept soundly waking up with start a sound of bugle rang out in night air be taken up by bugle of whole division brussels have hour before echoed with sound of carriage returning from ball woke with start with sound of bugle be mingled that of highland pipe in few minute street swarmed with soldier for there be scarce house have officer men quartered in upper window be thrown up inhabitant inquired cause of uproar soon whole population be in street there be delay soldier have packed knapsack before lying down to sleep in quarter of hour from sound of bugle regiment be forming up in park be surrounded by anxious crowd weeping woman be embracing husband lover inhabitant looked pale scared wildest rumor be already circulating among mounted officer dashed to fro bugle kept on sounding assembly heavy rumble of gun be heard a artillery came up took up appointed position in hour from sound of first warning bugle head of column began to move just a daylight be breaking comparatively few of officer of ralph regiment be married men there be therefore fewer of agonizing parting wrung heart of many belonging to regiment have be quartered for time at home ralph saw enough to convince that soldier must remain single man at rate during such time a be likely to be called upon for serious service in field be relief when band of regiment struck up with light step troop marched away from city where have spent so many pleasant week a troop marched on spirit rose indeed british soldier be always at gayest when there be prospect of fighting hum of voice rose along column joke be exchanged there be laughter merriment pace be not rapid there be frequent stoppage for long column can not march at same pace a single regiment be ten o'clock when halted at mount st jean fourteen mile from brussels here men sat down by roadside opened haversack partook of hasty meal suddenly there be cheer from rear of column nearer nearer grew regiment leaped to foot joined in shout a duke of wellington with brilliant staff rode forward on way to front already booming of gun in distance told that troop be engaged there be cheer when order ran along line to fall in again fighting have indeed begun soon after daylight prince bernhard who commanded division of dutch troop at quatre bra have commenced hostility a soon a be light by attacking french in front of prince of orange who have ridden to nivelles directly ball be over brought on dutch troop from town joining prince bernhard drove back french to within mile of frasnes duke of wellington reached quatre bra soon after eleven finding that there be immediate danger there galloped away to communicate with blucher found that latter have gathered three of corp occupied chain of low hill extending from bry to tongres rivulet of ligny wound in front of village of st armand ligny at foot of slope be occupied a outpost village be distance in front of hill be too far off for troop there to be readily reinforced from army on height duke of wellington be of opinion that position be not good one be said to have remarked to blucher everyman know own people best can only say that with british army must not occupy ground a do have duke be able to concentrate force round quatre bra in time intended to aid prussian by taking offensive unfortunate delay have taken place in sending news of french advance on previous morning rendered now impossible that must do so therefore rode back to quatre bra to arrange for defence against french corp be evidently gathering to attack be well for ally that napoleon be not in position to attack in force at daybreak troop instead of being concentrated night before at fleurus be scattered over considerable extent of country many of be still beyond sambre marshal ney who have be appointed to command of corp intended to push through quatre bra march straight on brussels have only arrived evening before be ignorant of position of various division under command therefore be not until two o'clock in afternoon that napoleon advanced with sixty thousand men to attack prussian at ligny while at about same hour column under ney advanced from frasnes against quatre bra delay be fatal to napoleon plan have battle commenced at daybreak ney must have brushed aside defender of quatre bra must have be at mount st jean by time english came up prussian must have be beaten by noon instead of at dusk before retreat must have be converted into rout on following day napoleon whole army must have be in position to have fallen upon only british division that wellington must by time have collected to oppose must probably have be in possession of brussels before night thus while delay in sending news to wellington prevented ally combining against french on th of june delay of napoleon in attacking that morning more than counterbalanced error there be le excuse for delay inasmuch a have chosen time for fighting must not have advanced until have whole force well up ready for action a advance during first day fighting have be so slow whole army might well have be gathered at round fleurus ready to give battle at first dawn of day fighting a did against vastly superior force napoleon one hope of success lay in crushing prussian before english who a well knew be scattered over large extent of country must come up failure to do cost empire artillery fire ceased in front before column continued march for mount st jean prince of orange have paused in advance when saw how strong be french force round frasnes ney be not yet ready to attack therefore from eleven until two there be cessation of operation ardor of troop flagged somewhat a tramped along dusty road between mount st jean genappe prince of orange be having anxious time while british column be pressing forward to assistance a hour went by saw enemy force in front of accumulating while knew that own support must be still distance away nevertheless prepared to defend quatre bra to last have with six thousand eight hundred thirty two infantry sixteen cannon while ney have gathered seventeen thousand men thirty eight gun to attack latter must have have with d'erlon corp of twenty thousand men forty six gun be suddenly withdrawn by napoleon when latter found that prussian force be stronger than have expected have just reached field of ligny when order from ney again caused to retrace step to quatre bra where arrived just after fighting there have come to end thus twenty thousand men with forty six gun be absolutely thrown away while presence with napoleon ney must have be invaluable soon after two o'clock picton division headed column heard several cannon shot fired in rapid succession in minute perfect roar of artillery broke out battle have evidently begun weary men who have already marched over twenty mile straightened up pace quickened division pressed eagerly forward few minute later even heavier more continuous roar of cannon broke out away to left napoleon be attacking prussian talking laughing ceased now even oldest soldier be awed by roar of fire younger one glanced in other face to see whether others felt same vague feeling of discomfort experienced yet terrible a be evidently conflict raging in front man longed to take part in officer order to men to step out briskly be given in cheerful confident voice men with finger tightening on musket eye looking intently forward a if must pierce distance realize scene enacting there pressed on doggedly determinedly messenger after messenger rode up to general picton who be marching at head of column begging to hurry on for that prince of orange be step by step being driven back troop be already doing best dutch belgian troop have fought with considerable bravery have held village of piermont farm near for time before fell back to wood of bossu here make stout stand again be at length driven out be beginning to lose heart in few minute must have given way when saw on long straight road behind red line of picton column glad news that help be at hand ran quickly through wood belgian met foe with fresh courage picton force consisted of eighth ninth british brigade former under general sir james kempt latter under sir denis pack with be fourth brigade of hanoverian with two battery of artillery one hanoverian other british excitement of troop increased a neared quatre bra loud cheer ran along line a neared wood took place by side of hardly pressed dutch belgian pack brigade consisted of first battalion forty second second forty fourth first ninety second first ninety fifth while kempt have under first twenty eighth first thirty second first seventy ninth third royal aspect of fight be speedily changed now french who have be advancing with shout of triumph be at once hurled back defender few minute later be strengthened by arrival of greater part of duke of brunswick corp in point of number combatant be now nearly equal a ally have eighteen thousand infantry two thousand cavalry twenty eight gun on field of however eight thousand at most be british picton at once sent forward first battalion of ninety fifth cleared little wood in front of piermont of french light troop restored communication between quatre bra ligny ney however be preparing to advance again in force front be covered with double hedgerow afforded admirable shelter to skirmisher while artillery be so placed on rising ground in rear of position a to sweep whole country over column must advance to attack at moment duke returned from conference with blucher at once saw that enemy have gathered heavy column behind wood of bossu directed prince of orange to withdraw gun be too far advanced to gather dutch belgian troop to oppose advance at same time sent forward twenty eighth to assistance arrived however too late for french swept belgian before advanced steadily while artillery from high ground opened furious cannonade upon picton division one of brunswick regiment now joined belgian in spite of reinforcement latter be driven from wood of bossu have occupied when british first came up british troop be suffering heavily from artillery fire to own gun must make effectual reply pretty hot conway captain o'connor said to ralph be not pleasant standing here being made target of that be not ralph said heartily call horribly unpleasant must mind so much if be doing something be indeed trying for young soldier under fire for first time french have got range accurately moment gap be made in line a round shot plowed through officer walked backward forward in front of men with exhortation to stand steady will be turn presently lad captain o'connor said assuringly will turn table on by by never fear there be not long to wait cloud of french skirmisher be seen advancing through hedgerow stealing behind thicket wood skirted road moment later order came for light company of regiment of picton division to advance forward lad captain o'connor said be turn now keep cool waste ammunition with cheer company followed hedge bank tree must afford shelter be seized upon sharp crackling fire at once replied to of french skirmisher light company be then armed with far better weapon than in use by rest of troop soldier must have told at once by sharp crackling sound along front of british line that be light company be engaged now heavy column of troop be seen advancing from village held by french a approached part of line held by brunswickers broke up into several column german be falling back when duke sent picton two brigade to meet enemy halfway ninety second be left behind in reserve on road light company be called in picton placed in front of long line with tremendous cheer advanced to meet heavy french column be thus through war of period that english french always fought french in massive column english in long line once again a at albuera in many stricken field line proved conqueror overlapping column opposed to pouring scathing volley upon flank then charging on shaken mass with bayonet british regiment drove enemy back beyond hedgerow be with difficulty restrained from following up face of opposite hill on right however brunswickers be suffering heavily from cannonade of french be only prevented from breaking by coolness of chief duke of brunswick rode backward forward in front of smoking pipe chatting cheerfully with officer seemingly unconscious of storm of fire even most nervous of young troop felt ashamed to show sign of faltering when commander chief set example four gun at request wellington have sent to came up opened fire so completely be overmatched that in five minute two be disabled other two silenced a soon a be done two french column of infantry preceded by battalion in line advanced along edge of wood while heavy mass of cavalry advanced along ghent road threatened brunswickers with destruction brunswick dutch belgian skirmisher fell back before of french duke of brunswick placed before regiment of lancer charged french infantry stood steady received lancer with so heavy fire that retreated in confusion on quatre bra duke now ordered infantry to fall back in good order by time be too shaken to do so french artillery smote with terrible effect infantry swept with bullet cavalry be preparing to charge wonder then that young troop lost self possession broke fled in utter confusion through quatre bra others through english regiment on left of village at moment gallant duke of brunswick while striving to rally one of regiment received mortar wound died few minute later a father have died on field of jena brunswick hussar be now ordered to advance cover retreat of infantry a moved toward enemy lost heart turned fled from field french lancer charging hotly among so closely be two body mixed together that forty second forty fourth be posted on left of road must not distinguish friend from foe before former regiment have time to form square french be upon for two three minute desperate hand to hand conflict took place between bayonet lance forty fourth did not attempt to form square colonel faced rear rank about poured so tremendous volley into french cavalry that reeled back in confusion two company of forty second have be cut off from rest be almost annihilated rest of square closed in around french cavalry who have pierced destroyed to man twenty eighth also repulsed enemy what do think of now conway captain o'connor asked a french retreated feel right now ralph said though thought just now that be over with big frenchman be just dealing sweeping cut at when musket shot struck still be thousand time better than standing still being pounded by artillery confess felt horribly uncomfortable while be going on dare say did lad duke of wellington have upon fall of commander in vain endeavored to rally flying brunswickers a be so engaged cavalry column swept down upon put spur to horse galloped to spot where ninety second be lying behind ditch bordering road french be close to heel shouted to men of ninety second in front of to throw down setting spur to horse leaped ditch men behind instantly highlander poured so terrible volley into french cavalry that hundred saddle be emptied cavalry recoiled for moment in confusion then reformed retired in good order of leading squadron however have galloped on into village cut down straggler there highlander closed round being pent up in farmyard from there be one outlet scarce man who have entered escaped french have now received heavy reinforcement kellermann heavy horse having come upon field a dutch belgian cavalry must face french trooper be free to employ whole cavalry force against british infantry again again charged down upon twenty eighth forty second forty fourth first royal twenty eighth royal did not indeed wait to be attacked led by picton kempt in person resolutely advanced to charge french cavalry feat seldom exampled in military history be rendered necessary in order to cover flank of forty second forty fourth now by flight of brunswickers dutch belgian open to attack of french cavalry field here be covered with growth of tall rye concealed approach of french cavalry till be within few yard of infantry be only by tramp of horse a rushed through corn that british square knew when foe must be upon picton in center of twenty eighth encouraged by presence stood firm although cavalry again again charged down until horse chest touched close line of bayonet be time repulsed with heavy loss thirty second seventy ninth ninety fifth be also exposed to similar attack everywhere british soldier stood firmly shoulder to shoulder nowhere did french succeed in breaking rank at five o'clock fresh gun cavalry reinforced ney infantry again advanced in great force through wood of bossu british square be decimated by fire of artillery several battery be advanced to comparatively short range opened with destructive effect stoutly a eight thousand british have fought deserted though be by ally against ney overpowering number must not much longer have stood ground when at critical moment general alten division came up by nivelles road to aid halket british brigade advanced between wood of bossu charleroi road while hanoverian brigade took up ground to left gave support to hardly pressed british ney now pushed forward man at disposal mass of cavalry charged down falling upon sixty ninth one of regiment just arrived cut up terribly carried off one of color thirty second however belonging to same brigade repulsed similar attempt with terrible slaughter french infantry supported by column of cuirassier advanced against hanoverian driving back approached spot where ninety second be lying major general barnes rode up to highlander taking off hat shouted now ninety second follow highlander sprang from ditch in be lying bagpipe struck up slogan of regiment with leveled bayonet threw upon french column in vain leading company attempted to make stand highlander drove back in confusion broke fled to shelter of hedgerow where tried to resist advance highlander burst through without pause colonel john cameron fell dead men more furious than before flung on french drove back in confusion into wood ney still thought of renewing attack d'erlon corp have not yet arrived while at moment two light battalion of brunswickers with two battery of artillery came up almost immediately afterward general cooke division comprising two brigade of guard reached spot latter at once advanced against french skirmisher just a be issuing afresh from wood of bossu guard have undergone tremendous march thought of fatigue be lost in excitement swept french before pressed forward a did so whole british line advanced halket brigade on one flank guard on other in vain french cavalry charged again again in vain french infantry strove to stem tide one after position have so hardly won be wrested from picton division retook village piermont be carried by ninety fifth german legion while guard drove enemy entirely out of wood of bossu night be now falling ney fell back under cover of darkness to original position in frasnes while british lighted fire bivouacked on ground have so bravely held a soon a order came for troop to bivouac where be standing arm be piled men set to work party chopped down hedge broke up fence fire be soon blazing owing to late hour at fight terminated confusion among baggage wagon be now beginning to arrive from rear regular distribution of ration must be made most of men however have filled haversack before leaving quarter on previous evening party sent down road obtained sufficient supply of bread for rest from commissariat wagon while fire be being lighted light company be ordered to aid in work of collecting wounded other regiment have also sent out party for hour work went on owing to frequent movement of troop darkness of night be difficult to discover wounded there be material at hand from torch must be made distinction be made between friend foe body found to be cold stiff be left where lay rest be lifted carried to one other of spot where surgeon of force be hard at work giving first dressing to wound where absolutely necessary performing amputation after hour work light company be relieved by grenadier in turn by other company so might have chance of obtaining a much sleep a possible troop be indeed terribly fatigued for have have thirty mile march nearly six hour continuous fighting be in high spirit at success although suffering severely from want of water have started in morning with full canteen dusty march have produced such thirst that most of be emptied long before reached field of battle water be to be found near spot where twenty eighth be bivouacked indeed with exception of regiment in village who obtained water from well whole army lay down without drink water have however be fetched for wounded whose first cry a comrade reached have always be for even when search have ceased for night there be number still lying in agony scattered over field ralph have before starting filled canteen with brandy water at suggestion of captain o'connor le drink lad while on march better chance be will find by night drop be worth weight in gold if have bad luck to be wounded content of canteen may save life if want may be sure that there will be score of poor fellow to whom mouthful will be blessing indeed so ralph have found have drunk very sparingly on way scarcely permitting to do more than to wet lip when set about work of collecting wounded felt more than amply rewarded for little self sacrifice by grateful thanks of poor fellow to whom be able to give mouthful of hoarded store be not until return to bivouac after hour turn of duty that learned extent of loss of regiment knew by smallness of number who mustered for search how much own company have suffered in brief interval in struggle have heard something of what be doing elsewhere lieutenant desmond have fallen early in fight shot through heart a light company went out to oppose french skirmisher captain o'connor have received lance wound through arm have made sling of sash have kept place at head of company officer be gathered round fire when ralph returned to bivouac see have arm in sling o'connor said nothing serious hope think not be confoundedly painful be french lancer did fortunately one of men bayoneted at very instant struck be only head of lance went through arm still made hole big enough to be uncommonly painful more so because gave frightful wrench a man dropped lance however there be nothing to grumble at may consider lucky indeed to have got off with flesh wound when so many good fellow have fallen yes considering number engaged loss have be terribly heavy major said looked very bad for time that did o'connor agreed be what come of fighting with little mongrel by side of be always be case when get mixed up with other nationality look at fontenoy look at talavera if be general must simply fight battle in own way with own men if ally have liked to come up fight on own account better must rely upon in very slightest belgian dutch fought very fairly at beginning o'connor yes will admit what be good of fighting at beginning if be going to bolt in middle of battle if have have two three regiment of own cavalry must have made difference in world when went off horse foot left division alone to face whole force of enemy hardly even hoped must hold ground till alten came up yes be just in nick of time even with must have have to fall back if cooke have not arrived with guard by way have one heard have taken place on left have heard nothing think there be doubt prussian must have be thrashed one must hear roar of fire over there occasionally be sure got farther off at end of day beside if blucher have beaten napoleon friend over there must be falling back can see by long line of fire have not done so dare say will hear about to morrow anyhow think have better lie down get a much sleep a can may have hard day work before chapter xviii waterloo prussian indeed have be beaten at three corp numbering eighty thousand men with two hundred twenty four gun have be attacked by napoleon with sixty thousand men with two hundred four gun battle be contested with extraordinary obstinacy on side village of ligny st armand be taken retaken over over again for hour desperate strife in around continued without cessation party continued to send down reinforcement to point must succeed in obtaining entire possession of fault wellington have perceived in prussian position told against blucher village be too far in advance of height on army be posted reinforcement be therefore long time in reaching spot where be required to act be too a descended hill under observation of napoleon who be able to anticipate arrival by moving up support on side who noted time when blucher last reserve behind ligny have come into action at critical moment general lobau arrived from charleroi with twelve thousand fresh men thirty eight gun at seven o'clock in evening napoleon launched force with division of guard twenty thousand strong who have hitherto be kept in reserve against enemy ligny be captured victory won prussian throughout day have fought with great bravery have long score to wipe out against french be inspired a much by national hatred a by military ardor owed defeat rather to disadvantage of position held than to superior fighting quality of french cavalry have several time made desperate charge sometimes against french horse at others upon column of infantry in one of be with a be in turn driven back by charge of french cuirassier horse be shot bringing to ground aid de camp leaped off threw cloak over a cuirassier came thundering past intent upon overtaking prussian cavalry paid attention to solitary dismounted man few minute later again passed spot time in retreat fresh party of prussian cavalry having met again passed by fallen general little dreaming that one of most formidable determined enemy lay there at mercy a soon a prussian came up dead horse be moved blucher who be insensible carried to rear when soon recovered resumed command though beaten prussian be by mean routed have lost key of position night came on before combat terminated under cover of darkness fell back quietly in good order general thielmann corp on extreme prussian left have taken little part in fighting a center right of prussian army retreated advanced fell upon french in darkness for time forced back thus giving time to rest of army to reform rank recover discipline after having rendered great service by thus occupying enemy thielmann took up position on height remained facing french while other corp d'arme took post in rear french be too weary to follow up advantage have gained night passed without attack being made at daybreak prussian started on march to wavre cavalry remaining behind to cover movement check pursuit conceal if possible from french line by army be falling back have pursuit be taken up at daybreak by french must soon have driven in cavalry ascertained route taken by infantry be not until many hour have elapsed that french got into motion by time prussian cavalry have disappeared from front nothing remained to inform of line by enemy have retreated there be general feeling of disappointment among gallant defender of quatre bra when on following morning order be issued for to abandon ground have so stoutly held have be astir at daylight firearm be cleaned fresh ammunition served out from reserve wagon men fell into rank expecting that in short time must again be engaged movement must be seen on part of enemy arm be again piled commissariat wagon have come up in night ration be served out to troop breakfast prepared a soon a be over strong party be again sent over battlefield to collect wounded who have escaped search of night before a soon a be collected whole of wounded be placed in ambulance wagon country cart despatched to brussels presently general movement of great baggage train be observed by troop to be taking place long column moved along road to north duke have sent off staff officer at daybreak to ascertain state of thing at ligny returned with report that prussian have left field then sent out small party of cavalry under lieutenant colonel sir alexander gordon officer pushed forward until encountered general zieten who be still at sombreuf mile distant from battlefield general informed of whole event of preceding day gave important intelligence that blucher have retreated to wavre must join hand with wellington at mount st jean english general have previously fixed upon a scene of battle for defense of brussels news relieved wellington of anxiety have be before arranged that blucher if defeated must if possible fall back to wavre be by mean certain that must be able to do have be compelled by event of conflict to retire upon base at namur must have be unable to effect junction for day with wellington latter must have be obliged single handed to bear whole brunt of napoleon attack latter plan have indeed be entirely based on supposition that blucher must retreat upon namur in order to force to do so have abstained from attack upon prussian left employed whole strength against right center so a to swing round force to retire by way of namur a soon a wellington learned that blucher have carried out arrangement agreed upon mind be at ease order be sent off at once to troop advancing from various direction that must move upon mount st jean baggage be sent back to brussels while provision for troop be to be left at mount st jean where also whole of

helped if have waited half hour must have have french army on yesterday work must have be mere child play to still can quite enter into soldier feeling of course understand position regard a simply retreat instead of mere shifting of ground to take up better position fight again to morrow still be nice position be see there be room enough along on top of slope for whole army gun will sweep dip between opposite rise if attack will have to experience same sensation did yesterday of being pounded pounded without satisfaction of being able to return fire must cross that dip to get at at least if attack suppose will a will be strongest party artillery will be able to play upon splendidly from road then too there be two three farmhouse nearer side than theirs suppose will be held in force look rather nice old place among tree there on right have wall inclosure will have hard work to turn out of yes call fine place for battle will have advantage here of being able to see over field of knowing what be going on in other place while yesterday one must see three yard before one during whole time one be fighting one felt that might be of use after for might be getting smashed up in other part of field never thought anything about stapleton said only idea be that must look a if be afraid must set good example to men that be very unpleasant that probably turn might come next must

skirmishing order a arrived within musketry range scattering fire broke out from hedge in front of wood battle of waterloo have begun soon from high ground behind battery of artillery opened fire on french column skirmisher advanced bravely constantly reinforced drove back hanoverian nassau rifleman in front of wood then bull battery of howitzer opened with shell upon so well be served that french skirmisher fell back hotly pressed by first second brigade of guard issuing from chateau roar of cannon speedily extended along crest british aiming at french column french who must see foe with exception of line of skirmisher firing upon british battery french therefore suffered severely while ally sheltered behind crest be only exposed to fire of shot grazed ground in front then came plunging in among prince jerome who commanded on napoleon left sent strong column of support to skirmisher acting against right of wood of hougoumont while foy division moved to attack in front in spite of terrific fire of artillery poured upon brave troop moved on supported by concentrated fire of powerful artillery against british position light company of guard after obstinate resistance be

fugitive dutch artillery behind tried to arrest mob nothing must stop fairly ran over gun men horse rushed down valley through village of mount st jean be not seen again in field during rest of day picton division be now left alone to bear brunt of french attack battle at quatre bra have terribly thinned rank two brigade together did not muster more than three thousand men picton formed whole in line prepared to resist charge of thirteen thousand infantry beside heavy mass of cavalry who be pressing forward having in spite of stout resistance driven in rifleman from sandpit road above a column neared british line fire from french battery suddenly ceased own troop now serving a screen to british head of column halted began to deploy into line picton seized moment shouted volley then

irresistible taken in act of deploying very number of french told against be borne down slope in confusion picton struck by musket ball in head fell dead kempt assumed command brigade followed up attack continued to drive enemy down hill in meantime french cavalry be approaching cuirassier have passed la haye sainte almost cut to piece hanoverian battalion be advancing to reinforce defender at moment lord edward somerset led house hold brigade of cavalry against cuirassier elite of cavalry of two nation met with tremendous shock weight impetus of heavy british horseman aided by fact that be descending hill while opponent have hardly recovered formation after cutting up hanoverian proved irresistible cuirassier be driven down hill desperate hand to hand conflict took place be here that shaw who have be prize fighter before enlisted in second life guard killed le than seven frenchman with own hand receiving however so many wound on return of regiment from charge must no longer sit horse crawling behind house died there from loss of blood while second life guard first dragoon guard pursued cuirassier down slope royal scot grey inniskillens rode to assistance of pack brigade have be assailed by four strong brigade of enemy pack rode along at front of line calling upon men to stand steady enemy crossed hedge within forty yard of ninety second delivered fire highlander waited

cuirassier advanced against wheeled about fell back in great confusion with heavy loss horse being completely blown with long gallop across heavy ground regiment have fared however better than grey royal inniskillens on left for having encountered infantry fire have charged up hill until level with french gun when turning sharp to left swept along line cutting up artilleryman until suddenly be charged by brigade of lancer while large body of infantry threatened line of retreat fortunately at moment light cavalry came up to assistance riding right through infantry column light cavalry fell upon french lancer rolled over with fury of charge then charged regiment of lancer checked advance light heavy horse be now mixed up together fresh body of french cavalry coming up drove down hill with great loss being saved indeed from total destruction by eleventh hussar who coming up last have kept formation covered by remnant of cavalry regained own crest on hill reformed under cover of infantry general ponsonby be killed brother colonel of twelfth severely wounded left on field while desperate fight have be raging on center left fresh column have advanced from jerome foy division against hougoumont have again after obstinate fighting captured orchard surrounded chateau be once more repulsed by fresh battalion of guard who moved down slope to assistance of hardly pressed comrade then for while fighting slackened artillery duel raged a fiercely a ever gunner on side have now got exact range carnage be terrible french shell again set hougoumont on fire badly wounded who have be carried inside perished in flame at end of hour fresh column of attack moved against chateau while at same moment forty squadron of cavalry advanced across valley toward english position english battery played upon with round shot a came near with grape canister horseman rode on at steady trot arrived within forty yard of english square when with shout galloped forward in moment whole of advanced battery of ally be in possession for wellington order have be that artilleryman must stand to gun till last moment then run for shelter behind square french cavalry paused for moment in astonishment at sight met eye have believed that british be broken disorganized sooner have passed over slope than saw british german square bristling with bayonet standing calm immovable artillery on side have ceased fire dead silence have succeeded terrible din have raged moment before then with shout cavalry again charged in case did dash against hedge of bayonet from storm of fire be now pouring breaking into squadron rode through interval between square completely enveloped lord uxbridge gathered remains of british cavalry together charged drove back through square down hill receiving reinforcement french again advanced again enveloped square be again hurled back while be going on battle be still raging round hougoumont la haye sainte against portion of reille division have advanced german resisted a obstinately a did guard a french cavalry retired for second time infantry fell back for time slope of english position be again clear of enemy for time battle languished then napoleon brought up thirty seven fresh squadron of cavalry with remains of who have before charged rode up slope although swept on passed british square must not succeed in shaking body of horse however sweeping down toward dutch belgian at end of line at once marched off field without firing musket brigade of cavalry with galloped away at full speed position be singular one have napoleon ordered infantry to advance in rear of cavalry issue of day might have be changed in appearance french be master of position mass of cavalry hid british square from sight british cavalry be too weak to charge most of gun be in possession of french latter infantry be far away after sustaining fire of square for long time cavalry began to draw off lord uxbridge now endeavored to persuade cumberland hanoverian hussar who have not so far be engaged to charge instead of obeying order turned rode off never drew bridle until reached brussels where reported that british army have be destroyed adam brigade be now brought up from reserve drove back french infantry cavalry who have come up to top of crest beyond hougoumont on other side ney sent column against la haye sainte german made gallant stand be cut off from assistance outnumbered be altogether without ammunition although defended with bayonet to end be slain almost to man la haye sainte be captured at last beyond french must not advance though column after column moved forward to attack on crest be beaten back be now nearly seven o'clock in evening prussian be engaged at st lambert napoleon having detached lobau corp to arrest progress march have be terrible one have to traverse country road softened by rain men be up to ankle in mud gun carriage stuck fast be not until after tremendous effort that leading squadron of cavalry passed through wood of wavre came in view of battle be raging be then past four o'clock hour passed before considerable number of infantry arrived be at time napoleon sent lobau against be able for time to resist advance a fresh troop came up from rear prussian began to win way forward napoleon be obliged to send two more division of young guard to check now saw that be lost unless must before whole of prussian army arrived break down resistance of british therefore prepared for final effort ney be to collect infantry advancing past la haye sainte to fall upon center of british line guard who have hitherto be held in reserve be to pas hougoumont attack left center cavalry be to follow in support cannonade even more heavy terrible than before for gun of reserve have be brought up opened upon british square be now melting away fast reinforcement must be sent to for whole of british troop be now in action ally have for most part long before left field gun be brought to front remains of cavalry gathered together a reserve of prussian now approaching left cavalry there be brought to center to aid in defense of threatened point just a arrangement be completed enemy advanced in tremendous force from inclosure of la haye sainte with fire so completely mastered that of remnant of infantry light gun be brought up to within hundred yard of british line opened with grape upon square two hanoverian battalion be almost annihilated brigade of german legion almost ceased to exist brunswick cavalry regiment have hitherto fought gallantly lost heart must have fled have not british cavalry behind prevented from doing so in meantime imperial guard in two heavy column led by ney be advancing guard being followed by available man of infantry cavalry one of column skirted inclosure of hougoumont other moved against center pressed forward until reached top of slope hundred cannon be brought up unlimbered while artillery on opposite slope rained round shot shell upon british square artillery english gun tried in vain to answer be wholly overmatched gun after gun be dismounted horse men destroyed a soon a leading column of guard reached point when own gun have to cease fire english artillery opened again terrible be havoc made in dense column still guard pressed on until reached top of crest then british guard leaped to foot poured in tremendous volley at close quarter fell on flank of column broke hurled down hill guard be recalled prepared to oppose second column aid be not needed fifty second threw upon flank seventy first ninety fifth swept head with volley a column broke retired duke of wellington gave order men have be longing for since fight began square broke into line british cheering wildly descended crest french retreat became rout cavalry infantry fell upon artillery plied with fire prussian poured down upon flank by eight o'clock splendid army of napoleon be mass of disorganized fugitive for ten hour battle have raged to men in square seemed lifetime when will get at when will get at be constant cry a round shot swept rank although from position behind crest must see nothing of enemy nothing be harder than to suffer in inactivity effort of officer be principally directed to appeasing impatience of men turn will come presently lad yes who will be alive when doe come query be very hard to answer a hour by hour rank melted away although kept cheerful countenance spoke hopefully to men seemed to officer that prospect be well nigh hopeless picton brigade mustered scarce strength when battle began be to have fought in second line day defection of ally in front of have placed in front upon upon defender of hougoumont brunt of battle have fallen a square grew smaller smaller seemed even to officer that end must come before long can not last captain o'connor said to ralph when day be half over will never beat by time get here there will be nobody left to beat think be more than two hundred strong now minute force be diminishing wonder men be impatient bargained for fighting never reckoned on standing for hour to be shot at without even chance to reply be just after that french cavalry burst upon square cheered rather than depressed spirit of men for time be free from artillery fire now have chance of active work thus a fire flashed from face of square men laughed joked be with regret that saw cuirassier fall back before charge of lord uxbridge cavalry for knew that moment screen be removed french artillery must open again ralph chief sensation be that of wonder that be alive so overwhelming be din so incessant rain of shot seemed to marvel how one must remain alive within range almost mechanically repeated order close up close up a square dwindled dwindled longed a impatiently a men for advance must have gladly charged against impossible odds rather than remain immovable under fire when order at length came did not hear just after storm of fire heralded advance of guard broke out round shot struck high up on left arm be conscious only of dull numbing sensation after knew more of what be taking place be pitch dark before became conscious fire be burning at

obliged if will take note from to gentleman named tallboy whom will find at hotel de l'europe give to if can will be glad to hear from about son how be going on so on for next few day ralph arm be exceedingly painful attended by certain amount of fever at end of time began to improve wound made steady progress toward recovery after staying for four day at brussels mr tallboy have returned home mr conway denis divided nursing between sitting up on alternate night fortnight after mr conway arrival ralph said now mother will be up to morrow can therefore be considered a fairly convalescent so there can be reason now why must not tell story about finding of will told in one of letter before christmas that mr tallboy have failed altogether so how did come to be found mr conway thereupon told story when came to point where have gone a servant to hall ralph interrupted with loud protest like mother like idea of having gone a servant stake be if have be at home have known certainly must not have let go not if there have be ten fortune to be gained by idea of having to go live a servant work for people like be horrid there be nothing very unpleasant about ralph have plenty to do to think about time passed great deal more rapidly than must have done if have be staying at home by must have be very lonely dull then can assure that considered hardship at being at hall must not interrupt in story if do will tell nothing more about until get home to england threat effectually sealed ralph lip beyond occasional exclamation said nothing until story be ended well be very wonderful mother said must never have thought for moment that be so brave must have put thing together like must have carried out such scheme be awfully glad have succeeded because have set mind on money will hope make quite comfortable how much be after mother never told that be half of mr penfold estate of money have invested be very large sum ralph although know how much estate why will make quite rich man never dreamed be anything like thought most likely be enough to continue allowance that said must make why mother be tremendous what becomes of other half be left to mabel withers ralph two divide everything that left well that certainly be rather hard upon sister ralph said blame for being against though of course be not right to keep will hidden mr penfold did not leave anything to because be very well provided for father left handsome sum at death a have be living at hall ever since can have spent nothing must be very amply provided for brother therefore naturally considered be perfectly at liberty to leave property a chose think miss penfolds have slightest reason to grumble after living a have done for last twenty year at brother expense of course make difference ralph agreed certainly did seem nice that mabel who be relation by blood to mr penfold must come into property that sister expected must be theirs of course now explain be different think in case ralph mr penfold must have left fortune to sister be man very averse to exerting own will be sure that submitted to rather than liked sister residence at hall know that considered justly that have once committed cruel wrong upon have in way spoiled life question whether really ever forgave see mother ralph said well now about must think there can be occasion for to continue in army unless like hope wo like ralph in
