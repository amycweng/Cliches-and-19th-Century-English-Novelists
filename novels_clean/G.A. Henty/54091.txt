enter into long conversation after four oclock prescott put aside law book be at friend service for rest of day first part of condition frank found easy enough to observe did not rise until late after have finished breakfast time occupied pretty well till be hour for going into prescott after lunch must take up novel light pipe make comfortable read for hour so presently must put book down begin to ask prescott question to entrap into lengthy conversation till arthur became quite desperate when frank must leave sally out to make round of call returning at six to go out to dinner with friend in evening prescott be safe from interruption a frank be almost always out at dance ball at house of numerous friend have met during travel be week after party at holls frost have broken up weather be raw cold arthur prescott be studying occasionally looking over with rather amused glance at friend frank having in vain tried to interest in novel have thrown down in disgust be gazing disconsolately out of window upon green lawn below at leaden coloured river beyond with black drifting barge busy little steamer hurrying past by jove prescott broke out at last be beastly climate of ours a how frank prescott asked quietly a how frank repeated irritably why in wind rain damp cold detestable last winter be in rome ah be there in summer frank of course not prescott one might a well live in oven with air blowing in from fever den quite so frank see other place have detestable point a well a ours frank maynard gave grunt of discontent again looked out of window at last turned round again what on earth be to do with prescott dear frank be afraid that question be likely to bring on long discussion in consideration of day more especially a see mean to let read will put away book for afternoon there good fellow frank said brightening up greatly wheeling fellow arm chair of one have be sitting in up to fire while prescott put book back into place on shelf done opened bottle of beer poured into large tankarda college trophy of prowess in boatingand lit pipe there thats comfortable frank said climate have advantage after now let talk seriously what in world be to do here have be back in england little more than three month two of have spent shooting now after month in london be bored out of life be hard case frank man with eight hundred year nothing to do to spend be out

up down rotten row must drive out of mind in week no when summer come will buy yacht of about twenty ton cruise about question be winter well frank a care have heard say for country sport really think must be worth while to think seriously of entering at bar of taking to literary work in fact making sort of aim for confess that a busy man can hardly conceive man having whole day on hand with nothing definite before dear fellow frank said despondently what on earth must be good of entering at bar must never readyou know that a well a do consequently must have more to do than have now with additional disadvantage of being obliged to dine so often in hall instead of being able to get dinner where like a to literary work thing simply absurd what on earth must write about when have fixed on subject what in name of goodness must have to say about upon word prescott suggestion be positively childish prescott shrugged shoulder smoked for time in silence presently took pipe from mouth asked suddenly why dont get married frank married dear prescott wish must not talk in light way of such serious business must a soon think of flying up to moon besides whom in world must marry go out to party ball flirt with dozen of girl never think more of do of just imagine one of face if be to say madam obedient servant be on look out for wife will supply deficiency frank laughed loudly prescott smiled then be quiet for time at last said with sort of effort there be one young lady with whom be at rate on intimate term mean of course miss heathcote alice frank exclaimed in great surprise now be about very last suggestion must have expected to hear from for upon word in three four time have be down there together since came back be so quiet andyou know what have sort of suspicion that be spoony there prescott coloured up hotly dear frank said gravely have very great esteem for miss heathcote think very loveable woman have deeper feeling for must only endeavour to lay aside a quickly a possible because know must not have remotest chance in world upon word now prescott dont see why alice be heiress dont know that money must be serious obstacle have one to consult if fancy why must not have be not speaking of money frank if miss heathcote loved must think nothing of money ialthough must far rather bring wealth to wife than must to still must be no great obstacle be speaking of herself know that must never care for so please let discus that part of question be speaking of in reference to yourself unless be greatly mistaken uncle must be very pleased if be to marry why must not do so well have thrown out hint only laughed thinking be joke upon word now prescott be too bad frank went on with air of great perplexity seems to that uncle have entered into sort of plot to marry to alice thank goodness though said cheering up alice be not in for have quite changed since came back again be awful friend formerly used to kiss regularly be a jolly together a possible when came back from abroad after being away two year of course kissed when met next time offered to do so must not have said that be great deal too old for sort of thing said that be cousin therefore be right proper answered quite sharply that be indeed nothing of sort altogether have be at time quite stiff formal not bit like what be before went away to continent be not in conspiracy upon word prescott quite frightened like other very wellvery much perhaps there be not slightest risk of of going further prescott shrugged shoulder with irritable impatience be very unusual to be angry with frank for careless indifference yet although told over over again that be sorry to see that friend be so blind how must help being glad to be new subject have thought over over till head ached with thought many time have seen year before how girl have looked up to frank have listened to schoolboy story college tale how have submitted to boy humour have made hero of to herself have noticed in last year before frank went abroad how girl feeling have grown intensified with own growth towards womanhood how flushed up when frank paid little attention how quickly resented whenever still treated a child have noticed how eagerly listened to be said about frank when be away at same time how shrank from appearing to pay most ordinary attention more than ever since frank return be prescott sure that alice heathcote loved le close le obtrusive watcher must not have seen prescott have deep stake in matter knew that loved alice with whole strength of nature have believed that have slightest chance of success must have yielded point of vantage even to friend frank have entered for prize have alice be neutral prescott must have told friend frankly that be rival fought matter out to last here must hing prize be given away winner be too indifferent to stretch out hand for true did not know that might be have for asking prescott a sat quietly for few minute after frank have spoken be thinking very deeply with whether ought to tell friend that be sure that be mistaken be interrupted by frank saying irritably wish to goodness prescott have never put notion into head be comfortable at home with alice before a have more idea of marrying than have of flying now will never get idea out of head wonder whether uncle have ever thrown out hint of idea to alice must not be surprised if have must account for what be saying about being cold stiff to naturally supposes want to make love to try a plainly a can to show that will have nothing to say to tell what prescott uncle with plan idea will end by making alice hate other frank got up walked up down room smoking pipe in short puff with air of extreme vexation prescott said nothing in reply be actually far more irritated much more puzzled than frank be must show irritation conflict of thought feeling be agitating presently frank stopped said there be only one thing in world do think must induce to marry alice what be frank prescott asked looking anxiously up at must marry rather than that must marry fred bingham be constantly there think be trying to make up to think that have chance prescott said quietly be always upholder of cousinwhat have changed opinion of dont think that anything have changed a far a be concerned prescott frank said sitting down again know be not sort of man believe just a much a did that be not bad hearted fellowfar from be have reason for believing otherwise see have be away for time cantankerous way come upon fresh never know whether be making fun of not doe try temper be know none of best most amazingly although know be only prejudice own like to see hanging over alice turning over leaf of music for sort of thing make somehow feel cold uncomfortable over a have said rather than that must marry must save from by marrying myself of course supposing that must have there be fear frank that will be called upon to sacrifice to prevent contingency happening miss heathcote may do be assured will never fall in love with fred bingham a for what say about feeling towards be not prejudice against be struggling be natural antipathy one of instinct nature give against what be dangerous bad know what felt about at cambridge must not agree with fought against idea instinct be too strong for will end by thinking like rest of prescott will not allow grant that

mr holl say tidied up john be smoking pipe with several visitor who have dropped in there be policeman perkins william holl wife too have come over for doe not happen to be one of night at meeting lastly there be mr barton that person however be certainly le welcome guest than others for john holl did not like man why must hardly say knew did not be at particular pain to conceal aversion mr barton never seemed to notice john rebuff periodically perhaps once in six month must come in smoke pipe with john holl have very often asked wife on whose good sense much relied what that chap barton meant by coming to see seemed comfortably off why must come in twice year to smoke pipe be thing must not understand for once sarah be quite unable to enlighten husband matter have fairly puzzled john wife many year have passed since john holl first made mr bartons acquaintance happened thus john have child then be much younger not quite so steady a have since become john temptation too be many for in discharge of occupation a dustman have sundry mug of beer offered to in course of day so chanced that one particularly warm summer afternoon being oppressed by heat john accepted several of offering have felt thirst noways abated thereby after work be done therefore went into public house to endeavour still further to wash dust from throat here somehow otherhe never must exactly recall causehe became involved in fierce dispute with man who be also engaged in quenching devouring thirst to settle difference of opinion adjourned into back yard end of be that john holl who have drunk more than opponent got considerably worst of first thing remembered afterwards be that be sitting on ground supported by mr barton good samaritan have entered public house just after john have espoused side in argument with great zeal now sprinkled water in face endeavoured to pour brandy down throat when have partially recovered mr barton in kindest manner sent for cab drove john to house there delivered over to tender care pity mingled with upbraiding of wife after came in several time to see how john be getting on when have a be got footing in house visit gradually became le frequent at last month passed by without seeing then greatly to astonishment have dropped in again from time six month so mr barton must pay visit greet john sarah a if have seen only day before reach long pipe down from mantelpiece seat in usual place next to james begin to smoke tranquilly husband wife have often wondered discussed much what must be possible motive in thus for seventeen year continuing periodical visit did not like man still have reason for telling so more especially a tried to make visit a acceptable a possible never failing to produce small bottle of spirit remarkingwith immovable face be impossible to questionthat have in pocket by accident to insist that must be drunk then there for child too always brought bag of cake lollipop so that to visit be noteworthy affair indeed served mr holl a specie of calendar reckoned date of household event for year past by baby have be born about month before bartons fourth visit back james have measles just about time of sixth visit so on indeed sarah must sometimes greatly mystify neighbour by method of reckoning be not till many year after commencement of disjointed intimacy john holl have found out who visitor really be have always supposed to be something in cityfor barton occasionally mentioned officebut did not even know in what part of london lived put down a being close man not given to talking about affair four year ago have made discovery in wise happened to be spending evening with john when mr barton have come in have said rather respectfully good evening mr barton mr barton have looked for moment decidedly taken aback recovering have said be off duty together to night brown brown being name by be known in private life after mr barton have sat smoking talking for time a usual when be gone told that mr barton be sort of private detective at john sarah have be astonished indignant what john said detective what doe mean by coming spying here haint nothing to be ashamed of mr brown may spy a much a like in house wont find nothing what be honestly paid for aint thief mr brown if find anything in binsand many silver spoon fork sort have found there in timewhen find give up why lor what good must be if didnt sairey must not so much a look at next time mr barton come here hell see what hell get for peeping spying just to think of sairey to think that while thought everyone knew john holl be honest man that time have have policemanno offence mr brownbut private policeman spying into doings dont thinkdo know john said after smoking meditatively for time dont think need trouble about bartons suspicion of honesty if there have be great robbery of plate must not make out how stuff have gone have taken away dust say early in morning dont know that might not suspect keep under eye lor bless must not have lasted more than few week at most aint nothing of sort may take solemn davey be rum start surely have often heard talk about mr barton who came in twice year never entered head a how be barton private detective well what doe come here for mr brown just tell that john holl said bringing heavy hand down upon table ill find out next time come name not john holl will punch head for mr brown detective detective there law against expect if come into house without even saying by leave smoked thoughtfully not paying much attention to what john holl said then remarked be certainly strange john barton be deep one there doubt of not bit sort of chap to waste minute of time without good reason for cant see what game be here what be mr barton mr holl asked be bow street runner said be turned out of force twelve year back call private detective now doe sort of thing in way say be a sharp a needle he got to bottom of several job have beaten people have heard though must not say so to one that play double sometime there that maynt be true see people be rather jealous of thats right enough mr brown still cant see what have be spying about here so long fortwelve yearsno morenigh upon thirteen be just about time when james poor mother came here be though policeman said then may take word for john come to keep eye on boy id bet gallon to pint know who boy be be paid by friend to let know if he alive how be getting on yes may depend upon thats about mark john holl wife looked at other in astonishment sarah be first to speak thats john sure enough like enough hell turn out rich man son get money yet must not think that mr holl no not if be policeman brown said must say chance now be worse than be before then day dont say be likely still there be might have be found out by accident who be now seems a if must know where be about dont want to acknowledge do anything for then theyre bad unnatural lot whoever be mr holl said indignantly poor lad cripple too way john if come to look after james must speak fair for who know perhaps day when be dying may be sorry for what have done year turn round send for be so policeman said let come go just a if thought nothing more of than before if good come of so much better if not visit wont have done harm so be settled since conversation mr barton have paid seven visit with usual punctualitythis be eighth hint be ever given by john sarah that suspected cause of coming to james have never spoken of what have passed for have gone to bed at time when discovery of mr bartons occupation be made agreed that be much better to say nothing to on subject for time little party talked on indifferent matter then cripple boy who be rather fond of attacking william holl brought up question of politics james have read much variously year that have be crippled have have other occupation have thought a well a read at ordinary time diction although better still resembled that of

to look back upon day william holl if dont watch said will be finding fine morning shut up between four wall voice of million can not be put down william holl said sententiously yes can uncle william james said when million dont happen to be united two three hundred thousand who be master who have armed force at command be perfectly unanimous history of world say otherwise in case uncle grant

unanimity have law on side troop police against mere mob be wave against rock french revolution james have taught power of people french revolution james laughed will never play game over here be slightest criterion for french people have reason on side have justice if not law people be tyrannised over to extent can hardly understand groaned under overbearing nobility with feudal power who looked upon a hardly human being condition be dreadful be nearly starving have something to fight for be not mere slave a be be starving french people groaned under so terrible tyranny that whole of middle class great proportion of clergy good many even of noble be at first with themin fact be revolution although in end people turned upon benefactor destroyed nobility clergy middle class people there be at commencement united with middle class at rate knew what be fighting for be sufficiently in earnest to be ready to give life for cause stand alone middle class be more bitterly opposed to than even upper have unity among yourselves lastly be fighting for know not whatfor chimera beg pardon james william holl said hotly be chimera universal suffrage be nature law man have right to voice in government now dear uncle be so like see get together dogmatise agree with other till lay down thing a law have existence except in own brain what do mean by great sounding phraseuniversal suffrage be nature law sound well what doe mean have meaning at alland if so be true let go back to state of naturesavage nature what will find chief governor be elected to rule nation will venture to say in tribe race of there be history be chosen by vote of man woman child be elected be now elected among savage tribe by wise men of nation object being to choose men most fitted for place so with government of ours when parliament be established be proposed that men most suited to rule nation must be chosen there be various way in might have be done way selected be that borough county must send so many member member be in day unquestionably selected by leading men in such borough county since foundation number admitted to privilege to speak more correctly number of upon whom responsibility of selecting representative devolves have largely increased until nearly man of intelligence energy having house can vote object of be to obtain good government be not that object attained do mean for instant to say that parliament such a must be elected under system of universal suffrage must be equal in intelligence in character in single point with present one failing to prove that whole argument fall to ground if under present state of thing found parliament legislating entirely for benefit of rich a against poor taking burden off own shoulder to lay on yours might well complain be not so burden on property be very great burden on very slight question come before can in way benefit working class have always full share of attention what reason therefore have to complain of who have vote not one half exercise inestimable privilege make so much fuss about not one quarter must do so unless canvassed worried bribed dear uncle a father say be very well a be let well alone there be something in what say james unquestionably republic in man have voice be happiest form of government theoretically may be uncle although must doubt jew tried fell back upon monarchy athenian tried there lasted till time of fall will find that house of assembly so to speak in athens be chosen by more limited proportion of people than have vote here besides if read domestic history dont think will conclude that be happy reputable one rome tried in earlier history real power be always in hand of patrician who chose consul who be king with name in rome a popular element became stronger so be government worse until nation took refuge under emperor england tried revolution fell into hand of cromwell who although ruled wisely well be far more despotic in power than king who preceded france tried cant say much for conduct of king mob there at last came to conclusion that emperor be better than mob law yes see uncle america america be young country have have since formation enemy near to try started with advantage what be result have pretty nearly universal suffragethat be man have votebut what be consequence find of use voting independently therefore bind to party have ticket given with list of name be bound to vote for look at congress sane man must compare for intelligence eloquence statesmanship conduct with own house of common besides above be president who be really very nearly independent of congress be indeed a despotic a european monarch while james have be speaking others have be smoking in silence mr barton be surprised although said nothing others be accustomed to talk be indeed far beyond age station when ceased there be moment silence then john holl said well spoken james spoken out like man ay clever man too dont quite know be

put bonnet on took leave including mr barton who have a be wont spoken very little who have listened attentively especially when james be speaking a if desirous of judging a far a possible of lad character chapter xii thwarted plan frank maynard have by mean forgotten what friend prescott have said to upon subject of alice heathcote have thought over constantly with increasing annoyance frank must have be easily led to do almost anything be one of worst men in world to drive considered to be attempt to force into marriage for have not least desire be more annoyed because be really very fond of alice in cousinly sort of way felt that must never again be upon same pleasant footing with a before have believed for instant alice regarded in other light than in thought of might have acted differently frank have not least personal vanity never entered mind that alice ever thought of except a sort of brother altogether be very unpleasant consequently stayed several day away from lowndes square instead of paying almost daily visit at last felt that must seem strange if did not go so started with uncomfortable feeling dogged resolution that if have least opportunity must enlighten uncle a to what own view upon subject be knowing captain bradshaws peppery disposition however have doubt that must be exceedingly irritated at finding wish thwarted in matter so very near heart on arriving at lowndes square found uncle alone in drawing room be large room with folding door on ordinary occasion stood open in cold weather be kept closed a captain bradshaw said large room made cold alice on part liked arrangement a back drawing room made sort of snuggery where must work paint undisturbed by visitor in front room frank found uncle well frank thought be lost where have be time be nearly week since be here frank said rather confusedly that have be good deal engaged nonsense engaged may be out of evening must surely manage to run down time in day to see frank knew that be one of captain bradshaws weak point that liked attention must bear anything better than being neglected so said that be sorry have let so many day pas without calling must come oftener in future be right frank captain bradshaw said mollified know dont see many visitor here brighten up be not for myself for alices sake that like to come down often ought to be more attentive there frank thought that be good opportunity to express opinion upon point said rather coldly really see uncle why must be specially attentive to alice think likely that interest in slightest degree a to coming going now captain bradshaw be just a anxious to have talk with frank upon subject a frank be for year marriage between nephew niece have be pet project have so thoroughly settled in own mind that believed be equally agreed that although actual love making might have taken place be sort of tacit engagement have often during frank absence joked alice about girl rising colour evasive answer more than ever confirmed in opinion since frank return however thing have not gone quite a have anticipated be not that doubted in least that be right for be good deal accustomed to have own way have beside old fashioned idea that in matter young people must do a elder recommend still frank be not so attentive a ought to have be under circumstance be captain bradshaws opinion now nephew have have fling sooner settled down married alice heathcote better have therefore quite made up mind to intimate wish to upon first opportunity hardly know what mean frank if be young man in place must think that must be only right proper under circumstance that must take good deal of interest in what did what do mean uncle by under circumstance frank asked shortly mean frank damme mean of course in relation in stand to other be nephew uncle harry alice be niece imagine that relationship between be something very slight pooh nonsense man captain bradshaw said irritably know what mean will put plainly for if like think natural that alice must feel interest in going on considering that be day going to be man wife man wife uncle what be thinking about alice have about a much idea of marrying other a have of flying damme sir captain bradshaw commenced fiercely will not get angry then continued in tone of concentrated rage showed far more than gesticulation must have done how angry be do mean to tell seriously frank maynard that intend to marry cousin alice heathcote most distinctly clearly uncle like alice exceedingly love almost a sister be dear good girl have not never have slightest intention of marrying captain bradshaw sat down must not trust to speak for time knew how passionate be that must be sure to say something must afterwards wish unsaid at last after great struggle with said quietly dear frank have upset sadly always thought be understood thing between have set mind on for year have planned hoped for what objection can have must make very happy be like son to alice like daughter why can not come together dear uncle frank said there be hardly anything must not do to give pleasure can hardly change present feeling for alice into love must give to wife be sorry very sorry that be disappointed never dreamed of such thing if have spoken about year sooner might have got to look upon in way be too late now always thought did understand frank have watched closely thought loved alice be quite sure alice captain bradshaw did not finish sentence for folding door opened suddenly alice heathcote stood among have not light of winter afternoon faded outthe room being only lit by deep red glow of firethey must have seen that face be very pale that cheek be still wet with tear however gave little time to notice for moved hastily forward stood between with back to fire so that face be in deep shadow then said trying to speak in playful tone in voice shook wavered little a began dear uncle if gentleman want to talk secret must not choose room with folding door through word can be heard not that be sorry heard what said in first place because have right to have voice in matter in be so much interested in second because be able to come in join voice to frank in asking to let go own way see uncle make very good cousin have inclination to exchange relationship for nearer one let have own way uncle can not make two people love other who have natural inclination way must not love better if be married than do separately captain bradshaw be silent for moment in astonishment then broke out damme alice if understand at always thought alice stepped forward laid hand upon shoulder murmured very low so that only must hear hush uncle for pity sake then more loudly see uncle unfortunately have be playing at cross purpose frank have be caring for other in brotherly sisterly sort of way wanting to be something else have along misinterpreted what saw now be dear kind uncle a always be let have own way just so uncle frank put in see have all be mistake be very glad that alice have overheard because have be able to assure that agrees with captain bradshaw be silent for moment then said softly to alice a kissed cheek be darling alice a for sir said turning fiercely upon frank opinion of sir be that be young fool yes sir damme thorough young fool with explosion of wrath captain bradshaw strode out of room slamming door behind frank gave long whistle upon word alice be too bad uncle harry be turning complete tyrant in old age idea of getting into passion because who have known other for last ten year be not going to fall in love with other at once to please be too absurd upon word very absurd frank alice said quietly now think have better go will go down pacify uncle frank took up hat paused a went towards door said hope did not say anything rude about alice know how much like a sister be obliged to protest against making man wife when know that of have such idea in head be not vexed alice not vexed at frank said quietly now please go frank went downstairs out into chilly evening air with strong feeling of discontent at thing in general whole thing be assured too ridiculous still somehow other did not feel a pleased a have expected now that affair be settled by time reached temple however have recovered usual good temper going straight up into prescott room sat down gave friend exact account of what have passed prescott listened with great attention when frank came to part where alice appeared upon scene prescott almost held breath to catch word murmured to dear alice dear brave girl when frank have done said now prescott just give opinion of be too bad be not do want honest opinion frank of course do prescott very well frank then will give agree entirely with uncle be fool thorough fool must have be very dangerous proceeding for anyone else than prescott to have expressed opinion of frank to face a be frank looked for moment a if inclined to be exceedingly angry glancing at prescott thoughtful face a looked into fire brow cleared again said at rate old man be fool to ask opinion for might have known beforehand what must be have a good a said be in plot with uncle advised to marry alice so be put out by finding that be ridiculously mistaken can only say that a must have doubtless acted so much more wisely in matter than have done wish have be in place wish to heaven have be frank prescott said with earnest sadness upon word wish have prescott for do believe that love alice although why if do must have be urging on to marry be more than can make out wished to marry frank because above thing must want to see happy then why in name of fortune dont marry make happy prescott because must not let frank pooh nonsense prescott know very well that doe not care for thank goodness therefore be more likely that may for prescott did not care to pursue subject farther for did not wish friend to see that felt serious interest in matter when frank maynard have left house in lowndes square alice heathcote did not for time carry out intention have expressed of going downstairs to pacify uncle a sat in low easy chair before fire not leaning back with figure bowed hand listlessly clasping other look of weary hopelessness upon face needed comfort too much to be able to dispense alice have suffered severe shock one of shock cast shade over whole life pain of rejectionor perhaps more properly speaking duration of painis in almost exact proportion to amount of hope be previously entertained instance be not wanting indeed where perfectly hopeless attachment have embittered whole existence who so suffered must have be endowed either with peculiarly sensitive organisation ill regulated mind be same thing in relation of life if man hope to attain large fortune by death of relation by fortunate speculation successful invention will form plan for future build greatly upon expectation will be great shock then when find that money be left to speculation invention turn out failure will not rankle in mind will not permanently affect whole career in life a must do have banker with whom have placed similar sum of money failed need certainty that strong belief be same a certainty to make loss of fortune failure of love dream cast permanent blight over life have alice heathcote doubted frank feeling for might still have loved truly might have dreamed happy dream built fairy castle of love happiness never must have quite given way to love must have known that dream be vision might never come true that castle be baseless fabric after have then found out that frank did not love must have felt a very great pain must have mourned over vanished dream ruined castle wound deep a might have be must have healed over in time left slight scar have believed believed surely that love be returned so have given whole heart nursed love until have become part of very being many thing have assisted to cause delusion for so many year almost ever since must remember have looked up to a protector adviser have always seemed fond of having sister of own have petted made very much of frank have warm kindly way about manner talk might very well deceive young girl into belief that affection be love while be abroad too have written so often so affectionately that judging feeling by own have believed that loved most of have be deceived by uncle manner talk little hint innuendo frequently threw out way in have seemed to consider that be settled thing have impressed with idea frank have spoken to upon subject before left england be only waiting until return to ask formally so have given whole heart trustingly confidingly be now terrible shock to find that have be mistaken after must not blame knew now that eye be opened that have never spoken looked a cousin thrown with a have be might not have done must blame for felt that must under circumstance have be next to impossible for not to have misinterpreted must only lament mistake feel with grief bitterness that bright hope dream have faded away that castle have seemed so solid have fallen that there be nothing to take place that dreaming hoping be over for light of life gone out for ever so sat there looked with dull pain into fire slight finger twined in out round other lip folded together to keep in cry of grief must hardly repress yet quivering restlessly while from time to time great tear rolled down from long lash for long while sat thus sometimes quite quiet at others swaying backwards forward at last when clock upon mantel struck six roused with weary sigh be almost wail passed hand slowly across forehead back over hair by temple then dropping listlessly by side passed out up to own room did not come downstairs until dinner be announced when did there be few sign upon face of hard struggle have gone through captain bradshaw on other hand have by mean recovered equability of temper be throughout dinner in state of explosion swore at footman in unusual way sent fiery message to cook until be a expressed so flustered did not know what be doing even footman accustomed a be to master outbreak felt aggrieved be just very image of indian tiger cook have be with good many year now never did know so awful cantankerous a be to day aint bad master captain noways flesh blood cant put up with not white flesh blood black might will tell in morning must provide elsewhere why didnt tell now cook asked sarcastically must right off dont think must now cook wouldnt no not if be to swear ten time wuss at he regular old tiger when temper up be if one be to say anything to must be dreadful business pretty nigh a much a one life be worth must say lor bless must think nothing of taking up poker candlestick soup tureen anything happened to come handy to at time what doe miss alice say to james be right down good one be footman said admiringly doe can to day he too fierce even for aint looking quite did try once twice to smooth down bit bless when he in such tantrum a be to day nothing short of strait waistcoat cold bath must smooth down while conversation be passing below alice heathcote be having by mean pleasant time of upstairs captain bradshaw have taken usual place by fire with port wine upon small table beside while alice sat down opposite with piece of fancy work in hand a excuse for idleness for little time after servant have left room there be silence then captain bradshaw after drinking off glass of wine pouring out said with great deliberation now alice will be glad if will give explanation of for damme if can make head tail of dear uncle alice said cheerfully dont know that there be anything to explain see frank want to marry other although believe that parent guardian have right to put veto upon marriage of approve confess think power extends to point of compelling two strongly objecting party to marry other captain bradshaw rubbed forehead with handkerchief then performed same operation with great violence over head brushing up short grey hair into state of wildest most aggressive looking confusion be not that be actually hot be trick have acquired in india be certain sign with of great irritation always looked upon a settled thing alice have set mind upon for year always felt sure that be fond of dont know what to make of if do care for alice by gad will marry at rate will be made most thoroughly to understand that not one penny of money will ever have if doe not thank very much uncle alice said smiling quietly see must not particularly care about being married to man who only took a incumbrance with money yours alice uncle said impatiently understand why took part to day so rendered said of avail be sure cared for never attempted to deny when spoke to upon subject now upset force of argument confirm that young jackanapes in refusal to listen to wish by saying that be mutually indifferent to other dear uncle alice said very gravely whole of unfortunate position have be brought about by deceiving in first place in second by very unfair unjustifiable way in have deceived upon word alice captain bradshaw said astonished at sudden attack upon replacing untasted upon table wine be in act of raising to lip understand what mean be what mean uncle along thought hoped that frank must day take fancy to other about have reason to complain that deceived into believing that thing be turning out a wished what be wrong in dear uncle be to have spoken to a did about frank what must think must not suppose possible that be doing so merely upon strength of hope upon subject naturally concluded that be in confidence that have talked matter over before left england that although might have thought wrong to ask to enter upon engagement at age of eighteen just a be leaving england for two three year still that perfectly intended to propose for upon return what else must think uncle captain bradshaw be silent felt that have be wrong without sufficient cause have led niece to believe that frank loved have thus greatly endangered happiness of favourite once feeling to be wrong one must be more ready to admit than captain bradshaw upon word alice said earnestly never looked upon in light see that what say be true have behaved like old fool a be in matter even now may not be too lateeven now may be able to persuade frank dear uncle forget must not accept under such condition beside that few men be le likely to be persuaded forced in matter of sort than frank be must be folly upon part to pretend like very much always believed that cared for daresay have be very attentive when returned made pretty speech behaved well must not have thrown serious obstacle in way of fulfilment of pet project a be find now have be mistaken all along a to whole affair have to do be to make a comfortable a possible under circumstance be afraid have done great deal of harm old man said sadly can only say that did not do wilfully for certainly deceived a much a did be very poor consolation to when reflect that thoughtless folly have made miserable not miserable uncle alice said speaking a cheerfully a must though have very hard work to prevent from breaking down going off in fit of cry not quite so bad a that have be little shock for will soon get over please speak about more at rate frank be not to blame in matter must not renew with without letting out that have be deceiving about must of course be very painful for to know that even guessed that be so so saying alice went across kissed uncle be settled then ay ay alice see that can say to have made so much mischief that least can do be to let have own way now a for frank repeat what told to daythat be thorough fool not to have fallen in love with dearest best girl in world alice be satisfied for have gained more than have anticipated knowing well how obstinate uncle be when have once set mind upon anything indeed be only thought that pain knew alice must be feeling be caused by own error made captain bradshaw a sort of reparation give up long cherished plan hope so a far a taking active measure be concerned matter dropped not from thought of captain bradshaw must not forgive frank at once for having thwarted plan made alice unhappy must forgive for share have taken in affair for although alice tried hard to seem cheerful when with unclethough talked more smiled more frequently than have be wontshe must not deceive now that be really watching voice be not always steady under command spoke in forced way very unlike former merry talk above smile never went farther than lipsnever lit up rest of face over cloud have fallen be difficult to say what change be be a if light have suddenly gone out uncle tried to be very kind to at time did not make matter easy for very tone of kindness commiseration in spoke to be in trial while with one else be so terribly bad tempered that made life of around burden to frank called few day afterwards captain bradshaw hardly spoke to frank have made up mind that uncle must be allowed time to work off disappointment appeared to take notice of chatted with alice a usual first visit of frank be great trial to alice have at least satisfaction of knowing that did not even guess what state of heart be be therefore able to get on with better than have expected to have done at first too frank made call a short a possible for with uncle in state of extreme irritation be by mean pleasant visit after fortnight so captain bradshaw began to calm down thing gradually resumed old footing except alice still looked pale wan voice be no longer to be heard singing snatch of old ballad a moved about house of frank knew nothing put down altered look partly to annoyance conceived that have to bear from uncle temper be after one of visit said to prescott think prescott must be great thing if be to go away for little have be thinking on way back that if be to write to teddy drake offer to pay visit must be very good fun must give uncle time to get into better temper a long a be in town must call regularly that keep sore open whereas if go away only for fortnight will calm down little will be very glad to see teddy too for have not seen since came back think be very good plan
