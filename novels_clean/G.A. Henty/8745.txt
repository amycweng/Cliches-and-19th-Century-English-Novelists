countryman ran against by accident wulf said looking up fearlessly in prelate face apologized though know not be more in fault than instead of taking apology a one of gentle blood must do spoke like churl threatened with chastisement then did say that hoped other norman in land must day be packed across channel ear ought to be slit a insolent varlet meant insolence lord bishop a to slitting of ear fancy earl harold master must have something to say on score prelate be about to reply glancing at angry face of growing crowd said coldly will lay matter before come walter enough of be also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously apology of saucy page crowd fell back with angry muttering a turned followed by walter fitz urse ecclesiastic made way along street to principal entrance of palace without waiting to watch departure wulf saxon page pushed way through crowd went off at full speed to carry message with have be charged king be good king squarely built

of honest english be spoken in palace norman castle be rising over land favourite divide among territory of english earl thane who incurs king displeasure be not for earl harold one might a well be under norman sway altogether nay nay neighbour ulred matter be not so bad a dare say must have be a say have not be for earl godwin son be great check that godwin gave when returned after banishment norman bishop noble hurried across sea in panic for year now king have left matter in hand of harold be well content if only can fast pray like monk give thought treasure to building of yonder abbey want monk norman over smith said roughly still le one who be norman monk must rather have dane like canute who be strong man firm one than king who doubt not be full of good intention be holy pious monarch who be not strong enough for ruler leaf to to preserve england in peace to keep in order great earl of mercia north to hold land against harold of norway sweyn others above to watch norman across water monk be well enough in convent truly 't be bad for country to have monk a king there have be war loving prelate ulred men a ambitious a of great earl more dangerous because have learning ay there have be great prelate smith agreed look at lyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin king owed throne be englishman first bishop afterwards be proof if needed that man can be great churchman great patriot statesman too be rather than godwin who overcame opposition of danish party got witan at last to acquiesce in choice of london wessex to give vote to edward well be did so for have failed must have have a great struggle in england a when alfred battled against dane of london men of wessex under great earl be bent upon being ruled by prince of own blood last two danish king have shown that anything be better than being governed by northman be lyfing who persuaded earl of mercia to side with wessex rather than with northumbria since lyfing what great englishman have have in church bishopric be granted by edward to norman priest until godwin son got upper hand after exile since then most of have be given to german must seem that king be so set against englishman that only by bringing in foreigner can harold prevent preferment going to norman what be consequence say now that church be governed from rome whereas before edward time englishman did not think of taking order from italy there will trouble come of neighbour perhaps not so long a edward reign at death there be one of royal race surviving like edward have lived life abroad there can be doubt what choice of englishman will be harold have be real ruler for year be wise politic a well a brave great general be own earl will assuredly be chosen then will have trouble with norman already bear a if be master will not give up hold without struggle men say that william duke make secret of hope to become master of england in case god help wo come a long a harold life englishman can wield sword battle axe a for have patched many norman suit of armour by st swithin will have far more pleasure in marring than have ever have in mending know who be boy who have contention just now norman be page of william norman bishop know more of than that other be wulf who be ward page of earl harold father be thane of steyning in south sussex one of godwin men at death two year ago harold took lad into household for bore great affection for gyrth who have accompanied in pilgrimage to rome fought by side when conquered welsh be there gyrth got wound at last brought about death wulf have be to smithy many time sometimes about matter of repair to arm more often think to see son osgod have seen once twice in calling at shop when one day osgod who be somewhat given to mischief be playing at ball drove into face of son of one of norman lord at court boy drew dagger there must have be blood shed wulf who be passing at time saw that thing be pure mishap not result of set intention threw between there be great fuss over for boy took tale to father who demanded that osgod must be punished must doubtless have gained end have not wulf spoken to earl harold who intervened in matter persuaded norman to let drop since then boy have be great friend in way osgod be year older than young thane have already made up mind to be man when grows up have got to agree to though must rather that have stuck to handicraft still prospect be not bad one harold will be king of england wulf will be powerful thane will doubtless day hold high place at court a seems to have taken real liking to osgod boy may have good chance wulf will make good fighting man one of day harold see that page be well instructed in arm two boy often have bout with blunted sword when wulf come to smithy by faith though have taught osgod already us arm well young thane be fully match for must hardly believe that boy can read a well a monk be so earl harold know think good deal of education have founded college at waltham persuaded wulf father to send there indeed will take none a page unless can read see not what good reading can do to most men doubtless for one who be at court may hold day high post there be useful to be able to read deed grant of estate instead of having to trust others interpretation wondered to see press forward so suddenly into crowd neighbour seeing that be busy man understand now that have interest in affair have be holding in readiness if norman boy drew dagger to give blow across wrist with cudgel that must be long before handled weapon again fear wulf have got into trouble bishop will doubtless complain to king of language used by one of harold page though earl be well able to see that harm come to lad be likely will send away to estate for time for strives always to avoid quarrel dispute though will not give way jot in matter where seems to that good of realm be concerned will go much farther length than most men must do in way of conciliation look how have borne with tostig with earl of mercia seems to have animosity in nature be ready to forgive injury a soon a pardon be asked smith be not far wrong in opinion a to what be likely to happen a soon a wulf returned to palace be told that earl desired presence proceeded at once to apartment where harold transacted public business be hall of considerable size floor be strewed with rush three scribe sat at table to earl dictated reply decision on various matter brought before when saw wulf enter rose from seat beckoning to to follow pushed aside hanging across door leading to apartment behind went in wulf have fear whatever of severe consequence to from quarrel with walter fitz urse be ashamed that thoughtlessness must have given slightest trouble to earl for popular a be among class of men in southern england harold be object of love a well a respect to dependent indeed to who came in close contact with earl be now forty one year of age be very tall be considered strongest man in england face be singularly handsome with expression of mingled gentleness firmness bearing be courteous to united frank straightforward manner with polished address rare among rough countryman harold have travelled more farther than englishman of age have visited foreign court mingled with people more advanced in civilization than be of england normandy be century ahead of mass of countryman be ardent advocate of education strong supporter of national church upholder of right of men although occasionally gave way to burst of passion be of singularly sweet forgiving disposition king edward be respected by people because coming after two utterly worthless king have earnest desire for good although desire seldom led to very active result be member of own royal house be deeply religious life be pure simple although taste sympathy be with land in have be brought up englishman forgave because at least be saxon while predecessor have be dane while respected edward for real ruler felt passionate admiration be worthy representative of be best in saxon character possessed in eminent degree openness of nature frank liberality indomitable bravery endurance of hardship distinguished race be earl of west saxon a such have special claim to fealty london be true did not lie in earldom in of brother leofwyn leofwyn harold be a one true brother in heart in disposition gentleness courtesy of manner that although natural have be softened increased by harold contact with foreigner be not only pardoned admired because be england champion against foreigner have fought victoriously alike against norwegian dane of northumbria welsh struggled a sturdily though peacefully against norman influence in england already dread of norman preponderance be present in mind of englishman be secret that in early day edward have held out hope if have not given actual promise to william of normandy that must succeed of late king have be somewhat weaned from norman predilection have placed unreservedly in harold hand giving to latter real power while confined to discharge of religious exercise to supervision of building of abbey varied occasionally by hunting expedition for still retained passionate love of chase men knew that warlike duke of normandy must not be likely to forget promise trouble might come to england from over sea harold then not only regarded a present ruler a future king a national leader champion edward have child royal house be extinct save for edward atheling who like present king have lived life abroad must have sympathy with englishman there being then one of royal house available who harold head of great house of godwin earl of west saxon virtual ruler of england must be chosen english king although generally selected from royal house ruled rather by election of people a declared by representative in witan than by hereditary right prince next in succession by blood might at death of sovereign be called king be not really monarch until elected by witan formally consecrated have be nine month after have be acclaimed to throne by people of london that king edward have be elected king by witan formally enthroned thus then fact that harold did not belong to royal family mattered little in eye of englishman to belonged right of choosing own monarch if chose who be to say nay wulf felt uncomfortable a followed stately figure into inner room faced earl a door closed behind with a fearless look a with have stood before haughty prelate of london slight smile played upon harold face a looked down upon boy be troublesome varlet wulf lord bishop have be making serious complaint of to king say that brawled with page walter fitz urse that used insolent word against countryman that even withstood what have to say to brawling be on part of bishop page not of mine lord be running out to carry message with charged to ernulf of dover when ran against fitz urse be not fault pure mischance nevertheless expressed regret in fitting term instead of accepting spoke insolently talked of chastising put hand on hilt of dagger then lord grew angry too why must page of earl harold submit to be thus contemptuously spoken to by young norman who be page of upstart bishop whom if lordship will give permission must right willingly fight with sword other weapon doubtless in anger did not speak respectfully of walter countryman for be sorry since have be ground of complaint of trouble to in fact wulf spoke a quarrelsome boy not a page of one who have care of kingdom on shoulder whose great desire be to keep peace between party earl put in gravely for first time wulf hung head be wrong lord be wrong wulf be not good always to say what think a page must bear in mind that here at court behoves to behave to speak not a headstrong boy a one whose word may rightly wrongly be considered a echo of may have heard from now to third charge that withstood prelate matter in king eye be very serious one bishop must give ear to nought have to say listened to own page account not to mine when said in defence that though did use word about norman did so merely a one boy quarrelling with other said ought to have ear slit surely lord free born thane be not to be spoken to even by norman bishop a if be norman serf only replied that before there be slitting of ear lordship must have say in matter so far admit did withstand bishop see not how must have made other reply must have be better to have held peace altogether wulf must lord must also surely have be better have bishop abstained from talking about slitting ear must have be better also two wrong make right be present when bishop made complaint upon inquiring more into matter version be somewhat similar to yours then pointed out to that if holy bishop lost temper used threat be beyond power to carry into effect must not be too severe upon boy who forget respect due to office nevertheless admitted that be wrong promised king who be perhaps more disturbed by incident than there be occasion for must take to task seriously that to avoid further brawl between young fitz urse must for time be sent away from court did on agreement that bishop must on part admonish walter fitz urse against discourteous behaviour unseemly brawling have known that have put hand on dagger must have gone further have witness that did so yes lord saw smith ulred among standing by doubtless must see action be well harold said will acquaint bishop with fact when tell have ordered to leave for estate at steyning that if page denies have witness to prove truth of assertion think in case will be glad to drop matter for be to mention fact to king who have horror of drawing of weapon must order walter fitz urse to be sent back to normandy so exile be not likely to be of long duration understand wulf be not seriously angered with in matter be boy one can not expect that will behave a prudent man remember lad even boy word may do mischief especially when placed a be there may come time when will show by deed not by word feeling against norman till then bear prudently saxon be over given to hasty word be fault a men know have love for norman one have heard speak against king love a be natural seeing that be brought up amongst have not withstood wish in matter trying only that certain amount of preferment in land must be bestowed upon who be owner not stranger to tongue will ride afternoon for steyning wulf hope will not be long before be back again if have own way in matter must think that sufficient have already be said done in so trifling matter a boy quarrel a have be brought before king by bishop be in king eye serious business for assuredly must have borne reproof from william of london more meekly than did having therefore become church matter be altogether beyond power to interfere at rate short sojourn on estate will do harm be sometime since be there be good thing that lord of soil must be well known by over whom be placed wulf bowed deeply withdrew prospect of visit for few week even month to steyning be not terrible one be year since have stayed there for time have be two year at waltham since father death have be for most part with harold thought of unrestricted life of spending time a chose hunting hawking going about among tenant be by mean unpleasant be quite satisfied that harold be not seriously angered with for anything else cared little a understood that duty a page be at present at end thought must first call upon ulred smith to ask if have seen walter fitz urse handle dagger also to tell osgod that be going away for time found smith at work good morning master wulf though be not first time have seen today for be at hand when have that quarrel with norman page yes caught sight of face ulred be about have come to bishop have made complaint against to king earl harold have ordered to go down to steyning for time of course acted wrongly in speaking a did to bishop so far a walter fitz urse be concerned maintain did wrong told lord a much that norman put hand upon dagger earl said that if must prove that must benefit case told that have seen close by that did not know whether saw page do assuredly did smith replied have cudgel in readiness to tap on wrist if have drawn dagger must testify same before king edward thank ulred will tell lord so be sorry be to be sent away from court be bad job master wulf osgod here will miss greatly that will lad said must not take down with young master must teach there how to comport a squire so when time come that need one must know duty besides must practise on with sword battle axe must not do much in way of teaching osgod seeing a yet be learner must be glad in truth to have with must be good for to keep up practice in arm will feel almost like stranger there must like to have one know with must ask harold to let have horse for from stable where have two three score doing nothing with favour sir must rather trust to own foot be stout walker though will not be able to keep up with think that night can get to hostelrie where may put up if not matter little can make way after join there be if father will give permission to go may a well go sooner a later smith said since have taken into head that will be master wulf man see not that will benefit remaining in forge know enough now to mend broken rivet to do such repair to helm armour a may be needed on expedition therefore if young thane be minded to take have naught to say against then so will be wulf said will see lord harold before start will tell that be minded to be man that be minded so to take will not object be sure be best to ask since when return to court will have about when do start master wulf be ordered to go to day therefore a soon a have seen earl again will be off where will sleep to night will ride to guildford afternoon then have better lay aside hammer at once osgod smith said don fresh clothes make best suit into bundle start without delay be ten o'clock may be at guildford before sunset 't be thirty mile eight hour walking will take there if young thane tell that lord harold make objection to taking can turn face backward to morrow harm will be done will overtake before be half way osgod can then take up behind on horse now will go back to palace may have to wait time before can see earl harold from sunrise to sunset have few moment to will have to watch time to get word with be not indeed until two o'clock in afternoon wulf have chance of speaking to duke then seeing that be for moment alone entered room stood with bowed head waiting for harold to address so have come to say good bye wulf latter said kindly be best so boy time in country will do good there will be much for to do down there have ordered two of men to be in readiness to mount ride with for must not that must go unattended one of will bear message from letter under hand to steward will tell that although will of course remain a ward until come of age be in respect to be treated a if be already sworn man thane must be well if must gather among tenant twenty stout men a house carls steward be ordered to pay to money may require to account for to when sends in checker

arm be one of own house carls will remain with will instruct men in arm teach to fight shoulder to shoulder there may be bad time ere long be upon trained troop not upon hasty levy that must most depend in time trust will be able to place fifty such men in field at present twenty will suffice have aught to say to before go yes lord first to thank for kindness to say will carry out instruction secondly to tell ulred smith saw walter fitz urse handle dagger be standing ready to knock from hand did draw lastly that ulred son osgod who be stout lad year older than for age well accustomed to arm desire to be sworn a man to serve in hall in field like much have almost daily practised with in arm must be glad to have with if see objection not at wulf be well that man must have at side one in whom can altogether trust be of gentle blood simple man at arm then may take down with lord yes if plea can ride not a yet lord will see that be instructed down at steyning started to walk morning understanding that if refused permission to be man must at once return will overtake on road bid one of escort take up behind earl said like spirit see that be fittingly apparelled will hear from ere long hour later wulf mounted with two follower rode from westminster chapter ii country life far from being depressed wulf felt spirit rise a rode away on banishment from court for instead of feeling disgrace regarded a step forward in life earl harold must certainly have be so inclined have smoothed down angry prelate must have retained at court by way have spoken wulf be convinced that earl let go because thought that be good for to be away for four year have be under tutelage first at waltham then at court in last position life have indeed be pleasant one for a one of harold page have mixed with noble youth of court have have place at festive gathering still have be page treated a boy now be to go forth to learn duty a father successor harold steward who have since thane death acted a earl agent in management of estate must instruct doubtless in civil duty while soldier who rode behind must teach how to lead men in battle how to make fighting force of estate efficient beyond duty time must be own must have responsibility must be responsibility of thane towards tenant not of page towards master be going away boy if pleased harold that must remain away for two year must return thane young one indeed one who have learned duty of station who if need be must take place in field of battle at head of follower for even putting aside norman from whom earl seemed to think greatest danger must come there be never long cessation of fighting in england there be welsh who be always turbulent dane of northumbria who be still distinct people although throughout rest of england identity be fast being merged into of saxon there be norseman still ready to take opportunity of interfering in affair of england if none offered to plunder harry coast there be earl of mercia who bore great love to house of godwin who resented ascendency of west saxon lastly there be harold brother tostig fiery turbulent noble now earl of northumbria who be jealous of harold ever ready to join in plot in close alliance with norway already have several time withstood royal authority must assuredly again become fomenter of trouble must see favourable opportunity at king death if not before opportunity must be sure to present must be certainly chosen king by people of london by west saxon almost a certainly must claim be disputed by earl of mercia on one hand by tostig dane on other wulf be sure therefore that work spent in preparing tenant to take field when called upon to do so must not be wasted full of thought rode for mile from westminster without addressing to two men behind

court swagger there a if englishman be dirt under foot moreover love not london way will be glad to be down again among honest country folk though must still rather be following lord earl in field master gurth will stay down at steyning be long one indeed have to bear master wish instruction to steward to stay for few day to see that be carried out according to desire be not like leof for prefer life in london where one meet with learned monk others can obtain sometimes use of choice manuscript can hear news from beyond sea whereas in country there be nought to talk about save beef sheep like journey well enough though must that animal bestrode be more gentle in pace have for last half hour be fretting on rein to place by side of yours horse be well enough for noble fighting men

hitherto regarded monastic life a one of work for good of poor a affording for who wished tranquil retirement from trial of world moreover offered special attraction to of quiet studious taste since

west saxon griffith of wale be still restless turbulent lastly there be ever present menace of norman duke have be united must have laughed at pretension of duke of normandy with northumbria ready at moment to break into civil war with mercia doubtful claim of normandy however shadowy indefensible must not be considered a grave element of danger listening to talk of monk wulf learned much more a to actual situation than have done in court of normanized king feeling of patriotism became more more developed strengthened while applied with even greater ardour to military exercise a recognized

osgod there be so much to learn wish to grow up mere beer swiller like edmund of angmering ethelred of arundel life be a far a can see whit higher more worthy than of own serf from whom differ only that eat more drink more sleep on softer bed earl harold expects better thing than of want to make worthy of being one of in whom can place confidence on whom can depend in case of trouble have heard say how bad be for england that thane be in learning culture so far behind noble of other country that if england be ever to take place among great nation must be by thane first raising to level of noble abroad who be counsellor of king can never hope to be anything like earl harold who be wisest greatest of englishman do hope so to fit that day may think worthy of trust confidence well master osgod said lazily one to liking hope to be good soldier true servant a for thinking learning must weary to death chapter iii at court two month after wulf have gone down to steyning one of harold men

tolerate presence at court order bishop obeyed with very bad grace at rate lad be sent away by ship week later after bishop have left audience chamber king said that be afraid have acted with harshness to a seemed that fault be by mean wholly on side must at once recall if wished to do so thanked majesty dutifully said thought be best in way for time must remain away from court in first

scarcely have be more erect regular have never seen anything at like on land then must be something formed by sea wulf do see cavern at foot of cliff in place see there be mound of rock a if newly formed may be that white stone be soft that sea beating against foot wear away in time then rock overhead give way by weight so leaf upright wall perhaps long back hill be like other hill sloping gradually down into sea in time perhaps many many year before roman landed here sea began to eat away have continued to do so ever since until be a see may be so beorn father have told that must remember when estate stretched good half mile farther seaward have since be eaten away by wave say that father have told same thing therefore a say in many hundred of year even hill if stone be soft might also be worn away there be rounding point beyond there be more cliff doubtless be in bay that shipmaster edred think to anchor at moment conversation be cut short by tremendous gust of wind rushing down sloping hill into bay striking with such terrible force that ship heeled over until water rushed above bulwark men be thrown against other several fell down to leeward confusion be heightened by fact that great sail be loosely furled to yard burst rope wind catching buried craft still further must have filled sunk have not ship master seized tiller aided by two sailor there pushed up so boat head payed off from wind ran before master shouted to men to lower sail be bellying flapping violently before order must be obeyed there be crash mast snapped off at sling of yard wreck fell over bow of boat hand be employed for minute in getting sail on board furling to yard be laid lengthways along thwart be found that three men standing in bow have be killed several others badly hurt vessel be by time distance from shore nothing must be done until be freed of water with be nigh half full hand be employed in bailing out squall have increased rather than lessened in fury by time water be cleared out be two mile from headland order be then given to man oar again be found that several of have be lost having be washed away when men leapt up believing that boat must capsize have slipped from rowlock unnoticed while be engaged in getting in sail be serious misfortune for oar be needed to force through water in teeth of wind be blowing directly off shore remaining oar be double banked harold thane taking place among rower for hour laboured hardest at end of time be farther from shore than when began force of wind acting on poop broad hull driving seaward faster than rower must force shoreward sea too be now getting up motion of vessel rendered increasingly difficult to row edred left place at tiller went forward to harold lord said be useless in spite of effort be drifting farther farther out from look of sky fear that be going to have great gale there be nothing to do to set little sail to run before maybe there will presently be shift of wind may enable to make for shore at present be exhausting yourselves in vain sea will soon get up so much that will be impossible to use oar so be harold replied at master order oar be laid in men prepared to get sail upon sailor climbed up mast fastened stay close to point be broken off then joined block be lashed to mast just below stay halliard be rove through then edred brought out small sail be hoisted vessel have before be rolling heavily began to glide swiftly through water have have satisfaction of seeing that consort although like nearly capsized by squall have suffered no damage after lowering sail yard to deck have succeeded in rowing into bay lighter hull draught enabling oar to drive through water in teeth of wind be going along finely now wulf said yes beorn agreed before night there be like to be sea will try harold held consultation with master presently men be called to work great sail be unrolled from yard portion cut off somewhat wider than beam of boat in length reaching from bow to mast nail hammer be brought up from little cabin canvas be stretched from bulwark to bulwark strongly nailed to wood on side oar being first lashed across at short interval to support suppose be for to lie under master wulf osgod said be pity be not erected before for there be not man on board who be not drenched to skin be not put there to keep dry osgod to keep wave from coming into ship go over well wind be getting up osgod will have great sea presently then why turn sail back again seems to to be folly to be running away from land if such be going to be weather how can sail back again do not see that be wind be blowing off vessel must go a wind take one can go little way that man ever yet sailed in teeth of wind be first time have ever be to sea osgod said trust will be last tossing of ship make strangely giddy many of servant be downright ill with why men must go on water when can walk upon land be more than can say think will go lie down under shelter of sail for indeed feel a if be about to die wulf be feeling strangely uncomfortable a long a have be at work have not felt unwell for necessity of holding on to bulwark rope excitement of strange position have saved from experiencing many qualm beorn be soon glad to follow osgod example to lie down on board under rower bench fiercer fiercer blew wind more more violent became motion of ship mass of water fell on canvas forward a plunged into wave must have soon beaten in have not be for support of oar by evening most of men be lying under shelter while harold brother friend have retired to little cabin in stern earl remained by side of ship master who have taken place close to tiller be worked by four men think that will weather edred have little fear about lord be staunch boat have be aboard in sea a heavy a besides that thought of yours of stretching canvas across bow have greatly improved chance water run off a fast a fall on none come on board have not be for man must have have to bail night have fear of weathering gale what be afraid of be that if wind continues to blow will assuredly be lost on coast of normandy must be ill fortune indeed for know that norman count be cast on shore a lawful prey even if reach land in safety escape murder at hand of lord of soil people may fall into hand of duke william who be assuredly friend of mine seeing stand in way of design upon throne of england truly be evil moment when thought of taking to sea occurred to must give broad slice of earldom to be back at bosham hour by hour wave increased in size violence often poured in over side number of men on board be too great for to work effectively therefore be divided into two party one being engaged in bailing while other lay under cover change being made hour wulf preferred working to lying still for a craft rolled water washed over while din of wave striking ship side cataract of spray falling on to canvas above be deafening be impossible to get moment sleep be glad when morning broke although scene met eye be reverse of comforting small a be amount of sail vessel tore through water under pressure of following wind great wave with white crest pursued a neared stern seemed to wulf that must inevitably fall over crush spray torn from crest by wind filled air wind shrieked in cordage vessel creaked groaned a rolled from side to side must not have believed if have not seen that sea must be so violent ill behaved wulf shouted to osgod who be then standing beside if clothes be dry stomach full must not mind so much osgod replied to be drenched in water night to have nought to eat in morning take courage out of one mightily how long think will go on one can say may last two three day food time osgod exclaimed in dismay must stand well enough osgod think there be much chance of being called upon to do so for heard one of sailor say that unless storm abates marvellously be likely to be cast upon french coast before must be glad to be cast anywhere so be out of at least whether be france england there must be food to be have on shore understand osgod unless happen to be cast upon shelving coast with sand gravel craft may be dashed to piece lose life for assuredly none must swim long in such sea a well must hope that will find shore such a speak of osgod said tranquilly for part be content to take risk rather than wait three day before getting anything to eat must rather fast for week than run risk of ship being broken up on rock wulf replied can swim little even in calm water be sure must hing among wave can swim will look after osgod said confidently used to swim day in thames wulf shook head daresay might look after if fell into thames osgod be very different thing in sea like wave must dash swimmer hither thither a if be chip of wood besides spray must smother even at height above water be difficult to breathe when one turn round face wind think that only hope lie in running upon flat shore where wave will wash vessel up so high that may be able to leap out from bow on to land beyond reach of fury late in afternoon one of sailor on poop astern shouted out that land be visible be not long before must be seen from deck eye be directed anxiously towards be rocky coast edred said rock be not high if can manage to direct vessel between two of may escape at present be needful that most of crew must keep in stern when be about to strike must run suddenly forward so a to leap out a soon a touch ground there will be little time given to for assuredly sea will batter to piece moment fall among rock harold issued order be to remain at post until gave word be then to run forward master scanned shore anxiously see lord that opening right ahead of seems to barely width of ship if can direct truly between rock methinks that most of crew will gain land will myself take helm be duty right must not succeed in making shore will at least die well contented with thought that who be hope of england will be saved must fain stay with edred that can not be lord a be duty to stay by ship to last so be first duty to save life for england need aid for vessel steer well by help of rope round tiller can manage alone farewell lord if be not to meet again on earth very few minute will decide fate swimming will be of use there osgod wulf said look how spray dash against black rock thought not that must be so bad osgod replied wonder master doe not cast anchor rope must not hold for moment wulf said when broke might drift broadside on to rock must mean destruction for master be steering for narrow opening between two great rock ahead will be two three minute now before fate be decided at moment harold shouted let man make peace with god baring head stood silently for minute two imitated by on board then harold again raised voice in shout be heard above storm move forward now of not further forward than mast for if head be too far down master must not hold straight moreover mast will assuredly fall forward crush in front of therefore let man go forward of until ship strike sailor have already cut away canvas stretched across bow on board clustered just aft mast wulf looked back saw master standing alone on poop with eye fixed in front of look of grim resolve on face then turned again to look ahead scene be terrible on side extended long line of white foam great mass of water be hurled against rock with thundering crash spray flew high up into air then caught by wind be carried far inland rock be now few length ahead passage between looked terribly narrow so narrow that doubted if ship must possibly pas through not word be spoken on board a ship neared opening now swerved little to one side now little to other a wave lifted stern swept along hand of master checked immediately brought head back to line be length away from passage when there be crash shook from stem to stern then great wave lifted wulf saw black wall of rock gleaming with water streamed down wall of rock flashed past bulwark so closely that must have touched moment later ship struck again time with force threw many off foot while mast fell over bow then once more lifted shot few foot further then struck with tremendous force remained stationary there be grinding splintering of plank a men rushed forward then wave swept over vessel carrying on deck before into cove beyond rock rolling over over up sandy shore behind managed to dig hand foot into sand to scramble out more be sucked back again by receding water a wulf found in water felt arm clutched osgod shouted in ear struggle can keep up when thrown up on sand wulf tried in vain to resist backward rush of water osgod be borne out again when next wave again swept up wulf saw earl standing knee deep in water a be swept past harold seized osgod with tremendous strength lifted right out of water keep still shouted weight will help to keep foot wulf felt supporter quiver a water rushed out for be waist deep now directly afterwards set down on foot saying run before next wave come ten yard farther be beyond reach of sea harold be with directed who have got ashore to form line taking hold of other hand so to advance far into surf grasp comrade a be swept up many be saved in way although of rescuer be badly hurt by floating piece of wreckage for vessel have entirely broken up immediately after course have be arrested a soon a who must be seen be brought ashore be found that ten men be missing among whom be master of ship most of having probably be struck by floating timber a soon a be certain that more must come ashore alive harold called men together rough litter be made of oar piece of sail for conveyance of who have broken limb be too much injured to walk party prepared for start by time several men apparently of fishing class have approached stood short distance away evidently waiting for departure of party before beginning work of collecting sea might cast up harold went over to asked in norman tongue what shore be how far be to nearest town where can obtain shelter assistance be in ponthieu in territory of count conrad town of st valery be two mile along coast there can obtain need returning to men harold ordered wounded to be raised party at once set out harold have already taken off gold chain ring have told companion to do same in order that cupidity of native might not be excited rank guessed at a soon a started wulf went up to lord said fear that have already be recognized by one of fisherman saw looking earnestly at then whisper to one of companion after doing so hurried away be bad news wulf must hardly expect must be long unrecognized there be many vessel come go between northern port own in st valery there must be number of sailor fisherman who have seen in london besides be sure to be questioned by count a to rank condition even must conceal for while news be certain to be brought ere long from england of having be blown off coast when be known must be speedily guessed that be missing party hark wulf have never heard aught good of count conrad one can not say what step may take to force to pay heavy ransom be like enough that will do can to prevent news of being in hand from reaching ear of duke be likely that beorn being lad will be watched le rigorously than rest of must be so try if find opportunity to send news to duke that be held prisoner here will of course endeavour to communicate with chance may occur by can do so more readily than can will try to do so lord trust norman count will treat with due honour courtesy wulf then fell back to beorn side hour later shipwrecked party entered gate of st valery townspeople flocked round a soon a learned that be party of shipwrecked saxon who have be blown by gale from england be led to house of officer in command of town asked few question saying must refer matter to count by usage of land who be cast upon become prisoner to be put to ransom otherwise a may decide however food will be supplied at once must be content to remain under guard until pleasure be known be accordingly at once placed in disused granary under charge of strong guard food be brought to a soon a have consumed most of men threw on ground worn out by long exertion be sorry welcome wulf after escape from sea beorn said truly land seems a inhospitable a ocean be not pleasant beorn at present feel so thankful for escape from terrible wave even thought that be prisoner to petty noble doe not greatly concern doubtless william of normandy who be liege lord of land will speedily take out of hand be alone may be that must suffer long stay in dungeon harold brother be far too important personage to be allowed to remain in hand of one of duke vassal be shameful beorn said indignantly say that who be cast on shore may not be often pillaged ill treated by common folk surely none of gentle blood must fail to show kindness hospitality be so on coast of sussex have heard that further west certainly among dane of northumbria vessel cast on coast be considered a gift from sea even life of who gain shore be not often respected regret much that harold must be with be true that being here will doubtless shorten term of imprisonment be unfortunate that must fall into hand of william who be a famous for craft subtlety a be for bravery skill a leader what can gain from harold beorn asked earl be well nigh a much known throughout europe a william of normandy christendom must cry out with shame be treated with ought courtesy by duke doubt not that will treat with courtesy beorn may well wring concession from before let depart may bargain that norman may be again allowed to hold land in england to build castle a did before godwin son returned from exile norman have to fly land save around person of king may beg so many bishopric for norman priest there be saying what concession may extort of prince in europe have rather harold have fallen into hand of other than into of william of normandy truly have never troubled head about such matter wulf thought that must be time to do so when became thane have vote at witan have heard much of from prior of bramber who be true englishman though priest learned in matter appertain to history of time past of own impressed upon just a boy must practise arm if be to bear worthily a man so must study story of king learn what be passing not only in own country in others if be ever to raise voice in council harold thane sat apart discussing position conclusion being very similar to arrived at by wulf chivalry have slight influence a yet in west of europe king prince cared little a to mean by attained end rival to throne be put out of way without profession of arm be business like other carried on for gain captured foe be valued chiefly for amount of ransom must be obtained for petty baron powerful noble alike levied exaction on who might fall into hand unless previously provided with safe conduct year later when king richard be made prisoner on return from holy land be only because of great exploit for recapture of holy sepulchre that feeling of reprobation be excited against captor thus then although normandy be at peace with england did not seem unnatural thing to harold companion that noble into whose hand have fallen must demand heavy ransom that duke of normandy must utilize opportunity for advantage on following morning heard large body of horseman ride up minute later governor accompanied by norman noble entered be followed by number of men at arm among whom be fisherman now fellow count said to man be saxon harold be harold said advancing step before companion be harold earl of wessex have with companion be cast on shore expect honourable treatment be willing to pay reasonable ransom must demand one will talk of afterwards count said roughly for present go with to castle at beaurain first do men hand over valuable that may posse be forfeited to being cast up on land without word harold produced chain of office other ornament dropped into helmet soldier at order of count held out for companion did same thane first then two lad will do count said to soldier be share can search rest yourselves protest against robbery harold said haughtily will proclaim in court of europe a one who be false to station who condescends to pillage whom fortune have cast on shore can wait until get opportunity to do so count sneered be not likely to come for time can do a like to others went on to governor want not to be cumbered with can doubtless find work for on fortification if can put to use be troublesome cut throat throw into sea saxon fingered knife harold said in own tongue resistance must be folly time may come when may turn table on fellow soldier now closed round harold thane led out of house here be ordered to mount behind soldier a soon a have done so rode out from st valery crossing river somme at abbeville authie by ford near crecy reached fortress of beaurain on river canche near town of hesdin before on road wulf watched anxiously for chance to escape none offered soldier rode on side of captive have slipped from horse must not have hoped to make escape across open country a soon a entered fortress harold thane be consigned to dungeon count learning that two lad have be harold page said must wait on see said to that service be good if wish to dangle over moat at end of rope be shame man must be nobleman beorn exclaimed indignantly to wulf a saw that soldier be placing chain upon harold before led away be hateful looking villain wulf said be lately that revolted against william heard of from prior brother last count of ponthieu joined france in invasion of normandy fell in ambush at st aubin man became count for time be held prisoner by duke afterwards be freed received back dominion a vassal face be at once cruel base told instruction harold gave beorn need for carrying out have arrived will try to make escape without loss of time from fortress to bear tidings to duke will escape with wulf two can get on better than one be so beorn must gladly have with maybe will be detected in attempting to escape be slain may fall into hand of peasant be brought back here if be together hope of letting duke know of lord captivity must be at end therefore be best that made attempt first if fail be like enough then do in turn try to get away bear news to duke beorn did not like to stay behind saw that wulf plan be best accordingly fell in with will go at once asked will stay for day two to lull suspicion may watch just at first if see that do a be ordered with good will will cease to regard so narrowly moreover will be needful to know place well before devise plan of escape chapter v rouen for next two day life of two young saxon be well nigh unbearable at meal count by turn abused jeered at companion following example lost opportunity of insulting in way if go on wulf beorn said a threw down on ground late that night when carousal be ended will snatch count dagger from belt bury in heart though put to death by torture afterwards thought of doing so beorn to night when threw cup of wine over said to myself life be not own harold rescue depends on be bound a men to suffer in patience whatever may befall in hour will try to make escape when be turn to wait evening stole away for time went to shed where keep war engine took thence coil of rope have hidden in courtyard know that noticed last night where sentry be placed decided where might best drop from wall unobserved fortunately moat be dry at present though can turn water into from stream at will so that once down will have difficulty in getting away now want to go to sleep directly will not stir until do so then when be questioned in morning can say be by side when went to sleep that when woke in morning place be vacant can say that told during day must not suffer insult much longer that suppose that after have gone to sleep must have got up either killed in way made escape beorn lay quiet for time then wulf said suddenly have changed mind beorn will go together feel be likely that in wrath at escape count may slay thus object with remained behind must come to nothing therefore be best that go with be thinking so wulf though must not say in truth think risk may run in making way to rouen be small compared to of staying here must lose time beorn castle be quiet now must be many mile away from here before morning for may be sure count horseman will scour country far wide in pursuit of have that morning before count be up service be required wandered about fortress apparently paying attention to anything really closely observing approach to wall general feature of country outside now stole out keeping in shadow of building until reached staircase leading up to battlement close to point wulf have fixed upon for making descent have be chosen chiefly because sentry be placed on part of wall watch generally being careless a normandy be at present at peace with neighbour when reached top of step listened for short time everything be silent then stepped out on to narrow pathway along battlement fastened one end of rope round piece of stonework let other end drop down into fosse will go down together rope be strong enough beorn asked be strong enough have better go separately beorn be of accustomed to climb rope if upper one be to slip down too fast might knock other off rope make matter who go first will if like only mind if hear footstep approaching let down at once whether be off rope not be sure twist leg tightly round will run through finger taking hold of rope at once swung over without much difficulty reached bottom in safety have scarcely done so when beorn came down beside with rush what made come down like narrowly missed coming on head believe have cut finger to bone beorn groaned feel a if be holding bar of hot iron have scarcely started before heard voice be evidently of men going round so caught hold of rope swung off before got leg fairly round rope began to slip though gripped a hard a must must not stop slid down like lightning hush wulf whispered be coming along above voice came nearer until sounded directly overhead wulf knew that be very unlikely must notice rope in dark felt much relieved a heard pas on waited until must no longer be heard now beorn can safely be off be muddy at bottom of fosse not so deep a thought must be scrambled up opposite side then struck across country south presently came upon road followed until after three hour walking reached authie river at spot where bank be broken down must be ford have best try to wade across anyhow there can not be very many yard to swim can manage that found that bottom be pebbly that even in middle water be not much above waist be something done at rate beorn said now way will go road be on seems to lead south can not do better than follow star give light enough now that eye be accustomed to darkness yes can keep road be doubt that by travelled before a far a village heard call noyelle then will have to strike off to left for place be not far from abbeville will have to follow somme up distance unless can find mean of crossing must think have better leave road before get to village so a to be well away from if peasant be going to work early caught sight of must be sure to mention to horseman who might come along searching for noticed that there be several wood on right a rode along must be safest way doubt wulf agreed fortunately can do without food for to morrow for have managed to get supper after have finished in hall having made up mind to escape to night hid away large piece of bread under smock can manage very well on accordingly after hour walking left road bore to south west little of land be cultivated be fortunate in not coming upon woodland until light began to break in sky then made way to nearest wood went in for distance then threw down in few minute be fast asleep accustomed to judge time by position of sun saw when awoke that be already past noon after eating few mouthful of bread continued journey for most part course lay among wood did not venture across open piece of country until after careful examination to see that one be in sight shortly after starting caught sight of village in distance afterwards learned be st riguier with exception saw human habitation late in afternoon came down on bank of somme be thickly covered with long reed rush among sat down ate rest of bread confident that however vigilant search must not be traced be very different matter to last crossing beorn said be wide river fear must not swim across must like to try fortunately there be occasion for to trust to swimming for can pull up break off number of great rush make into two bunch will give ample support for passage so will wulf must never have thought of two large bundle be soon made reed being tied together by tough climber wreathed everywhere among a soon a be quite dark went down to water edge found to satisfaction that reed possessed ample buoyancy for purpose wading in started swimming resting chest on reed striking out with leg in few minute be on southern bank of river now must make to east of south wulf said must say if walk steadily all night will be beyond territory of vile count hope before long will strike on road leading in right direction for if get among wood again will be able to make progress road may come upon going at in right direction be likely to lead to rouen how far be do think have very vague idea prior have map of normandy on pointed out to how duchy have grown since william came a boy to be duke can remember general position of town not more than must think from somme to rouen must be over seventy mile le than hundred more closely than can not guess came upon road before morning a country be open made good progress when lay down in thicket a day be breaking calculated that must be nearly thirty mile south of somme feel that want sleep beorn said still more that want food if be sixty mile to rouen know not how be going to travel distance fasting must get food to morrow rather to day beorn have nothing of value to offer for searched too closely for anything to escape dare not go into town village until be quite sure that be beyond count territory might enter solitary hut pray for piece of bread for charity can walk day by time will surely be well beyond count of ponthieu territory must boldly go into town if be seized can demand to be sent to rouen saying be bearer of important message to duke william even if send straight on must hardly keep without food after sleeping for four five hour again started after walking mile came upon herdsman cottage man be out wife looked with surprise at two lad whose garment though stained by sea water travel be evidently of youth of class above common beorn addressed in own language told that be wayfarer who have lost road be grievously in need of food at once invited to come in set before black bread cheese made from goat milk learned to satisfaction that have long passed limit of ponthieu that rouen be distant about fifty mile road from amiens lie five mile to east said must be shorter for to keep due south for incline in direction will strike after seven mile walking after that can not miss way after warmly thanking woman for hospitality lad again started feeling greatly strengthened refreshed by meal want of sleep told upon when got within sight of road again lay down slept until sun be setting resuming journey followed road before morning crossed over range of hill presently arrived at small hamlet close to be monastery towards directed step seating on ground near door waited until be unbarred be early wayfarer son monk who opened gate said a went up seem to have travelled far have father be sorely in need of food hospitality of monastery be unbounded monk at once led into kitchen where bread meat wine be placed before truly be hungry monk said smilingly a watched onslaught upon joint be well nigh starving father for two day have have nought to eat save crust of bread have brought with that shepherd wife bestowed upon out of charity have walked from near hesdin ask out of curiosity son monk said after pause know be not custom to question wayfarer who come in to ask hospitality be strange to see two youth who by dress manner seem to belong to superior station in so pitiable state a be wandering alone a must seem penniless through country ask not confidence if chose to give maybe might aid advise prior be kindly man very gentle with fault of others be saxon father be wrecked four day since near st valery be now bound on errand of high importance to duke william to whom be urgent must arrive a soon a possible have run sore peril on way have be stripped of money valuable be mission of importance to duke a well a to yourselves monk asked gravely be of great importance to be sure that must consider that one who assisted on way have done good service monk look earnestly at will speak to prior said returned in few minute bade follow prior be tall gentle old man have heard story from brother gregory said wished to see might judge for whether so strange tale a two shipwrecked boy must have important business with duke must be believed before did aught to help forward look to honest of purpose of gentle blood not be sure belonging to class of wayfarer who will trump up story for purpose of gaining alms whether errand with duke be of importance deem can not say if give word that consider urgent matter will aid to proceed at once do indeed consider most urgent father be sure that duke will so regard must not have walked well nigh hundred mile in two day night almost without food have not deemed so brother gregory prior said bid lay brother philip at once prepare three palfrey tell be to ride with two saxon youth to rouen distance be thirty mile went on a monk left room be not yet six o'clock though palfrey be not accustomed to travel at rapid speed will be there afternoon in time to have audience with duke lad returned warm thanks to prior must gladly tell purport of mission beorn said be only bearer of news duke might be displeased did know that have confided to before reached own ear wish not to learn son be sufficient for that have mission to duke that be possibly furthering interest by aiding to reach in be more moved by desire to aid two stranger youth whom sea man alike seem to have treated hardly be long since left england have well nigh lost account of time father so much have taken place in few day be week since be sailing along english coast with large company in three ship when sudden tempest arose carried away sail blew off shore then increasing in fury drove before until be wrecked on coast of ponthieu near st valery since then have be prisoner have escaped have journeyed here on foot truly bad week work for prior said be ship wrecked two consort being lighter more easily rowed regained land when be blown off conrad of ponthieu be evil man prior said have come ashore twenty mile farther south must have be beyond jurisdiction fear that seacoast people view good obtained from vessel cast ashore a lawful prey company must assuredly have received fair hospitality if cast on shore of normandy now methinks hear patter of palfrey hoof farewell son may god who have protected through danger give blessing lad knelt before a placed hand on head gave benediction a rose brother gregory entered to say that horse be ready with renewed thanks to prior followed to courtyard mounted rode off with lay brother glad indeed to find journey on foot thus abridged impatient a be to reach rouen gentle pace at palfrey ambled along fretted very much brother philip kept up constant string of talk on monastery estate kindness of prior strictness of subprior other matter of great interest to of none to boy whose thought be with harold chained in prison palfrey however made very fair progress be three o'clock when rode into street of rouen whose size grandeur must at other time have impressed much for be incomparably finer city than london be duke palace brother philip said a approached stately building will put up horse at convent at farther corner of square will then go with to palace a have order to tell officer who may make difficulty about entering that be bid by prior of forge to say that be here on urgent business with duke to pray that may have immediate audience with in day great men be easy accessible one of usher on receiving message from prior at once led boy to apartment in duke be sitting looked up in surprise on seeing two lad standing bareheaded at door while usher repeated message have received advance said what be business of prior of forge have sent word two boy advanced knelt before duke be man of about same age a harold with dark hair complexion le tall than earl of powerful figure stern resolute face boy have discussed among must be speaker wulf have desired that beorn being elder must deliver message beorn insisted that a wulf have received from harold be who must be one to deliver to duke lord duke wulf said be saxon page of earl harold bring by order news that vessel in be sailing along coast have be blown off by tempest cast on shore of ponthieu near st valery that companion have be villainously ill treated by conrad count of ponthieu who have seized cast into dungeon in fortress of beaurain harold companion being fettered like malefactor duke be astounded at news greater piece of good fortune must have befallen for have in power to lay great rival under obligation to to show generous prince at same time to obtain substantial benefit rose at once to foot by host exclaimed be foul treatment indeed of noble earl brings disgrace alike upon count of ponthieu upon liege lord wrong will be remedied speedily will see that waste moment in rescuing lord from unmannerly count struck hand on table attendant entered pray knight fitz osberne warren to come hither at once how be boy went on a attendant hurried away that be enabled to bear message to while harold thane be cast into prison wulf said count kept to wait upon not for service that might flout ill treat obtained possession of rope let down at night from battlement made way on foot a far a forge where good prior learning from that have message of importance to though nothing of import sent forward on palfrey so that time might be lost when did leave beaurain will be three day come midnight wulf said how did live by way took piece of bread with once obtained food at shepherd hut morning be well entertained at convent of forge have proved yourselves good trusty messenger duke said must be always a well served a be earl page be of course of gentle blood be ward lord will be thane when come of age how be that young sir who seem to be younger than companion be spokesman happened thus wulf said modestly fisherman came up just after have gained shore with loss of many of company marked that one of started on seeing earl harold whispered to companion feeling sure that have recognized lord told earl of a walked towards st valery then charged if be taken prisoner by count to endeavour to bear news to to give same order to comrade beorn saying be likely that might not

to norman noble for europe will cry shame when news of earl treatment get abroad that conrad must hold to ransom be only in accordance with strict right that must imprison chain be by saint almost beyond belief a soon a knight have left duke sent for chamberlain ordered to conduct beorn wulf to apartment to see that be at once furnished with garment befitting young noble together with purse of money for immediate want then taking long heavy gold chain from neck placed on table with blow with dagger cut in sunder handed half to of lad take said in token of thanks for having brought news remember that if at time must have boon to ask that be within power to grant swear to upon ducal honour that will be yours never have received more joyful news than that great earl of wessex will

ponthieu have surely succeeded even beyond hope a to rest know not a be speaking marked satisfaction joy on duke face said to myself that be greater than need have be caused by thought earl harold be to be guest so thought beorn there can be doubt that a said deemed best news have ever received fear greatly that harold will exchange one captivity for will doubtless be more pleasant one methinks harold will find a much prisoner although treated a honoured guest by william a be while lying in dungeon of conrad be bad business greatly fear indeed that harold will long rue unfortunate scheme of hunting along coast have brought to pas in short time attendant arrived with ewer water four suit of handsome garment belt embroidered with gold thread dagger together with two plumed cap purse containing ten gold piece informed that two horse have be provided for use that be to take meal with duke household to consider in respect a guest look finer bird than did when rode in with brother

early next morning to accompany duke to eu in order to receive with due honour william guest friend harold of england while meal went on many question be asked a to shipwreck prisonment of earl liveliest indignation be expressed at conduct of conrad of ponthieu truly norman will be reckoned churl one of gentleman exclaimed indignantly fame of harold bravery wisdom courtesy to men be known in court in europe that duke vassal must have dared to imprison chain will excite universal indignation why rudest of own norse ancestor must not have so foully treated one so noble whom fate have cast into hand have be at war with england must be shameful being at peace there be word can fitly describe outrage when meal be over one of duke page who be about same age a beorn asked what be going to do with if have nothing better said will ride with to father castle be five mile away name be de burg can promise hearty welcome father be one of knight who accompanied duke when paid visit to england fifteen year ago liked country much have ever since spoken of princely hospitality with be received by king did not meet earl harold then earl with father brother be away in exile wulf said rather shortly for visit have be most unpleasant one to englishman have happened when norman influence be altogether in ascendant king be filling chief place at court in church with norman have bestowed wide domain upon castle be everywhere rising to dominate land englishman then regarded with hostility visit of young norman duke with great train of knight although at return of godwin son greater portion of intruder have be driven out influence still remained at court be even said that edward have promised duke that must be successor be true that englishman laughed at promise king of england be chosen by nation edward have shadow of right to bequeath throne even to one of son much le to foreign prince who although related to by marriage have drop of english blood in vein still that promise must ever have be made rankled in mind of english people more so a power of normandy increased ambition a well a valour of duke became more more manifest according to english law promise be empty breath absolutely without effect value according to norman law constituted powerful claim duke william be assuredly not man to let such claim drop unpressed wulf have heard again again prior of bramber have explained to in bearing showing that little a englishman might think of promise given by edward so long ago must be likely to bring grievous trouble on land at death might perhaps have said more in reference to william visit have not beorn at once accepted invitation to ride with young de burg to father castle chapter vi release of earl in few minute three horse be brought out wulf beorn be much pleased with animal have be placed at service be powerful horse must carry knight in full armour with ease seemed full of spirit fire be handsomely caparisoned lad felt a sprang on to back that have never be so well mounted before must have made journey more quickly easily if have have horse three day ago young de burg laughed yes indeed there must have be occasion to hide in wood then with light weight on back must have made nothing of journey must not expect to see castle de burg said presently though call one in early day duke set to destroy great majority of castle throughout normandy for a know have little trouble with noble held that while strength of fortress disposes men to engage either in civil war in private feud with other be of avail against enemy of country father who be just age of duke be loyal follower from first of free will levelled wall a did many others of duke friend in first place because gave duke pleasure in second because have only castle of opposed to duke be destroyed there must have be such jealousy animosity on part of owner that matter must never have quieted down in country thus be that throughout land will find few castle remaining noble felt strange at first to be thus dwelling in house undefended against attack soon learnt that be far more convenient than to be shut up within massive wall present dwelling be much larger more comfortable than of former day duke said rightly that abolition of fortress well nigh doubled fighting power for so many men be required to garrison a to greatly diminish number lord must take with into field have castle in england do live in open house hold that be far better more pleasant to do so there be fighting between neighbour with great earl may quarrel lead force into field may gather against danish norwegian pirate except on occasion be rare dwell peaceably in home horse be fresh five mile quickly passed over there be house de burg said pointing to large building standing on eminence be castellated in form much of old building have be incorporated with addition outer wall have be pulled down moat filled up broad casement have replaced narrow loophole though flag of de burg still waved over keep stood little apart from rest family no longer dwelt in be chiefly used a storehouse now guy de burg explained there a see old loophole still remain in case of trouble might be held for time of however there be little chance duke hand be heavy one have shown great leader have raised normandy well nigh level with france so long a life reign there be fear of domestic trouble gate stood open rode into courtyard when several men came out took horse guy de burg ran up broad staircase to entrance of house passed beneath noble entrance with lofty pointed arch supported by clustered pillar inside be spacious hall paved with stone from de burg turned into apartment whose wall be covered with rich hanging here lady be at work embroidering surrounded by several of maid similarly engaged girl fourteen year old be reading missal while master of castle be sitting in chair with low arm be playing with ear of hound whose head be lying on knee well guy what be news asked a son entered hour since received message from duke desiring to appear with ten men at arm in best trapping to ride with to eu be conrad of ponthieu giving trouble again who be young gentleman with guy went down on one knee to kiss father hand then did same to mother then said will with permission answer last question first father friend be young saxon thane page to earl harold at present guest of duke

foully imprisoned even fettered by count conrad beorn wulf escaped from prison brought news to duke who afternoon dispatched fitz osberne warren at full speed to bid count at once free prisoner deliver over to at eu under pain of direst displeasure harold in normandy prisoner be strange news indeed will surely make welcome for be in respect great man save own duke have reputation second to none in europe wulf thought a looked at speaker at least have second thought in mind be frank honest face martial in outline softened by pleasant smile have spoken in genial tone of affection to son wulf thought that although doubt be ready to take field at summons of lord preferred quiet life in stately home be news for wife went on will have to furbish up gayest attire for will be having grand doings in honour of great english earl dame will have to look best in order that may carry home fair report of to saxon lady how did manage to escape young sir when did arrive with news beorn who a elder be specially addressed shortly related story of escape journey have done well baron said when have concluded guy may learn from young saxon even page may be called upon to do work of more importance than handing wine cup standing behind lord on state occasion have not be for readiness courage harold might have lain week in prison maybe month while count be striving to wring utmost ransom from lad must doubtless have be slain have be detected in making escape overtaken on way attempt be therefore one required courage a well a devotion to lord doubt not that must exhibit quality did opportunity offer question whether must have walked distance did that on such scanty fare norman be too apt to trust wholly to horse leg to neglect of own although have doubt that must ride a far a horse must carry warrant that must hardly have performed on foot journey from beaurain in twice time in did must have exercised leg a well a arm although in campaign norman noble depends upon war horse on march on day of battle there may often be time when be well that knight must be able to march a far a of footman in army well agnes what have to say to saxon youth methinks eye be paying more attention to than to missal can read missal at hour father be first time have seen young saxon noble thought there must have be more difference between hair be fairer more golden eye bluer dress differs in way from own spoke in matter of fact serious air a if be horse dog that be commenting upon beorn wulf smiled while guy laughed outright be little wonder that attire be like ours agnes said seeing that be furnished with by duke order suppose that after being tossed about on sea well nigh drowned in landing being made prisoner then travelling through country sleeping in wood beorn wulf must arrive here with garment new spotless must indeed have be miracle indeed beorn said garment differ not greatly from now have on for norman fashion be prevalent at king edward court have choice to conform to language be always spoken there methinks be to visit westminster must see little difference between king edward court that of own duke sister do too dress like queen edith lady dress like in norman fashion away from court attire be different more simple sister wulf have none be orphan ward of earl harold who hold estate until be of age to take oath to to lead men in battle will be baron like father count simple knight will be none of thing lady agnes have great earl a in france have great duke below have title be thane be land owner who hold land direct from have wider land than others a free thane be equal a to knight have not in title ceremony be so much thought of in france in other court be pity girl said gravely for vow of knighthood make knight courteous gentle to enemy friend alike rather agnes mother put in must do so in truth looking round at cruel war have have in normandy see that men have be more gentle courteous than must have be have never taken vow have knightly spur buckled on in truth seems to from news of what have taken place beyond sea that in civil trouble have have in england men be much more gentle with other foe be far more easily reconciled than with in normandy who be supposed to be bound by law of chivalry have duke be cast upon shore of england a harold have be cast upon of ponthieu think that must not have be so dishonourably treated by one of english thane a harold have be by count conrad when godwin son returned from exile into have be driven again became powerful there be not a have heard from father single drop of blood shed vengeance taken upon men who have brought about exile must have be very different have such thing happened here speak rightly wife english be of more gentle disposition than be though nowise backward in battle now guy be time that be returning have already made longer stay than usual will see again to morrow when start for eu young sir hope that on return will often ride over here when lord doe not require will always be pleased to see although forest lie mile away guy can show good hunting though not so good a a hear can get in england where population be not so thick a be in part of normandy horse be brought round three lad rode into rouen just a night be falling long before daybreak there be stir in street of city a party of knight noble rode in with body of retainer in obedience to order of duke in palace be awake early hasty breakfast be eaten while just a sun rose duke mounted horse at head of array composed of twenty baron knight four hundred men at arm rode out of city there be good deal more pomp show here than there be when rode with harold from london wulf said in truth norman noble make far braver appearance in armour robe with banner carried behind than do be king to ride in state through london must scarce be so gaily attended duke william doe not look a if cared for show beorn said doe guy who be riding beside put in for be simple in taste know that people be impressed by pomp love to see brave cavalcade therefore insists on observance of outward form court here on state occasion vies a tell with of henry of france where will rest tonight wulf asked methinks from appearance of sky that will have rain unless sleep under shelter many of fine robe that see be like to be a much dabbled in mud a be in arrived will sleep in town for there be place on road between eu must receive so large party soon after rode out yesterday train of waggon with tent else needful started from rouen half way to eu will find camp erected everything in readiness for reception be indeed case camp have be erected in sheltered valley through ran stream supplied need of man horse tent be placed in regular order of duke in centre of chief noble in order of rank on side behind be line for use of court official page knight of le degree while soldier must sleep in open a party rode up chamberlain with three four assistant met be provided with list containing name of duke following be at once conducted to tent alloted to so that in few minute be housed without slightest confusion trouble squire of knight noble attendant of officer page at once took horse picketed in line behind tent rubbing down cleaning with greatest care then supplying with forage from pile have that morning be brought in from neighbouring farm fuel in abundance have also be stacked number of cook have come on with tent equipage supper be already prepared for duke party while animal have be slaughtered cut up men at arm soon have joint hanging over bivouac fire be wonderfully well managed beorn wulf said doubt whether must be done so well orderly with at home what doe matter beorn said contemptuously make difference whether one sup five minute after arrival hour matter nothing beorn what be question of hour waiting in small party be one of going altogether supperless to bed when be large one norman have be constantly fighting for last twenty year see have learned how important be that everything must be regular orderly if manage matter with large force a well a do with small one a be probable that do see what advantage give to be two army to arrive near other with intention of fighting in morning one knew exactly what to do must get food in comfort then lie down to rest while other be in confusion one knowing where must go where to bestow being unable to obtain food forced to lie down supperless first army must obtain great advantage when met next morning especially if have breakfasted well while other went into fight still fasting look at how weak be that morning when have lain down hungry got up fasting while on morning when woman gave that food simple a be stepped out boldly in spirit be true enough wulf know that among be said that earl harold be always most careful for comfort of soldier yes earl always think of around a have never be in field know not what arrangement be can not think must be so well ordered in great gathering of englishman that must manage matter a well a norman with experience have learnt to do well wulf beorn laughed have best study matter then ask earl to appoint to take charge of arrangement when take field one must hardly have more useful office wulf said earnestly must need man of experience of high rank position for saxon thane be not accustomed to discipline a be norman baron only one of great authority must induce to observe regulation carry out plan in due order beorn nodded be true enough wulf be therefore clear that good many year must pas before can properly fill post of chief chamberlain to army for will be well content to do what fighting be required to leave matter in hand yes ca be left in hand of one officer wulf said warmly unless give aid willingly to carry out plan well need not be angry about wulf there will be time enough for when get to be grand chamberlain know what saxon thane be how ease loving averse to trouble with aught save chase must a soon marshal flock of sheep in military order teach to keep place a get thane to conform to strict order regulation yet beorn said baron de burg who have just entered tent unnoticed by in order to speak to son who with page shared with unless will conform to strict order regulation army be mere gathering of armed men animated not by one will by a many will a contains men such army may be valiant man may be hero yet may be shattered to piece by give up wholly to direction of one will be why norman have so badly beaten french mail have place in battle charge when be ordered to charge be held in reserve whole day battle ended without ever striking blow may fret under inaction may see what think chance of falling upon enemy wasted know that duke be great leader that have plan for battle will carry through disobedience to order must be offence a great a of riding from field hence have learned to obey consequently have always be victorious against men a brave a ourselves obeying own feudal lord so fighting in detached body rather than a whole young companion be in right in duel between two men strength skill be everything in struggle between two army obedience to order be virtue even higher than bravery skill at arm where be guy be in attendance on duke lord beorn said presented also at tent told that required duty from let come to tent when return baron said be a soon a have finished supper will be glad if will also come unless duke sends for methinks be not likely to do be in thoughtful mood to day will probably be alone two three other knight be assembled in baron de burg tent when three lad went in de burg said few word to companion explaining who be then continued conversation with others beorn wulf a stood behind chair listened to talk must not help being struck with difference between conversation have heard at house of saxon thane with harold have be accustomed to hear matter of state touched on church struggle going on between norman prelate monk on one hand english clergy on other be one be frequently talked over a be also project harold have at heart for encouraging spread of education raising condition of people generally at house of thane however evening be passed in feasting song be seldom that there be anything like discussion upon general affair indeed between men heated with wine accustomed to state opinion bluntly anything like friendly argument be well nigh impossible de burg companion made allusion at to public affair discussed gravely calmly with courteous respect for other opinion question connected with art of war hunting changed condition brought about by demolition of castle improvement gradually being introduced in armour other kindred topic other noble be men of about same age a de burg although latter page from time to time carried round wine goblet be rarely emptied certain topic be touched upon only to be dropped at once wulf saw subject upon there be disagreement among be carefully avoided when boy returned to tent wulf said talk reminds of evening spent with prior almoner two three other monk rather than of at house of saxon thane beorn nodded be not so much against custom of feasting merriment a be wulf must not care to spend evening often in listening to such grave talk truly norman baron knight be far more courteous in speech than own thane seem to care little for wine cup admit that such men must be far wiser adviser for king than be saxon saving of course harold brother norman be not so abstemious a father saw with guy laughed listen can hear song loud laughter from many of tent ay might hear quarrel too did listen long enough saw be men high in confidence of duke have fought together under banner in many field be powerful baron be content to hold own have nothing to gain at expense of others value be well established believe that of must be well pleased be never called upon to set lance in rest again methinks evening avoided public question chiefly because be present see word be spoken of unexpected accident have thrown harold on shore although must have be in mind doubtless talked over a rode to day must not be surprised if father have in tent for very reason that being there must prevent more being said about suppose of know exactly what be in duke mind possibly have not even made up be assuredly wise here in normandy to express strong opinion until duke own mind be manifest daresay be right guy rather wondered why father have asked a well a to tent when have others with be like enough that thought presence must prevent discussion on delicate topic next morning cavalcade mounted early in afternoon rode into fortress of eu stood upon river bresle have previous to conquest of ponthieu be frontier guard of normandy on north lay only ten mile from spot where saxon galley have be wrecked messenger have arrived there early in day from fitz osberne saying that conrad of ponthieu have assented to demand of duke for surrender of captive that have be at once released from confinement be now honourably entertained must start on following morning from beaurain must be accompanied by conrad who desired to come to eu to pay respect to duke although have be certain that conrad must not venture to refuse command of powerful over lord wulf beorn be greatly delighted to hear that harold companion have at once be released from imprisonment that must so speedily arrive at eu in afternoon of following day messenger arrived stating that cavalcade be hour ride away preparation be at once made to receive with honour garrison of castle in bravest attire

st valery who have by conrad order be sent to join cavalcade where crossed somme at procession be closed by strong body of count men at arm rode through double line of spearmen until reached entrance then a harold dismounted duke descended step embraced with warmest expression of satisfaction at thus meeting most illustrious of englishman harold replied in suitable term duke then turned to conrad thanked warmly for having acceded to request ponthieu be newly conquered might yet be thorn in side of normandy in event of renewal of war with france be therefore to william interest to treat conrad obedience to order a if have be voluntary submission to ignore discourteous treatment of captive in order to eradicate sense of injury on part of vassal not only paid ransom for harold gave considerable grant of territory duke now presented noble principal officer to harold then with arm placed familiarly on guest shoulder led into hall placed in chair of state beside own other seat being placed for wulfnoth hakon for of principal norman baron while rest mingled with saxon thane in body of hall a soon a reception be over wulf hurried out into courtyard to speak to osgod right glad be to see again osgod have be troubled a to how be faring in truth have fared badly enough master have be working like beast of burden without having food must suffice for as however be not for long will do harm though there be more than one of fellow at st valery with whom must gladly have ten minute play with cudgel quarter staff may guess how surprised be yesterday evening when be suddenly called out from shed where be sleeping with many profession of regret apology for treatment conducted to better quarter where good honest meal be set before be then told that duke have just arrived at eu that harold following be there to be given up to have fresh rush for bed hearty breakfast morning be then placed in boat taken up to abbeville have be there hour when earl arrived with

'no have befallen master friend good fellow ' earl said 'they have indeed done good service for made escape from beaurain carried news of detention to duke william be thus that have obtained liberty ' seem to have fared bravely wulf judging from attire yes be in sore plight when arrived at rouen duke saw that be provided with clothes with horse for journey here at moment attendant came out from hall informed wulf that duke desired speech with beorn be already at entrance be conducted on to dais here be two page duke said to harold hold to be greatly debtor for having carried news have brought about meeting given pleasure of having a guest be faithful lad quick witted for men must have carried out mission better more promptly than did still more be indebted to harold said a held out hand to two lad who bent on one knee while kissed knew not of going until learnt from baron that have reached rouen with news be ward of mine although at one time page have ceased to be so for more than year have be down upon estate learning duty of station deemed better for than wasting time getting into mischief at court duke nodded result show that course be wise one at court youth learn little good atmosphere be not healthy for men still le for boy youth will shortly be of age when will be fit to render men service a indeed have already done lad now retired from dais have be fortunate week work for beorn said have obtained freedom of lord have gained approbation that of duke william though indeed matter not greatly a to duke know beorn one can not look into future there be saying what may happen anyhow even now may be of advantage to honourably a duke be treating earl be still wholly in power until hear something of intention be just a much prisoner a be to conrad although admit captivity be very much more pleasant one chapter vii oath from eu party travelled back to rouen where there be feasting entertainment in honour of harold nothing must be more courteous

warmest most sincere nature harold be really gratified at pain william took to show esteem in held thane be well satisfied with attention bestowed upon by norman baron beorn wulf have nothing to do save to make friend with young norman of own age to visit castle to join in hunting party duke lost opportunity of showing sincerity of feeling of gratitude have expressed to for bringing news of harold presence in dominion be always specially invited to court ceremonial enjoying exceedingly wulf occasionally expressed surprise to companion that word be said a to return to england beorn answer always silenced earl seems well satisfied wulf why must be more anxious for than be for once indeed replied harold be of so open generous nature beorn that must be last person to suspect of dishonourable motif moreover be not because be apparently well content here that must judge to be without uneasiness whatever felt must be impolitic to show see little of now save when in company of norman can not know that presence be required in england be matter of satisfaction to wulf that walter fitz urse be not at court having few week before returned to england where be again in suite of norman bishop of london have become firm friend with guy de burg often rode over with to father residence where hunted in forest together rode out with falcon on wrist agnes de burg often accompanying

experience of guest harold accepted invitation with thane set out with duke against disciplined force of normandy breton peasant have chance whatever in open field wild broken country well nigh covered with forest afforded opportunity for display of own method of fighting by sudden surprise attack defended rough formidable intrenchment with desperate valour harold experience gained in warfare with welsh be of much utility duke committed to hand formal command of troop engaged averring that knew comparatively little of warfare such a harold conducted operation with equal vigour

clemency be always shown to garrison when fortress be stormed be permitted to return unharmed to people bearing news that duke bore ill will towards be ready to show mercy to who laid down arm wulf beorn be permitted to share in assault with saxon thane followed harold a led way on foot up to intrenchment at one point while duke with party of baron attacked at more than once english banner be carried into heart of breton fortress before norman have fought way in on of occasion duke warmly expressed admiration for courage of english ally at last there remained one formidable stronghold to be captured so strong be by nature so desperately defended that for time effort of besieger be fruitless one evening guy de burg have be with wulf in tent beorn be out spending evening with of norman

matter most of present have taken oath of allegiance to william have broken again again william have not le frequently broken feudal oath to suzerain king of france harold be man with deep sense of religion did not esteem a lightly a norman baron oath thus sworn felt that have fallen into trap resistance must consign to prison if not grave at once understood how hollow have be pretended

rode back to rouen in morning duke accompanied harold to river bank there took courteous farewell of be not probable that thought for moment harold must observe oath saw that breach must be almost a useful to a fulfilment for must enable to denounce rival a perjured faithless man to represent expedition against england a being sort of crusade to punish one who have broken most solemn vow made on

calmly let not talk of now will be for english people to decide question day for english bishop to determine whether be bound by vow thus extorted better at event must be held for time to have be false perjured than that english people must fall under norman yoke maybe there will be occasion for oath ever to come in question william of normandy may die before king then there will be end of let talk of other thing thank god be free men again face be set towards england where from what hear may have to meet open foe instead of false friend may have to teach welsh once for that king can not

in readiness to join with levy in spring somerset devon men be to gather at bristol thence to be conveyed by ship to southern coast of wale troop at gloucester be to march west tostig be to bring down body of northumbrian horse to enter wale from chester housecarls to surprise be ordered to lay aside ringed armour heavy helmet in place of leather jerkin cap be served out to heavy ax be to be left behind be to trust to sword alone be to abandon tactic in have be trained of fighting shoulder to shoulder with shield overlapping shield be to exercise in running climbing in skirmishing with imaginary foe rapidly gathering in close formation to resist anticipated attack harold gave instruction will have foe to meet breast to breast said if be to conquer to root out hornet must be by showing even more active than be speed activity go for everything in war like while own method of fighting be absolutely useless unless make end of matter may be called away from home once year to repel attack while if conquer now there will be welsh foray again during lifetime therefore be worth while to make great effort for once to lay aside own method of fighting commander will see that exercise be well carried out will report to regarding who show most zeal energy extra pay will be given to will know how to reward who be reported to a most deserving of troop set to work with great energy soon recognized advantage gained by laying aside heavy arm armour swimming running climbing be practised incessantly when may arrived with time for commencement of campaign felt confident of ability to cope with welsh in own method of warfare chapter ix in welsh valley wulf beorn did not form part of expedition be to embark with harold from bristol to enter wale by one of southern valley be necessary that gathering of levy at gloucester must be strengthened by having a nucleus three hundred trained soldier levy be lightly armed accustomed to fight in same irregular manner a welsh adversary whom held in considerable dread for fierce hillmen have again again proved more than match for peaceable native on english side of border addition then of three hundred housecarls be required to give confidence have indeed abandoned for time armour heavy weapon solid formation must still be necessary gather in line behind levy must rally must be impregnable to undisciplined attack of welsh young thane be somewhat disappointed at finding that be not to accompany earl a told be mark of confidence that must post with force where fighting be likely to be more severe risk greater than with led will penetrate into heart of wale said will have horseman with strong force of trained soldier levy enemy will feel sure be unable to oppose successfully be likely enough that when welsh find that force from south tostig from north can not be withstood will pour out on eastern frontier try to light flame in worcester hereford gloucester that must be obliged to abandon work hurry back to stem tide of invasion be necessary therefore that from side also there must be forward movement brother gurth will command here have strongly recommended to experience in breton war will be of assistance to have told that can be far better trusted than many older than yourselves in carrying out expedition among hill valley anticipate there will be pitched battle welsh know that can not withstand trained soldier will be war of skirmish of detached fighting of surprise long march great fatigue valley in country be to be harried with fire sword be to be made to feel that even in mountain be not safe from a never take prisoner give quarter in foray on side of border so will hunt down like wolf in own forest work must be done so thoroughly that for hundred year at least lesson will not be forgotten in last week of may gurth moved forward marching first to hereford a more central point of attack then crossing border entering wale troop carried heavy baggage meat expected to find flour be carried on two hundred pack horse force be about strong housecarls marched in body keeping solid order behind came pack animal led separately so that must more easily make way through forest over broken ground marched in line forty abreast light armed levy led by respective thane moved a chose on flank of trained troop followed in rear when halted on first evening after crossing frontier lighted fire bivouacked wulf beorn walked together through camp in spite of fact that be dressed somewhat alike in leather jerkin be easy to see be trained soldier said housecarls be a merry over food have brought with a if be going upon march of pleasure through hill while border levy evidently regard business a serious one be wonder beorn replied seeing how for year have suffered at hand of welsh look at hill wulf can count dozen beacon alight of course have heard of preparation for attack be flashing news from hill to hill of advance of force will not be long before gather to oppose be like enough may attack to night beorn may have have spy at hereford will have known two day ago of coming may reckon that must anticipate attack until farther among hill that will in consequence be careless a in truth seem to be think must be well to offer gurth housecarls to stand sentry to night might laugh at beorn said doubtfully well let laugh will laugh good humouredly anyhow for be of kindly light hearted disposition at rate there can not be harm in proposing after surprise got from breton can not be too cautious walked to fire where gurth be sitting with four five of friend of whom have furnished body of border thane have by order remained with own following so at time must be in readiness to give order lead in case of surprise where have be young thane gurth asked slipped away a soon a meal be finished a if be afraid of wine cup care not much for drinking beorn said have be going through force to see how be disposed have come to offer that men will to night furnish guard for camp there be occasion for gurth said welshman will not attack until be entangled among hill depends upon how well be led lord gurth wulf said if be well led may attack to night for must know of approach will think probable that will being so near own border be at first careless breton gave just lesson inflicted heavy loss upon norman army well post men a like gurth said though seems to that must be better for to husband strength for to morrow march will have night sleep wulf said if have not known how stoutly fought how courage saved norman camp must have said be over cautious gurth laughed however will not refuse offer young thane though methinks there be chance whatever of welsh disturbing here having obtained permission beorn wulf returned to fire of men be to have honour of furnishing guard to night osgod tell men gurth relies upon watchfulness want repetition of surprise have from breton will be short night watch 't be nine now by four will be broad daylight beorn men ours will march hundred yard out from camp half can lie down to sleep at once other half can post a sentry relieve at half past twelve attack if come will come from front therefore will post men twenty thirty yard apart along there for distance round flank one of will remain with party that lie down so a to be in readiness to lead at once against point attacked other will move round round to see that sentry be vigilant that be good news to osgod said methinks affair in breton wood have shaken courage for have be looking at tree in front of wondering whether welsh be gathering there thinking how must be with raw levy if came down upon to night went hard for bit with norman tried soldier though be must not trust levy to stand for moment for hold welsh in mighty respect men cheerfully took arm fell in considered compliment that have be chosen to furnish first guard beorn men with portion of wulf be to furnish first line of sentry two young thane accompanied by osgod went round with posted after giving strict injunction to be watchful vigilant savage beorn said will creep up through grass a noiselessly a cat so must keep ear a well a eye well open if hear breaking of twig challenge at once then if rise alarm at top of voice do whole of run back to here if cry come from front if from flank hurry to spot will do same from here be careful not to rouse camp by false alarm for if do instead of gaining credit will become jest of whole force when sentry be placed beorn with leader of band began to go round while wulf osgod returned to party can sleep master while watch beside osgod said must not sleep if lay down for have got yell of breton in ear must not close eye very well osgod in case may a well take nap be soon sound asleep remained so until osgod touched sat up in moment by star be past midnight lord be time for to relieve beorn party men be at once called to foot relief effected if attack come wulf said a with osgod proceeded to walk backwards forward along line of sentry fancy will be just before daybreak many of may come from long distance leader must wait until last moment in order to gather a large force together a possible besides men sleep heaviest at time must reckon hour a best for surprise a walked frequently paused to listen intently though once twice thought heard distant sound might be caused by passage of wild animal through bush sentry be vigilant be first time that sussex lad have be in face of enemy stillness of night sombre forest in front of possibility of savage unknown foe lurking there kept thoroughly on alert once twice wulf osgod went forward to examine bush have seemed to imagination of sentry to have moved in case alarm be groundless must be nearly three o'clock now osgod wulf said at last half hour will decide will be glad when morning come for work be trying keep on fancying hear noise fancy so too osgod said seems to like sort of whisper rustling of leaf be just what seems to osgod let stay where be be just in centre of line now there be certainly sound lord thought be fancy before be sure now hear something wulf said come from front run round to right bring sentry from flank post in interval of in front while do same on left have just returned when heard sharp sound like cracking of stick short distance in front dozen of sentry at once challenged in instant number of figure sprang to foot at distance of fifty yard in front of then wild yell be raised swarm of men came rushing towards while volley of arrow javelin whizzed through air fall back on others men wulf shouted at top of voice line of sentry rushed back to beorn party who leapt to foot at sound of welsh war cry have scarce formed in line when enemy be upon received with volley of javelin then shield to shield withstood attack be fighting in own way now numerous a welsh be be unable a ran up in scattered order to break through line steady men steady wulf shouted out from post in middle of line friend will soon be up show stout front give way foot in vain welshman with wild yell strove to beat back saxon line very number be hindrance to in front pressed forward so that behind be unable to use javelin arrow many creeping between leg of fighter of front rank leapt with cat like spring upon saxon strove to rip with knife light wicker work shield covered with leather have taken place of solid heavy one generally carried by housecarls stood wulf follower in good stead although many of shield be penetrated by knife of welsh in most case effectually screened body of soldier lightly armed welsh on other hand be hewn down by long sword of saxon in front rank while javelin of behind flew with terrible effect among assailant there be however pause in fury of attack of welsh until with great shout main body of saxon came up pressed forward in line with little body who have hitherto borne brunt of battle while on flank thane levy poured in volley after volley of dart arrow fight ceased a suddenly a began sound of deep toned horn rose in air whereupon welsh instantly abandoned struggle before saxon have time to realize that fighting be over have disappeared in forest by st peter young thane earl gurth exclaimed a came up to wulf band who be panting from exertion have saved from grievous mishap night take shame unto treated suggestion so lightly for by saint must have fared badly indeed have wild foe taken asleep thanks of whole force be due to will take care that brother harold know how narrow escape have have in telling tale will not spare older thane who be disposed to mock proposal to keep guard over camp a showing amount of caution altogether unnecessary attack have be lesson to that will not forget henceforth will select force for special service requiring watchfulness valour in going among men wulf beorn found that six have fallen for most part under shower of javelin with welsh have heralded attack many of others have received wound more le severe few of be so badly hurt a to render necessary to leave behind gurth called thane at once to council fresh wood be thrown on to fire twenty of thane took place round wulf beorn be specially asked by gurth to attend attack of welsh have shown that be by mean dismayed at extent of preparation for invasion of mountain that advance must be conducted with greatest caution prudence be well gurth said that in absence of griffith have many leader will therefore fight without general plan did whole force fall upon one other of column might go very hard with may be sure that chief will desire to keep follower by in order to defend own valley nevertheless have shown to night that can gather rapidly in considerable force will have to root out piecemeal will not be able to scatter force too widely be told that valley at whose mouth now be contains large number of village to must confine until have done work there trust that will oppose stoutly in case will have le trouble with when come to undertake more difficult task of pursuing among hill next morning advance began have proceeded short distance when welsh again poured down upon time force be prepared for attack although welsh fought obstinately be driven back without much difficulty a soon a attack ceased gurth gave order for pursuit housecarls held course straight up valley at full speed while levy swarmed up hillside to prevent welsh from rallying attacking in flank troop now felt benefit of abandonment of heavy armour weapon pressed so hotly upon flying welsh that entered first village with for time native turned fought desperately in defence of home be unable to withstand skill discipline of saxon troop measure that have so frequently dealt out to saxon villager now fell on quarter be given man woman child be slaughtered house given to flame village after village be captured burnt resistance became fainter fainter last three village at head of valley be found to be entirely deserted then just a sun set force bivouacked for night horn calling in scattered levy who gradually rejoined next morning force be broken up into five six column having proportion of regular soldier body of levy penetrated side valley climbed hill in many case encountered resistance stone being rolled down upon welsh defending strong barricade of felled tree everywhere saxon be successful day after day continued work until at end of five day be able to move where must without encountering resistance force now marched forward from head of valley crossed range of hill descended into valley have now grown more confident in while third of force proceeded to lay waste valley rest broken up into small column ascended hill on side carrying fire sword into hamlet came upon several of fortalices of welsh chief perched on almost inaccessible eminence gave great trouble be only taken after serious loss one day beorn wulf with own following two hundred fifty light armed levy be despatched by gurth to porthwyn stronghold belonging to powerful chief named llewellyn ap rhys be from hear said very strong place will require force to capture indeed be reported to be so strong that may be necessary to leave unmolested until form junction with harold can besiege regularly must not do to make unsuccessful attack for must raise spirit of welsh that wish of be to obtain view of castle from side if possible to bring back exact account of defence to give opinion a to chance of capturing if decide to lay siege to porthwyn be forty mile distant beorn wulf determined to march thirty of then to push forward at daybreak so a to obtain view of fortress in early morning took with welsh boy a guide have be spared in last village captured have be told that life depended upon guiding faithfully place of ten men who have fallen during various fight have be filled up by equal number of gurth own housecarls seventy soldier kept with leader guide levy spreading out on side two of irregular who spoke little welsh accompanied young thane to question guide if necessary march be heavy one at time passed through thick forest in valley on lower hillside at time crossed over bare hill on whose summit ground be frequently so boggy that men have to march with greatest caution guide sullen lad with matted hair whose only attire be sheep skin be several time questioned sharply a to whether be certain of way answered in monosyllable saying that knew foot of road indeed never hesitated for moment suppose be right wulf said although thought lay more to west than be going have wound about so among forest hill be quite confused there be one comfort beorn if guide prof treacherous lose altogether have to set face to rising sun will find back on border for be sure that must not retrace step to gurth camp sun be just setting when found on bare plateau on crest of range of hill higher than have before crossed ask how far be from porthwyn wulf said to interpreter say twelve mile lord then when get across flat look full two mile wide will camp in first valley come to a advanced ground became more more boggy troop have to move carefully stepping from one tussock of coarse grass to interval being filled with black slimy mud ask if get deeper beorn said angrily for if doe so be like to be swallowed up believe must be leading wrong osgod have charge of boy be walking close beside a question be put by interpreter boy muttered that knew way man turned to translate answer to beorn when there be sudden shout at moment that osgod be making long step from one tuft to boy stooped caught foot with roar of surprise fury osgod fell head foremost into morass at same moment lad darted away with yell of defiance leaping from tuft to tuft with agility of hare several of men started after unaccustomed to treacherous bog four five be immersed in to waist before have gone dozen pace shoot shoot beorn shouted dozen javelin be thrown boy be almost beyond distance rapid irregular movement rendered well nigh impossible to take aim with accuracy most of javelin flew wide of be soon beyond reach osgod be well nigh smothered before must be rescued of other men be only hauled out with greatest difficulty three four of most active men be sent forward presently returned with news that bog became worse sun have already set wulf said if darkness catch here plight will be bad one let retrace step at once beorn be with great difficulty that made way back to firm ground by time did so darkness have fallen be bad business altogether beorn wulf said in first place have lost guide in second place have idea where be for may for aught know have be going in wrong direction time besides boy will raise country against in morning may be attacked by overwhelming force what do think have better do wulf well must say have better in first place retrace step to valley there will light fire cook meat have brought with then must say have best march for hour matter not in what direction so that get a far a possible from here a beorn must suggest nothing better wulf counsel be carried out supper be cooked eaten in forest after two hour for rest for march have be very fatiguing one started night be moonless in shadow of tree darkness be intense housecarls kept together moving a closely a possible to other levy be ordered to follow after proceeding for two hour wulf said let halt see if be together housecarls halted when went to rear wulf must see sign of irregular let man speak move said want to listen sound broke stillness of wood how foolish of oswald edred said to beorn told to follow with levy close behind must have allowed to fall to rear however ca be far behind waited for hour silence continued unbroken do shout wulf said ought to hear mile away on still night like osgod who have scarcely spoken since fall so furious be at having be outwitted by boy having not only allowed to escape being rolled in mire raised voice in tremendous shout listened intently answering sound came back must have gone altogether wrong wulf said know that crossed streamlet ran into brook soon after started must have followed that up thinking have done so have gone up other valley what be to be done beorn crossed that streamlet hour after starting beorn said a have spent hour here must have by time marched up two hour journey if retrace step to point will have got hour half farther away besides may have gone back when missed there be saying way to look for think have better go on a before in morning will be able to see nature of country to look for people who may be mile mile away when one can not see one own hand must be lost time labour methinks will have need to husband strength before get out of scrape into have fallen if two thane have obeyed order kept closer must not have happened have lost by own carelessness must manage a can will have work to do to look out for ourselves seventy men lost in heart of savage hill by to morrow morning will swarm with welsh have poor chance of ever seeing english border again be not so bad a beorn say that be not in unpleasant position at rate be great deal better off than be when be driving headlong on to coast of normandy when there be three of in midst of breton have to find in first place will need good many of to overcome when do fancy that be very near head of valley ground be rising rapidly propose that push on now till tree cease lie down there till morning break then cross next hill so a to find shelter in other valley before sun be fairly up from top of hill may get general view of country will have idea a to course to take must first of try to find native who can tell be direction of porthwyn how far lie away order be to reconnoitre must be done before there be question of return even if be absolutely alone must carry out that order beorn be silent for minute then said doubtfully perhaps be right wulf when gurth gave order gave more than three hundred men to carry out have now seventy by time be on way up valley followed by men fact that two hundred fifty men have left really make matter easier than must otherwise have be wulf said of course guide carried news of coming straight to porthwyn be like enough that fire be at present blazing on hill larger division be more likely to be seen than ours to be attacked will have more chance of getting up unobserved sincerely trust that thane when discover that have lost will at once lead men back to gurth camp in case may escape before welsh can assemble attack a must naturally be supposed that a soon a have lost guide retreated in body welsh will imagine that there be occasion for further vigilance be always too full of argument for wulf beorn laughed if have made up mind to go on be not of least use saying anything against so have own way at last forest became le dense when reached edge lay down wulf slept for two three hour then roused waited for first sign of dawn be heavy responsibility for though beorn be of equal rank with always gave way to opinion thought over whether must not be better that beorn must march with speed with force to east that with osgod perhaps two other men must make way to porthwyn already welsh might be out over mountain be larger body must be likely to be discovered attacked welsh must know that on dark night in strange country must not have got very long distance from bog where guide have escaped from valley at whose head now be must be first place to be searched however did not like severing from men who have marched under banner from steyning finally determined that whole must stay together be about half past two when roused band at once started up bare hillside a get lighter said scatter proceed singly will be far le likely to be noticed by anyone at distance than if march together in solid body must travel a fast a possible so a to get under shelter again before sun be really up men be by time well accustomed to climbing hardened by exercise at rapid pace breasted hill although be in place exceedingly steep by time reached crest there be light enough to permit of view of country round in direction hill rose around bare brown growing light in sky showed that east lay behind after waiting for minute two to recover breath proceeded at brisk trot met with bog of importance after running for mile ground began to slope downwards again saw below wooded valley similar to have left by time hilltop be lit up by rising sun spot where stood however be still in shadow in scattered order ran rapidly down hillside until reached cover of tree chapter x porthwyn there be short halt to enable band to quench thirst at little rivulet trickled down centre of valley then prepared to continue march wulf impressing upon necessity for moving a silently a possible if come upon village of size said must avoid main point be to capture native find out exactly where be after walking for hour came suddenly upon hut stood in cleared patch of ground small herd of goat be browsing round smoke curled up from hole in roof wulf halted men beorn osgod one of interpreter have best go in alone there be not likely to be more than one two men within will be well at rate that number must not be known before advancing however told band to surround clearing let one escape said must cost life did one get away to tell of being here see too that bring down two three of goat meat be nearly exhausted be well to replenish store after waiting until men be in place wulf ran forward across open ground with three companion there be door to hut on entering saw that only occupant be decrepit old woman gave cry of dismay at entrance of stranger tell not to be alarmed wulf said to interpreter desire to do harm now ask if life here by went on when interpreter have spoken to old woman life here with two son man said be away there be beacon fire on hill last evening went out doe not know when will return ask how far be to porthwyn answer be most satisfactory be three mile away lord lie in valley of be branch be good news indeed beorn wulf said boy led in right direction perhaps because thought that if did not do so must perceive tax with treachery be more likely that wished to lead so close that must when escaped carry news of being in neighbourhood in time for welshman to surround cut off before must return a say that beacon fire be lighted in evening can have lost time country must be aroused wish have whole force here what will do with old crone beorn said must never do to risk giving alarm though look feeble might be able to get down to porthwyn will tie securely beorn ca hurt poor old creature son be doubt out with welsh band hunting for will return here sooner later so that harm will come to by order osgod securely bound old woman with rope found in hut then leaving went outside called upon men to close in eight of goat be killed be then cut up divided among men after consultation wulf beorn agreed that instead of following valley down where might meet with other hut even good sized village have best keep along on hillside just inside line of tree a in way must come out high up on side of main valley probably obtain good view of fortalice in single file made way among tree in hour valley that be in opened considerably through tree saw large village at foot quarter of mile farther stood on side of wide valley there be numerous flock herd to be seen grazing in four five village must be made out attention however be chiefly directed to object of journey three hundred foot below spot where stood rock jutted out from hillside extended five six hundred foot into valley side be perpendicular save where stood out from hill here strong wall forty foot high ran across two square tower stood at angle there be gateway visible wall be continued right round top of rock be crossed by two other wall defended by flanking tower castle stood at extremity of rock be strong massive looking building men be ordered to lie down a soon a castle be visible between tree among wulf beorn followed by osgod moved cautiously until reached spot whence must obtain through foliage full view of building be formidable place said beorn chief who first planted here knew what be doing yes must fancy from look of castle at end be built first then gradually wall be added until whole rock be inclosed bit nearest to be evidently addition during last few year can see that by colour of stone see other two wall have gateway in while have none must say until be built entrance to castle be along neck must have got other way now so shut up altogether how on earth can get in certainly not at side wulf said for be a near perpendicular a possible must be at other end of rock ca see may slope little more gradually there may have cut zigzag road up suppose climb hill behind till get high enough to see over tree get complete view of valley there be fear of being noticed be good five hundred foot above now even if anyone did see up there must take for two herdsman of course will leave shield weapon behind on attaining spot from clear view of whole valley must be obtained wulf said there beorn do see hill jut out into plain on right half mile from castle be wooded to foot think if be to make way down there must be able to obtain view of face of rock below castle without leaving shelter of tree beorn agreed that be worth trying returned to men rearmed spoke to osgod be going to reconnoitre osgod may be hour away a will not leave forest there be danger even be seen can climb hill again a fast a welshman can follow do keep eye on castle stir until return even if hear shout have doubt that will be able to rejoin be most important that even if do make out must have reason for supposing that there be force behind after hour walking beorn wulf found at edge of wood in valley there be road see wulf exclaimed go straight up that gradual slope to bottom of rock then make two zigzag to edge of point jut out little whence there be bridge thrown across gap to point where there be turret ca see beyond must think must have driven tunnel from there right up into castle for see there be fifty foot of perpendicular rock above turret in case of attack of course must cut away bridge must be next to impossible to throw across must overwhelm force attempting with stone from above besides sweeping zigzag road below beorn agreed that place be absolutely impregnable on side that must only be attacked from hillside by carrying wall in succession well there be nothing more to see wulf said so may a well return see there be large village nestling down there just at foot of rock must not see from where be before well osgod have seen anything going on in castle lord everything have be very quiet seems to that there be very few men about for such strong place doubt most of be out in pursuit of osgod know that country be roused by beacon that there must be big force somewhere in hill only hope wont find oswald edred fear will go hard with levy fight well when have housecarls with by in strange country be afraid must lose heart now beorn be going down to wall on side can see that there be sentry on want to find out if there be other defence besides what can see be very important to know that a agreed that be side from attack must be made descending among tree wulf cautiously approached wall found on nearing that perpendicular cut thirty foot wide twenty foot deep have be made across rock stretched from foot of one flanking tower to foot of other wall between being ten foot from edge having ascertained returned to beorn having told what have seen sat looking at castle what be thinking of wulf beorn asked suppose have better stop where be till then make eastward be thinking in first place that must cost great number of life to take place by assault that must beorn agreed have seen place of anything like equal strength in wale indeed anywhere else there be doubt about wulf agreed if well defended ought to hold out for week for when have taken that wall in front of only third of work have be done in next place be thinking that llewellyn greater part of garrison be away in hill beorn nodded that being so seems to that best plan will be to take beorn looked at friend to see if be serious there be smile on wulf face do really mean wulf yes mean certainly what be to prevent taking there may never be such good opportunity again have not seen dozen men on wall suppose there be fifty there altogether even if there be hundred will have chance with men if be once among see gate through inner wall be open once over first one place will be open to be true enough how in world be to climb that wall be what be puzzling over beorn see there be time to lose for llewellyn men may be back to night if find be party morning will return at once if may not be back till morning can not count on have to be done must be done at once sat thinking little longer must cut down couple of tree make ladder beorn pine tree grew very close together where passed through quarter of mile before got here be very slender for height have ax must fell couple of in few minute even if have must not dare use for chance be that villager be forbidden to cut down tree anywhere near castle sound might bring people up from below to see who be chopping be thinking of burning two of down in dry weather flame might run up must get blaze must bring villager up here beckoned to osgod when came up told that beorn have agreed to try take place be good osgod said joyfully have be thinking of did not see how be to climb that wall must cut down two young pine tree must not chop down must take long time with knife osgod said doubtfully be easy enough to cut through pole three inch thick when come to nine ten be different matter then must cut down small one tie together bring twenty men at once with osgod let rest lie quiet le movement there be better a soon a men be ready wulf led back to point where pine tree grew then selected eight of tallest slightest be about three inch through at foot be judged at least inch half at twenty foot from ground two men be set to work at tree in le than hour eight tree be on ground branch be then lopped off four of stem be cut across five twenty foot from foot thin end be then placed together so a to overlap five foot there be difficulty about lashing a thong be cut off bottom of men leather jerkin joint be made stronger by light pole fifteen foot long being firmly lashed across junction thus two pole for ladder forty five foot long be ready for use needed only to lash cross piece for step in little over hour from time that work be begun ladder be complete from other young tree two ladder twenty five foot long have be constructed in meantime whole be then raised carried back to place where band be lying now men wulf said be going to take castle at once must wait until be not that fear return of welsh a may come back at time there be not minute to be lost now let understand work short ladder be to enable to cross cut twenty foot deep have made through rock when get over can plant long ladder against wall a soon a gain top man must lie down crawl along over who have preceded if be seen before few of be on top of wall will fail because will have time to give alarm shut inner gate so far have seen one go in out of court between wall have hope that will find one there expect be place where cattle be kept in case of siege great danger be in chance of being noticed by men on other part of wall on castle however a far a can see attention be entirely directed other way for be doubt on look out for news from chief for return intention be that will gain top of wall before movement be made if alarm be given who have got to top be at once to follow down staircase into courtyard run at full speed to gate not moment halt be to be made there must run on to next gate there defend until rest come to aid will be taken so completely by surprise even if be four five can hold gate until rest come up man a soon a gain top of ladder must run on at full speed to aid cut down with arm in hand hurt woman child tell off six men osgod to carry ladder place against wall to be first to follow let others follow in order in stand in rank made way down through tree a soon a reached cut one short ladder be lowered other be handed down placed against opposite side of cut end of long ladder be then lowered be swung over upper end placed against wall six men then ascended short ladder raised long one until stood on rock at foot of castle wall now beorn do mount first will follow must go first beorn said will do a tell a soon a beorn be way up wulf began to follow saying to osgod men keep same distance apart let more than two be on ladder at once happens inside if be to break must be fatal to a soon a gained top wulf threw down by side of beorn lay there watching men on other wall on summit of castle osgod four men have joined when wulf noticed sudden stir heard shout leapt to foot follow quickly be careful of ladder called to below then dashed along wall to top of staircase closely followed by others ran down on through gate in next wall here five six men be asleep in shade while woman be standing in front of low hut bordered yard on side gazed in astonishment for moment at seven men who appeared so suddenly from outer yard then set up shrill cry of alarm without heeding wulf ran on to next gateway just a reached number of men came running up from other side osgod do alfred cover rear while keep men in front at five men held gate without difficulty against welsh who first arrived for at shout of one of comrade that men be climbing wall have run down only with knife must hing against saxon shield long sword presently others with spear ax ran up two young thane three follower still kept back for in narrow gateway must not be attacked by more than own number amid yell of welsh wulf must hear nothing of what be passing behind be delighted when heard voice of osgod in ear there be eight here now wulf have finished with welshman in courtyard so be clear behind men be coming down from wall fast in five minute will have whole band here now let have turn stepped forward took place of one of saxon who staggered back with javelin in shoulder moment added to number of saxon let know when be up wulf said to one of behind a cut down welshman who sprang at with uplifted knife attack be growing weaker a assailant saw that instead of five men have now to face considerable number wulf have difficulty in restraining men keep back shouted must wait until be up then drive before follow into castle if have once time to shut door there will have troublesome task a spoke yielded place in front rank to one of follower turned to see how matter stood behind be up asked last man told that there be six more to come lord then need wait longer now beorn be ready charge with rush saxon swept through gate carrying welsh before hewing down front rank in instant defender turned fled saxon pressed hard on heel of welsh ran up staircase to wall many of saxon must have followed at wulf to castle to castle can deal with afterwards followed at once on step up to gateway of castle desperate struggle be going on among welsh seeing saxon pressing on rear of fugitive within castle strove to shut door strove in vain a terror stricken men outside tried to force way in two young thane with osgod many of follower cut way through struggling mass reached door trying to shut have already seen hopelessness of endeavour have fled into hall beyond in number of terrified woman be wailing shrieking a wulf burst in shouted to welsh throw down arm surrender life will be spared word be not understood a welsh never gave quarter have thought of quarter being offered to woman ceased screaming broke into death chant many of seizing weapon from wall joining men in last desperate effort to drive back saxon for moment who have entered have difficulty in resisting desperate attack a others poured in advanced although wulf continued to shout spare who throw down arm order be of avail for welsh continued to fight desperately until last fell under saxon sword most of woman who fought with even greater fury than men sharing fate a soon a struggle be over wulf ordered osgod to take eight ten men to find entrance to tunnel leading down to road on face of cliff to guard against attack from without then through interpreter called to welshman on wall that life must be spared if must lay down arm be answered by derisive shout shower of javelin must lose good many men in storming two narrow staircase beorn there be twenty thirty of be enough to defend such steep approach let take twenty men up to top of castle from there can hurl javelin down at will soon see resistance be useless ascended stair paused at end of room over hall have be scene of conflict aged woman whose dress showed high rank be seated on settle beside be white headed harper while two little child boy girl stood at knee looked fearlessly at intruder wulf despatched one of men down to hall to bring up interpreter a soon a arrived wulf doffed helmet stepped forward ask who lady be who be child at gesture from old lady harper answered be mistress gweneth mother of prince llewellyn ap rhys be child in name bid defiance have taken castle will know how to avenge child have desire intention of acting with disrespect still le of injuring mistress child of llewellyn wulf replied when be translated to friend be saxon thane who have be forced to leave home to embark on war in order to put stop to ravage committed across border burning of town village massacre of men woman child by countryman llewellyn ap rhys have brought misfortune upon did render motherless childless must be fate that follower have inflicted upon many englishman make war upon woman child prisoner of course must be be assured of honourable treatment none will enter room save with permission can have female attendant to serve a usual while interpreter be repeating speech wulf beorn left room with men ascended to top of castle where be joined by interpreter who addressed welsh on wall replied with shout of defiance volley of javelin be poured down upon three four be struck rest seeing that hope be gone rapidly gathered in body at head of staircase leading from wall be going to run down beorn exclaimed leaning over parapet shouted to saxon in courtyard below to stand on guard minute later welsh rushed down intent on killing at least one foe before died saxon weapon discipline be however too much for fought until last not one of throwing down weapon asking for quarter be brave men must that be not forced to slay be choosing not ours beorn if must leave alone be sure that nobody must wish to interfere with wild countryman what be next thing to be done wulf must say let turn woman child save old lady attendant out of castle must only be trouble to then must examine store of provision plant sentry cut away bridge at rate cut away so much of that blow two with axe will suffice to send down must not forget to haul up ladder llewellyn men may be back at moment let go down together to turret saw on face of rock order be at once given woman child collected told to leave castle be allowed to carry away with eight ten men who be found to be still living went for most part in silence of elder woman poured out voluble curse on saxon beorn wulf have already gone down to turret there be very strong gateway in courtyard beyond tunnel sloping steeply down eight foot high four foot wide have be cut in solid rock following emerged upon platform principally occupied by turret path led through strong gateway under on to wooden bridge here osgod with ten men have taken station woman child few wounded will be coming down directly osgod a soon a have passed do set to work with men pull up planking of bridge save single plank loosen so that can if necessary at once cast down after rest if see welshman pouring up road throw over at once without waiting for further order then close gate take station in turret be getting very hungry master have eaten nothing morning fighting sharpens appetite have forgotten about osgod will see food be cooked at once will send down portion for men tankard of liquor can find in cellar be going to make examination of at once returning to courtyard told off body of men to search cellar granary be glad to find that there be ample store of grain to last for month together with large quantity of ale few cask of wine so far be well beorn said must not be prudent to send off at once to gurth to let know that though be master of castle at present may in few hour be surrounded by swarm of angry welshman that certainly be most desirable wulf agreed question be who be to send must be terribly dangerous enterprise even now there be score of men from village watching movement from wood above at rate must wait until four sentry be posted on wall by have ascended a after making circuit of place be agreed only point at surprise be possible unless there existed secret passage into castle have just finished inspection of wall when there be shout from look out at top of castle great number of men be coming down valley cried to thane in courtyard below at once mounted to battlement mile away great number of men must be seen running at top of speed there be order formation among be few horseman riding in knot together round number of footman be running in close mass by far greater proportion straggled across valley being considerable distance behind rest be like swarm of bee beorn said yes be just a angry of course news of what have happened here be sent off to at once have brought back again trust that reached before came upon oswald party must have be on return beorn said be two hour ago that won castle have swift messenger started moment news reached village have known exactly position where must find llewellyn must not have taken news to brought back here have be eight mile away must be farther than to spot where lost oswald a thane must surely be making way back to camp eastward to border must have be many mile from here hour since know that welsh levy be summoned in evening probably reached spot where be deserted by guide before daybreak took up search at once therefore think wulf there can be doubt that messenger from here must have met a be returning whether have overtaken destroyed oswald command have failed in search for can not tell wulf shook head fear former be most likely welsh here must know foot of mountain so that by scattering through valley must scarcely fail to come upon trace of oswald passage must pursue a hotly a wolf chase deer only hope be that oswald may have established at daybreak morning in strong position fortified there in hope that might rejoin that llewellyn have not begun attack upon when news reached of capture of castle how many think be there in approaching throng four five thousand must say yes quite five thousand beorn at call of watchman men have of own accord mounted to wall have better divide command beorn said force be double mine for present will undertake defence of rear wall if will take front of course till attack actually commences will not be necessary to keep more than strong guard on duty certainly not wulf agreed danger will be far greater at night than by day must give men a much rest a possible think that with men half of mine ought to take command in front while with rest defend rear not at wulf be affair altogether must never have thought of trying to take castle be idea have be carried out by altogether be much fuller of plan than be will do best to second must continue to be head in matter very well beorn refuse to be considered in command will apportion force a suggest will take care at rate welsh will not capture castle a rapidly a did so will put four men always on duty at of gate in interior wall so that if by chance manage to effect entrance into one of yard will be able to get farther until whole force can assemble to oppose chapter xi secret passage beorn called men together distributed along rear wall while wulf made fresh examination of front have before noticed that great pile of stone in block from fifty to hundred pound in weight be piled along by parapet in readiness to hurl down upon foe attempting to ascend road while in courtyard below be immense reserve of missile placed twenty of men here posted other ten a sentry on side wall then went down through passage to osgod bridge be entirely demolished a have directed with exception of single plank must be thrown over in moment osgod have closed gate have fastened rope from top of turret to plank so that must be hauled up without engaged in operation being exposed to missile from other side of chasm one feel almost ashamed at being so safe osgod said a wulf joined on turret doe not give one chance of fight have have one good fight to day osgod can do without must be glad if did not have to strike blow till see gurth banner coming down valley have done very well osgod agreed must be quite contented if have come across rascal who nearly smothered in bog need not bear malice against osgod for if have not deserted led llewellyn force away to spot where left must not be master of place a at present must have be terrible business have be obliged to take stronghold by storm be true enough master except by hunger by surprise such a carried out see how place be to be taken if stoutly defended there be reason why welsh must have be in such hurry to return for must know a well a do that there be little chance of getting in again have come to halt now down there half of have thrown on ground like pack of tired hound have fear whatever of open attack osgod can see for that bridge be destroyed think will dream of coming up road a know can sweep with stone from above if attack openly at will be by wall scaled if make twenty ladder such a have may think might gain footing especially a archer high among tree must be able to fire down on defender of wall what be really afraid of be that there may be secret passage do think so osgod said startled where must come from well osgod see have cut winding road up rock have made tunnel hence to courtyard so chief have have abundance of labour at disposal must naturally wish to provide mean of escape if castle be besieged like to fall by force famine moreover must enable to send out messenger receive message from without passage four foot high two foot wide must suffice may have driven passage from place in wood behind may come up somewhere in courtyard perhaps in one of little hut along side of course entrance must be covered here by stone must be hidden among bush at other end still think that be likely for hostile force must almost certainly take up post in wood attack place in rear if there be such passage think that must open somewhere on face of rock on one side other look to almost perpendicular there may be inequality by active men might ascend at point other for considerable distance must see there be tuft of shrub growing here there one of may conceal small opening from point staircase may have be driven up into castle must be very awkward master if be so must indeed to night force except sentry will gather in castle where ten men by turn will keep guard one two being placed in lower chamber in way will be safe for before more than three four can enter must be on foot a can come up in single file must repulse without difficulty tomorrow will lower men down with rope from wall examine clump of bush growing on face of rock if find sign of path entrance will have difficulty in discovering where enters into castle can effectually block up will then feel much more comfortable than do at present be looking forward to good night sleep osgod grumbled idea master have quite done away with if went off must dream have one of welsh wolf at throat however be good thing that thought of think lord one of soldier said there be number of men among welsh can make out helmet shield think many be clad in leather jerkin wulf looked attentively yes there be certainly shield helmet said fear there be doubt have overtaken oswald levy have made prisoner wulf shook head never take prisoner know fear have slain possessed of arm clothes in other way can there be saxon shield helmet among by st nicholas osgod exclaimed be too bad that must be standing here doing nothing why doe llewellyn attack instead of keeping men gaping there at castle because at present can hing be not fool enough to throw away hundred of life besides must know that mother child be in hand presently white flag be raised among welsh wulf have expected have ordered white cloth to be held in readiness to raise in reply a soon a flew out to wind three men be seen to advance with flag towards foot of road up to castle wulf at once sent for two interpreter to join will let come up master osgod asked be a treacherous a snake see how boy led astray in bog can not get that boy out of head osgod wulf laughed there be conceivable way by three men must recapture castle there be nothing for to learn know strength everything connected with can see for that have destroyed bridge will be glad to hear what have to say llewellyn be most likely one of number little party mounted road until stood on platform from bridge started one of be tall figure dressed in armour with long black hair flowing down from under helmet over shoulder wulf at once from description have heard of chief appearance recognized a llewellyn ap rhys must speak with commander of saxon who have in absence taken castle by treachery be commander wulf said welshman finger clenched glanced furiously at young saxon by great effort however restrained passion said courteously be llewellyn ap rhys to whom have pleasure of speaking be wulf of steyning prince know altogether have taken castle by treachery indeed claim to have won by fair fighting went out with force to attack among hill during absence attacked captured castle will do garrison credit to say fought bravely in spite of surprise must gladly have given quarter refused offer save few wounded whom allowed woman to carry off died to man fighting bravely woman be hurt insulted save who took up arm fought among men be fault of ours that be killed methinks that in incursion into england have not always shown same mercy llewellyn be silent for minute have indeed never shown pity in foray have never expected that castle family must be in hand of saxon learn said at last from woman mother child be alive in hand thank for honorable treatment hear that have received be safe well wulf replied saxon massacre woman child in cold blood will be honourably treated until can hand over to care of earl gurth who will doubtless send to england a hostage will try to win back castle llewellyn said may be sure that happens will be safe may even be forcing way into castle will guarantee that hair of head will be injured now prince be turn to question see saxon helmet shield among follower whence come cloud passed over llewellyn face have not reckoned on being observed from castle concealment be now out of question said boldly defeated party of countryman morning came with hostile intent into territory have be destroyed although have expected answer wulf be shocked at confirmation of fear llewellyn indeed have fallen on oswald levy annihilated soon after daybreak having idea that party have separated from during night be returning exulting in idea that have destroyed whole of invader when news have reached of capture of castle wulf be silent be fortune of war said gravely be not to that have to reckon for deed with earl gurth for whom hold castle llewellyn made reply with wave of hand turned went down hill again be even more than before convinced osgod that there be secret passage be watching closely when interpreter told must hand mother child over to gurth pressed lip together face lighted up with exultation for moment what do think came here for master came here to assure if possible that life must not be sacrificed in event of attacking be pity told must be safe osgod said will be safe even if be surprised slain must not that llewellyn must say that be only suddenness of attack that saved life will place two of best men at door with order come what may be to prevent anyone from entering think will come to must passage enter into castle a if exists have doubt doe will be prepared to deal with if open elsewhere will have force save few sentry assembled though wall fall into hand ought to be able to hold successfully till gurth arrives to rescue wulf returned to castle then joined beorn at post on wall facing wood communicated to idea a to probable existence of secret passage must provide mode of retreat for men on guard here beorn in case welsh enter by of yard instead of by castle flanking tower at angle of wall cut off passage will construct bridge with two three plank across tower so that sentry can retreat from rear wall to next again on to inner door between courtyard will be closed so that must enter of outer court will be delayed men will have plenty of time to join in defence of last wall however be convinced castle will be scene of action five sentry will be enough to place on wall will put two on of cross wall so that if men give alarm will be passed along speedily will remove last plank of bridge at nightfall have osgod four men in turret two on wall above will therefore have fifty five men in castle must be ample can keep watch watch so there will be over twenty five men under arm ready to throw upon welsh wherever may enter arrangement be carried out at ten o'clock light be extinguished save torch burning in room on ground floor floor wall have be carefully examined sounded nothing suspicious have be discovered four men be told off to room except great hall where twenty be gathered in reserve half be to keep watch be to lie down order to who be to keep awake be strict if heard noise saw stone move be to keep silent until two three men have stepped out then be to give alarm leap up throw upon be alarm given said before fairly issued out stone might be moved back again must give immense trouble before must demolish find secret of spring therefore let get footing first from time to time beorn wulf got up went noiselessly round to different room to see that watch be vigilant a have be arranged of on guard raised hand a entered room so a to show that be awake wulf did not expect that attempt must be made before midnight after hour sat in corner of dais leaning a if asleep with eye wandering round room watching stone ear listening for faintest sound have feeling of sleepiness sens being strung up to highest pitch from time to time held up hand ten others be at once elevated showing that watcher be a vigilant a be thought about one o'clock when heard faint creaking sound did not seem to to be in hall in room adjoining door having be left open rose to foot touched beorn who lay pace two away stole noiselessly out grasping sword in hand stopped before got to open door of next room listened seemed perfectly quiet stood motionless until minute later there be sudden shout followed almost instantly by clash of arm with shout to follower wulf ran into room four saxon be on foot be attacking three men who a entered be joined by fourth from behind beorn threw into fray just a one of saxon fell with head cloven by sweeping blow from tall figure opposed to one after in rapid succession welsh poured in from narrow opening saxon rushed up in overwhelming number there be brief fierce fight welsh be slain overpowered men who last emerged turned to fly meeting crowding up from behind be unable to do so others ran in only to be cut down a soon a appeared sound of fierce shouting angry struggle came through opening when more showed wulf called for torch dozen be soon at hand seizing one passed through narrow opening winding staircase met view with beorn saxon following close behind descended for considerable distance then found in low narrow passage following for twenty yard stepped out into open air need do more to night beorn said will see where come out block up in morning though be not likely to try again can sleep now without fear of interruption first step be to examine body of fallen welshman have recognized in tall man with whom have crossed sword llewellyn ap rhys found lying beneath four of follower who have stood over defended to last be glad to find that welsh prince still lived directed that must be at once carried to room that attention must be shown none of other fourteen welshman who have fallen showed sign of life ordering body to be carried out into courtyard wulf placed four men on guard at upper opening of secret passage be to be relieved hour then went out saw to relief of sentry on wall called down to osgod that attack have be made repulsed then went back slept soundly till daybreak on going to wall learned that there have be great commotion down in valley fierce shout loud wailing cry confused sound of running talking have be heard at daybreak welsh be still there fire have be lighted one party be seen to march away a soon a be light others arrived number appeared about same a on previous evening there be general movement must be seen that gathered in cluster listened to men who addressed with animated gesture know what to do wulf said to osgod whom have joined in turret believe chief to be dead know that mother child be prisoner in hand can have little hope of capturing place believe to be impregnable to open attack at present must be without leader yet must be so animated by spirit of hate revenge by desire to wipe out humiliation by retaking place that will not stir from in front of a spoke messenger came from beorn saying that welsh be pouring arrow javelin from hill upon sentry on wall that be unable to show head above parapet in one of shed large quantity of hide have be found taking party laden with proceeded to wall at rear here directed ladder be still lying there to be cut up into length of eight foot be fixed at interval upon parapet cord fastened along top men engaged in operation being protected by shield of comrade from rain of missile from tree hide be thrown over rope hid on wall from view of enemy while must peep out from time to time between hide to see that preparation be being made for attack secret passage be next investigated be found that opening be about half way down rock that assailant must have climbed up by path that goat must scarce traverse wulf set party to work to carry down stone from courtyard to block up passage solidly for ten foot from opening sentry being posted on wall above after erection of shelter of hide welsh only sent occasional javelin from tree by loud yell be from time to time raised there be doubt be still there in force be evident that be going to besiege beorn wulf said when sat down to breakfast together question be be to remain here until rumour carry report of capture of place to gurth will despatch messenger to a said yesterday messenger must never get away wulf must give year revenue if must do so for may be long time before news come to gurth ear may possibly hear of annihilation of oswald force for welsh woman taken captive might mention that in triumph must certainly say nothing of such grievous blow to welsh cause a capture of porthwyn death of llewellyn in attempt to recapture gurth therefore naturally supposing that have be involved in oswald disaster may abandon idea of moving against place until greater part of country be reduced to obedience see beorn that difficulty of messenger getting through must be indeed enormous welsh must know that be small band that first aim must be to communicate with gurth may be sure therefore will keep vigilant guard round place at night to see that messenger make way out two interpreter know anything like enough welsh to pas a native none of people know word of language must be sending anyone to almost certain death think must be content to depend upon ourselves gurth be sure to learn news sooner later for will make great stir through country have just seen llewellyn be very sorely wounded think must be good thing to let welsh know that be in hand will render more chary of attacking might hang out flag of truce when come up in reply tell that be alive sorely wounded that may send up leech who must better attend to wound than can do be accordingly done two welshman of rank came up to broken bridge be informed that prince be sorely wounded that leech must be allowed to enter to attend upon hour later man with boy carrying large basket came up hill crossed plank into turret basket contained various herb medicament be taken from boy who be then sent back again while leech be taken up to room where llewellyn be lying in care of mother maid three day passed without change force in valley be seen to be considerably diminished hostile demonstration have taken place twenty men always remained in courtyard in rear in readiness to run up to wall in case sentry gave alarm on fourth morning just a day be breaking man ran into castle with news that welsh be attacking wall beorn wulf sprung to foot with man except on duty a sentry ran off to scene of attack that be serious assault be evident by wild yell shout be heard wulf ran up stair to wall storm of missile be striking against hide many of failed to penetrate others did so several of men be lying wounded under shelter of parapet while rest be hurling down javelin between opening of hide be doing asked sub officer in command of party be preparing to scale wall lord have number of ladder be about to look out between hide officer exclaimed so risk life lord can see down without danger pushed out lower side of one of skin from wall so that wulf must look down without being seen by welsh archer fosse in rock narrow platform at foot of wall be alike crowded with foe who be planting number of ladder side by side be strongly constructed be wide enough for two men to mount abreast eight ten of ladder be already planted against wall enemy be climbing up wulf turned waving sword shouted to men running into courtyard from wall castle to hasten up already dozen have joined scarce have placed along battlement when head of welshman appeared above for minute two seemed that must overmaster defence several succeeded in crossing parapet be either cut down cast headlong into courtyard by time whole of saxon save guard in turret by bridge be on wall be able to form close line along parapet against ladder be placed welsh fought with utter disregard of life a fast a at top be cut down hurled backwards others took place so closely did swarm up ladder that several of broke with weight killing many of clustered below a well a on rung for hour there be pause be well for defender that have protection of line of hide be therefore screened from arrow of bowman on hill soon ceased to shoot a many of comrade be hit by missile while be unable to see whether arrow have effect upon hidden defender at length leader of assailant saw that task must not be achieved gave signal by blowing of cow horn that attack must cease so furious be follower that many disregarded summons continued effort to gain footing upon wall at least to kill one of defender for time after main body have withdrawn a soon a last of be killed garrison hurled ladder backwards then gave shout of triumph be answered by renewed yell of defiance by welsh have be hard fight wulf beorn said a removed helmet have indeed be well planned attack be nearly successful ought to have have stronger guard there did not think that must venture to attack at daylight that must have so quickly run forward placed ladder have be minute later in arriving here must have gained wall courtyard must indeed have got farther success must have so excited that must have have to fight night day what have be loss five of men be killed many of others have received severe wound on head shoulder from knife of assailant have not be for protection afforded by leathern helmet jerkin number of killed must have be very much larger must a lief fight with troop of wild cat exclaimed osgod who a soon a saw that there be movement down on plain have run up with little garrison to join in defence of wall a tried to staunch deep wound extended from ear to chin over over again saw shock head come up above wall before have time to take fair blow at man must hurl over upon like wild animal three time be knocked down be chicken either if have not be for comrade on side must have gone hard with be able to return service several time have welsh be imp must not have be more active more fierce there must be hundred lying slain along here in courtyard wonder that oswald men be killed by though after previous fight held in small respect be different thing osgod beorn said in field have always have advantage from order discipline here be man against man have advantage of position of number discipline went for nothing on side doubt if must have done a well a did have be assailant be ready to own osgod agreed like to fight with foot on firm ground must make poor figure balanced on top of ladder when tumult in wood have died away wulf raised white flag ordered one of men who spoke welsh to shout to enemy that might approach without molestation remove wounded dead from foot of wall also said that saxon leader desired to speak to officer of rank two of came out from tree hitherto interpreter cried with loud voice lord noble thane beorn of fareham wulf of steyning have given most honourable treatment to chief llewellyn ap rhys wounded prisoner in hand to family have altered that treatment while be attacking wall bid warn others in arm against authority of sovereign lord king henceforth will hold a hostage life will be forfeited if fresh attack be made upon castle three day passed without further act of hostility by welsh at end of time llewellyn be sufficiently recovered to sit up supported by pillow on couch have already heard of defeat with terrible slaughter of attempt of countryman to recapture castle of warning have be given welsh that if attack be renewed life of family must be forfeited beorn wulf paid visit a soon a heard that be in condition to talk to prince wulf said through interpreter be must see hopeless for follower to attempt to recapture castle bridge be destroyed secret passage by entered blocked up can resist attack upon rear wall have shown yours mercy such a must certainly not have extended to english men woman under similar circumstance grieved a must be to be obliged to proceed to extremity with prisoner yet be castle again attacked be to see that there be prospect of being recaptured must not hesitate to slay a must be treachery to king to allow so formidable enemy a to regain freedom cause be hopeless harold tostig gurth be carrying fire sword through valley people will have to choose between submission death why must so hopeless struggle continue gurth will be here shortly then fate have befallen district already subdued will light upon surely will be better for people that must be averted can only be done by sending order to follower to scatter to home to lay down arm will at once in case send messenger to earl to tell that district have submitted must request that in order message will reach will bid two officer of rank accompany messenger to gurth camp giving undertaking that will be allowed to leave unmolested offer tally with own intention llewellyn said have be free must have resisted to last a prisoner with mother child in hand be powerless harper tell that fully four hundred of follower fell in attack with stronghold in power tribesman without leader army desolating land see that further resistance here must add to misfortune of people be ready therefore to send down harper doctor to bid four of chief come up here under safe conduct will lay matter before tell that being prisoner can no longer give order will point out to that in opinion further resistance can bring terrible disaster upon district on return will lay before men if a trust will agree to scatter to home will furnish escort desire for messenger two hour later three of chief summoned arrived fourth having fallen in assault have private interview with llewellyn then left great meeting be held down in valley in afternoon three chief six others came up to castle formally made submission before beorn wulf besought to send messenger to earl praying to forgive past offence to have mercy on people hour later two of saxon bearing letter from beorn wulf to gurth started under escort provided by chief chapter xii edith two day after departure of messenger from castle look out gave notice that perceived large body of horseman footman coming down valley hour later banner of gurth must be made out garrison at once set to work to replace planking of bridge be accomplished by time that saxon earl accompanied by several thane followed by strong body of troop reached platform at other end a did so beorn wulf crossed bridge to meet have done well indeed thane gurth exclaimed have made conquest to be proud of for a rode along place seemed to well nigh impregnable messenger have told how captured how stoutly have since defended be daring thought indeed to attempt assault of place with handful of men have rendered splendid service to king for with capture of fortress of llewellyn child there be fear that there will be trouble in part of wale for year to come too be specially indebted to for have be forced to besiege place must only have be taken with vast loss of life might well have resisted effort that seventy men must have taken even if weakly defended be wonderful indeed be to wulf lord that credit be chiefly due beorn said be who proposed planned attack though have done best to support have acted a second in command be quicker witted than be far more fitted to lead wulf be about to speak when gurth stopped with gesture of hand at rate beorn said posse quality be by mean common that be brave soldier know well so trust be thane still be not one who have wit to perceive that have sharper wit than still fewer who must have generosity to stand aside to give major share in exploit like to what may lose in credit by avowal will at least gain in esteem of now commandant said to wulf with smile show way into capture of yours before entering castle gurth made detour of wall upon seeing be still more surprised than before at manner in capture have be effected see thane said matter hinged on possession of gate through cross wall that rear wall must have be taken by surprise be daring action must have availed nothing have garrison have time to close even second of gate for though a seems more numerous than men must have easily held until reinforced from village below must then have turned table on assailant capture be due to quickness boldness with wulf beorn with few men who have obtained footing on wall when alarm be given rushed forward held inner gateway until rest came up gurth paused for time on wall above point where secret passage came out on face of rock having asked many question a to how be that be so well prepared for llewellyn follower when made attack commended wulf very strongly for conduct in matter others might have taken castle a did young thane said assuredly most must have lost again for having set guard on wall must have given up to feasting sleep without thought there might possibly exist secret passage through rock look a if nothing short of winged army must scale what say thane saxon cordially agreed with earl be stout fighter better in field than in council be in small degree to danish blood in vein that son of godwin owed vigour intellect have raised family to so lofty position among countryman on concluding inspection of wall gurth entered castle after first examining entrance to secret passage sat down with thane to banquet preparation of have be begun a soon a coming be perceived after gurth paid visit to llewellyn fate be not in hand prince said to in of brother harold a however have used influence to persuade people to submit will do best to induce to take favourable view of case next day main body of gurth force arrived encamped in valley llewellyn chief came in made submission people for most part took to hill a day after day news came of terrible retaliation dealt out by troop of harold tostig lost heart altogether sent in messenger craving to be allowed to come in lay down arm gurth at once accepted submission hundred returned to home in other part of wale feeling that resistance be vain rapidly extended most fertile valley have be turned into desert even on own hill among own forest where have hitherto deemed safe from attack be pursued hunted down by now lightly armed saxon from part therefore offer to submit be sent in a proof of submission regret for past behaviour seized griffith king killed sent head to harold who thereupon granted term ordered force to withdraw beyond border campaign have lasted le than three month so terrible have be blow dealt to welsh that hundred year passed before again ventured to renew incursion into england llewellyn be pardoned great breach be made in wall of fortress facing hill be forbidden ever to repair child be taken to england to be brought up there to serve a hostage for future good behaviour harold when learnt particular of capture defence of porthwyn expressed approval in warmest term have performed greatest most important feat of war wulf said yes be right that must give credit beorn for share in matter know well be assured that beorn must never have conceived carried out attack have done so successfully men must have be slain by llewellyn night beorn be good youth be brave kind hearted be fool will make excellent thane will become favourite at court be always loyal staunch will look to see more than have head quick to plan readiness decision in danger a have shown genius for war study writing of roman greatest

close wulf have be present at two great event at abbey at banquet knew better than most of present that gravity on harold face be not caused solely by mighty responsibility that have assumed by sad thought in heart wulf on return from abbey have handed to harold small roll of parchment have be slipped into hand by man who at once disappeared in crowd after handing to with word for king in interval before banquet handed to harold who have opened glanced at have then abruptly turned away contained word that god may bless dear lord king be prayer of edith do know where be harold asked abruptly turning upon wulf lord have respected wish made inquiry king said others think doubtless be rejoicing at having gained object of ambition a god know must far rather have remained earl of west

without making public inquiry charge to do so to tell on day have thought mostly of tell not where be what be done can not be undone must fain that in time be to come may at least know where to send message must be needful chapter xiv wulf suspicion beyond fact that name of king have changed death of edward accession of harold made sensible difference in government of southern half of england harold have practically reigned for year fact that be now able to give order direct instead of having nominally to consult edward have only effect that affair of state moved somewhat more promptly such of norman favourite of edward a desired to leave be permitted to do so be honourably escorted to coast many remained norman prelate abbot retained dignity undisturbed several of court official of

engagement to marry one of william daughter be received with honour harold informed that must without delay reply to duke summons few day later three thane of high rank started for normandy with harold reply wulf accompanied must that must go with wulf harold have said to be too young to be one of embassy to duke william must be well that must form one of party duke know have liking for possibly may speak more freely to than to official messenger moreover have many acquaintance friend there may gather valuable news a to feeling in normandy probability of william baron embarking in desperate war for advantage will be glad to go lord duke know well enough what answer must be be aware that be ready either to resign kingship to to agree to hold crown a vassal people of england must laugh to scorn assumption so to dispose of must assuredly renounce slay a traitor who have broken oath swore at coronation be mere formal summons william make a one summons city to surrender before undertaking siege be move in game that will if can strike for kingdom doubt not in way may well be that baron will refuse to embark in war beyond sea be altogether beyond military service be bound to render at rate have breathing time vast preparation must be made before can invade england until be ready will have messenger passing to fro few of chief councillor earl great thane refuse to believe william will ever attempt by force of arm to grasp crown of england for have doubt will do so will at once prepare for war first step of be to unite england from northern border to southern sea so that may oppose norman with whole strength must be personal work other matter must for time intrust to earl train be not large one one ship bore thane attendant from southampton to rouen be received with honour at landing conducted to house have be assigned to use informed that must be received by duke on following day have brought horse with a soon a be housed wulf mounted attended by osgod rode to castle of de burg three year have past since have last be there have from time to time received letter greeting from guy de burg by hand of norman who visited court knew that although have gained in health strength prediction of surgeon have be fulfilled that must never be able to take part in knightly exercise deed of arm warden at gate have sent in wulf name a alighted tall young man ran down step embraced be overjoyed to see wulf exclaimed when heard that harold must send over english embassy to answer duke demand hoped that must be among number harold must be likely to choose felt sure that must come over to see have messenger waiting at rouen to bring tidings of arrival of ship be scarcely hour since rode in with news that by inquiry among servant a landed have learned that be indeed of party have hardly looked to see until to morrow morning have indeed intended to ride over on palfrey at daybreak must not delay guy for answer bear will not be to duke liking for aught know may pack off again a soon a interview be ended therefore thought best to lose not moment see have brought tall retainer with wulf be glad to see stout fellow again come in will chide for keeping so long at entrance wulf be warmly received by baron wife be just what thought must grow up former said indeed figure be so set square before there be little chance of great alteration have heard of from time to time that distinguished greatly in war against welsh stood high in favour affection of harold guy have overshot see in point of height though be scarce half breadth baron looked with suppressed sigh at fragile young fellow who stood with hand on wulf shoulder look better stronger than expected lord wulf said must remember when last saw must scarce walk across room in heart scarce hoped to ever see again gain strength very slowly de burg said wistfully although have to be careful of have ailment must hardly gain strength while growing so fast wulf said now that have gained full height will doubtless gather strength a three year have done so much for three year will hope do far more lady agnes be well trust be well will be here anon baroness said guy laughed with something of former heartiness be here when man brought news of arrival wulf fled away like startled deer have suppose gone to put on best kirtle in honour a spoke agnes entered room considerable a be change that three year have wrought in young men be still greater in case for have grown from pretty young girl into very lovely maiden whose cheek flushed a presented for wulf salute must have known again wulf guy asked with smile must certainly have known though have so greatly changed wulf replied thought that must be grown up altered scarcely looked for so great alteration in though might of course have known that must be so now tell wulf baron said abruptly changing conversation how go thing in england be people united in choosing harold a king south east west be a one man wulf said mercia comprises midland have accepted choice northumbria have a yet held aloof although earl have sworn allegiance primate have placed crown on harold head in time be well assured north will also accept a said when spoke about after harold have be tricked into taking oath to be william man have more power to pledge for england than have englishman be free to choose own king a harold have long be ruler choice naturally fell on harold be about to marry sister of earl of northumbria mercia widow of griffith of wale will hope bind two powerful noble to only trouble be likely to come from tostig who be a know at court of norway a be hated in northumbria earl brother of mercia have personal enmity against can gather following there while anglia wessex be devoted to harold still king of norway may cause trouble answer of harold ambassador be of course refusal assuredly wulf said know exact import of reply a although have accompanied be not member of embassy being too young to be intrusted with so weighty matter there can be one answer harold be powerless to carry out oath have choice of becoming king of england thus defending right freedom of refusing crown in case must have fled here must have given aid whatever to william a must be regarded a worst of traitor by english duke must be perfectly well aware that king of england must not without assent of people accept foreign prince a liege lord de burg nodded be plainly so wulf although duke professes intense indignation against harold have over over again broken own oath of allegiance to king of france breach of oath go for little except serve a pretext for war must have be same thing if harold have never taken oath except breach of will be aid to william in war against northman came to france conquered province simply by right of strongest duke have doubled dominion by same right deems now strong enough to conquer england whether be so remains to be seen at present methinks few of be disposed to follow in enterprise there be never saying how thing will go at last when war be in air men mind become heated there will be dignity estate title to be won when many be ready to go few like to hang back more than once already william have embarked on war against wish of majority have finally carried with may be so again especially if can win over pope to excommunicate harold for breach of oath sworn on relic excommunication will go for little in england wulf said sturdily many of prelate almost clergy be englishman hold in very small respect claim of pope to interfere in affair of england if harold died who must be likely to succeed have never thought of wulf said must think that few englishman have done so if such misfortune must happen methinks that england must be rent in two that while wessex anglia must choose one of brother mercia north must take edwin brother morcar a king assuredly foreign prince must be chosen with england divided chance of conquest must be easier be about king wulf keep shrewd guard over say not for moment that duke must countenance attempt to do harm there be many rough spirit who might think that must gain favour greatly did clear path of harold who must feel le scruple in doing so must pope be induced to excommunicate such thing have happened again again mind have warrant for speech methinks honour of de burg be too well known for anyone to venture to broach project before so many king great prince have fallen by assassin knife to clear way for next heir for ambitious rival can not close eye to fact that one in harold position might well be made subject of such attempt history of own country will furnish with example of what say thank lord wulf said gravely thought that assassin knife might be raised against harold who be of men most beloved in england have never once entered mind see there may be indeed danger of such attempt being made greatly trust morcar brother danger may come from a say from one desirous of gaining favour with duke will lay warning to heart conversation now turned on other topic on welsh war life wulf have be leading since last met upon what have happened to many acquaintance wulf have made in normandy talked until long past usual hour for retiring to rest wulf slept at chateau rode into rouen at early hour in morning audience next day be public one william be surrounded by officer of state by large number of baron english envoy be ushered in duke asked in loud voice what answer brought to just demand on part of sworn liegeman harold king of england bid state duke that hold oath taken by prisoner under force to be invalid especially when taken in ignorance of sanctity of concealed relic secondly say that have be elected by people of england that have power whatever to transfer right that have conferred upon have sworn to maintain that must absolutely refuse to be bound by act on part contrary to welfare of kingdom to right a freeman thirdly a to demand that must carry out promise to marry daughter point out that lady whose hand be promised to have since time died lastly that although a earl of wessex might transfer engagement to of daughter a king of england be unable to do so a will of people be that king will marry foreign princess that royal family will be of unmixed english blood william frowned heavily hear lord said after pause to norman baron english earl who be here a guest refuse to carry out engagement to swore upon holy relic can not however bring to believe that will really persist in foul perjury will persevere in endeavour to bring to sense of duty to show foul dishonour will rest upon must persist in contempt alike of holy church honour a knight christian conduct must bring upon eternal infamy scorn contempt of prince noble of europe draw upon head wrath of church then abruptly turned on heel left audience chamber while english envoy returned to house made preparation for immediate departure few minute after arrival there one of duke page brought word to wulf that duke desired to speak to in private at once went across to palace duke received cordially marked be with other thane be glad to see one whom count a friend tell frankly what think people of england of monstrous act of perjury on part of harold to speak truth lord duke wulf replied trouble head in way about hold that right of electing king rest wholly with that harold promise to do what have more power to do than lowest born of englishman be waste of word harold feel obligation far more than anyone else have there be other englishman who must have united people a well a must must gladly have stood aside there be none such have choice to accept decision of witan for sake of england to lay aside own scruple late king too nominated a successor although voice have legal weight be now regarded a almost saint among people fact therefore that full of piety religion a be must have held that harold oath in way prevented people from choosing have gone very far to satisfy scruple might have be felt edward at one time named a successor duke said shortly so have heard lord duke a grew in year learned more of english feeling character became fully aware that people must accept foreign prince that only man who have for thirteen year governed in name must be choice great earl thane be likewise of opinion assuredly in anglia wessex be so know not mind of earl morcar edwin be at witan stood by side at coronation doubtless felt that must not rely upon own people if attempted open opposition to harold will support usurper against wulf will fight lord duke for king chosen by people of england must choice day fall on must be a faithful follower of yours a be now of harold well answered young thane have twice done loyal service at least forget promise a yet mind be not made up a to course must fate will so william of england will not forget service rendered to william of normandy few minute later wulf rejoined companion before ship be far on way down river will go back to steyning lord when return home osgod asked a stood by bulwark together watching passing shore osgod mean for time to remain with king baron de burg yesterday hinted to that thought possible that of duke follower might endeavour to remove obstacle between throne of england there be in country desperate men who be ready for crime deed of violence if think that committal will bring reward have have english king assassinated before now have be same in other country moreover there be many norman who be forced to fly from england when godwin family returned from exile having personal grudge against must be willing to gratify at same time to earn place in william favour harold be so frank unsuspicious that will never think of taking precaution for personal safety then must serve a watch dog may be difficult task for have idea from what quarter danger may come yet by chance may discover clue other will set on right track at rate if be near keep watchful eye on stranger approaching may save from treacherous blow good lord methinks that harold be wrong in not sending norman across sea man with whom have spoken think same at rate can a say keep sharp look out although can not be always near person will go about listen will be hard if anything be on foot without hearing whisper of will tell word of suspicion suppose certainly not have fear rather than suspicion baron de burg certainly spoke a if regarded a likely that attempt might be made know own people better than do expressly said that have special reason for giving warning may have heard angry remark covert threat against harold although duke must not feel sure openly countenance slaying think that slayer might confidently look for reward from gratitude did by dagger open way for to throne of england on return of embassy to london king harold said to wulf have further occasion for service at present wulf suppose will return home increase number of housecarls be not with undisciplined levy that norman if come must be met be question time of welsh mountaineer of trained warrior must land must be met by men a firm a obedient to order a be trying to impress on thane most of be hard to move deem that be necessary on day of battle be that men will have strength courage arm with permission lord must rather abide near leave training of men to officer who taught who fought by side in wale thought did not care for gaiety of court harold said in surprise do lord for gaiety care nothing in time like there be much to be learned must not bury in steyning when there be so much of importance going on in london then stay wulf will be glad to have here have little time to myself now be relief to put aside grave matter sometimes will appoint room for near own chamber have heard news of suppose in truth lord know not how to set about task seems to that only chance be to run against one of serving men in street be slight chance wulf even with power of england in hand be equally at loss can not send round to thane of wessex to ask if strange lady have taken house in jurisdiction to parish priest to ask if new worshipper have come to church however believe that sooner later will herself advise where have hidden may be that stay here will not be long one for purpose journeying to north to northumbria wulf said in surprise people there refuse to recognize must win by going among rather than by force dear friend bishop wulfstan will accompany will take with body of housecarls partly a guard more because can not now travel a private person be very many year since english king have visited northumbria be not strange that northern men must object to be ruled by stranger from south will take with two three of thane only will be glad for to ride with young a be have quick eye ready wit in case trouble must arise can rely upon more than upon many men far older than palace of westminster be not imposing edifice london have not yet become capital of england

be henceforth to be retained for be that on right hand of corridor next to door leading to royal apartment like others be mere cell with straw pallet covered with sheep skin with rug for covering constituted whole of furniture in morning water be brought in brass ewer basin by page servant of guest nothing must be better lord than osgod said be light sleeper lying across door be sure that one must enter king apartment without hearing heavy door move there be little chance osgod of attack being made on in fashion doubtless of royal servant sleep on other side of door if design be attempted against life will be when be travelling when be abroad amid crowd saw walter fitz urse to day master in train of william of london then must have returned within last day two osgod for have be absent for more than year know that when sailed for normandy be still absent for inquired of one of court official if have be here of late what must bring back again wonder have long be out of pageship can hope for preferment in england while harold be king have know great possession in normandy for asked guy about learned that father be knight of small consideration a to state character that boy owed place a page to william of london to fact that be distant relation of prelate must say harm of man must think be a likely a to be mixed up in such plot a be talking of be landless hot tempered ambitious owes goodwill to harold for be by intervention that be sent away in disgrace after quarrel with at rate osgod since have one else to suspect will in first place watch rather have looked after for see not how can in way keep near know well have doubtless seen with having seen once must not be likely to forget think can manage osgod said confidently father have small apprentice who well nigh worry life out with trick trifling have more than once begged off beating methinks will do anything for be a full of cunning a ape warrant must act part marvellously father will be glad enough to get out of forge for while when tell that be in service will make difficulty about be fifteen year old so small for age that must pas for three year younger than be think be very good plan osgod have best see father in morning if consent to having boy bring down to river bank behind abbey where will be awaiting can there talk to without observation be sure that can be trusted to keep silence regarding what tell can be trusted lord in first place will enjoy playing part in second will know well enough must nearly flay alive with stirrup leather if be to fail that life in forge must be worse than ever next morning wulf strolled down to river bank after breaking fast be not long before osgod joined with boy have told what be required for osgod wulf asked a boy doffing cap stood before with air of extreme humility be not good at telling of tale a know lord thought better that must tell just a much a little a chose like work at forge ulf for wulf have learned be boy name think that like better than like boy replied when get to do fine work will like at present be 'fetch tool ulf file iron blow bellow if do smile get cuff ulf osgod said of course at present be beginner at age too have to fetch carry be at bidding of men be not for smiling that get cuffed for playing trick being away for hour when be sent on message to next street doing errand wrongly father tell will be good workman day will never be strong enough to wield heavy hammer to forge battle axe say finger be quick nimble that will day be able to do fine work such a clumsy hand must not compass be not to point now will be glad to be out of forge for bit ulf wulf asked must not always will not be for very long want watch set upon norman in order to know where go whom meet what purpose osgod tell that think must play part rarely that must be willing for sake to do bidding boy looked up into osgod face with expression of earnest affection must do anything for said even if be to be cut to piece osgod be a much interested in matter a be ulf a have assured that be to be trusted will tell more a to man object in setting to watch can trust lord boy said earnestly will do bidding whatever be know ulf that duke of normandy desire crown of england so have heard men say lord be king harold out of way chance of obtaining must be improved boy nodded be sure that duke must take hand in bringing about harold death there be many of people who might think that must obtain great reward be to do so boy nodded again man wish to watch be walter fitz urse who be in train of bishop have particular reason for suspecting beyond fact that have just come over here be scarcely time norman must come to london though a bishop be relation patron of may have come merely to visit still have a think cause for enmity against king be needy a know somewhat unscrupulous be little enough against man still seems to that coming bodes danger to king being so desire that will be watched in order may find out what be real object in coming over here want to post near gate of bishop palace whenever come out to follow save when be in train of bishop most of if sally out alone after dark will not do for to be always dressed a apprentice osgod will procure for such clothes a may require for disguise one day can be sitting there a beggar asking alms a girl from one of village with egg fowl understand that will have to follow to mark where go in especially must be joined by anybody when out to endeavour to overhear something of what say to other even few word might suffice to show whether suspicion be true not do think can do osgod tell that be good at playing part will do lord that right gladly be business after own heart will warrant that who see one day will not know when see next osgod will go with now will stay near bishop palace until man be to watch come out will point out to in day two may be going away with king when return will tell have found out till go osgod will meet here morning a abbey bell ring out hour of seven can tell anything that have learned then will give such further instruction a may seem needful remember must be cautious for walter fitz urse must not hesitate to use dagger on did come upon eaves dropping will give leave to do so if catch boy said very well then osgod will go with to buy such clothes a may be necessary remember that will be well rewarded for work want reward boy said almost indignantly be apprentice a master have bid do osgod command have right to service be nothing there be not one in london who must not do aught in power for harold who must scorn to take pay for a be matter in very life may be concerned though be boy small one at there be nought must not do even to giving of life to spoil norman plot osgod be about to chide boy angrily for freedom of speech wulf checked be right lad be sorry spoke of reward must have answered same at age must have died for harold then a must now must have bethought that feeling of englishman gentle simple be same towards king crave pardon for treating loyal service a thing to be paid for with money boy eye filled with tear dropped on one knee seizing wulf hand placed to lip then without word sped away halting hundred yard off till osgod must join have made good choice wulf said boy be wholly trustworthy unless face belies be a shrewd a be faithful only fear in matter be that may be over rash in desire to carry out trust have given warn against tell must be discovered killed must upset plan chapter xv meeting by river during three day elapsed between ulf being set upon track of walter fitz urse departure of king for north boy have news to report to osgod young norman have not left bishop palace alone have accompanied prelate several time when went abroad have gone out with of countryman who still held office at court in one other of disguise have suggested boy have hung about gate of bishop palace until late in evening walter fitz urse have not come out after dark on day before starting wulf be with osgod when latter met boy at rendezvous after heard be report wulf said a leave to morrow be last report will have to make to so far must seem that there be nothing to give ground for suspicion if after few day find that norman still remains quietly at bishop there will be occasion for to continue watch until time be approaching for king return yes lord can not say surely that doe not go out of evening why thought said that certainly have not done so lord said only that have not seen have certainly not gone out through great gate in norman dress that seems to show very little a bishop guest must pas out there there be entrance behind that might use did wish to go out unobserved even at main entrance can not tell beneath cowl frock of one of many monk who pas in out walter fitz urse may not be hidden must scarce go about business a suspect in dress a norman noble be viewed with little favour here in london must draw attention towards must assume a do disguise in must go about unremarked might be that of monk might be that of lay servitor of palace be right ulf have not thought of be indeed difficulty one see how can get over be sure that have not passed out by main gate have marked walk carriage closely lord step along with long stride unless be better mummer than judge to be must know whether in monk gown servitor cloak be easy thing to change knight stride into shuffle of sandalled monk noiseless step of well trained servitor in bishop palace be shrewd lad indeed ulf wulf said warmly feel that will fathom matter if there be aught at bottom a say can not watch more than one place other entrance be not altogether unwatched lord first day gave order went to one of crony who have shared with in many expedition when master deemed that be soundly asleep without a may be sure giving reason told that have come to believe that norman pointed out to be in habit of going out in disguise be mightily curious to find whither went why therefore wanted to watch at entrance behind palace bade mark walk of person went out height for norman be tall to follow who might come out of lofty stature with walk carriage seemed to accord ill with appearance so evening a soon a house be closed light extinguished have slipped out a know how have watched till ten o'clock at gate seemed to that must be late enough indeed door be closed at hour have done well ulf have not boy questioned a to reason for thus setting watch on norman have told nought beyond what have said lord may guess shrewdly enough must not myself take so much trouble in matter unless have more reason than have given be closely banded together just a must do without asking reason such action did propose to so carried out wish can not feel a sure a if have watched that fitz urse have not passed out in disguise unnoticed have strong belief that be so at rate lord can go away with assurance that be possible will be done by that even if pas out once twice undiscovered there be good hope that will at last detect after again commending boy wulf returned to palace with osgod feel half ashamed of having entertained suspicion of fitz urse on such slight ground osgod think have done quite right lord know how fellow gave false report to bishop of quarrel with at rate must nothing come of harm will have be done a to boy so far from regarding a trouble feel sure that view a exciting pleasure be a keenly anxious to detect norman going out in disguise a can be when get tired of will give up ulf at rate be determined not to relax watch during absence of king more thought of more certain felt that if walter fitz urse went out on private business after nightfall must use one other of entrance at rear of palace accordingly next day arranged that one friend must watch front entrance of evening while took post behind a soon a be dark lay down by wall close to entrance at servitor generally passed in out moon be up be still young back of palace lay in deep shadow projecting buttress screened to great extent from view while by peeping round corner must watch who came out see a passed from shadow of building into comparatively light space beyond many came in out evening be bitterly cold teeth chattered a lay cautiously putting head beyond edge of stonework time heard one leaving palace heavy bell have just struck eight when man wrapt up in cloak passed out differed in respect from many of who have preceded save that be somewhat taller hood of cloak be drawn over head ulf raised to knee gazed after figure man be walking more slowly than others have done for most of have hurried along a if in haste to get errand finished to be in shelter again from keen wind if be fitz urse be walking so a to avoid appearance of haste in case anyone must be looking after ulf muttered to at rate will follow be more like norman than anyone have yet seen though carry head forwarder shoulder more rounded a watched boy saw that a increased distance from palace man quickened pace when came into moonlight be stepping rapidly along be man ulf exclaimed know well enough that one be likely to be standing at door think need no longer walk cautiously feeling sure even if man looked back must not be able to see in shadow started forward at run paused before reached edge of moonlight then a soon a figure entered lane between house ran forward at top of speed man be hundred yard in front of when ulf came to entrance of lane just a turned into man stopped looked round ulf threw down by side of wall settle said to one who have not fear of being followed must turn look round on night a ulf be barefooted for although generally wore soft shoe be almost a noiseless a naked foot be dressed in rag foot covering of sort must have be out of place always keeping in shade having eye fixed on man be pursuing holding in readiness to leap into doorway throw down must see turn head lessened distance until be within fifty yard of other man took several turn at last entered long street leading down to river a soon a ulf saw enter darted off at full speed turned down lane then when got beyond house on to broken ground lay between river ran until be nearly facing end of street have seen man enter then threw down have scarcely done so when saw figure issue from street strike across open ground towards water crawling along on stomach ulf followed until halted on bank man looked up down river stamped foot impatiently then began to walk to fro presently stopped appeared to be listening ulf did same soon heard distant splash of oar came nearer nearer ulf must not see boat for be close under bank be twenty yard away from presently when boat seemed almost abreast of man on bank said where do come from from fishing in deep water voice replied be right come ashore word be spoken by in language ulf must not understand muttered saxon oath thought that conversation fitz urse might have with norman must naturally be in tongue have never once occurred to three men mounted bank one shook hand with fitz urse others have doffed cap stood listening bareheaded to conversation between superior be long animated at first stranger stamped foot seemed disappointed at news fitz urse gave then a latter continued to speak seemed more satisfied for fully hour talked then men got into boat rowed away fitz urse turned walked back to palace ulf did not follow meeting for fitz urse have come out have taken place must be sure to go straight back to palace ulf lay there for time fairly cry with vexation have done something have discovered that fitz urse be indeed engaged in undertaking have to be conducted with greatest secrecy be little to what must have learned have understood language only consolation be that wulf osgod have likewise forgotten probability that conversation be charged to overhear might be in norman have wulf still be in london must have gone to for fresh instruction have started at daybreak king party must assuredly ride fast there be time to be lost men have boat probably came from ship in port be there really conspiracy against king might sail north land in humber though seemed more probable that must wait for return for on journey must be surrounded by housecarls there must be far le chance of finding alone unguarded than in london have be intention to sail at once for north walter fitz urse must probably have rowed away with without returning to palace at rate be too important matter for to trust to own judgment determined to take counsel with master have not be near forge since have begun search be supposed to have gone down to stay with family who lived near reading have hidden away apprentice dress beneath stone in field mile from westminster presented in at forge in morning be back sooner than expected ulf ulred said a entered did not look for for week to come be well at home be well master have message to deliver to concerning business armourer saw that apprentice wished to speak to in private knew nothing of reason for osgod have asked to release boy from work at forge for time have quite understood that wish to pay visit to family be cloak that boy be to be employed in service for wulf guessing therefore that message be one must be delivered in private bade boy follow from forge took into room above what be must say to ulf mind wish to hear nothing about private matter in may be engaged by wulf osgod be away may not return for month more judged matter be private one a osgod said nought of to matter be private one master a be away must fain take counsel on armourer shook head decidedly can listen to nought about boy can be business of mine unless have given license to speak must not on account meddle with affair of young thane who be good lord to son that have not done sir pray to hear added urgently a armourer be turning to leave room be matter may touch safety of lord king armourer stopped art well assured of what say ulf for can say nothing master young thane told that have fear that attempt other might be made from other side of sea against king life that although have strong ground thought that walter fitz urse who have just returned here might be concerned in having reason for enmity against king therefore appointed to watch then related scene have witnessed on river bank evening before be strange story indeed ulf may mean meeting can have be for good purpose secrecy with be conducted be enough to prove be indeed unfortunate that did not understand what be said for much may depend upon well be grave affair must think over ulf have done well in telling have plan occurred to thought that might accompany master must willingly though have picked up enough of tongue to enable to do business with norman at king court when come in to buy dagger to have piece of armour repaired must not follow talk one with must obtain someone who can speak language well who can be trusted to be discreet silent why be whispered abroad that norman be plotting against life of king there must be so angry stir norman in land might be hunted down slain go down to forge will tell wife to give food have best then go up to attic sleep will have to be afoot again to night be well that kept altogether away from others so a to avoid inconvenient question will come up to when have thought matter over be aught troubling ulred armourer wife asked when breakfast be over men have gone downstairs again to work never have seen sit so silently at board be worried about matter have learned morning matter not what be now time later will hear of at present be pledged to say word about want above thing to find one who speaks norman tongue well be yet true englishman have be puzzling brain can not bethink of anyone canst thou help except about court there be few such to be found ulred if wulf of steyning have be here must doubtless have assisted have be matter must have confided to for osgod said that although have learned little norman master be able to talk freely with norman noble ay learnt partly when page at court what say reminds that be yesterday afternoon friend beorn came into shop have just arrived from estate said how disappointed be at finding that wulf have left london will go to palace see at once know little of save have heard from osgod that be wulf firmest friend fought together across in normandy again against welsh have be here several time to have weapon repaired know osgod be wulf man wonder did not think of thought be running on people of own condition ulred at once put on cap proceeded to palace where found beorn without difficulty have not come to tell that blade left with yesterday can not be fitted with new hilt master ulred be favourite weapon of mine must rather pay twice price of new one than lose have come on matter lord beorn be for private ear may pray to come with to house where can enter upon without fear of being overheard certainly will come ulred though can not think what matter may be concern in way thane of steyning lord others even higher in position be enough beorn said anything that concern wulf concern a be in matter can count on without question upon reaching house ulred left beorn for moment in room upstairs fetched ulf down from attic be apprentice lad of mine said a be who have be employed by thane of steyning in affair be best that informed of when ulf have finished story beorn exclaimed will go at once will put affront upon walter fitz urse that must need meet in mortal combat even if slay lord may not interfere with carrying out of enterprise in a know of equal rank with be engaged be true master armourer spoke hastily thought perhaps be for have informed of matter lord seemed to that first thing be to assure for certainty that affair be really plot against king life of have a yet manner of proof simply suspicion entertained by son master first necessity be to find out for truth that be so secondly to learn how when be to be carried out can only be by overhearing conversation between plotter a have heard ulf must have learnt if have understood norman tongue must have spoken well enough to follow conversation must not have troubled seemed to that at next meeting needed that one must be present who must speak norman well after considering in vain how to find one who must at once know norman tongue be true trustworthy englishman thought fell upon of whom have always heard son speak a companion friend of master made bold to come lay matter before thinking that might either take in hand name one suitable for certainly will take in hand beorn said right glad be that came to matter in king life be concerned must trust to one now how think will proceed for may well be that plotter may not meet again for time seeing that king be away so seems to armourer said moreover may in talk last night have appointed other place of meeting what think ulf beorn said turning to boy wulf must not have chosen for business have not have good opinion of shrewdness indeed have shown well worthy of confidence must say lord must go on watch a before be most likely that norman will sooner later go out in same disguise by same way a before that hour will be between seven nine in evening most likely between seven eight in order that may return from meeting before bishop door be closed for night will keep watch with ulf be sure that meeting must take place at same spot a before must show where landed must lie down there in readiness a may meet elsewhere seems to that must post by side must be better lord if must take place on other side of open space for although being small can escape notice might well be seen by approaching door will be necessary too that must put on sandal of soft leather cloth so that footfall must not be heard then a follow must run to where be posted must follow so that must keep in sight yet be beyond view for plan must be foiled must suspect that be being followed will do a advise come with now will fix upon station to night afterwards may be sure of finding there between half past six ten must wish to see at other time will find at palace will not stir out between eight nine in morning must say wish be warmer weather for watch of three hour with snow on ground be beginning to fall now be not so pleasant way of spending evening a have looked for when came hither beorn went out with ulf fixed upon doorway twenty yard from street down norman have before gone must hope will go by same way beorn said for must turn to right left after issuing from gate will have gone so far before can run across fetch that may well fail to pick up track again be well if must arrange signal by must let know must so turn off must not do for to call whistle lord must howl like dog must think cur lying under wall might howl once if turn to right twice if turn to left must then cross ground in direction must meet on way without losing sight of for long must do well ulf if be sure must imitate howl of dog so nearly that must not suspect can do ulf said confidently have used signal before with comrade to make sure will go out to field practise daily month passed harold be still away in north complete success be attending journey influence of bishop wulfstan who be greatly respected throughout kingdom did much harold did more noble presence courtesy to assurance gave of desire that men must be well justly ruled that evil doer of rank must be punished that there must be oppression exaction of tax beyond borne by whole community won heart of people be moreover gratified by confidence that have shown in coming among in seeing for first time in memory of man monarch of england in northumbria ulf beorn have kept regular watch without success ulf comrade have a steadily watched other entrance beorn have two three conference with ulf be becoming impatient at long delay though acknowledged that be possible have be arranged that more meeting must take place until be known that harold be about to return armourer be perhaps most impatient of three be doing nothing anxiety made so irritable captious at work that men wondered what have come over master after fretting for three week over own inaction one morning told ulf to go to beorn say that begged to have speech with hour later beorn returned with ulf bethought last night lord ulred said while lay awake wondering over matter whether fellow be still on board ship be in lodging in london might be either ulred have frequently thought over matter possibly may have stayed on board ship till left then have come on shore in guise of peaceful trader if ship did not return at once may still be on board armourer said for wind have blown steadily from east for last five week ship have be able to leave port blame sorely that did not think of before at least will lose time now if think that good might come of must certainly be good if must find ship house where men be in lodging seeing that know nothing of appearance number name of ship in came port sailed from see not how must set about will first go to port reeve office find out name of ship arrived just before time that meeting by river took place may have come in early day on day before must surely send word at once to that have arrived might learn something way ulred know that meeting ulf saw be first be true a ulf friend declares that certainly have not gone out way during evening that have be keeping watch be likely that be first meeting be so ulred at rate must be well that must make inquiry that while be keeping watch a before must try to gather tidings of fellow in way chapter xvi voyage north armourer found without difficulty that twenty five vessel exclusive of small coaster have arrived in port during thirty six hour previous to time of meeting on bank of eighteen be from english port seven from normandy france flanders three of latter have sailed away of four remaining in port two be from rouen one from calais one from flanders having obtained name of took boat rowed down river ascertained where lay at anchor then with assistance of citizen of standing of acquaintance obtained view of manifest of cargo flemish vessel carried other three miscellaneous cargo wine dried fish cloth other good flemish vessel be largest from rouen calais be about same size have discharged cargo be waiting for change of wind to drop down river there be nothing unusual to be observed on of ship men be for most part down in forecastle for weather be too severe for to lounge about on deck talked matter over with beorn agreed that be most probable that men must embark from calais rather than rouen be far shorter le perilous voyage moreover a frenchman must move about without attracting attention while a norman must be viewed with certain amount of hostility suspicion will make business to watch vessel know not whether good can come of must fain be doing something if wind change will doubtless proceed to sea if be still on board of will come ashore must see number where put up will indeed be important beorn said for must then have two place to watch must be almost certain to get to root of matter how will watch there be many house near water edge on southern side of river near ship be lying having moved away from quay when discharged cargo will hire room in one of will there pas a much of time a can will take with apprentice ernulf whom will bid keep eye upon ship whenever be away need say nothing of reason of desire must be acquainted with everything pass on board ulred succeeded in getting room exactly opposite french vessel sitting back from window be able unseen to notice everything passed on board ship lay scarce own length from shore upon third day boat containing man wearing ample cloak with hood be pulled far over face rowed up to side of ship climbed up right nimbly into waist be saxon cloak armourer said to be norman legging man be tall quickness with climbed over show that be young doubt not that be man must give year profit of forge to be hidden down below at present however be much to have learnt that be really ship that norman friend be still on board must that wulf be in london have keen wit must hit on plan by might get to bottom of matter beorn be brave young thane be wulf here must second valiantly have none of other quickness of thought a soon a fellow leaf ship will hurry back to take counsel with hear what boy ulf who be marvellously shrewd little knave may think of matter hour later boat put off again man came to side with visitor retired below a soon a left ship ulred at once hurried off hailed boat short distance higher up be rowed to westminster a soon a gained house despatched ulf to beorn latter listened to discovery have be made then asked armourer what advised must be done be just what be at loss about lord doubtless be to go to city tell port reeve that there be men on craft who have design against king life must pounce upon throw into jail have evidence to give in support of charge beorn nodded head in agreement if have half dozen of own men here said hotly must go down in boat after seize vessel put on board to sword must hardly do lord armourer said gravely on high sea doubtless thing might be done here in port of london must be desperate undertaking especially a have nought that in eye of law must in way justify such action well let have own advice then beorn said impatiently think can not be arrested may not be slain what do counsel will be done see nought to do to continue to wait to watch be better off than be before inasmuch a know where men be yes know where will be to morrow for know nothing of what passed between fitz urse doubtless settlement of plan have be come to may land may sail away for methinks from look of sky there be like to be change in weather see norman may have taken news that harold will soon be on way back for indeed message arrived from morning with news that thing have be well nigh settled that will shortly make for york where be to wed sister of northern earl may be that ship may be bound thither also left apprentice on watch suppose yes bade keep eye on ship must men leave be to follow on track mark movement at rate there can be little need for to watch evening beorn said a fitz urse have seen others to day can not want to meet to night be certain armourer agreed with permission will call ulf in told before sent to what have observed be going to watch again evening boy asked when ulf entered methinks there can be little chance of going out again to night will keep even stricter watch than usual master ulf said for may be that agreement at arrived to day be that sail north in case walter fitz urse may go on board ship hide there until wind change can get up sail think boy be right lord in dark matter like where know so little behoves to provide for chance think not that there can be need for to be on watch for can hardly be that will hold consultation on river bank ulf returned soon after ten o'clock have not gone out by gate master find that comrade be missing when went round a usual to other entrance be not there perhaps be tired went home indeed boy replied indignantly have sworn to do what told know that must be bad for if broke word besides be sworn comrade have never before failed can not think that must have seen man go out followed instructed that if at time saw man like one be looking for be to follow wherever went to bring word whether met anyone whether returned to palace went into house if did so be to make small mark on door post with chalk so in morning must be able to point out with surety will sit at window watch warrant will not be long before be here hour later ulf heard step rapidly approaching then low whistle put head out of window what be news edwyn man came out in cloak be tall followed heard sword clink under cloak so felt sure be man have be looking for stole after went straight down to river gave two short call boat be rowed up only word two be spoken then took seat in be rowed away down river have done well comrade ulf said warrant that good will come to through discovery good night ulf went knocked at master door on ulred opening told news will go down right early armourer said be beginning to rain master frost have broken wind be soft warm so much worse boy will be up at daylight will go down river with may want to send back with message to beorn next morning have rowed near to london bridge when saw boat approaching day have broken light be still uncertain a boat approached however ulf said there be boy in boat master wear apprentice cap maybe that be ernulf other boat be keeping close inshore for tide have begun to run down armourer told boatman to row closer in presently called boy name yes master be be just coming to with news in couple of minute boat be alongside of other what be news ernulf can guess ship have sailed yes master lay down by open window hour before day broke be aroused by creaking of rope looking out must see that ship be getting up sail tide be then just on turn five minute later sail be spread went down river came off to tell be time before must get boat come on board here ernulf armourer said message have saved further journey then paid off lad boatman with two apprentice returned to westminster beorn will be up by time ulf have best go tell news will come with to save time though see not that there be aught to be done thane at once came out chatted for time with ulred while ulf stood by cap in hand be certain that something must be done yet see not what can be what think boy see by eye that must fain speak must say lord that must be good thing if must discover whether norman be still at bishop palace may have returned early morning can easily be done beorn said will send man to bishop bid ask one of servant if walter fitz urse be in need not say that come from only that have message to deliver if servant say be there will bid fellow slip away when man go to fetch down supposing have gone a must think have done what then then lord think there be more danger than if norman remained here may be that norman have returned to france abandoned plan may have entertained seems to far more likely that have gone north to carry out enterprise whither think will be bound ulf must say to humber lord may on landing proceed to york if have really design against king life may take post somewhere on road down from city by faith boy be right beorn said what say master armourer say same lord villain have slipped through finger can do nought to stay seems to that not hour must be lost in sending warning to thane of steyning will mount ride north beorn said lord will at once go down to port inquire if there be ship sailing to day for humber scarce day pass that one more start for northern port yes ulf will take with be charged with business by thane of steyning be aiding in will go straight away to city lord if ship be sailing after so long bout of east wind be like many will be doing so will be back in hour with news maybe can find quick sailer will be at one of port in humber before craft left morning by time return will have found out whether fitz urse be at bishop palace will have horse ready to mount armourer learnt in city that several ship for north have already dropped down river three others be hastily completing lading must follow by next tide learnt from trader that one of be considered especially fast being acquainted with owner took armourer with arranged for passage for boy will have to be on board afternoon owner said shipmaster will not waste tide a soon a turn will up anchor make way down river in dark know channel well there will be light enough to enable to hold on course night east wind may return again might be caught so have decided to start a soon a last bale be on board know sand well may reckon on speedy passage if wind hold a be even if go round to east again when be once abreast of harwich on returning to westminster ulred learnt from beorn that fitz urse be there no longer having a servant said left for normandy be just starting ulred will be at york first depends upon wind lord ship can sail night day horse rider must take rest may be that will lay to at night must depend upon shipmaster if breeze hold ship go on without stopping methinks will be there before at rate beorn said may feel sure that will be in time design will have to lay plan wait opportunity such may not come for time farewell then ulred safe voyage to a for have have enough of sea never wish to set foot on board ship again for what with want of space tossing sickness must rather pas time in bond in prison cell than be cooped up in ship few minute later beorn attended by servant started for north in afternoon ulred after giving many order to head man a to conduct of business during absence took boat with ulf went on board ship to armourer be very serious undertaking upon be embarking have never before set foot on board of ship sea voyage in day be regarded a very dangerous business nothing short of loyalty to harold must have induced to have ventured on expedition be few month since that northumbrians have be burning sacking country round northampton even putting aside danger of sea regarded visit to north a full of peril ulf on other hand be delighted to journey be full of interest excitement on return must be regarded a great traveller by comrade face therefore a climbed on board ship be in strong contrast to grave serious visage of master before vessel have passed greenwich have made acquaintance of two ship boy soon felt perfectly at home on board watched with great interest other craft that met passed noted with great satisfaction that overhauled several who have when first seen be two three mile ahead wind be blowing briskly from south west with great sail set vessel ran quickly through water even when tide turned held on course keeping close inshore made good way against many time during night went out from close sleeping place to assure that vessel be still making way when morning broke tide have again turned ulf found that vessel be now holding course near middle of river have widened to extent seemed wonderful to where have got to now asked one of boy be out at sea there doe not seem to be land on right hand must see if be clear be just opposite foulness vessel roll about good deal do feel ill boy laughed be nothing feel hungry be if wind hold a be will not have rougher than for will steer more more north a always keep inside sand land will shelter shortest passage be straight ahead generally go through channel between two sand into wallet lie between sand essex shore there be not many ship master who will come down river below sheerness at night even master must not try with falling tide even if one doe touch when tide be rising one soon get off again wo roll about so much when get inside sand besides heard master say that thought wind must fall lighter a sun got up must like to keep on just a be ulf said want to blow so hard that must go into port want to blow so light that will go slowly what be in hurry for boy asked there be people master know who have gone up in ship started yesterday morning master want to be there before need not be afraid be sure to be there first like enough have passed already wind be not so strong yesterday a be in night expect have to anchor when tide turned if have master who know sand well may have gone on when tide turned again be likely must anchor before got down to sheerness if did passed three four hour ago anyhow be sure to be in first often beat vessel started with by week most of go outside sand when be fine weather always keep inside make great difference for tide run so strong even with light wind can make way against while outside have to anchor ca make out how can find way in dark if be thick night weather be bad anchor when be clear enough to see star if wind be steady so a to give direction go on there be man always standing at side with lead line that tell depth of water be quite guide enough for master of course never sail in rough weather for if went on sand then must soon go to piece if be fine when stick fast be very seldom put out anchor lower sail go to sleep until tide float again come up into top can see great deal farther from there than can from deck ulf found difficulty in mounting to top although be much longer than companion in getting up there be several sail following ulf be surprised at knowledge companion showed of vessel appeared to almost precisely similar one nearest to be alfred said know by patch on sail trade with harwich two smaller craft behind be bound must say for colchester maldon craft two mile ahead of be foreigner can see sail have longer yard than others sail be narrower at bottom than be at top two three small craft see more inshore have passed through channel will follow into wallet farthest one be going on to harwich others into river there be craft about own size hull down close by land may be going to harwich may be going on north look to like foreigner if so have come last from london french flemish ship come within fifty mile of now must go down do cooking breakfast must be ready in hour master will be storming at wind held steadily from south west vessel ran along near shore in smooth water armourer have be ill first night came on deck soon after breakfast when once vessel be past mouth of harwich bay be close inland soon recovered on morning of fourth day after leaving port entered mouth of humber by nine o'clock arrived at hull landing at once armourer found small vessel on point of starting for york in hour from time of weighing anchor tide turned ran rapidly along helped by flood at what time will reach york armourer asked master by daylight to morrow will sail on until flood be spent then anchor go on again a soon a ebb have done how far will be from york when anchor will most likely get to selby fourteen mile away by road though farther by turn of river must put ashore there for be anxious to reach city a soon a possible oh yes will put ashore in boat there wherever else may bring up be three mile short of selby when ebb began to come down anchor be dropped armourer ulf be at once landed shouldering bundle set out at brisk pace passed through selby at four o'clock question be asked there be small difference of dress between people of various part of england be unusual sight to see trader others passing along road on way to northern capital be right glad to be on firm land again ulred said for although after first night matter have be better than expected there be always movement seemed to make head swim liked master ulf said if be not that be going to be armourer must gladly be sailor might not have said so if have seen bad weather moreover be one thing to be passenger with nought to do to amuse to be always hauling at rope washing down deck a sailor be glad night be coming on for feel strange in country know nothing of in dark one place be like must much rather walk along road in dark ulf laughed than along of street of london where one may step moment into deep hole stumble into heap of refuse at rate in dark one can see be stranger ulf though must not think there must be robber on road so near to york dane be rough folk want to meet none of one man even two in way fear when come to half dozen even best sword player may wish out of met however one two men on road beyond exchanging usual salutation nothing be said ulred be well pleased when about seven o'clock entered street of york have already learned that royal marriage have taken place on previous day that king be expected to remain in york two day longer before journeying south there be banquet being held at archbishop palace where king be lodged on arriving there found that must at present be impossible to get at wulf a supper have just be served small bribe however be sufficient to induce one of bishop servant to take message to osgod who must be stationed near master chair that father be at entrance prayed to come out to a soon a possible few minute later tall saxon came out with expression of utter bewilderment on face be really father in flesh blood exclaimed a eye fell on ulred have never be taken for ghost osgod if be to give thee buffet methinks must have doubt upon matter what brings here father if have told that great abbey tower stood without must not be more surprised do not see have brought ulf with osgod if head be not so thick must guess at once have come about business with be charged osgod looked relieved that father must be in york have seemed to so strange outrageous that have first doubted own eye then father sanity now for first time object of coming flashed upon be there danger father methinks there be great danger story be long one then can not wait to hear now for must need return to wulf whispered in ear that must leave for moment must be back directly then just whisper to again osgod have urgent need for speech with suppose beorn have not arrived beorn osgod repeated vaguely thane of fareham armourer said sharply be wit wool gathering altogether be not here have wulf said word of coming a assuredly must have done have expected well when tell that be riding from london while have come thence by sea may suppose that thought matter urgent will tell wulf at once father be sure that can not come out for hour yet matter will keep while will go look for lodging for get something to eat for have walked seventeen mile leg be not so accustomed to exercise a arm in hour will be here again ulred apprentice have returned to gate of bishop palace few minute when wulf came out followed by osgod message must be important one indeed ulred to cause to leave forge to undertake so long voyage say beorn be riding hither on same errand be be sort of race between seems that have won let step aside from here wulf said there be too many gathered about to stare at guest a come go for to talk unobserved cathedral yard be close by there will be fear of eaves dropper there be ulf story armourer said when reached shadow of cathedral be to that matter be committed though be forced to take into confidence merit of following up matter if merit there be be ulf accordingly related story of watching discovery have made by river how walter fitz urse have be afterwards seen to embark have not returned ulred then stated how have discovered ship from boat have come have seen norman go on board how when learned that ship have sailed have after seeing beorn taken passage in vessel have come up fast said opinion of master be that have gained full day on craft started that morning of course know not that villain have come hither may have returned to france may have gone up of other river in order to take post on road king will follow on way south at rate felt right that must know that fitz urse with with whom have be holding secret communication have left london have done rightly indeed ulred in king name for thank heartily of course be still without proof that fitz urse be conspiring against king life be unfortunate indeed that ulf did not understand first conversation heard ought to have foreseen that be likely that talk fitz urse might have with others must be in norman can not think now how must have overlooked probability of course in year that have be over here have learnt to speak language must be with norman must deal in matter of suspect will give night to think over matter before decide what step have better take inside bishop palace at rate king be safe a say be not likely that norman can be here for day at least if ship be french one master will be ignorant of danger of coast instead of threading way through channel of sand a master did will have held course far outside must knew how many men be engaged in matter a to that have clue armourer said there be man of own rank other two who met on bank whether be whether there be score of others on board ship know not certainly none showed on deck while be watching prof nothing must naturally be kept in concealment for have there be unusual number of men on board inquiry must have be made a to whom be business will meet here at seven to morrow morning ulred will then have time to talk matter over more fully chapter xvii attempt at assassination when wulf met armourer next morning in cathedral close be accompanied by beorn who said laughing to latter have beaten fairly friend ulred be well that have wager with on race be not by much for rode in here a bell be chiming eleven be glad to hear from wulf when roused up that have learnt news from for indeed be sore weary be right pleased to wrap in cloak go straight to sleep instead of having to sit up for hour expounding story have resolved in first place ulred to say nought of matter to king began wulf will have enough to occupy thought in affair of kingdom in second place nature be so open that will refuse to believe in such villainy unless upon strong proof of actual proof have beorn appearance here will excite surprise will say that having nought in particular to occupy have ridden north to be at wedding finding that be too late must at rate ride back with king with ever on watch methinks there will be little fear of surprise be by surprise only that can succeed for harold be match for four five ordinary men if have time to draw sword will however on excuse have score of harold housecarls placed under order sleeping waking king will never be moment unguarded must not think be likely that fitz urse will have more than five six men associated with in enterprise must not take more into confidence than must help six must suffice a well a score for surprise that number must travel in disguise without exciting attention while twenty must assuredly do so therefore feel sure that will not have to deal with more than six including two leader ulf do station at river bank mark vessel arriving if men come hither will probably do a did leave ship at hull come up by local trader must thus avoid question might be asked if passing through country on foot what be there for to do lord wulf armourer said frankly have gone so far in matter must fain see through of course reckon upon ulred have be talking over with beorn seemed to that best thing will be for to ride with osgod can either make slight change in clothes ride a man of mine can ride a osgod father who having come up here on matter connected with business have obtained permission to ride in train with will see that have permission care not how go so that can be at hand if there be blow to be struck for king then in case ulred be best went a man for must then have entry of house where king will stop can aid in keeping guard will do well for ulred replied ulf have best journey back a came might go by ship after king have left here no will travel with will see chamberlain who have charge of arrangement of journey will get leave for to ride in waggon with servant during three day before king left york ulf kept vigilant watch over boat came up river must see nothing of men be searching for wulf have bought horse for armourer when started latter took place by osgod side while ulf be seated in one of waggon king rode with bishop wulfstan next to rode four thane who have accompanied through journey next to wulf beorn came on together behind came queen litter with guard of main body of whom rode just behind while waggon servant brought up rear need not trouble ourselves on march beorn be not while king ride with so strong following that blow will be struck see not when can ever get chance beorn said king will stop always at religious house will scarcely storm convent to get at must not attempt to storm beorn might enter secretly for own part think most dangerous time be when mount dismount there be always crowd assembled to see two three reckless men might rush forward stab must be at cost of own life beorn objected might be must reckon much on confusion must follow might think so to get away must probably have horse somewhere close at hand might ride for port where have left ship be great stake be playing for doubtless be desperate men though must know danger might calculate that at least must escape to claim reward then again might manage to mingle with servitor at one of place where stop must not be difficult for many beside usual establishment must be hired to aid in preparation for reception of king might be safest plan for be stabbed suddenly at meal assassin might very well escape in confusion first night slept at monastery at village of bautre establishment be small one must entertain only king queen with thane personal attendant rest of train be lodged in village although have little fear that attack must be ventured in so quiet village where presence of stranger must at once attract attention wulf beorn osgod kept watch in turn night in corridor night passed without cause of alarm next day rode to nottingham where be lodged in bishop palace beorn wulf agreed that be place where there be greatest likelihood of attack being made on harold life ship might have sailed up river landed passenger few mile from town where among number of country people who must flock in to obtain sight of king one must think of questioning stranger armourer ulf be charged to wander about street to closely scan face wulf have with difficulty obtained from harold command of twelve of soldier have reason lord king though must rather not state must remind have shown that be not habit to take alarm lightly brother gurth laughed at when begged to watch over camp with housecarls saved from sudden attack by welsh thereby then think that there be danger of attack upon wulf said not so lord have only begged to appoint twelve of men to obey order solely during journey to london will do a like wulf king said at last have proved brave a well a prudent before now be not given to vain fear therefore do a please let know nought about will have to receive visit of thane of neighbourhood when reach nottingham same in other town there will be many person coming in with petition for redress of grievance must not have thought disturbed by other matter will know nought about lord wulf said be like enough that nothing will come of matter none will be more glad than to find be mistaken order accordingly have be given to officer of king guard to hand over twelve of men to wulf latter have begged to choose twelve of most intelligent men for service a soon a reached nottingham wulf took small command aside have be chosen said for special duty have learned that there be disaffected men who may possibly make attempt on king life be to say word of what tell to anyone meet over by wall hour after sunset gather quietly one by one so a to attract attention will be posted round palace to keep watch ward during night a soon a be daylight half of will lie down sleep till mid day then be in readiness for fresh duty others will instruct a to where to hold king will remain here two day watch must be kept over safety night day a soon a apartment be assigned to different guest wulf went outside examined window of room to be occupied by king be on first floor looked into garden surrounded by high wall at rate there be little fear of successful surprise from side wulf said to beorn who be with must need ladder to scale wall must have to be pulled up for to descend into garden then carried across to mount to window if post ulred with two men here let four others lie down near to change guard two hour will be ample for on alarm being given norman however numerous will see that attempt must fail can therefore send other six to bed after supper be over for can not suppose that must be so daring a to force way into palace at other point a soon a be dark ulred six of soldier be placed in garden others be directed to hold in readiness to take post in banqueting hall just before bell sounded for supper wulf be told that boy desired to speak to at gate hurried out a expected saw ulf waiting there what news ulf hast seen walter fitz urse have not seen lord be sure that heard speak there be great crowd in square

know aught of know nothing of bishop replied so far a be aware have never seen of face before assuredly be not here with cognizance will at once question people shrewdly woe be to who have admitted stranger here unknown to at time when be beneath roof have house searched from basement to roof bishop may be that there be others in hiding with permission lord said beorn will at once take men of whom have posted six under window will call up more search town be likely that there be others without with horse held in readiness for assassin to escape do so beorn will be well if can catch at

people before matter be fully unravelled beorn returned have in quiet spot short distance from palace come upon two men with six horse before must run up seize two men have leapt up into saddle galloped furiously away unfortunately other four horse have followed immediate pursuit be therefore impossible housecarls have run to spot where horse be stabled have gone off in pursuit beorn feared that men must have far too great start to be overtaken one of officer have ridden with housecarls beorn have told to keep by river bank a men must assuredly make for ship be lying somewhere down river

arm worthy armourer that shrewd apprentice of for have entered chamber taken unawares must have slain without doubt have done best must since learnt from armourer suspicion that wulf entertained whole thing be wulf doing have heard that walter fitz urse be back in london must have given matter further thought than that be one norman more be a told word baron de burg said when saw over in normandy other day that first set thinking then must not understand why fitz urse must return to london at time when norman be not overwelcome there caused to have sort of suspicion a to reason for undertaking journey determined to set watch on fellow movement have be other than wulf who have so acted must have laughed at suspicion be a brother to knowing how sharp be wit be always well content to follow without question first heard of matter after discovery that norman be having secret meeting with of countryman who be concealed on board ship at once felt sure that wulf have not be running on false trail so did little must to aid who have matter in hand have done well beorn though a say be doubtless wulf to whom chief credit be due regretted at first that other two men have escaped have be taken might to save own life have implicated others might have be forced to lay complaint against duke of normandy a be now matter be at end four men have tried to murder have be killed body have be buried morning there be more to be said about be obliged to go down show to people hour since for assembled in great crowd clamouring to see so that might know be safe told that while thanked for loyal care there be nought to be alarmed about be true that there have be attempt on life by four men of whom leader have private grudge against for disservice did year ago that have be killed by guard without even penetrating chamber have run no sort of personal risk have reason to suppose that malefactor have accomplice within without palace late in evening when surgeon be applying pungent salt to nostril wulf opened eye osgod be standing beside holding one of hand be well master said finished off harm have happened to king have be hurt hope will soon be better leech say that be not to talk have best sleep a much a can have got stuff for to drink here do lie still will pour between lip look of intelligence came into wulf eye a osgod spoke smiled faintly murmured thank god king be safe swallowed few spoonful of potion osgod held to lip then closing eye regular breathing soon showed that be again asleep on following day king proceeded on way to london beorn remaining to nurse king must have loaded ulred with present sturdy armourer refused to receive anything save small gold cup in remembrance want reward for doing duty said have trade that keep must be happier be laden with money have done in matter have be to watch for few hour at window to make journey by ship to york must be ashamed of indeed if must not take that slight trouble for king without looking for reward a to ulf be thanked praised king decided to take step to alter condition until wulf must be well enough to be consulted in matter be fortnight before doctor be able to state with confidence that young thane be on road towards recovery still month before have gained sufficient strength to be carried in litter to london chapter xviii northern invasion news of harold marriage to ealdgyth put end to demand of william of normandy that harold must take one of daughter to wife in complaint that addressed to christendom against breach of promise in respect be placed far more prominently than failure to carry out oath to be duke man must have be evident indeed to that be beyond power of english king to keep oath obtained from by force treachery have be elected by voice of english people have more power than meanest of subject to hand crown have bestowed to breach of oath however served to obtain aid that church must give to william harold be solemnly excommunicated struggle for duke be preparing thereupon assumed character of sacred war in england bull of excommunication have effect whatever great bulk of bishop clergy be englishman thought far more of king than of foreign prince prelate even bishop abbot of norman blood disregarded commination remained staunch to harold have be generous patron to church have maintained in privilege dignity edward have bestowed upon possessed love of whole english people therefore in spite of bann interdict church remained open service be held a usual people be married buried a if papal bull have never be issued be not so on continent norman baron a body have at first refused to support duke in invasion of england a individual have be brought round to join in william project to give far more aid in ship men than be bound to do by feudal engagement having accomplished william issued invitation to adventurous spirit in europe to join in crusade against excommunicated king of england promising that must share alike in plunder of england in division of land bait be tempting one joined enterprise merely for sake of gaining glory under banner of one who be regarded a greatest military leader in europe others be influenced by love of gain while a in crusade number joined to obtain absolution for past misdeed by taking part in enterprise blessed by pope thus force william be collecting greatly exceeded that resource of normandy alone must have set on foot among first to hurry to court of william a soon a harold accession to throne be known be tostig in whose mind refusal of harold to embark in civil war for sake to force upon people of northumbria in spite of detestation of be injury not to be forgiven fact that tostig be ready thus to sacrifice england to own private quarrel showed baseness recklessness must hardly be expected from early career william naturally accepted alliance received tostig oath of allegiance aided in fitting out number of ship manned by norman flemish adventurer evading watch kept by english fleet crossed sea landed plundered ravaged considerable extent of country then retired tostig being enraged that william of normandy be unwilling to send expedition to act in concert with until whole of plan be prepared great army ready for sea normandy indeed have be converted into vast camp in port great number of workman laboured night day building ship for normandy have ceased to be naval power shipping be utterly insufficient to carry great army across tostig impatient hasty thought more of oath of allegiance that have sworn to william driven from yorkshire by force of northern earl sailed to scotland where be welcomed by king malcolm a sworn brother a enemy of england from scotland entered into negotiation with harold hardrada of norway warlike monarch be in fit mood to listen to advance have for year be engaged in struggle with denmark have ineffectually attempted to conquer have at last be forced to conclude treaty of peace with sweyn king tostig have already endeavoured by personal persuasion to induce sweyn to revive claim to crown of england to undertake conquest altogether declined to undertake so dangerous difficult enterprise tostig have then turned to harold of norway whether interview with be before went to scotland whether went thence to norway be point on historian differ deny that interview took place balance of probability lie strongly in favour of early interview at harold entered heartily into tostig plan began at once to make preparation for enterprise be certain that invading force from norway must land in northumbria harold although might not be able to rely greatly upon assistance of northern earl a against norman knew that must do best to defeat expedition landing on own shore especially when tostig be sharer in invasion own thought be wholly bent upon repelling mighty expedition gathering in normandy for purpose by immense effort collected greatest army fleet have ever be got together in england incessant watch be kept up along coast where norman might be expected to land while fleet cruised for month between thames isle of wight prepared to give battle to invader condition of service in england be such that be impossible to keep great force on foot for indefinite time housecarls be only regular portion of army great bulk of force land sea consisting of levy militia whose term of service be very limited say much for influence of harold that be able for four month to keep army navy together have foe appeared soldier sailor must have done duty long term of inaction weary waiting for foe never came be too much when september arrived harvest be ready to be gathered be impossible even for to keep men longer together army disbanded levy went to home ship of fleet sailed away to port to belonged effort anxiety of harold lavish expenditure in feeding providing for so great number of men have be thrown away england lay for time absolutely defenceless against coming storm be not until august that wulf have completely recovered strength be able to join army be not time harold said to on day arrived at camp for granting of dignity bestowal of grant if be successful remain king of england service have rendered at risk of life wulf will be worthily rewarded need reward wulf replied estate be sufficient for need desire land dignity being more than content have be enabled to render service to to england wulf be however at once appointed a commander of whole of housecarls supplied by thane of south coast of sussex none of body be equal in strength to own carefully prepared contingent few of thane having kept up more than fifteen twenty men constantly under arm only for past few month in consequence of harold exhortation altogether force amounted to about four hundred men party have own sub officer wulf did best to weld into one body when army broke up returned with king to westminster day after arrived there man met a issued from palace handed letter contained

shadow of love between before marriage in fact may even have hated for be who brought ruin death upon husband welsh king must know that only married in order to gain firm alliance of brother that hand be given by to harold without reference to feeling must that king be happy even though be with be not for happiness left england might be one be true that army be broken up fleet scattered be true

of month still will reassemble rapidly said when norman really come doubtless will loss of fleet be greater than of army for at sea must have met almost assuredly have conquered for norman be match for sailor whereas to meet so great army of trained soldier with hastily assembled levy be to fight under disadvantage be rumour true say that tostig harold of norway be also preparing for invasion

entertainment to pas time a if news of mighty invasion have never reached first attempt made to urge to follow harold counsel be dismissed so curtly that felt useless to persevere fortnight passed by then messenger rode into york with news that vast fleet have entered tyne that norseman be harrying burning country harold hardrada have first sailed to isle of shetland orkney with northern district of mainland formed powerful scandinavian province paul erning two young earl of state large number of subject joined fleet a did scotch contingent sent by malcolm commanded by tostig who also have with force have brought from flanders iceland then great norwegian colony sent ship men a did irish sovereign of danish descent roused to action at last northern earl sent out summons in direction for levy to assemble invader be next heard of at scarborough made brave resistance norseman took post on steep hill overhanging town gathering there vast pile of wood set on fire hurled blazing timber down on place many of house caught fire spread rapidly inhabitant surrendered greater portion be slaughtered town given up to plunder holderness like scarborough bravely unsuccessfully resisted attack great fleet sailing south entered humber hour by hour messenger rode into york bringing news of progress of invader hour by hour northumbrian levy poured into capital much a have disapproved of previous carelessness delay wulf acknowledged that two northern earl now bore a men saw to defence of town mustered inhabitant capable of bearing arm arranged for feeding disposition of levy did be possible at so short notice to get to take field saw too that raw militia be little calculated to stand before assault of norseman there be body of seasoned troop like housecarls to serve a nucleus to bear chief brunt of battle alike be raw inexperienced badly armed save for axe be favourite weapon of english great fleet made stay sailed up humber packing closely in river a narrowed till seemed

ground in direction from norseman be likely to advance have decided that place known a gate fulford two mile from city be best calculated for defence being situated on narrow ridge having river swampy bank on one side flat marshy country on other army of earl marched to take up position chapter xix stamford bridge owing to difficulty of getting levy formed up set in motion norseman have arrived on ground have taken up defensive position before english reached have force contained strong body of housecarls wulf who have talked matter over with earl must have advised that must fight on defensive allow norseman to attack with freshly raised troop ready eager for battle wanting discipline that alone enables trained soldier to endure patiently long series of attack thought that there be more chance of victory in attacking enemy morcar commanded on left edwin on right wulf took up position by side of morcar exchanged few word with osgod before advancing to charge will be right royal contest master latter said a fingered heavy axe never before have seen set battle like do keep close to osgod be sure to do master latter broke in yes know that while fight will be by side may be that

government to proclaim law for new kingdom already cortege have set out clad not in warlike armour in court habiliment when on long road leading gently down to river cloud of dust sparkle of arm be seen there be little room for doubt a to nature of arriving force northumbria must gather array must venture thus to approach army have five day before crushed levy of north must only be harold who with men of south have thus unexpectedly arrived tostig at once proposed retreat to ship at riccall so that whole army might be gathered together harold hardrada strove to marshal army for battle at same time sending off mounted messenger to summons party left at ship while be in confusion among main body of invader on eastern bank of river while men be buckling on armour gathering in rank cloud of war rolled rapidly down descent with mighty shout english vanguard fell upon norseman on western bank valiantly fought there be resisting solid array of english housecarls thingmen a be also called taken altogether unprepared for most part without defensive armour norseman must offer successful resistance to english host great number be killed others be driven headlong across bridge be drowned in stream be said to have be literally choked with dead for time advance of english be stayed for one norseman man of great stature prodigious strength took post in middle of narrow bridge barred way to english host one foe must attack at time so great be strength prowess that be said forty englishman fell under mighty blow of two handed sword at last be only over powered by one who made way along

moved forward to attack have king of norway advanced to end of bridge battle must have be impossible for english must never have forced way across king be equally anxious for battle harold of norway knew a well a king of england that host of normandy be on point of sailing be a essential for to crush english army before norman landed a be for harold of england to dispose at once of norse invader there be three claimant for english crown king felt necessity of having hand free to meet norman harold of norway may well have believed that host of tried warrior be capable of disposing of army save for small body of regular troop be wholly unused to war therefore held array immovable while english army crossed bridge formed up for battle steadily firmly solid line of housecarls moved up ascent

formidable assailant that standard generally flew well in advance of fighting line while on other side still greater height strength of king of norway rendered equally conspicuous at last obstinate valour of english housecarls prevailed over resistance of fierce norseman invading host be driven backward step by step up ascent until level ground be reached here battle again raged a fiercely a ever in vain did harold of norway followed by bravest warrior hurl upon rank of english terrible sword carrying death in path in vain did follower again again strive to take offensive english line

tight a almost to numb that care little for a have now taken off bow string be cutting way into flesh told that everything depended upon keeping absolutely quiet for week for slightest exertion might make wound break out afresh that if burst there must be poor chance for well must travel in waggon instead of on horseback will hing of sort osgod absolutely forbid must be act of sheer madness besides must be useless at present even if went south while if rest here for three four week may be able to take part in of battle moreover may be week before harold move against norman at rate be out of question that must move at present be not going to have risk life by such folly osgod be silent for minute two then said well master must obey order never before did feel so hard thing to do be for own good mine osgod be not going to lose so faithful follower must rather do without for two month than for life now must be going for will ride on ahead so a to go down to steyning fetch men be before sorry owing to being here did not come down with king now be glad for might have lost half of while a be will have hundred men a good a own to help to fill up rank of harold housecarls besides

thought must go hard with have rallied be doing well save that will come home without left arm will trust soon be recovered man fought more stoutly than did at stamford bridge king noticed valour although wound be five day old when started must have come south at once if must have suffered though must assuredly have be carried whole way in litter troubled greatly to hear that must be face to face with norman not there to strike blow for england be glad to hear that boy life armourer said for indeed when saw alone first thought be that have fought last battle have terrible news from south norman be plundering slaying from beachy head well nigh to dover people be flying before in crowd however matter will be changed a soon a king return to town london will send militia in full strength hear that thane of west be hurrying 't be pity indeed that harold be drawn off north for have be here norman must have have to fight best before established on shore must have landed in case ulred be not king of norway tostig impatience of sailor troop left shore unguarded harold tried best to keep together in vain however rallied quickly when heard of landing in north be coming in freely now will troop of northumbria be here doubt greatly ulred be not true men edwin morcar surrendered york before arrow be shot against wall received harold hardrada a king must be equally willing to acknowledge william of normandy so that might preserve earldom under have promised to send whole force forward without delay have belief that will be here be going to steyning a soon a have eaten meal rested for few hour will miss osgod sorely trust that will not be long before have by side when will army be back here master in three day at most imagine there will be short stay here before harold march south to meet norman news of wanton destruction be making have roused to fury will assuredly lose time even though have force of england behind be a well to have something to fall back on armourer said be not by one battle england be to be conquered even if lose first may gain second can stand loss better than norman for doubtless william have brought strength with if beaten must make way back to ship while harold must in short time find at head of larger army than with may first meet be slaughter a great a say at stamford bridge be terrible ulred though norseman suffered vastly more than did rank of housecarls on whom brunt of fighting fell have be sorely thinned will feel loss when meet norman against heavily armed troop squadron of knight horseman one of thingmen be worth three untried peasant have number of foe that housecarls must not for moment doubt issue london will put strong body in field though have not training of thingmen may trust to fight sternly master wulf if be beaten will warrant that there will not be many of to bring tidings back of be sure ulred citizen have more to lose better know what be fighting for than country levy a say be sure will do part stoutly well must stay here no longer will sleep for two three hour then take fresh horse from king stable to morrow will be at steyning by will be on way back with man on estate hundred fifty besides housecarls two day march will bring here again ulf be well hope see have carried home arm have be mending be working night day since news that norman have landed came there have be thought of bed among armourer smith of westminster london man work until can work no longer then throw down for two three hour sleep then wake up to work again so will be till army have moved south with most of in rank wulf reached steyning soon after daybreak a soon a news that have arrived went round tenant flocked in coming have be anxiously expected for alarm caused by incursion over country by norman horse be intense although so far none have come west of beachy head there be general feeling at moment might make appearance news therefore that harold be marching south with army that be to share in pitched battle with invader instead of being slaughtered on hearthstone caused deep feeling of satisfaction wulf gave order man must assemble in fighting array at noon that if later on news came that enemy be approaching house be to be deserted stack fired driving cattle before woman child must cross hill take shelter in great forest beyond few of older men who be unfit to take part in long day fighting be to aid woman in work arm of men be carefully inspected weapon remaining in armoury served out to worst provided at one o'clock force marched off wulf riding at head of hundred housecarls while tenant hundred fifty strong followed in good order man carried six day provision camped that night in forest twenty mile from steyning marched thirty mile next day early following morning joined great array be gathering on hill south of london to great pleasure wulf found that beorn have arrived day before with levy have not met since have returned from north with harold so have be up there again wulf fought at fulford stamford bridge be very unlucky be not in london when army marched north received summons heard nothing of until king be well on march none of thane along south coast be summoned so heard beorn fancy king thought that in case of landing by norman men near coast must all be wanted to help take woman cattle to place of security doubt be reason beorn said at rate be sorry missed fight at stamford bridge other seems to have be bad affair very bad suffered terribly so much so indeed that earl will have good excuse for not getting levy together in time for battle with norman be false loon beorn said brother in law a be of must have be well have king after stamford bridge have head smitten off for traitorous surrender to norseman have doubt will hold aloof now beorn until see how matter go in south if be worsted will hasten to make peace with william to swear to be liegeman just a swore to be liegeman to harold hardrada will find out mistake in end william have promised to divide england among needy adventurer if win edwin morcar will very speedily find that will not in case be allowed to keep country a share be great host be gathered ready for march south gurth have

visit abbey that have founded in have taken so lively interest there earnestly prayed for victory with vow did conquer in strife must regard a god ransomed servant must throughout life specially devote to service day two after wulf arrival in messenger came from william of normandy calling upon harold to come down from throne to become a have sworn to be duke man harold in reply sent back full answer to william claim admitted that edward have promised crown to william said that according to law of england man might at time revoke will edward have done have named a successor a to oath have sworn maintained that be extorted oath therefore of binding force finally offered rich gift to william if must depart quietly added that if be bent on war must meet in battle on coming saturday be probable that william insolent message be meant to have effect of inducing harold to march against norman position be very strong one have be carefully fortified hoped that harold must attempt to storm gurth urged brother to remain in london while went with army to battle large number of levy have a yet not come in with must first battle be unsuccessful army must be gathered to continue struggle moreover whether oath harold have sworn be binding not have sworn be better that who be perfectly free in conscience must lead english to battle then too gurth urged if be slain must matter comparatively little while harold death must jeopardize whole kingdom prayed therefore to stay in london to gather greater force to lay waste whole land between london coast so that norman whether successful not in first battle must be starved into departure from land counsel of gurth be approved of by thane harold rejected declared that must never let brother friend go forth to danger on behalf while drew back from facing must bring to harm land good of englishman for six day harold remained in london waiting in vain for force from north to join on thursday morning set out with army in order to meet invader on day have named account differ very widely a to strength of army norman writer in order to glorify own victory speak of a one of prodigious number english writer on other hand endeavour to explain defeat by minimizing number of who followed harold standard doubtless english king knowing proved valour of housecarls fresh from crushing defeat inflicted on norseman considered number to be sufficient military genius be unquestionable next only to william norman be regarded a greatest general in europe a there be occasion for haste so long a norman remained at hastings must not have moved forward with force deemed insufficient when knew that in week number must have be doubled on day that king made last visit to waltham wulf rode over to croydon in compliance with entreaty received from edith when doe army march asked anxiously a entered day after to morrow lady lord go with doe think that gurth counsel be good that be best for england that

south to morrow have have message from king praying to see must be too much for be woman husband dare not meet be sin for to do so must fain be nearer to scene of battle so in few hour might journey there in order that if lord dy might see once again know superior of convent at lewes there will betake thence a believe be sixteen mile to hastings so far a have heard norman plunderer have not gone so far west must aught happen to will send speedy messenger to must live through fight will do so lady even must not return news will travel swiftly god forfend so great loss must fall upon england

peace if fear be fulfilled will assuredly do when return to convent will leave no more life be over have happy past to look back upon in be blest will be happier than who have such consolation moreover can still be proud of harold may love a might love memory of husband who be lost god bless wulf protect through coming battle wulf rode sadly back to camp although have denied to edith must not admit to that sacrifice that harold have made have so far be unavailing have failed to draw northern earl closer to king marriage have be productive of happiness to harold only reward have gained have be in sympathy of people who knew well enough that have sacrificed love for good of country army marched rapidly beorn wulf rode together talked over chance of coming battle can not blame harold for not remaining behind wulf said though be certainly more politic for to have stayed in london a must not do so think must have be well have bidden gurth remain behind to gather army with to meet norman must be defeated if must not spare gurth might have left leofric behind be assuredly mistake for three brother to come for must fall england must no longer have head surely such misfortune a will befall wulf know not will fight side by side must one fall may perish together one at least ought to remain behind matter not how many of be killed so that one of godwin son be left to rally kingdom may be sure that if be conquered victor will be in poor condition to meet foe if there be one to gather army unite england against norman will eat up piecemeal must not think of so terrible thing wulf be not like to look at dark side why when be in wale in a bad plight a must well be always made light of danger managed affair a if be certain to succeed why must be defeated why must king be killed went through terrible fight at stamford bridge without scratch have seen norman at work know that be not such terrible fellow a for duke must assuredly rather meet in battle doughty a may be than have faced harold hardrada with two handed sword have hope of winning day beorn still do regret much that gurth leofric be here do remember that in wale agreed that be always well to have way of retreat in case of defeat well feel that defeat time will mean not only defeat of army ruin of england on friday afternoon army reached rising ground near village of senlac harold have beforehand fixed upon a place where must give battle to invader kent sussex knew well have be home of family owned vast estate there doubtless in long week of waiting for coming of norman fleet have fixed upon spot a one well suited for battle be necessary that english must fight on defensive norman be strong in cavalry while english be unaccustomed to fight on horseback must have be at grievous disadvantage have attacked enemy hill offered many advantage to force standing on defensive great eastern road passed close to foot possession barred passage of invader in direction ground between sea be marshy broken occupation by english force left norman choice to come out attack side be steep ground rose rapidly in rear so that norman cavalry must not attack from behind be indeed sort of peninsula running southward from main range of hill moment troop reached ground royal standard be planted men set to work to fell tree to form triple palisade along accessible side of hill force at harold command must have be far nearer to estimate given of strength by english chronicler than by norman for space occupied be insufficient for standing room of such army a enumerated by latter writer harold relied almost entirely upon housecarls levy might be brave be undisciplined might easily be thrown into disorder must too be impatient under trial of long day battle be even said that sent away of ill armed levy who came flocking in from country round eager to revenge injury received at hand of norman be upon shield wall favourite formation of english that relied to win battle be national mode of fighting be that in alfred have led saxon to victory over dane be that in clashed against shield wall of norway shattered might well hope that baron of normandy adventurer from part of europe who fought under william banner might well try in vain to break in evening messenger arrived from william again bidding harold resign kingdom meet duke in single combat crown of england to be prize of victor harold refused challenge have proved personal courage too often for to be supposed that declined from feeling of cowardice knew well that issue must not be thus decided be to fall people must still refuse to accept william a king be william to fall host have gathered for plunder of england must still give battle nothing be therefore to be gained by proposed combat chapter xxi hastings fiction of norman historian while norman passed night preceding battle in prayer english spent in feasting be even more palpably absurd than many other falsehood invented for purpose of damaging character of english army have marched nearly seventy mile in course of two day have in addition laboured incessantly for many hour in erecting palisade in digging ditch may be sure that after two such day great mass of army lay down dog tired directly work be done slept till morning harold thane have shared in labour knowing terrible work awaited in morning must most surely be disposed to get a long sleep a possible to prepare for what be most opposed to norman story be fact that harold be sincerely deeply religious man far more so than rival life of one man be in accordance with profession be gentle merciful ever ready to forgive enemy averse to bloodshed so true friend of church that whole of prelate clergy set interdict of pope at naught for sake only exception in clemency to conquered be in case of welsh in instance stern measure adopted be in end most merciful oath must bind marauder stern punishment inflicted be mean of procuring for west of england respite from incursion lasted for three generation william of normandy on contrary be absolutely merciless in warfare be not cruel for sake of cruelty where deemed that policy demanded be ruthless spared age sex be lavish to church be rather because needed obtained aid than from feeling of real piety in point of ability civil military duke of normandy harold of england be perhaps about equal in point of nobility of character there be comparison between may be sure that night before battle harold prayed a earnestly a have prayed at waltham for aid of heaven wulf beorn lay down among thane after harold sitting with round fire have explained plan for battle so calmly confidently did speak so strong be position that even who have like wulf doubted wisdom of advance until whole force of england have assembled now felt something like assurance of victory lay down to sleep with belief that victory at stamford bridge must be repeated on waking wulf visited men be already astir be astounded at seeing among towering figure of osgod why what mean osgod exclaimed did not order to rest quietly at york did lord osgod said man obeys order more readily than anything that bid do be willing to do if possible in be not possible for must not remain at york either in rest quiet must have have fever in blood must by time have be lying a deep in earth a harold of norway therefore in order to get rest quiet have ordered be necessary for to come south a have left well supplied with money be able to do so in comfort though must well enough walk have have carried in litter by easy stage reached london on wednesday night having be fortnight on way arrived here hour since day walked little so a to keep health exercise limb so well have succeeded that wound have well nigh healed although doubt whether will be able to use heavy axe trust will be able to strike hard enough with right hand to split few norman helm exertion may set wound bleeding afresh osgod wulf said unable to repress smile at osgod argument methinks there be fear of that most night have slept at monastery have inquired from monk whom told must need stand by side to day whether must be fit said at first that there must be risk in matter that if continued to take rest quiet a be doing wound continued to heal favourably be possible if abstained from actual fighting might do so of late have spoken more confidently told monk who seared arm to do heartily for little pain more le be of small account so that made good job of so what with rest quiet mind being at ease went on so well that monk who examined at westminster on wednesday evening told that save for healing of skin wound be pretty nigh cured that thought there be chance whatever of breaking out afresh bandaged tightly to prevent rush of blood into vein though when drove axe just now into stump yonder felt have not got back strength fully expect when warm to work will strike a strongly a most well at rate must take care of osgod can aid in keeping men steady charge not to fight unless see line waver then can of course throw into fray will keep back for master be sure will have to do best before sunset a will be risking life there be reason why must not do so a well a rest troop made hearty breakfast from food carried quenched thirst at little stream that ran down by side of slope then be told off to ground be to occupy at nine in morning vanguard of norman army appeared over brow of rise english at once took up position in centre be housecarls of royal house of thane together with men of kent whose right be ever to be in front of battle london citizen under sheriff be armed attired like housecarls in centre of array flew royal standard around be three royal brother aelfwig uncle with monk cowl over helmet nephew

have spear javelin many have only fork sharp stake while carried stone hammer ax such a be used by primitive ancestor a norman army wound down from opposite hill formed up in order of battle harold rode along in front of line exhorting to stand firm be there said to defend country to defend country have to hold hill be steadfast firm must assuredly resist attack of host who came to capture plunder england order in norman prepared for battle be similar to of english commander have be well informed by spy of strength position of opponent duke placed tried norman troop in centre to match against english housecarls breton contingent be on left while on right be french fleming other foreign adventurer who have come to fight under banner in front line be archer slinger who be to open battle shake line of defender behind came infantry who be to hew down palisade clear way for cavalry charge full into centre of english host norman trumpet gave signal for commencement of battle archer along whole line poured storm of arrow into english be unanswered for there be few bowman among defender of hill distance be too great for javelin men to hurl missile after archer have shot several volley of arrow fell back infantry advanced against hill before did so taillifer norman minstrel dashed forward on horseback spurring up ascent tossing sword in air catching a fell rode up to english line one man pierced with lance cut down with sword then fell dead under blow of heavy axe mad exploit have scarce terminated when norman infantry advanced up hill be greeted with shower of stone javelin slew many with unbroken front pressed upwards until reached palisade here desperate struggle began norman sword spear be met by ax of housecarls club spear fork of levy in vain norman breton frenchman fleming strove to break english line high position of defender gave great advantage over assailant among whose crowded rank javelin men did great execution while norman must receive little aid from archer side fought with obstinate valour norman battle cry be god help english god almighty holy cross latter invocation being to relic at waltham be king special object of devotion with jeering cry too greeted effort of assailant to cross palisade break line at last norman infantry fell back broken baffled having suffered terrible loss now knight horseman who formed backbone of william army rode up hill duke a well a brother odo bishop of bayeau who fought beside have laid aside norman sword be armed with heavy mace weapon a formidable a english axe valour of horseman strength of armour length of lance weight of horse availed more against shield wall of housecarls than infantry have done superior height strength of english sweep of terrible battle ax counterbalanced advantage horse afforded to norman hitherto irresistible chivalry of normandy france be for first time dashed backwards by trained infantry in front of english line ground be thickly covered with fallen men horse there be few wounded among for where english axe fell whether on horse rider did work thoroughly english too have suffered action of swinging axe with arm above head left neck upper part of body exposed many have fallen pierced through through by norman spear great shout of triumph rose from english line a norman horseman unable to do more fell sullenly back down hill a in centre king with thane housecarls have repelled attack of norman so on flank english levy have held ground against breton french carried away by exultation levy on right forgetful of harold express order that man be to stir from place until gave signal for pursuit broke line rushing down hill fell on retreating breton unable to withstand onslaught already disheartened by failure breton fled in wild alarm rushing towards centre for protection threw norman also into confusion panic spread rapidly host wavered have already begun to fly when william throwing off helmet rode among exhorting striking others with lance have caught up at last restored order breton infantry rallied fell upon pursuer killing many driving rest back up hill again norman infantry cavalry together advanced up hill terrible struggle recommenced william brother bishop performed prodigy of valour not le valiantly fought harold of england brother palisade be by time destroyed in many place desperate hand to hand contest now took place cutting way through meaner foe duke strove to reach royal standard encounter harold be nearing goal when gurth sprang forward eager above thing to protect harold from harm hurled javelin at william dart struck norman horse only fell beneath william leapt to foot springing upon gurth smote with heavy mace full on helmet noble earl of east anglia fell dead at foot almost at same moment brother leofwin fighting sword in hand be slain fall of two royal brother in way changed fate of battle men of kent essex furious at fall of beloved earl fought even more fiercely than before to avenge death william have remounted second horse be also slain eustace of boulogne offered horse mounting that of one of follower fell together upon english line valour of duke chivalry failed to break on french left breton have indeed succeeded in completely destroying palisade levy stood firm impression be made upon solid line attack have failed even william saw that be hopeless more to hurl troop against shield wall manner in english irregular have be induced to break array led to try by feigned retreat to induce to repeat error while fight yet raged around sent order to breton to turn flee then if defender pursued to turn upon while ordered portion of norman force to make straight for gap a soon a english left post stratagem be successful again with exulting levy poured out in pursuit of breton fled for distance then suddenly turning fell on pursuer ill armed undisciplined a levy be unable to withstand attack of such overwhelming number bore gallantly one party took possession of small outlying hill with shower of dart stone killed drove off who attacked greater part however made way to broken ground to west of hill made stand on steep bank of small ravine french horseman charging down upon unaware of existence of ravine fell into be slaughtered in such number by knife spear of english that ravine be well nigh filled up with dead body gallantly a levy have retrieved error be fatal one a soon a have left line norman told off for duty pressed into gap be followed by whole of main body thus english lost advantage of position contending host faced other on hill ground now occupied by norman being somewhat higher than on housecarls stood be now about three in afternoon fight have be raging for six hour though thus outflanked order of battle destroyed veteran of harold showed alarm discouragement formation be changed shield wall still faced norman for time effort to break failed in vain norman cavalry charged down upon in vain duke plied terrible mace occasionally men worn out by long defensive battle sprang from english rank engaged knight baron hand to hand all along line such single handed conflict be going on roar of battle be a loud fierce a at beginning of day so for three more hour fight went on with diminishing number with undiminished bravery english still held ground a twilight be now closing in seemed a if must maintain till then william ordered up archer again bade shoot arrow high into air so that must fall among king thane grouped round standard effect be terrible through helm shoulder guard arrow made way soldier held shield above head thane have such protection harold glanced up for moment a if directed by hand of fate arrow struck full in eye fell prostrate a if struck by thunderbolt cry of horror dismay burst from thane around there be time for indulgence of grief norman too have seen king fall with shout of triumph body of knight tried to force way in to take possession of body so long a englishman must swing axe be not to be assault be repulsed a others have be before when news of harold fall spread did brave housecarls lose heart sternly obstinately a ever held together at last norman burst in at centre baron knight striving to be first to pluck down standard one king own cognizance other national banner waved side by side one after thane be smitten down not one asked for quarter not one turned back upon foe beorn wulf have through long fight stood side by side watchfulness with guarded other have carried so far unharmed through be over now beorn wulf said be not hard to die for with cause of england be lost at rate will sell life dearly beorn said a struck norman knight from horse be last defender of standard end be at hand blow rained down upon beorn be beaten on to one knee wulf be so exhausted by exertion that must scarce swing axe when norman baron pressed horse through throng springing to ground held sword aloft shouted stand back stand back two men hold duke solemn pledge for life of others still pressed on shouted again whoever strike at strike at there be still hesitation so furious be norman at resistance have met with tremendous loss have suffered baron exclaimed de burg be right pledge given so did many of be young saxon who saved duke camp from attack by breton bore brunt of assault till have time to arm other brought with news that harold be wrecked word be decisive norman turned aside horse to attack other foe thank god arrived in time wulf baron de burg said knew must be near standard be fighting elsewhere when news reached that line be broken standard on point of capture be badly hurt beorn be dizzy faint beorn who have risen to foot replied unsteadily think not badly wounded walk by one on side holding stirrup leather must place on horse be best that must be seen removed helmet bareheaded moved off with young thane walking beside many norman stopped a made way down hill to question replied duke have guaranteed safety of thane a be well known to stand high in duke favour word be at once accepted in meantime harold standard whose emblem be fighting man golden dragon national banner have be carried off in

standard lost survivor of housecarls still fought on until darkness fell levy have fled just before hotly pursued by norman horse knowing ground well light armed footman fled across bog in fast gathering darkness pursuer did not notice nature of ground galloping on plunged into morass where great number of perished miserably either suffocated in mud slain by english who turned fell upon with axe spear a soon a saw plight so great be slaughter who have reined up horse in time be stricken with horror even after carnage have witnessed on field of battle with darkness battle came to end few

many friend earl loved so loyally must assuredly refuse if will grant short leave will take ship back to normandy place in care of wife where can remain until matter have settled down here be good

upon body of osgod distinguished alike by bulk loss of arm axe lay with broken shaft by side helmet be cleft asunder face covered with blood body be yet warm wulf said a lifted arm believe still life de burg called upon two norman soldier near to aid with assistance wulf beorn carried osgod down to stream where washed blood from face bathed wound in head be certainly alive beorn said doubtless be stunned by blow have remained unconscious from loss of blood de burg sent for flask of wine little of be poured through osgod lip presently there be deep sigh slight motion of figure then osgod opened eye at first seemed bewildered a eye fell on wulf look of pleasure came into smiled faintly be alive osgod glad indeed to find that be also beorn have also escaped take draught of wine have lost lot

for master will stay with for present for have matter to see about before start for coast in hour returned have to ask to perform last service to dead king said body of gurth leofwin have be found borne away by people for burial none can find body of harold dead be near standard be removed last night by soldier among great pile of dead none can recognize that of king well a knew wulf beorn be unable to recognize body of harold among ghastly heap of mutilated corps after time wulf said there be one who might recognize when others failed be edith whom so long loved a wife may recognize by mark sign unknown to others if will give leave will ride to lewes where be staying bring hither certainly wulf will obtain safe conduct for from duke wulf have ridden however mile along western road when saw litter approaching borne by four men reined in horse by side order be given from within a bearer lowered to ground edith stepped out be deadly pale eye be red with weeping seemed to wulf to have aged year since saw week before presentiment have come true wulf said be surprise to when last night news came that battle be lost harold slain have looked waited for be coming to fetch lady be body have not be found early morning two monk of waltham who have followed army seen fight afar off came into camp with gytha be mother saw duke begged for harold body offering weight in gold if might carry for burial to abbey of waltham duke refused saying that excommunicated man must not be buried in holy place might remove body of other two son harold when found must be buried by seacoast monk searched in vain for body beorn have done same have failed to recognize in so vast heap of slain will know edith said among thousand dead must know harold be terrible sight lady for woman to look upon wulf said gently will see nothing replied firmly accompanied back to battle ground where two monk joined wulf who be greatly shaken by sight of set white face left with what eye of friendship have failed to accomplish of love detected unerringly there be mark on harold body by edith recognized one of monk bore news to duke who charged sir william malet to superintend burial to do with honour remains be collected reverently placed together be wrapped in purple robe laid on litter beorn wulf two monk lifted edith walked behind followed by lord de burg several other norman knight baron who have known harold in normandy must admire appreciate valour of dead hero little procession went down to shore where norman soldier have already dug grave there by coast have defended so well harold be laid to rest over body great cairn of stone be raised by order of duke chapter xxii lord of bramber edith stood by while norman soldier piled stone over grave tear have fallen from eye from time that have reached field of battle face be a pale a marble looked almost a rigid when last stone be placed on top of cairn turned to wulf beorn farewell wulf farewell beorn be glad be here be glad that beside stood two of most trusted thane two of monk from abbey founded whose welfare be so dear to go to lewes when door of convent close on will be dead to world must be lying beneath that cairn by side of dear lord can not weep for now spring of heart seem frozen have time for farewell thane will remember in prayer so saying turned away walked back to litter poor lady beorn exclaimed a watched litter escorted by two monk carried along road poor lady indeed wulf repeated yet there be thousand in england normandy who be widowed yesterday maybe be better off than many lost harold day resigned to be harder perhaps to be parted from in fashion than to know that be dead now can think of a true widow for assuredly queen who never cared aught for be widow in name before edith be tortured by desire to see to comfort yet marriage stood a gulf between gulf that must never have passed now can think of a very own a man who have loved her even a have loved be grief terrible grief one without bitterness see lord de burg be coming way a there be litter behind suppose be ready for departure be ready young thane de burg said a came up ride at once for pevensey whither order be sent hour ago for ship to be in readiness to sail for normandy three horse be led up mounted rode away followed by armed party litter on osgod be laid have done last duty to king norman said be fit grave for hero assuredly harold be one maybe that be not last resting place duke at present doubtless felt constrained at first to refuse christian burial for have granted gytha request must have be acknowledgment that charge brought against be unfounded excommunication of avail doubt not that in time will allow body to be taken to abbey at waltham now said le gravely in order to turn thought from sad scene have witnessed what think of future will northern earl head national movement against be foul traitor beorn exclaimed passionately must that wulf must meet in fair list fight will hing wulf said more quietly will hasten to make best term can for will ask to be permitted to hold earldom a vassal will not long enjoy treachery be ever intriguer a soon a see opportunity will conspire against william a conspired against harold thank heaven will receive scantier mercy at hand than received at king a for south east who be to lead there be one left to whom can look for guidance doubtless in place will resist such resistance can only bring ruin upon who attempt maybe will take to forest great eastern marsh may perhaps hold out for month even year what can avail in end have harold escaped alive there must have be many battle a obstinate a of yesterday to fight before england be conquered have of greater thane escaped men must have flocked to be gone save few be found well nigh lifeless morning perhaps be better a be for now william be victorious will soon receive large body of reinforcement a resistance must be vain be best that resistance be made duke william have shown wise just ruler in normandy will doubtless prove same in england if be not angered by revolt rising be hard that englishman must be ruled by foreigner be new thing for saxon conquered briton in turn danish king have ruled over saxon dane have become almost one old grudge have died out maybe in time norman also may become english must take oath of allegiance to william then wulf not now lord when england accepts a king must be willing to hold land from a have held before from king be if land remain mine will remain yours lord de burg said confidently duke promise be publicly made will certainly adhere to even if wished must not after charging harold with perjury break own promise sun be sinking when reached pevensey for search for harold body building of cairn have occupied many hour went at once on board one of ship de burg have furnished for expedition two day later landed at rouen have brought horse with two young thane at once rode with baron to chateau leaving osgod to be brought after in litter lord de burg be received with greatest joy by wife guy agnes have be in state of terrible anxiety for last twenty four hour for swift ship have be despatched by duke with news of victory at daybreak after battle be known that fight have be long desperately contested that great number of baron knight have fallen a soon a first outburst of delight be over baron called in wulf beorn who have not followed into room feeling that must prefer to greet family alone guy gave exclamation of surprise pleasure a came forward be prisoner baron said with smile if can call prisoner who have never surrendered duke have intrusted to keeping have ordered that will hold in safe custody lord de burg doe not tell lady that saved life for be assuredly lost be well nigh spent be surrounded by ring of foe when broke in stood beside proclaiming that duke have given pledge for safety have paid part of debt owe baron said though saved at cost to while wulf defended guy at risk of life how long do stay with lord a long a can wife went a know unwillingly to war when norman baron followed duke must not hold back trust to have more of so terrible field man living have seen in truth until twilight fell seemed that must be beaten with such obstinacy endurance did english fight won be victory over dead rather than living of harold regular troop man turned man asked for quarter fell where stood even irregular who have fought with equal bravery when a night fell be lost fled inflicted well nigh a heavy blow upon a have be dealt during day have animosity against be valiant men be in right in defending country must must stay peacefully here until last blow have be struck be well content with estate need foot of english land share in english spoil must fight for liege lord a long a fighting go on that over hope to return here live in peace at rate can tarry quietly here for week certainly force can be raised in time to oppose duke advance on london sword therefore may well rest in scabbard suppose thane will not object to give parole to attempt escape willingly lord beorn said if contrary to opinion england must rise fight one more battle for freedom will give due notice that will if possible escape cross sea to join countryman be fair enough de burg said with smile moment give notice will clap into so firm cage warrant will not escape from trust necessity will not arise now guy take friend to chamber see to comfort will not tell story of battle until return for doubtless be burning to hear in truth will be famous in time a one of sturdiest fight ever heard of because such great issue depended on result when guy returned with friend meal have be eaten de burg told story of battle of senlac such be story a far a know added in conclusion in truth beyond beginning end fact that twice fell back at one time be flying in headlong rout to ship know nothing day be striving to break through living wall striving in vain can see now close line of shield helmet covered face above terrible ax rising falling cleaving through helmet hauberk a if have be pasteboard may well nigh be said that have wounded for man struck fell in track a if smitten by lightning can add more thane beorn shook head be like dream wulf said never moved through long day at time there be short lull then man be fighting a best must know that arm grew tired that axe seemed to grow heavier horse foot swept up to there be occasionally breathing time that royal brother voice rose ever cheeringly encouragingly until gurth leofwin fell after harold alone be heard though think came to ear a from distance so great be tumult so great exertion when harold died knew that be lost even did not seem to affect have become sort of machine fought almost mechanically with dim consciousness that end be close at hand be only at last when beorn stood back to back seemed again be animated with new strength came suppose from despair be awful day de burg said have fought in many battle under duke banner sternest of be paltry skirmish in comparison to half of noble of normandy lie dead army filled mighty fleet sailed from st valery have fallen william be king of england whether will in end repay normandy for loss have suffered seems to very doubtful now let to bed sleep not well on shipboard in truth have such dream of death slaughter ever awoke bathed with sweat in such fear dared not go to sleep again at end of week baron sailed again for england to two young englishman following week passed pleasantly ship came frequently from england with news of what be doing there william have tarried for time at camp at hastings expecting to receive submission of england not englishman came to bow before northern earl have hurried to london a soon a heard of defeat at senlac death of king brother witan be instantly summoned to choose successor to throne edwin morcar thought that choice of nation must surely fall upon one other of a in rank position be now first men in realm exerted to utmost to bring about true hearted englishman must forgive acceptance of harold hardrada a king long treacherous delay have left southern england to stand alone on day of battle choice of witan fell on young edgar grandson of edmund ironside last male survivor of royal blood edgar however be never crowned a ceremony must only take place at one of festival of church be therefore postponed until christmas london be eager for resistance alfred have fought battle after battle against dane though without natural leader people throughout southern england looked forward to long determined struggle with army of north a rallying centre force more numerous than harold have led might soon be gathered hope be dashed to ground by treacherous northern earl have one of be chosen to sit on vacant throne must doubtless have done best to maintain that throne have be passed over oblivious of fact that be to south owed rescue of earldom from sway of king of norway tostig sullenly marched away with army left south to fate while cause of england be thus being betrayed ruined william be advancing eastward along coast ravaging destroying romney be levelled to ground inhabitant slain dover opened gate be probable that most of male population have joined harold have fallen at senlac that terrible fate of romney have struck such terror into heart of inhabitant who knew there be army must advance to assistance that surrendered at conqueror approach to william behaved with lenity kindness severity at romney lenity at dover have effect there being central authority army in field town district be left to shift for assuredly none of unaided must hope to offer prolonged resistance to norman a after eight day stay at dover william advanced towards canterbury be met by deputation of citizen offering submission soon from part of kent similar message came in kent have done full share in national defence on hill near hastings be not to be blamed if when england remained supine inactive villager refused to throw away life uselessly duke be detained by sickness for month near canterbury there received submission of kent sussex also that of great ecclesiastical city of winchester spirit of resistance in london still burned brightly william be indisposed to risk loss must be incurred by assault upon wall therefore moved round in wide circle wasting land plundering destroying till citizen convinced that resistance must only bring destruction upon city in spite of effort of wounded sheriff sent embassy to duke at berkhampstead to submit do homage to not london alone be represented by embassy young king elected uncrowned be with two archbishop two bishop many of chief men in england accompanied although be not spokesman of witan might be said fairly to represent london southern england deserted by north without leader seeing land exposed to wholesale ravage south west saxon be scarcely to be blamed for preferring submission to destruction doubtless thought
