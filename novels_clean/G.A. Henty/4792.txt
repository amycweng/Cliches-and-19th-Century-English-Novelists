son exclaimed did give trooper order to tie up give taste of stirrup leather must not be worth while allan father said will make stout men at arm day will have to fight under banner care a little a man what vassal think of seeing that whatsoever think have to do mine order need not to set against one needlessly so let varlet go on with play undisturbed that evening archie said to mother how be mother that english knight whom today saw ride past with kerr be governor of scottish town of lanark may well wonder archie for there be many in scotland of older year than who marvel that scotsman who have always be free must tolerate so strange thing be long story tangled one tomorrow morning will draw out for genealogy of various claimant to scottish throne will see how thing have come about under what pretence edward of england have planted garrison in free scotland of ours next morning archie did not forget to remind mother of promise must know began that good king alexander have three child david who died when boy alexander who married daughter of count of flanders died childless daughter margaret who married eric young king of norway three year ago queen of norway died leaving only daughter also named margaret who be called among beaid of norway who at mother death became heir presumptive to throne a such be recognized by assembly of estate at scone hoped that king must have male heir for early last year while still in prime of life married joleta daughter of count of drew unhappily on th of march attended council in castle of edinburgh on way back to wife at kinghorn on stormy night fell over precipice be killed hope of country now rested on beaid of norway ' who alone stood between throne number of claimant most of whom must be prepared to support claim by arm thus bring unnumbered woe upon scotland most unhappily for country maid died on voyage to scotland succession therefore became open will see on chart have drawn out line by principal competitor for there be nigh upon score of claimed throne before death of maid king edward have proposed marriage between young son ambassador met scottish commissioner at brigham near kelso on th of july treaty be concluded contained besides provision of marriage clause for personal freedom of margaret must survive husband for reversion of crown failing issue for protection of right law liberty of scotland freedom of church privilege of crown vassal independence of court preservation of charter natural muniments holding of parliament only within scotland specially provided that vassal must be compelled to go forth of scotland for purpose of performing homage fealty that native of scotland must for cause be compelled to answer for breach of covenant from crime committed out of kingdom thus see boy that king edward at time fully recognized perfect independence of scotland raised claim to suzerainty over indeed by article be stipulated that right law liberty custom of scotland must remain for ever entire inviolable throughout whole realm march by article v that kingdom of scotland will remain separate divided from england free in without subjection according to right boundary march a heretofore king edward however artfully inserted salvo beaving right of king of england of others before date of treaty belong to of in march elsewhere ' scottish lord raised objection to insertion of salvo seeing that be of general purport edward possessed right in scotland have ever be asserted by predecessor scotland being kingdom in equal to neighbour that william norman of successor attempted to set forward claim to authority beyond border sooner be treaty signed than edward without warrant excuse appointed anthony beck warlike bishop of durham lieutenant of scotland in name of yet unmarried pair finding that be not resented demanded that place of strength in kingdom must be delivered to demand be not however complied with matter be still pending when maid of norway died three principal competitor bruce baliol comyn friend at once began to arm william fraser bishop of st andrew friend of baliol wrote to king edward suggesting that must act a arbitrator more than hinting that if chose baliol must find submissive in thing to wish edward jumped at proposal thereupon issued summons to baron of northern county to meet at norham on d of june mandate be issued to sheriff of northumberland cumberland westmoreland york lancaster to assemble feudal array at same rendezvous now know son that owing to marriage between royal family of england scotland there have be close connection between country many scotch baron have married english heiress hold land in country while scottish maiden have married english knight thus happens that great number of scotch nobility be a much englishman a scotchman be vassal to england for land held there four of competitor john baliol robert bruce john comyn william ross be baron of england a well a of scotland land lying in north be of course included in invitation in may edward issued invitation to bishop of st andrew glasgow other scotch noble to come to norham remain there return specially saying that presence there be not to

lord paramount scottish noble present with exception of who be privy to edward design be filled with astonishment dismay at pretension declared ignorance of claim of superiority of king of england over scotland king in passion exclaimed 'by holy edward whose crown wear will vindicate just right perish in attempt however saw that nothing must be done on instant adjourned meeting for three week at end of time prelate noble community of scotland be invited to bring forward whatever must in opposition to claim to supremacy at time fixed scotch noble again met time on scottish side of border for edward have gathered together whole of force of northern county besides four claimant whose name have told be sir john hastings patrick dunbar earl of march william de vesci robert de pinkeny nicholas de soulis patrick galythly roger de mandeville florence count of holland eric king of norway with exception of eric count of holland dunbar galythly of be of norman extraction held possession in england when meeting be opened prelate noble present advanced nothing to disprove edward claim to supremacy representative of common however did show reason against claim for indeed son a man in scotland know there be not shadow of foundation king chancellor declared that there be nothing in objection to edward claim therefore resolved a lord paramount to determine question of succession various competitor be asked whether acknowledged edward a lord paramount be willing to receive judgment a such whole of wretched traitor proceeded to barter country for hope of crown acknowledged edward a lord paramount left judgment in hand bruce baliol received handsome present for thus tamely yielding right of scotland present at once agreed that castle stronghold of scotland must be surrendered into hand of english commander garrison be immediately done thus be archie that see english officer lording over scotch town of lanark then scotchman be called upon to do homage to english king a lord paramount who refused to do so be seized arrested finally on th of november last date will long be remembered in scotland edward judgment be given at berwick by john baliol be declared

upon by english soldier slew several made escape so say archie appears from description of to be remarkable young man trust that will escape vengeance of english day may again strike blow for poor scotland though nominally under rule of baliol be now province of england surely mother scotchman will never remain in such state of shameful servitude trust not son fear that will be long before shake off english yoke noble be for most part of norman blood very many be baron of england so great be jealousy among that general effort against england will be possible if scotland be ever to be freed will be by mighty rising of common people even then struggle between common of scotland whole force of england aided by feudal power of great scotch noble must be well nigh hopeless conversation sank deeply into archie mind day night thought of nothing lost freedom of scotland vowed that even hope of regaining father land must be secondary to of freeing country sort of wild dream did boy turn over in mind be no longer gay light hearted walked about moody thoughtful redoubled assiduity in practice of arm sometimes when fighting with sandy must think that have english man at arm before must

auchinleck commanded one sir john grahame with wallace of riccarton second sir walter of newbigging with son david sir john clinto third cavalry be placed in front footman being imperfectly armed disciplined therefore unable to withstand first charge of english followed cavalry before marching forward wallace called commander round charged earnestly to restrain men from plunder until contest be decided pointing out that many battle have be lost owing to propensity of who gained first advantage to scatter for plunder just a scotch be moving body of horseman well armed equipped from annandale eskdale led by halliday kirkpatrick jardine joined with accession of strength marched forward confidently against enemy chapter v treacherous plot so rapid be advance of wallace army that english have scarce time to form when be upon scotch charged with extreme impetuosity among english rank directing onslaught principally against centre commanded by earl of kent english resisted stoutly earl of kent be struck down by wallace be with difficulty borne off field after severe fighting whole english army be thrown into disorder took to flight hundred be killed in action many more in pursuit followed however wallace must not allow to be pushed too far lest fugitive must rally turn then victorious scot returned to english camp in be found great abundance of provision arm other valuable booty many of cattle be killed sumptuous feast prepared then wallace have whole of spoil carried off into place of safety in heart of neighbouring bog fell back to shelter in morning english who have rallied when pursuit have ceased again advanced hoping to find wallace unprepared be now commanded by earl of lancaster have received reinforcement in night passed over scene of previous day battle at last came in sight of scotch army wallace at first advanced then a if dismayed at superior strength retired to point where in order to reach english must have to cross portion of bog surface be covered with moss long grass treacherous nature of ground be unperceived by english who filled with desire to wipe out defeat of preceding day charged impetuously against scotch line movement be fatal for a soon a reached treacherous ground horse sunk to saddle girth scotch have dismounted on firmer ground behind now advanced to attack working round flank of morass others crossing on tuft of grass so fell upon struggling mass of english earl of westmoreland many others of note be killed earl of lancaster with remains of force at once retreated south recrossed border archie have taken part in first battle wallace have asked whether must fight by side take command of body of infantry chose latter alternative almost knight gentleman be fighting on horse with follower archie thought that

charge of horse a victory be won entirely by cavalry have opportunity of distinguishing upon second day however did good service a lightly armed footman be able to cross bog in place impracticable to dismounted men at arm in heavy accoutrement victory of biggar still further swelled wallace force sir william douglas joined other gentleman great meeting be held at forest kirk when leader of wallace force be present agreed to acknowledge a general of scottish force against england with title of warden of scotland king edward be at time busied with war in france be unable to despatch army capable of effecting reconquest of portion of scotland now held by wallace a english force in various garrison be insufficient for such purpose earl of percy other leader proposed truce be agreed to although wallace be at head of considerable force sir william douglas be only one among scottish noble of importance who have joined although success have gained be considerable little have be really done towards freeing scotland of whose strong place be still in hand of english king edward have not a yet really put out strength greater portion of army of wallace be now dispersed shortly afterwards

have be capture effected wallace be so accustomed to free life of wood that preferred to remain there to taking up abode in town moreover here be safe from treachery for felt sure that although english noble leader must be incapable of breaking truce yet that there be many of lower degree who must not hesitate at deed of treachery by might gain reward credit from king archie band be found of greatest service a messenger although sometimes spent few day at sir robert gordon with mother generally remained by side of wallace spot where scottish leader be now staying lay about halfway between lanark ayr archie heard with uneasiness news of approaching council wallace acceptance of invitation fact that earl of percy very noble knight gentleman have be lately recalled from governorship of ayr have be replaced by one of somewhat low degree arlouf of southampton still further increased doubt seemed strange that governorship of so important town post deemed fitting for earl percy must be

scot jock must not in slightest degree make out still word be strange might be important resolved directly preparation be finished place closed so that there must be chance of learning more to return

word cluny have day endeavoured in vain to gather news have day before sold of egg chicken at governor house towards evening determined again to go thither to make attempt to enter house where have heard that officer of garrison be to be entertained that evening at banquet if must overhear what be said there mind must be at rest certainly nothing be known to soldier may well be that if treachery

handle of door leading into apartment found in long narrow room used apparently a private office of governor there be many heavy chair in room ranged along wall cluny crouched in corner by window beside chair standing there concealment be poor one one searching must instantly detect have fear of search for doubted not that cook on missing must suppose that have left at once intending to call for money basket together next morning be already growing dusk must one enter room for half hour must be hidden in shadow in corner of room be more probable still that one must enter time passed slowly on darkness rapidly increased through door cluny have drawn to have not tightly closed on entering must hear voice of servant a moved about completed preparation in banquet hall presently be quiet faint light gleaming in through crack of door showed that light be lit that be in readiness for banquet hour later there be heavy trampling of foot sound of many voice door be suddenly closed

glass continued for nigh two hour then sudden quiet seemed to fall upon assembly cluny heard door close guessed that banquet be at end servitor dismissed now if ever must something of importance be said within cluny must have given life to be able to hear many time thought of turning handle opening door inch two lock in day be roughly made slightest sound might attract attention in case not only must own life be forfeited news of governor intention matter what might be must reach wallace so almost holding breath lay on ground listened with ear to sill of door silence be succeeded by steady monotonous sound a of one addressing others cluny groaned in spirit for word must hear after minute murmur ceased then many voice be raised together then one rose above rest then distinct clear came voice evidently raised in anger a please master hawkins if disobey order a king edward governor here will take consequence will at once place in durance will send report to king of mutinous conduct be

of murderer seize governor shouted give in charge to guard to lay in castle dungeon there be movement of foot now heard cluny waited longer angry utterance have reached ear knowing that mission be accomplished thought only now of escape before detection might take place have noticed when entered room that window be a be usually case with room on lower floor barred saw also that bar be wide enough apart for lad of slimness to crawl through banqueting room be raised three step above hall room that be in be upon same level window be four foot from floor must therefore be probably seven

of governor house be soon in principal street already most of citizen be within house few provided with lantern be picking way along uneven pavement cluny knew that be impossible for to leave town night must have given anything for rope by might lower from wall there be possibility of obtaining one appearance of young girl wandering in street alone at night must at once have attracted attention remark so cluny withdrew into dark archway then sat down until general silence told that have retired to rest then made way along street until neared gateway there lying down by wall went to sleep when gate be opened in morning cluny waited until few person have passed in out then approached hallo lass sergeant of guard who be standing there said be pretty figure with torn clothes why what have

death without further word kept on at full speed be time before companion overtook for be at first too convulsed by laughter at cluny extraordinary appearance to be able to run presently sobered by

word dropped by governor officer might really have evil meaning whatever must not throw doubt upon fair intention of king edward representative for might well be said that be grossest insult to

after capture of ayr one of archie band came into hut tear be running down cheek face be swollen with weeping what be jock archie asked kindly ah sir archie have bad news from glen cairn one have come hither who say that few day since kerrs with following of own retainer came down to village having heard that of have followed to war took list of be missing sir john called father up before swore truly enough that knew nought of intention that have left without saying word to sir john refused to believe at first threatened to hang then after time said might draw lot that two must die father allan cunninghame drew evil number kerr hung up to old tree on green put fire to rooftree of others ah there be weeping wailing in glen cairn archie be for while speechless with indignation knew well that wholesale vengeance have not be taken by kerrs because son of cottager of glen cairn have gone to join army of wallace because deemed to be still attached to old lord be to fidelity to forbeses rather than to scotland that owed ruin have befallen poor jock said be grieved indeed at misfortune can not restore father life can from spoil of ayr send sufficient sum to glen cairn to rebuild cottage kerrs have destroyed will not be enough will have vengeance for foul deed order band to assemble at dusk evening tell orr macpherson to come here to at once archie have long consultation with two young lieutenant whose father cottage have with others be destroyed what have to do archie said must do alone sir william have ample employment for men can not ask to weaken force to aid in private broil indeed must aid short of whole band be of use seeing that kerrs can put three hundred retainer in field be not by open force that must fight by fire harassment fighting be out of question can do damage without giving chance of striking blow at a have lighted glen cairn so will see fire blazing round own castle of aberfilly will not retaliate by hanging crofter vassal if of men at arm fall into hand will have blood for blood in course of afternoon archie saw chief begged leave to take troop away for time telling sir william of cruel treatment kerrs have dealt at glen cairn determination to retaliate for deed aberfilly be strong castle archie wallace said at least so people say for have never seen so far doe lie removed from main road unless by stratagem doubt if force be strong enough to capture must attack be sure of capturing without loss of man noble landowner stand aloof from may be that after have wrested more strong place from english may join must not on account war against one of now half great family be united by tie of blood marriage kerrs know be related to comyns other powerful family did lift hand against adieu to chance of being joined by great noble openly hostile a many of be must let go way confine effort to attacking friend english then will have excuse of personal feud for taking side against cause of scotland doe not apply to everyone know that there have long be blood feud between forbeses kerrs damage may do will be counted a private feud think be rash adventure that be undertaking with handful of boy although be true that boy can fire roof drive off bullock a well a man however will promise that if must get into scrape will come with what speed can to rescue even if embroil with noble of scotland embroiled with power of england in behalf will not find slack in hour of need if join in fray be to rescue friend archie forbes not to war against john kerr ally of english own enemy archie warmly thanked leader assured that have thought of placing in great peril be not going to fight said for kerr retainer must eat up will trust to leg knowledge of mountain after dark archie band started arrived within ten mile of aberfilly on following morning rested till noon then again set out when approached one of outlying farm of kerrs archie halted band accompanied by four of stoutest tallest of number went on to crofter house man came to door what must young sir said to archie must archie said that bear message from to lord know not what message may be frankly must rather that bore especially if be of nature to anger sir john message be archie said quietly tell that archibald forbes bid defiance that will retort upon cruelty have wrought in glen cairn that will rest not night day until have revenge for innocent blood shed rooftree ruthlessly burned then crofter said bluntly if be archibald forbes may even take message sir john care not much upon whose head wrath light care not to appear before a willing messenger on errand may tell archie said quietly that be willing messenger for told that unless did errand house must before morning be heap of smoking ash have following hard by will keep word crofter hesitated do bidding promise that may befall other vassal of kerrs will go free unharmed well if need must must crofter said will do bidding young sir partly because care not to see house in ruin more because have heard of a valiant youth who fought stoutly by side of wallace at lanark ayr though seeing that be lad marvel much that must be able to hold own in such wild company although a vassal of kerrs must need follow banner need not tell since have lived so long at glen cairn that kerrs be feared rather than loved that there be many man among who must lief that lord fought not by side of english however must need dance a play now will put on bonnet do errand sir john can hardly blame greatly for doing what need must great be wrath of sir john kerr when vassal reported to message with have be charged in savage fury be with difficulty dissuaded from ordering to be hung for bringing message principal retainer ventured however to point out that man have acted upon compulsion that present be not time when might at moment have to call upon to take field to anger vassal who must assuredly resent undeserved death of one of number be past bearing knight said furiously that insolent boy like must first wound in street of lanark must then cast defiance in teeth landless rascal whose father killed whose den of castle month ago gave to flame must be mad to dare to set power against mine be fool did not stamp out long ago woe betide when next meet have not be that be served by fool here angry knight turned to henchman red roy must not have happened who must have thought that man of year must have suffered to be fooled by boy to bring tale that insolent upstart be poor stupid lout by heaven to be thus badly served be enough to make one mad well sir john man grumbled best man will be sometimes in error have done good service for yours yet ever since met boy outside gate of lanark have never ceased to twit concerning rest secure that such error will occur again that next time meet will pay alike for wound gave for anger have brought upon head if will give order will start at daybreak with twenty men will take up trail at cottage of john frazer will not give up search until have overtaken slain do so knight replied will forgive having be so easily fooled fellow may have of wallace follower with contemptible a rabble be have best be on guard send round to vassal tell to keep good watch ward keep party of retainer under arm night in readiness to sally out in case of alarm night however passed quietly next day knight sallied out with strong party of retainer searched wood lower slope of hill must find sign of archie follower at nightfall returned to castle in rage declaring that defiance sent be mere piece of insolent bravado nevertheless kept horse again saddled night ready to issue out at slightest alarm soon after midnight flame suddenly burst out at dozen of homestead at warder shout of alarm sir john kerr men at arm instantly mounted gate be thrown open drawbridge lowered sir john rode out at head of following be within few foot of outer end of drawbridge when chain supported suddenly snapped drawbridge fell into moat plunging upon into water archie with band after detaching of number to fire homestead have crept up unperceived in darkness to end of drawbridge have noiselessly cut two projecting beam upon end rested when be lowered have intended to carry out plan on previous night when darkness set in not breath of wind be stirring night be so still that deemed that operation of sawing through beam must not be effected without attracting attention of warder on wall have therefore retreated far up in recess of hill next night however be windy well suited to purpose work have be carried out without attracting attention of warder when kerr men at arm rode out whole weight of drawbridge of horseman crossing be thrown entirely upon chain yielded to strain far greater than be calculated to support instant men at arm be precipitated into moat archie companion who have be lying down near edge leapt to foot opened fire with bow arrow upon be well for sir john retainer that have not stopped to buckle on defensive armour have done so man must have be drowned in deep water a be several be killed with arrow two three by hoof of struggling horse sir john with six of eighteen men who have fallen into moat succeeded in climbing up drawbridge regaining castle fire of arrow be at once opened from wall archie follower be already out of bowshot knowing that fire must call in few minute to spot number of kerr vassal more than sufficient to crush without assistance of in castle again made for hill well satisfied with first blow have struck at enemy rage of sir john kerr be beyond expression have be twice struck by arrow smart of wound added to fury by light of burning barn garrison be enabled to see how small be party have made audacious attack upon increased wrath men be instantly set at work to raise drawbridge from moat to repair chain to replace timber upon rested summons be despatched to whole of vassal to be at castle in arm by daybreak again wood be searched without success band then divided into five party forty strong proceeded to explore hill pentlands afforded numerous hiding place to like archie most of band well acquainted with country after searching till party retired worn out disheartened to castle night three of outlying farm be in flame cattle be slaughtered in byre attack be made upon dwelling house following night sir john distributed whole of vassal among farm lying farthest from castle putting twenty men in to fury time be five homestead nearer at hand be fired instant first outburst of flame be discovered retainer hurried to spot by time reached sign of assailant be visible flame have however taken too good hold of various barn outbuilding to be extinguished chapter vii cave in pentlands john kerr be well nigh beside with fury if be to go on whole of estate must be harried vassal ruined revenue stopped by mere handful of foe again started with vassal to explore hill time in party of ten only so a to explore thoroughly larger space of ground when at evening men returned be found that two men of one of party composed entirely of men at arm from castle came back reported that when in narrow ravine shower of rock be hurled down upon from side four of number be killed at once four others have fallen pierced by arrow from unseen foe a fled back down ravine methinks sir john red roy said that know place where forbeses may have taken up abode when be boy be tending herd of goat far up in hill near pas where mischance have today befallen found cave in mountain side entrance be hidden by bush must not have found have not one of goat entered bush remained there so long that went to see what be doing there found cave entrance be three foot high inside widened out into great cavern where fifty men must shelter perchance archie forbes of band may also have discovered if so might well think that better place of concealment must be found will search tomorrow knight said tell vassal to gather here three hour before daybreak will start so a to be there soon after sunrise if be on foot again tonight will then be asleep did follow cave discover whether have other entrance beyond by entered not henchman replied go long way into hill there be several inner passage did not explore for be alone feared being lost in next night more homestead be burnt time vassal did not turn out a have be told to rest until appointed hour might befall three hour before daybreak party of fifty picked men assembled at castle for force be deemed to be ample two men who have escaped from attack on previous day led way to ravine there red roy became guide led band far up hillside have be possible must have surrounded cave before daylight roy said that be so long since have first found cave that must not lead there in dark must need daylight to enable to recognize surroundings even when daylight came be for time at fault at last pointed to clump of bush growing on broken precipitous face of rock a place where cave be situated red roy be right in conjecture archie have once when wandering among hill shot at wild cat wounded have followed to cave to have fled seeing advantageous place of concealment have when determined to harry district of kerrs fixed upon a hiding place for band deeming possible however that existence might be known to others always placed sentry on watch on approach of kerrs cluny campbell who happened to be on guard ran in roused band with news that kerrs be below archie immediately crept out reconnoitred from bush must see that foe be for present at fault sir john be standing apart from rest with red roy who be narrowly scrutinizing face of cliff archie guessed at once that be aware of existence of cavern though at present must not determine exact spot where be situated be too late to retreat now for face of hill be too steep to climb to crest retreat below be cut off by kerrs therefore returned to cave leaving cluny on guard be not sure a to situation of cave yet said will find can hold mouth against for time might smoke out be real danger if fail in may try starvation do dozen of take brand at once from ember explore winding behind be so narrow low that hitherto have not deemed worth while to examine now be really only hope of may lead round to face of hill in case may find way by may circumvent kerrs six of lad at once started with flaming pine knot while archie returned to entrance just a took place there saw red roy pointing towards bush minute two later sir john follower began to advance archie now called out rest of band who silently took place in bush beside led by sir john personal retainer assailant approached foot of rock began to make way up using utmost precaution to avoid noise there be longer need for concealment a foremost of assailant began to climb great boulder at foot of precipice dozen arrow from bush above alighted among killing three wounding several others sir john kerr shouted to men to follow began to clamber up hill several arrow struck be sheathed in mail a be men at arm although several be wounded in face two slain succeeded in reaching bush must not penetrate further for a strove to tear bush aside force entry behind pierced with spear a four five assailant at time must gain footing use arm be outnumbered finally driven back by defender when sir john furious at discomfiture rejoined vassal below found that assault have already cost eight of best men must however have again led to attack red roy said be best lord to send back bid fifty of vassal to come up hither at once with bow arrow can so riddle bush that defender will be unable to occupy to resist advance be good step sir john said even when gain ledge know not how will force way through hole say be three foot high there be need to force way in red roy replied man who climb will carry with faggot of wood will smoke in hole like wolf be well thought of roy that assuredly be best plan send off at once one of most fleet footed of party archie watching from above saw assailant draw back out of bowshot while one of number started at full speed down hillside others sat down evidently prepared to pas time before renewed attack leaving two of party on guard archie with rest re entered cavern searcher have just returned reported that various passage came to nothing save one ascended rapidly terminated in hole looked a if have be made by rabbit through light of day must be seen then be there must work archie said will myself go examine passage after ascending to point archie judged to be nigh hundred foot above floor of cave narrowed to mere hole two foot high a much wide up crawled for distance of four five yard then narrowed suddenly to hole three four inch in diameter through three foot farther archie must see daylight through clump of heather backed down narrow passage again until joined comrade now said do four of stay here take by turn one after other to enlarge hole forward to entrance a scrape earth down must past back handful by handful enlarge outer entrance disturb root of heather growing there movement might be noticed by below be lucky indeed that rock end just when get to narrowest that be sandy soil through have to scrape way will be hard work for have scarce room to move arm have plenty of time since can not sally out till hour passed slowly about noon lookout reported that number of bowman be approaching be going to attack time under cover of fire archie said a wish to hazard loss of life will keep within cave let gain ledge can never force way through narrow entrance only thing fear be smoke purpose that if light fire at mouth of cave will retire at once up passage where be working block up at narrow place short distance after leaf cavern with clothes have best take off of thing scrape up earth from floor of cavern make stout bundle so that can fill up hole solidly be soon done bundle of earth be laid in readiness at point upon leader have fixed in meantime archie have rejoined lookout have be scattered for time guard said have be cutting down bush making into faggot just what expected archie exclaimed bowman be joining now will soon see at work sir john kerr now marwilled retainer men at arm drew sword rest putting bundle of faggot on shoulder prepared to follow while bowman fitted arrow to string fall back inside cave archie said be of use risking life band now gathered in half circle with level spear round entrance soon heard sharp tapping sound a arrow struck upon rock then there be crashing among bush come on sir john kerr shouted to vassal fox have slunk into hole then came low thud a faggot be cast down light have streamed in through entrance gradually became obscure voice of without muffled darkness grew more intense a faggot be piled thicker thicker then suddenly slight odour of smoke be perceived come along now archie said have fired pile there be fear of entrance two of number with blazing pine knot led way when reached narrow spot passed through archie andrew macpherson last took bundle of earth a others passed along from behind built up like wall across entrance beating down a piled so a to make set close fill up crevice several remained over after wall be completed be opened earth crammed into crevice between bag smell of smoke have grown strong before wall be completed be not too oppressive to breathe holding torch close to wall archie comrade stopped closely few place through saw that smoke be making way soon have satisfaction of seeing that barrier be completely smoke tight there be plenty of air in passage to support life for time archie called back to who be labouring to enlarge exit in order to allow a much fresh air a possible to enter strong guard with spear be placed at barrier although archie deemed that hour at least must elapse before kerrs must attempt to penetrate cave fire must doubtless be kept up for time after have expired must be long before smoke cleared out sufficiently from cave to allow of one entering after time finding that there be difficulty in breathing although air be certainly close heavy archie again set lad at work widening entrance going up to superintend operation in turn crept forward loosened portion of earth with knife then filling cap with crawled backward to point where passage widened be not yet dark when work be so far done that there now remained only slight thickness of earth through root of heath protruded at mouth of passage vigorous push must make exit into air guard at barrier have heard movement within archie withdrew one of bag smoke streamed through so densely that hastily replaced satisfied that hour must still elapse before assailant must enter cave watched impatiently failing light through hole at last when night be completely fallen archie pushed aside earth heather looked around be seemed to on side of hill few yard from point where fell steeply away ground be thickly covered with heather soon made way out ordered andrew macpherson who followed to remain lying at entrance to enjoin a passed out to crawl low among heather so that might not show against skyline where dark a be might attract attention of below archie led way until so far back from edge a to be well out of sight of in valley then gained foot be soon joined by whole of band now said will make for aberfilly think cooped up here will be rejoicing in supposed death will strike one more blow then driving before couple of score of ox for use of army rejoin wallace methinks will have taken fair vengeance for kerr doings at glen cairn consternation of few men left in castle be great when three hour after sunset eight homestead burst suddenly into flame dared not sally out remained under arm until morning when sir john band returned more furious than ever a have penetrated cavern discovered barrier have cut off smoke hole by foe have escaped fury be brought to climax when found damage have be inflicted in absence many week passed before garrison of aberfilly vassal of kerrs be able to sleep in peace so great be scare archie raid have inflicted upon truce be now at end indignation excited by treachery of english spread widely through scotland people flocked to wallace standard in far greater number than before be now able to undertake operation on greater scale perth aberdeen brechin other town fell into hand castle of dundee be invested in south sir william douglas captured castle of sanquhar desdeir others rapid success of scot induced few of greater noble to take field such a steward of scotland sir andrew moray of bothwell sir richard lundin wishart bishop of glasgow wallace be one day lamenting to archie friend grahame that greater noble still held aloof above said must fain see on side comyn young bruce baliol be captive in london be to comyn bruce scotland must look for king so long a only poor knight be at head of rising be rebellion against edward chance be still so weak that few men who have aught to lose join if bruce comyn must raise banner must receive a future king be lord of wide territory besides force must bring into field must be joined by many of principal noble although be true that adherent of other must probably arm for edward still thought of king of own must inflame popular mind vast number who now hesitate to join movement supported by so little authority must then take up arm of two must rather archie asked must rather bruce wallace said father be inert man mere cypher death of grandfather competitor have now brought prominently forward be true that be said to be strong adherent of england personal favourite of edward that spends much of time in london be even at present moment king lieutenant in carrick annandale be waging war for against sir william douglas still comyn be equally devoted to england be older le can be hoped from bruce be young be said to be of great strength skill in arm to be one of foremost knight in edward court be hear of noble presence be much loved by with whom come in contact did man determine to break with edward to strive to win crown of scotland a free gift of people instead of a nominee of edward to rule over independent kingdom instead of english province must attract heart to may well succeed where a foresee must sooner later fail why must fail when have succeeded so far archie asked because have with small portion of people of scotland whole of northern lord hold aloof in south carrick annandale galloway be hostile against have power of england wale ireland although may for time win victory capture town be certain archie in end to be crushed will all effort have be in vain archie said with tear in eye by mean brave lad will have lighted fire of national resistance will have shown people that if scotland divided against with great noble vassal standing sullenly aloof can yet for long time make head against english assuredly when time will come will rise a one man from solway to caithness freedom will be won life will not have be thrown away archie if have taught lesson wallace have by time returned from expedition farther north force be in camp near lanark town when not engaged in distant enterprise be regarded a centre of movement that evening archie said that a leader purposed to give troop rest for week two must go to uncle for short time if can spare sir william

went to spot where band be encamped have expedition for said time together when be over will be able to go home for few day for rest will be glad to see may well be proud of doubt not that spoil

be true scotchman be good place on be standing andrew to place scout among tree here can watch road way from castle to point where enters forest do cluny take post here at once mark well pass what be doing body of men who enter leave castle there be occasion to bring news to for must be unlikely that must meet in forest have therefore only to watch tomorrow will return with band encamp in wood farther back directly arrive will be relieved of guard following day band moved up to spot within mile of seaward edge of forest few hundred yard from road to crossraguel abbey be only on road that archie must hope to effect capture for country near coast be free of tree ambush must be set lord of carrick be moreover patron of abbey bruce might ride over thither with small party whereas if journeying south southeast towards douglasdale must probably be marching with strong force for several day watched castle body of mounted men entered departed twice party among whom lady must be seen came out with hawk none came within reach of lurking foe on fifth morning however lad on watch ran into glade in be encamped reported that small body of seemingly two three knight with lady followed by four mounted men have left castle be approaching by route towards abbey not moment be lost archie placed six of company with pike sword close to road to form across when gave order to bar retreat

dare attack bruce within mile of turnberry why be lad added scornfully rein back girl men at arm will soon clear way for through varlet can do single handed halt sir robert bruce archie exclaimed in loud clear voice if move must perforce give word may well be that of lady with may be struck with arrow young though follower may be must find so easy conquest a imagine have stood up before english ere now men at arm will find hard work to get through pike outnumber threefold be robber be sir archibald forbes exclaimed robert bruce lowering sword have drawn at first alarm held uplifted in readiness for charge sir archibald forbes have heard name often a of one of wallace companion who with sir john grahame fought with bravely at capture of lanark ayr other place surely can not be be sir archibald forbes pledge word archie said quietly sir robert bruce methinks that if who be a see yet lad not yet having reached seventeenth year can have done good service for scotland how great shame that valiant knight great noble must be in rank of oppressor not of champion name will tell have come hither for purpose of robbery have come on mission from wallace not sent thereon by acting in consequence of word dropped from said how sad be that who might be king of scotland free independent by choice of people must prefer chance of reigning mere puppet of edward over enslaved land spoke in highest term of person held that did place at head movement command must be successful one then determined unknown to to set out bring to face to face honourably with courtesy if must by force if must not must fain will be former believe must not find easy to break away through hedge of pike now around by time whole party have gathered round horseman bruce hesitated mind be not yet made up a to future course hitherto have be with england since upon edward only chance seemed to depend latterly have begun to doubt whether even edward must place on throne in despite of wish of countryman sister who taking after mother be true scotchwoman now urged upon to comply with archie request accompany to lanark heart wish be entirely with champion of country go with robert isabel eldest exclaimed sister fear being struck with arrow although such might well be case must conflict begin for own sake scotland go see wallace harm can arise from such journey much good may come of even must news of having have interview with come to ear of edward can truly say that be taken thither captive that being with be unable to make effort to free young knight of whose deed of gallantry have heard smiled approvingly at archie will doubtless give safeguard on honour to return hither free unpledged when have seen wallace willingly lady archie replied one hour interview with honoured

robert will join cause heart soul battle be a good a won journey passed without adventure until arrived within two mile of lanark where archie found wallace be now staying on road bruce have have much conversation with archie learned detail of many adventure of before have only heard vaguely by report be much struck by lad modesty loyal patriotism if ever come to kingdom sir archie said will be one of most trusted knight counsellor be well assured that advice may give will be ever what think to be right for good of country without self seeking in interest of be more than must look for in most counsellor now methinks that a be drawing near to lanark will be well that waited here in wood under guard of follower while ride forward inform wallace that be here care not to show in lanark for busy tongue must soon take news to edward a know not what may come of interview be well that must not be known to men archie agreed rode into town why where have be truant sir william exclaimed a archie entered room in governor house have be set apart for use of wallace since expulsion of english sir robert gordon have be here several time tell that have seen nought of although have made many inquiry have be able to obtain news save that band have disappeared even sent to glen cairn thinking that might have be repairing damage fire lighted by kerrs did to hold found not only that be not there that none of band have returned thither made more mysterious for have alone disappeared must have supposed that have be following up love adventure though indeed have never told that heart be in way touched archie laughed there will be time enough for sir william ten year hence in truth have be on adventure on own account so in sober earnest expected archie feared that enterprise might lead into serious scrape since deemed that must have be well nigh desperate one must not have hidden from knowledge might have led to blow sir william happily did not turn out so knowing importance attached to adhesion of cause of scotland of robert bruce determined to fetch hither to see be now waiting with band for coming in wood two mile from town be jesting with wallace exclaimed be bruce really waiting to see why must be well nigh miracle be fact sir william if will cause horse to be brought to door will tell on road how have come about in five minute sir william young follower be on way former heard how archie have entrapped robert bruce while riding to crossraguel abbey be well done indeed scottish leader exclaimed may well prove archie that have done more towards freeing scotland by adventure of yours than have by month of marching fighting ah sir william have not be for marching fighting bruce must never have wavered in allegiance to edward be only because begin to think that cause may be winning one decides to join meeting between wallace bruce be cordial one admired splendid proportion great strength of other for be probable that in europe there be two more doughty champion although indeed wallace be far superior in personal strength while bruce be famous through europe for skill in knightly exercise archie withdrew to distance while leader conversed must see that talk be animated a strode together up down among tree wallace being principal speaker at end of hour stopped wallace ordered horse to be brought then called archie to sir robert have decided to throw in lot with said will at once call out father vassal of carrick annandale seeing that father be at edward court may be that many will not obey summons still must hope that for love of scotland young lord many will follow will write to pope to ask to absolve for breach of oath of homage to edward a such oath lie lightly on men mind in day have be taken broken by king edward a well a by sir william douglas other knight who be now in field with will not wait for pope reply will at once take field indeed there be need for haste seeing that percy clifford have already crossed border

strong to be openly attacked on night following arrival in neighbourhood wallace broke in upon in night surprised by sudden unexpected attack english fell into great confusion percy at once ordered camp to be set on fire by light english be able to see how small be force of assailant gathering together soon showed so formidable front wallace called off men not before large number of english have be killed many of store a well a tent be destroyed by conflagration english army now proceeded with slow march towards ayr at irvine scotch leader have assembled army douglas bruce steward sir richard loudon wishart bishop of glasgow others force be about equal to of english marching against wallace be collecting troop further north archie be of course with fear lad said one day that will not be able to reach irvine before army join battle sir william douglas bruce be there a lie in country be better to let win day without meddling archie fear there will be battle news have reached that messenger be riding to fro between percy army scot fear that half hearted baron will make peace surely that can not be be shame indeed to have taken up sword to lay down after scarce striking blow methinks archie that word shame be not to be found in vocabulary of noble of unhappy land let hope for best few day will bring news news when came be of worst noble headed by wishart douglas bruce with exception only of sir andrew moray of bothwell have made submission acknowledging guilt of rebellion promising to make reparation required by sovereign lord percy on part guaranteed life land good chattel that must not be imprisoned punished for what have taken place sir william douglas bruce be ordered to find guarantee for good conduct sir william douglas finding unable to fulfil engagement surrendered be thrown into prison in berwick castle there kept in iron until died death being attributed by contemporary historian to poison surrender of leader have little result upon situation people have won success without aid beyond indignation excited by conduct treaty of irvine did nothing towards ensuring peace indeed heightened confidence of people in wallace movement

stirling bridge upon rejoining force sir william wallace called few knight gentleman who be with together said to methinks gentleman that woe of contest must not fall upon one side only one of here be outlawed if be taken by english will be executed thrown in prison for life land belonging to forfeited be time that who fight upon other side must learn that too run risk besides leading vassal in

confiscated bestow upon good friend sir archie forbes sir john grahame do proceed tomorrow with five hundred men take possession of hold of kerrs sir allan kerr be still at stirling will not be there to defend like enough vassal will make resistance will gladly accept change of master kerrs have reputation of being hard lord vassal can not like being forced to fight against cause of country hired men at arm may resist will know how to make short work of ask to go rather than sir archibald forbes because must not that be said that took kerr hold on private quarrel when have captured will take

of kerrs be powerful family being connected by marriage with comyns of badenoch other noble house land in ayr be a extensive a in lanark even with father land added to own however if scotland win day good work that have done must well outweigh influence might bring to bear against now archie can for time release ere long edward army will be pouring across border then will need good scotchman sword till then have best retire to new estate spend time in preparing vassal to follow in field in putting one other of castle in best state of defence may methinks that kerr hold may more easily be made to withstand lengthened siege than glen cairn seeing that latter be commanded by hill beside kerr castle too be much larger more strongly fortified need thanks continued a archie be about to express warm gratitude be warden of scotland who reward service to country sir william wallace will not forget how have twice stood beside against overwhelming odds how yesterday in stirling be watchful care thoughtful precaution alone saved life archie friend congratulated warmly next morning with own band started for glen cairn here news that be once more lawful chief caused greatest delight be evening when reached village soon great bonfire blazed in street a news spread burned up from many outlying farm before night vassal of estate came in glen cairn village be scene of great enthusiasm much a archie regretted that must not establish in hold of father felt that wallace suggestion be right one glen cairn be mere shell must in case be made capable of prolonged resistance by powerful force whereas castle of kerrs be very strong be disappointment to retainer when heard that must not at once return among saw force of reason promised that if scotland be freed peace restored must again make glen cairn habitable pas of time there in meantime said will be eight mile from estate will be one now hope that for next three month man among will aid by personal labour by sending horse cart in work of strengthening to utmost new castle of aberfilly wish to make so strong that will long resist attack must scotland be permanently conquered may god forfend must not of course be held must have temporary revers might well hold out until party again gather head man on estate promised aid to extent far beyond archie a feudal superior have right to demand from have have hard time under kerrs who have raised rent greatly increased feudal service be sure of good treatment must forbeses make good position a lord be ready to make sacrifice to aid to do so next morning messenger arrived from sir john grahame saying that have during night stormed aberfilly that with scarce exception vassal of kerrs when upon arrival on previous day have learned of purpose in coming of disposition wallace have made of estate have accepted change with delight have joined in assault upon castle be defended only by thirty men at arm have be killed sir john invited archie to ride over at once take possession did found that vassal of estate be gathered at castle to welcome be introduced to by sir john grahame received archie with shout of enthusiasm swore obedience to a feudal lord archie promised to be kind lenient chief to abate unfair burden have be laid upon to respect right said just at first must ask for sacrifice from castle be strong must be made much stronger must be capable of standing continued siege in case temporary revers must enable english to endeavour to retake for friend sir allan kerr vassal at glen cairn have promised aid far beyond can command trust that also will extend time of feudal service promise relaxation in future year equivalent to time may now give demand be readily assented to for tenant of aberfilly be le delighted than of glen cairn to escape from rule of kerrs archie accompanied by sir john grahame now made inspection of wall of new hold stood just where county of linlithgow edinburgh join that of lanark be built on island on tributary of clyde stream be small one island have be artificially made so that stream formed moat on side of castle occupying knoll of ground rose somewhat abruptly from surrounding country moat be twelve foot wide archie sir john decided that must be widened to fifty foot deepened to ten that dam must be built just below castle to keep back stream fill moat wall must everywhere be raised ten foot several strong additional flanking tower added work built beyond moat to guard head of drawbridge with such addition aberfilly must be able to stand long siege by force might assail timber stone rough labour there be in abundance wallace have insisted upon archie taking from treasure have be captured from enemy sum of money must be ample to hire skilled mason from lanark to pay for cement iron other necessary must be beyond resource of estate matter in train archie rode to lanark fetched proud rejoicing mother from sir robert gordon to aberfilly be accompanied by sandy graham elspie former archie appointed majordomo to be in command of garrison whenever must be absent vassal be a good a word for three month work of digging quarrying cutting squaring timber building went on without intermission there be upon estate fully three hundred ablebodied men work progressed rapidly when therefore archie received message from wallace to join near stirling felt that must leave aberfilly without fear of successful attack being made upon in absence there be need indeed for scotch capable of bearing arm to gather round wallace under earl of high treasurer cressingham other leader army of foot horse be advancing from berwick while foot horse under earl percy advanced from carlisle wallace be besieging castle of dundee when heard of approach leaving people of dundee to carry on siege under command of sir alexander scrymgeour marched to defend only bridge by edward must cross forth near stirling thus far surrey have experienced resistance at head of so large well appointed force might well feel sure of success large proportion of army consisted of veteran inured to service in war at home in wale with french while mail clad knight men at arm looked with absolute contempt upon gathering be opposed to consisted solely of popular levy of men who have left home taken up arm for freedom of country be rudely armed hastily trained of feudal noble of scotland who must have led one sir andrew moray be present commander be still little more than youth who great a be individual valour prowess have have experience in art of war on large scale while english be led by general whose fame be known throughout europe scot took up station upon high ground north of forth protected from observation by precipitous hill immediately behind cambuskenneth abbey known a abbey craig in bend of river opposite abbey craig stood bridge by english army be preparing to cross archie stood beside wallace on top of craig looking at english array be fair sight said great camp with pavilion banner pennon lying there in valley with old castle rising on lofty rock behind be pity that sight must bode evil to scotland yes wallace said must that camp lay where be that pennon banner be of scotland noble that royal lion floated over surrey tent truly be sight must glad scot heart when will see ought like however archie went on in lighter tone methinks that will be rare camp to plunder archie laughed one must kill lion before one talk of dividing skin said truly seems well nigh impossible that following a yours true scot brave men though be yet altogether undisciplined new to war must be able to bear brunt of battle be thinking of dunbar wallace said did fight in such field chance must be poor with broad river in front narrow bridge for access methinks that can render account of god grant be so archie replied will be right glad when day be over three day before battle steward of scotland earl of lennox others of scotch magnate entered surrey camp begged that must not attack until tried to induce people to lay down arm returned however on third day saying that must not listen to that next day must join army with men at arm on leaving camp evening scotch noble riding homeward have broil with english soldier of whom one be wounded by earl of lennox news being brought to surrey resolved to wait no longer gave order that assault must take place on following morning at daybreak of th of september one of outpost woke wallace with news that english be crossing bridge troop be at once got under arm be eager to rush down to commence battle wallace restrained five thousand welsh foot soldier crossed bridge then there be pause none be seen following be to charge down now sir william archie said surely might destroy that body before aid must come to must do archie a say wallace replied success must be of little worth nay must harm rather than benefit for surrey learning that be not altogether to be despised a now belief must be more prudent in future must keep army in flat country where must do nought against to win much one must risk much must wait until surrey army be across before venture down against presently welsh be seen to retire again movement have be premature surrey be still asleep nothing must be done until awoke when did so army armed leisurely after surrey bestowed honour of knighthood upon many young aspirant number of scot under wallace be not certainly known majority of estimate place below twenty thousand a english historian who best describes battle speaks of a defeat of many by few can certainly be assumed that did not exceed number only on ground of utter contempt for enemy can conduct of earl of surrey in attempting to engage in position be understood bridge be wide enough for two at most three horseman to cross abreast when who have crossed be attacked assistance must reach slowly from rear english knight men at arm with royal standard banner of earl of surrey crossed first men at arm be followed by infantry who a passed formed up on tongue of land formed by winding of river when english army have passed wallace gave order to advance first sir andrew moray with two thousand men descended hill farther to right on seeing english cavalry charged at once against instant did so wallace with main army poured down from craig impetuously swept away english near head of bridge taking possession of end by shower of arrow dart preventing more from crossing by maneuver whole of english infantry who have crossed be cut off from friend inclosed in narrow promontory english men at arm have succeeded in overthrowing scot against whom have charged have pursued distance upon drawing rein turning to rejoin army found aspect of affair changed indeed troop left at head of bridge be overthrown destroyed royal banner that of surrey be down bridge in possession of enemy men at arm charged back strove in vain to recover head of bridge scot fought stubbornly in front made hedge of pike while behind hurled dart poured shower of arrow into english rank greater proportion of men at arm be killed one valiant knight alone sir marmaduke de twenge with nephew squire cut way through scot crossed bridge many be drowned in attempting to swim river one only succeeding in so gaining opposite side men at arm defeated wallace chosen band under who have be engaged with joined who be attacking english welsh now cooped up in promontory flushed with success already gained scot be irresistible almost man who have crossed be either killed drowned in attempting to swim river sooner have seen that success in quarter be secure than wallace led large number of follower across bridge here english who still outnumbered army who have now advantage of position have previously be on side of scot might have defended bridge in good order have given battle on other side sight however of terrible disaster have befallen nearly number before eye without being able to render slightest assistance have completely demoralized a soon a scotch be seen to be crossing bridge fled in terror hot pursuit be kept up by fleet footed lightly armed scot great number of fugitive be slain more than english perished in battle flight remainder crossed border mere herd of broken fugitive earl of surrey before riding off field committed charge of castle of stirling to sir marmaduke de twenge promising that must return to relief within ten week at utmost tent wagon horse provision store of english fell into hand of enemy scotch soldier obtained rich booty cressingham be among number killed be said by one english historian account have be copied by many others that cressingham body be flayed skin divided among scot there appears good foundation for story although probably cressingham who have rendered peculiarly obnoxious hateful to scot be hewn in piece even be proved that ill story be true one need excite surprise seeing wholesale slaying plundering burning have be carried on by english that scottish prisoner falling into hand be often mutilated tortured before being executed quartered english historian be fond of cry out that scotch be cruel barbarous people whenever retaliated for treatment suffered so far from being case be probable that scotch before first invasion of edward be more enlightened for number more well to do people than english have for many year enjoyed peace tranquillity under long prosperous reign of alexander have made great advance while england have be harassed by continuous war trouble at home abroad warlike baron when not engaged under monarch in war in wale ireland france occupied in quarrel

beside in spite of precaution be grievously straitened be delayed for month near edinburgh a wallace so wasted country that army be almost famished by effort be able to bring on battle with scot whose rapid march intimate acquaintance with country baffled effort of english leader to force on action edward be about to retreat being unable longer to subsist army when two scottish earl of dunbar angus sent news to king wallace with army be in falkirk forest about six mile away have arranged to attack camp on following morning english at once advanced that evening encamped at linlithgow next morning moved on against scot late in evening archie scout brought in news to wallace that english army be within three mile consultation be at once held between leader most of be in favour of retreat comyn of badenoch who have lately joined wallace have be from rank appointed to command of cavalry with of associate urged strongly necessity for fighting saying that men must be utterly dispirited at such continual retreat that with such immensely superior cavalry english must follow up destroy to argument wallace sir john grahame sir john stewart yielded own opinion prepared to fight took up position so front be protected by morass fence of stake rope be also fixed across so a to impede advance retreat of english cavalry scotch army consisted almost entirely of infantry be about third number of of english while comyn cavalry be thousand strong infantry be formed in three great square circle front rank kneeling spear pointing outwards in space between square be placed archer under sir john stewart english army be drawn up in three division first commanded by earl marechal earl of lincoln hereford second by beck warlike bishop of durham sir ralph basset third by king first two division consisted almost entirely of knight men at arm third of archer slinger wallace plan of battle be that scottish square must first receive brunt of onslaught of enemy that while english be endeavouring to break scotch cavalry be drawn up distance in rear must fall upon when in confused mass drive against fence into morass first division of english on arriving at bog made circuit to west second division seeing obstacle first have encountered moved round to east fell upon scottish square instant be seen rounding end of morass traitor comyn with whole of cavalry turned rein fled from field leaving infantry alone to support whole brunt of attack of english so impetuous be charge of latter sir john stewart archer be unable to gain shelter of square be with almost men slain by english men at arm thus spearmen be left entirely to own resource encouraged by wallace grahame archie forbes other leader scottish square stood firmly english cavalry in vain strove to break hedge of spear again again bravest of chivalry of england tried to hew way through scot stood firm undismayed have battle lain between english cavalry day must have be theirs presently king with enormous body of infantry arrived on ground english archer slinger poured cloud of missile into rank of scot while english spearmen picking up great stone with ground be strewn hurled at front rank of foe against storm of missile scottish square must hing such armour a have be useless against english clothyard arrow thousand fell a stood again again closed up gap in rank at last must no longer withstand hail of arrow

direction number be drowned by trying to swim river carron ran close by multitude be cut down by host of english cavalry sir archie forbes be in same square with wallace with few other mounted men dashed forward against english a broke through rank of spearmen force opposed be overwhelming be of use archie must retire better than throw away life uselessly be lost now wallace shouted to spearmen who gallantly rallied round keeping together in spite of effort of english cavalry succeeded in withdrawing from field other square be entirely broken dispersed scarce man of escaped account vary a to amount of slaughter english writer placing a double that of army wallace must possibly have brought into field seeing that whole of great noble stood aloof grahame stewart macduff of fife be only three men of noble family with be slain together with infantry wallace with about men succeeded in crossing ford of carron english spread over country district of fife clackmannan lanark ayr surrounding country be wasted burnt man found put to sword scotch in retreating destroyed stirling perth english found town of st andrew deserted burnt to ground sooner have wallace retreated than divided force into small band proceeded in separate direction driving off cattle destroying store of grain so in fortnight after battle of falkirk english army be again brought to stand by shortness of provision be compelled to fall back again with speed to mouth of forth there to obtain provision from ship a did so wallace reunited band pressed hard upon at linlithgow fell upon rear inflicted heavy loss so hotly did press that great army be obliged to retreat rapidly across border made halt until reached fortress of carlisle that be compulsion alone forced edward to make speedy retreat may be sure from fact that after victory of dunbar be contented with nothing le than clean sweep of scotland to northern coast that repeated same process when in year following battle of falkirk again returned with mighty army thus decisive a be battle of falkirk be entirely abortive in result when english have crossed border wallace assembled few gentleman who be still with announced intention of resigning guardianship of scotland of leaving country announcement be received with exclamation of surprise regret surely sir william archie exclaimed can not mean be only leader in have unbounded confidence in none else have not be for treachery of comyn field of falkirk must have be ours for have horse charged when english be in confusion round square have assuredly be defeated moreover effort have retrieved that disastrous field have driven english across border dear archie wallace said be because be only leader in whom have confidence must need go have vainly hoped that when scottish noble saw what great thing commonalty be able to do how far alone unaided have cleared scotland of tyrant must have joined with vassal see be not so success have gained have excited envy against of only grahame stewart macduff stood by side while great earl baron held aloof be like bruce in rank of edward army like comyn friend joined solely to betray be convinced now that be only united scotland can resist power of england be certain that so long a remain here scotland never can be united of bruce have longer hope if retire comyn may take lead many at least of scottish noble will follow have horseman archer to support spearmen must not fear issue be noble alone who can place mounted men at arm in field of bowman must always be deficient seeing that people take not naturally to arm a do english with spearmen to break first shock of english chivalry with horseman to charge when in confusion may yet succeed horseman will never get so long a noble hold aloof be useless to try change decision friend sore grief though will be to to sheathe sword to stand aloof when scotland struggle for freedom be convinced that only by doing so have scotland chance of ultimate success in struggle make harder for by pleading have thought long over mind be made up heart be well nigh broken by death of dear friend brother in arm sir john grahame feel able to struggle no longer against jealousy hostility of scottish noble wallace hearer be in tear at decision felt that there be truth in word that scottish noble be far more influenced by feeling of personal jealousy pique than by patriotism that so long a wallace remained guardian of scotland must to man side with english next day wallace assembled follower in few word announced determination reason have driven to take urged to let feeling of resentment at treatment have experienced wrath at lukewarmness treachery have hitherto marked scottish noble overcome feeling of patriotism to follow leader must raise banner of scotland a bravely devotedly a have followed then bade farewell mounting horse rode to seacoast passed over to france although have retired from scotland wallace did not cease from war against english being warmly received by french king fought against by sea land won much renown among french after returning to england edward finding that scottish leader still professed to recognize baliol a king sent to pope at rome having first confiscated great possession in england bestowed upon own nephew john of brittany during rest of life baliol lived in obscurity in rome portion of scotch noble assembled chose john comyn of badenoch john de soulis a guardian of kingdom in autumn of following year edward again assembled great army moved north be late in face of approaching winter difficulty of forage many of baron refused to advance edward marched across border seeing that scot have assembled in force at season of year must not hope to carry design fully into execution retired without striking blow thereupon castle of stirling be invested by scot seeing hope of relief surrendered sir william oliphant be appointed governor next spring edward again advanced with army even greater than with have before entered scotland with be alexander of baliol son of late king who be devoted to english dunbar fraser ross other scottish noble vast army first laid siege to little castle of carlaverock although defended by sixty men resisted for time assault of whole army be at last captured scot fell back a edward advanced renewing wallace tactic of wasting country edward must get further than dumfries here finding enormous difficulty beset made pretence of yielding with good grace to entreaty of pope king of france that must spare scotland retired to england disbanded army having accomplished nothing in campaign save capture of carlaverock following summer again advanced with army time supported by fleet of seventy ship scot resorted to usual strategy when winter came invader have penetrated no further than forth edward remained at linlithgow for time then returned to england sir simon fraser who have be one of leader of english army at carlaverock now imitated comyn example deserting english cause joined countryman greater part of english army recrossed border scot captured many of garrison left in town sir john seagrave next invaded scotland with from to men mostly cavalry reached neighbourhood of edinburgh when comyn fraser advanced against with men chiefly infantry english army be advancing in three division in order better to obtain provision forage after rapid night march scotch came upon one of commanded by seagrave in person conceiving sufficiently strong to defeat scot unaided by of other division sir john seagrave immediately gave battle a at falkirk english cavalry be unable to break through scottish pike great number be killed taken prisoner seagrave being severely wounded captured with twenty distinguished knight thirty esquire many soldier scarcely be battle over when second english division even stronger than first arrived on field encumbered by prisoner scot be at disadvantage fearing to be attacked by in rear while engaged in front slaughtered greater portion of prisoner arming camp follower prepared to resist english onslaught failed a first have done cavalry be defeated with great loss by spearmen many prisoner taken among sir ralph manton third english division now appeared scot worn out by long march two severe conflict have endured be about to fly from field when leader exhorted to one more effort second batch of prisoner be slaughtered pikemen again formed line to resist english charge again be cavalry defeated sir robert neville leader slain with many others whole dispersed scattered sir robert manton who be king treasurer have have quarrel with fraser when latter be in edward service regarding pay fraser be said by historian to have now revenged by slaying prisoner other account however represent manton a having escaped slaughter of prisoner appears although cruel to have be unavoidable a scot having before well appointed force fully equal to own in number must not have risked engaging with so large body of prisoner in rear none of knight other leader be slain being subsequently exchanged ransomed a afterwards find fighting in english rank seeing by defeat that vast effort be necessary to conquer scotland king edward advanced in spring of with army of such number that historian of time content with saying that be great beyond measure consisted of english welsh irish gascons savoyard one division under prince of wale advanced by west coast that of king by east two united at forth without meeting serious resistance great host marched north through perth dundee to brechin where castle under charge of sir thomas maille resisted for twenty day be only after death of governor that surrendered english then marched north through aberdeen banff moray into caithness carrying utter destruction everywhere town hamlet village farmhouse be alike destroyed crop be burned forest orchard cut down thus be whole of scotland wasted even rich abbey of abberbredok dunfermline richest most famous in scotland be destroyed whole levelled to ground very field be a far a possible injured intention of edward being a fordun say to blot out people to reduce land to condition of irrecoverable devastation thus to stamp out for ever further resistance in scotland during three year have elapsed since departure of wallace archie have for most part remained quietly in castle occupying with comfort wellbeing of vassal have time english entered scotland taken field with portion of retainer in obedience to summons of comyn latter be little disposed to hold valid grant made by wallace especially in case of archie forbes kerrs being connection of house feeling of people in general be too strongly in favour of companion of wallace for to venture to set aside especially a castle must not be captured without long continued siege archie many of noble hostile to claim of comyn obeyed order being sole possible leader at present of scotland edward however have left alternative since have in order to induce english noble to follow formally divided among land of whole of scotch noble save actually fighting in rank archie be now nearly three twenty frame have fully borne out promise of youth be over average height appeared shorter from extreme breadth of shoulder arm be long sinewy personal strength immense from time of first taking possession of aberfilly

bruce at last great invasion by edward archie did not take field seeing that comyn in despair of opposing so vast host did not call out levy upon approach of english army under prince of wale called whole of tenant into castle great store of provision have already be collected woman child be sent away up into hill where provision have also be garnered old men boy accompanied a prince of wale passed north band from army spreading over country destroyed house in district archie be summoned to surrender refused to do so prince being on way to join father on forth after surveying hold judging far too strong to be carried without prolonged siege marched forward promising on return to destroy soon afterwards archie received message wallace have returned at once took with fifty men leaving castle in charge of sandy graham with rest of vassal two hundred fifty in number rejoined former leader many others gathered round wallace standard throughout edward march to north return to forth wallace hung upon flank cutting off slaying great number of marauder striking blow at detached band wherever be in number not too formidable to be coped with stirling be now only great castle remained in hand of scotch king edward prepared to lay siege to save for band of wallace there be longer open resistance in field few hold like of archie forbes still remained in hand of owner insignificance time must be wasted in subduing having protected from siege none of noble now remained in arm bruce have for short time taken field have a usual hastened to make peace with edward comyn adherent surrendered upon promise of life freedom that must retain estate subject to pecuniary fine noble of scotland be included in capitulation save few who be condemned to suffer temporary banishment sir william wallace alone be by name specially exempted from surrender stirling castle be invested on th of april for seventy day held out against effort of edward army warlike engine of kind have be brought from england for siege religious house of st andrew brechin other church be stripped of lead for engine sheriff of london lincoln york governor of tower be ordered to collect forward mangonel quarrel bow arrow must gather for seventy day missile of kind immense stone leaden ball javelin be rained upon castle greek fire new terrible mode of destruction be also used in siege be only when provision other resource be exhausted that garrison capitulated be found that survivor of garrison have defended stirling castle for upwards of three month against whole force of england numbered including governor sir william oliphant twenty four knight gentleman hundred twenty soldier two monk thirteen female during siege wallace have kept field archie have at request returned to castle being day march from stirling might at moment be besieged several time indeed party appeared before be hand be too full must spare none of necessary engine to undertake such siege when stirling at length fell army be in too great haste to return to england to undertake prolonged siege especially a aberfilly standing in retired position commanding none of principal road be hold of political importance short time afterwards to archie immense grief sir william wallace be betrayed into hand of english several scotchman took part in base act principal being sir john menteith late historian in ardour to whitewash who have for age be held up to infamy have endeavoured to show that sir john menteith be not concerned in matter evidence be overwhelming other way scotch opinion at time for generation afterwards universally imputed crime to fordun who wrote in reign of robert bruce bowyer langtoft scotch historian say that be who betrayed wallace account be confirmed by contemporary english writing chronicle of lanercost arundel ms written about year scala chronica distinctly say that wallace be seized by sir john menteith finally sir francis palgrave have discovered in memoranda of business of privy council that forty mark be bestowed upon young man who spied out wallace sixty mark be divided among others who assisted in capture to sir john menteith be given land of annual value of one hundred pound very large amount in day manner in wallace be seized be uncertain be at once handed by sir john menteith to sir john seagrave carried by to london be taken on horseback to westminster mayor sheriff alderman with great number of horse foot accompanying there mockery of trial be held be in one day tried condemned executed defended nobly urging truly that a native born scotsman have never sworn fealty allegiance to england that be perfectly justified in fighting for freedom of country cruelty attended execution be drawn through street at tail of horse be hung for time by halter be taken down while yet alive be mutilated disembowelled head then cut off body divided in four head impaled over london bridge quarter distributed to four principal town in scotland such barbarity be common at execution in day of norman king who have be described by modern writer a chivalrous monarch nobler character than wallace be not to be found in history alone poor landless knight by personal valour energy aroused spirit of countryman in spite of opposition of whole of noble of country banded people in resistance against england for time wrested scotland from hand of edward bitter enemy english be unable to adduce proof that epithet of ferocious bloodthirsty with be so fond of endowing have even shadow of foundation may rather believe scotch account that gentleness nobility of soul be equal to valour of moderation wisdom when acting a governor of scotland there can be doubt while brilliant strategy first won battle of stirling must have gained that of falkirk have not treachery cowardice of cavalry ruined plan show that under other circumstance must have taken rank a one of greatest commander of own age first taught countryman indeed europe in general that steady infantry can repel assault even of mailclad cavalry lesson be followed at bannockburn by bruce who won under precisely same circumstance a under wallace have be defeated simply because at critical moment have horse at hand to charge disordered mass of english while at falkirk wallace horse who must have struck blow be galloping far away from battlefield upon english conqueror be lesson lost for at cressy when attacked by vastly superior number edward iii dismounted army ordered to fight on foot result gave death blow to mailed chivalry have come to be regarded a only force worth reckoning in battle conduct of edward to wallace later to many other distinguished scotchman who fell into hand be foul blot upon memory of one of greatest of king of england edward might now well have believed scotland be crushed for ever in ten year no le than twelve great army have marched across border twice whole country have be ravaged from sea to sea last time so effectually that edward have good ground for belief that land must never again raise head from beneath foot now proceeded a william of normandy after hastings have done to settle conquest appointed thirty one commissioner of whom twenty one be english ten so called scotch among sir john menteith to carry out ordinance place of strength be occupied by english garrison high officer large proportion of justiciary sheriff be english edward ruled scotland from westminster a did england among commissioner be robert bruce now through death of father lord of annandale carrick edward addressed proclamation to headed to faithful loyal robert de bruce earl of carrick others who be in company greeting went on to say that possessed king fullest confidence though scotland lay prostrate spirit of resistance yet lingered in heart of commonalty although conquered now memory of past success still inspired until leader presented none must stir be in august that wallace have be executed archie have received several summons from english governor of stirling lanark to come in do homage to edward have resolutely declined task of capturing castle be too heavy one to be undertaken by single garrison still saw that time must come sooner later when must have to choose between surrender death when matter settled down be certain that great effort must be made to root out one recalcitrant south of forth for time remained gloomy thoughtful mood most unusual to mother who be watching anxiously be scarcely surprised when one day said to mother must leave for time matter can no longer continue a be surrender to english will not there remains for to defend castle to last then to escape to france to cross thither at once enter service of french king a did wallace of course must fain take latter seeing that former must bring ruin death upon vassal who have ever done faithful service when called upon whom must not see suffer for sake in case must propose that must return live quietly with sir robert gordon until time change dame forbes agreed with son for have long felt that further resistance must only bring ruin upon there be yet one other course mother that be about to take be well nigh desperate one hope of success be small yet must attempt before leave scotland give aberfilly back again to kerrs ask not what be for be best that if fail must not know of there be danger in enterprise for month will be absent on return will hear final resolve having attired a lowland farmer archie proceeded to edinburgh there took ship for london here took lodging at inn have be told in edinburgh be much frequented by scotchman who have to go to london on business first care be to purchase garment of english gentleman of moderate mean so that must pas through street without attracting attention be greatly impressed with bustle wealth of london be wonderful said to that scot who be after army of peasant must for nigh ten year have supported war against country a seems madness to adventure farther in way if present errand fails will assuredly hold firm to resolve seek refuge in france archie ascertained that robert bruce lodged at westminster that great gaiety be taking place at court for joy at final termination of hostility with scotland now secured by execution of wallace despatched letter to earl by messenger from inn saying that one who have formerly known in scotland desired earnestly to speak to on matter of great import begging to grant private interview with at lodging at a early hour a might be convenient to man returned with verbal reply that earl must see writer at lodging at nine o'clock on following morning at appointed time archie presented at house inhabited by bruce to request of earl retainer for name business replied that name mattered not that have received message from earl appointing meeting at hour two minute later be ushered into private cabinet of robert bruce latter be seated writing looked up at unknown visitor do remember sir robert bruce archie asked methinks know face sir earl replied can not recall where have seen be five year since archie said a time have changed from youth into man wonder not that face have escaped know now earl exclaimed rising suddenly from seat be sir archibald forbes be archie replied have come now on same errand came then cause of country english think be dead though faint bleeding scotland yet life there be one man only who can revive man be mission be vain one bruce replied though honour sir archibald for faith constancy though must give much ay have be record one of a true patriotism sacrifice a yours yet be madness to listen to have not asked bitterly earned hatred of countryman have not three time raised standard only to lower again without striking blow did not fight by edward at field of falkirk ah said in changed tone never will forget horror felt a passed over field strewn with scottish corps truly name must be loathed in scotland yet sir archibald irresolute false a have hitherto proved believe love scotland land of mother believe sir archie said be therefore that implore to listen to be now only possible leader only possible king baliol be captive at rome son courtier of edward wallace be dead comyn proved weak incapable be unable to rally people to offer opposition to edward last march scotland need leader strong valiant a wallace capable of uniting around large body at least of scotch noble having claim to crown know not sir how deep be hatred of english last terrible incursion of edward have spread that feeling far wide while before be in few county of lowland that flame of resistance really burnt time believe that scotland save perhaps comyns adherent must rise at call say not that success must at once attend for forgive for saying so commonalty must not at first trust when saw that be fighting for scotland a well a for own crown that have by action definitely for ever broken with english have time entered heart soul into cause be sure must not hold back own vassal of carrick annandale be goodly array in young douglas might be counted on to bring dalesman to banner there be lord who have favoured cause so stood aloof from comyn will have good array to commence with above all even if unsuccessful at first scotland must come in time to regard a king champion resistance will never cease for even wallace be ever able to assemble band make head against english so will be with until at last freedom be achieved will reign free king over free scotland name will be honoured to time a champion deliverer of country think not sir went on earnestly a bruce paced up down little room that be too late other scotchman fraser many others who have warred in english rank have be joyfully received when at length drew sword for scotland only do stand forth a champion believe that memory of former weakness will be forgotten in admiration of present patriotism for two three minute bruce strode up down room then paused before archie by heaven said will do be not so sanguine a believe that success can ever finally attend enterprise be that a may will attempt win die memory of robert bruce will go down in heart of scotchman a one who early error atoned for at last by living dying in cause sister brother have long urged to take step must never bring to brave power of england word have decided die be cast henceforward robert bruce be scotchman now sir archibald what think first step must be english in scotland be lulled in security sudden blow upon will assuredly at first be wholly successful must withdraw suddenly quietly from here be not easy to do so bruce replied although high in favour with edward have yet suspicion of not said bitterly without just cause must assuredly arrest did know that be going north only plan will be to appear at court a usual while send down relay of horse along northern road will ride with sir archie will not must tell have already in degree prepared for movement in scotland comyn have met have talked over matter mutual claim to crown stood in way have agreed that one will yield to other take crown will give land to be property of other in consideration of waiving claim giving support have agreed to have signed mutual bond to effect though be not so writ down have further agreed that will have crown that comyn will take carrick annandale be for future thought not of movement for present be bad bargain sir archie said gravely one trust will never be carried out comyns be even now most powerful noble in scotland with carrick annandale in addition to own broad land must be master of scotland let who must be called king did displease must with vassal connection place stronger army in field than king must raise must at moment did anger call in english to aid so again lay scotland under english yoke will think of sir archie there be much in what say sorely doubt comyns henceforth fear to give advice freely possessed confidence of wallace have shown worthy of must ever free scotland win kingdom believe will not find robert bruce ungrateful will give order tomorrow for horse to be privately sent forward so at hour

unable to be present at council have be prompt step must have be taken must by time be lying prisoner in tower even now may be arrested at moment have aught for wish to return to inn archie replied

virtue of be now present a soon a news that bruce have arrived in town spread adherent vassal there speedily gathered round a accompanied by several of went through town met comyn in precinct of grey friar concerning memorable meeting there have be great dispute among historian have charged bruce with inviting comyn to meet with deliberate intention of slaying others have represented meeting a accidental slaying of comyn a result of outburst of passion on part of bruce one who weighs fact considers circumstance in comyn be placed can feel least question that latter be true hypothesis bruce whose whole course show to have be man who acted with prudence foresight must have be nothing short of mad have just at time when be necessary to secure goodwill of whole of scotch noble chosen moment to slay comyn with whom be connected by blood friendship larger half of scotch noble still le have decided upon so suicidal course must have selected sanctuary a scene of deed to slay rival in place must be to excite against horror aversion of whole people to enlist against immense authority influence of church therefore unless must conclude that bruce whose early career showed to be cool calculating man whose future course be marked throughout with wisdom of highest character be suffering from absolute aberration of intellect must accept account by who represent meeting a accidental slaying a result of outburst of passion provoked by comyn treachery a correct one when bruce saw comyn approaching bade follower stop where be advanced towards comyn who be astonished at presence must speak with aside john comyn bruce said two withdrew into church apart from observation of others then bruce broke into torrent of invective against comyn for gross act of treachery in betraying by sending to edward copy of agreement sought said to send to scaffold so clear way for to throne of scotland comyn finding that dissimulation be useless replied a hotly without must hear voice of angry men rise higher higher then there be silence bruce hurried out alone what have happened archie forbes exclaimed fear have slain comyn bruce replied in agitated voice then will make sure kirkpatrick

deeply do regret that by own mad passion at treachery of comyn have begun by evil deed when tell of way in traitor sought to bring to english block will somewhat absolve for deed will grant that unhappy unfortunate a be passion be in degree justified then informed of bond into comyn have entered of betrayal by comyn to edward thus be said that deed have taken place be too late to mend have before desperate enterprise yet hope that may succeed in at rate time there can be drawing back must conquer die be certain in case comyn party must oppose now hostility will go to length while edward will never forgive attack upon justiciary still will have breathing time king will not hear for ten day of event here will take two month at least before can assemble army on border comyn friend will probably do nought till english approach however let hurry to lochmaben castle there will be safe from sudden attack by comyn friend in galloway first let draw out paper setting forth cause of enmity

scotland sent out notice to noble gentry calling upon to join fortunately bishop of st andrew wishart bishop of glasgow of wallace friend at once declared strongly for a did bishop of moray abbot of scone adhesion of prelate be of immense importance to bruce a to extent fact of joining showed that church felt overwhelming indignation at act of sacrilege have committed enabled minor clergy to

isabel be wife of comyn of buchan open adhesion to might influence of faction accordingly on following day ceremony be again performed isobel of buchan placing crown on bruce head act of patriotism for unfortunate lady be afterwards to pay dearly thus although great majority of scotch noble still held aloof bruce be now at head of considerable force at once proceeded to overrun country numerous english who have come across border under belief that scotland be finally conquered to take possession of land granted by edward be compelled to take refuge in fortified town castle held by english garrison to return hastily to england when news of proceeding at dumfries general rising in south of scotland reached edward be at city of winchester have be lately making sort of triumphant passage through country unexpected news that scotland have believed crushed beyond possibility of further resistance be again in arm be said for time to have driven almost out of mind with rage not moment be

perth near town scottish army be gathered archie forbes who stood very high in favour with bruce have urged upon advantage of carrying out tactic formerly adopted by wallace of compelling enemy to fall back by cutting off food supply bruce must not in instance be guided by counsel when king advance next spring with great army sir archie will assuredly adopt course point out seeing that must not hope to withstand so great array in pitched battle case be different now in first place castle town be in hand of english from pembroke can draw such provision a need in second place force be not so superior to own that may fight with fair hope of victory whereas wallace have never cavalry with save at falkirk when deserted at beginning of battle have strong body of mounted men at arm retainer of noble with therefore fear to give battle in open field in pursuance of determination bruce sent challenge to pembroke to meet with army in open field next day pembroke accepted challenge promised to meet opponent on following morning scotch retired for night to wood of methven near perth here many of set out on foraging excursion knight laid aside armour army prepared for sleep archie forbes be much dissatisfied at manner in bruce have hazarded fortune of scotland on pitched battle thereby throwing away great advantage superior mobility knowledge of country gave to scot have disarmed like rest be sitting by fire chatting with william orr andrew macpherson who a have be lieutenant in band of lad have raised seven year before now occupied same position among retainer having command of hundred men suddenly one who have be wandering outside line in search of food among farmhouse ran hastily in shouting that whole english army be upon scene of utmost confusion took place bruce knight hastily armed mounting horse rode to meet enemy there be time to form rank to make order of battle archie sprang to horse bade lieutenant form men into compact body move forward keeping king banner ever in sight to cut way to whenever saw be in danger then followed by two mounted squire rode after king contest of methven can scarce be called battle for scot be defeated before began many a have be said be away great number of footman instantly took flight dispersed in direction here there small body stood fought desperately being unsupported be overcome slain king with knight fought with desperate bravery spurring hither thither charging furiously among english men at arm three time bruce be unhorsed a often remounted by sir simon fraser once be so entirely cut off from companion by desperation with have charged into midst of english that be surrounded struck from horse taken prisoner king be taken archie forbes shouted ride in lord rescue most of scotch knight be so hardly pressed that must hing to aid king christopher seaton joined archie two knight charged into midst of throng of english cut way to bruce sir philip mowbray who be beside captured monarch be overthrown

into rank of english horse nothing must withstand impetuosity of assault horseman recoiled before levelled spear pikemen sweeping onward surrounded king companion well done brave fellow archie cried now keep together in close body draw off field darkness have at first proved so disastrous to scot be now favourable to english infantry knew not what be going on cavalry tried in vain to break through rank of spearmen keeping closely together regained shelter of wood drew off by way of dunkeld killiecrankie to mountain of athole on way be joined by edward bruce earl of athole sir neil campbell gilbert de la haye douglas by many scattered footman to grief bruce learned that randolph inchmartin somerville alexander fraser hugh de la haye others have be captured number killed have be

to north be badenoch district of bitter enemy comyns while westward lay territory of macdougalls of lorne whose chieftain alexander be nephew by marriage of comyn killed by bruce adherent of english beyond occasional deer fish in loch stream country afforded mean of subsistence be therefore decided to disband greater portion of force knight noble with few of immediate retainer alone remaining with king while main body dispersed regained home be done few day later messenger came saying that queen with wife of many of gentleman have arrived at aberdeen sought to join king although accession of number be by mean desirable hardship of life immense for lady to support there be other resource for to join party a must otherwise have speedily fallen into hand of english therefore bruce accompanied by of follower rode to aberdeen escorted queen lady to mountain retreat be strange life bruce queen little court led sleeping in rough arbour formed of bough party supported by hunting fishing gin trap be set in stream douglas archie be specially active in pursuit archie boyish experience at glen cairn serving in good stead between sir james douglas warm friendship have sprung up

douglas be wounded little party continued to show face to foe until reached spot where path lay between steep hill on one side lake on other then bruce sent follower ahead covered rear suddenly three of macdougalls who have climbed hillside made spring upon from above one leapt on to horse behind king attempted to hold arm seized bridle rein while third thrust hand between bruce leg saddle to hurl from horse path be too narrow for bruce to turn horse spurring forward pressed leg so close to saddle that imprisoned arm of assailant beneath dragged along with while with blow of sword smote off arm

on joined friend in course of struggle brooch fastened cloak be lost be found by macdougalls carried home a trophy have be preserved by family ever since with apparently a much pride a if have be proof of fidelity patriotism of ancestor instead of being memento of time when a false disloyal scotchman fought with england against scotland king deliverer chapter xiii castle of dunstaffnage bruce party be now more than ever straitened for provision since have to depend almost entirely upon such fish a might catch a be dangerous to stray far away in pursuit of deer archie however with bow arrow ventured several time to go hunting in order to relieve sad condition of lady succeeded two three time in bringing deer home with have one day ventured much further away than usual have not succeeded in finding stag lady have for more than week subsisted entirely on fish therefore determined to continue search however long until found one have crossed several wooded hill be knew league away from

lately great harm to clansman secondly a having dispossessed allan kerr who be also relative of land castle uncle be man of violent passion hesitated may not think archie went on respect promise for life if be so lady from what have heard of alexander macdougall be like enough beg to give back surrender for must rather die here sword in hand than be put to death in cold blood in castle of

against will not inflict such dishonour upon a to break pledge have given for safety archie thought from what have heard of macdougall that chance be very slight one still a young ever cling to hope a must assuredly be slain by clansman thought better to take chance small a be so continued march by side of captor palfrey after two hour journey neared castle of alexander of lorne archie must not repress thrill of apprehension a looked at grim fortress thought of character of lord bearing showed fear a conversing with young lady approached entrance gate be thrown open alexander of lorne issued

what have happened of service marjory macdougall have rendered a be naturally supposed that have lost way in wood on previous day have not reached encampment in morning until after have started few question be asked indeed thought of whole party be occupied with approaching separation night before have agreed be absolutely necessary lady be worn out with fatigue hardship earl of athole of other elder men be also unable longer to support winter be close at hand hardship must increase ten fold in severity therefore be concluded that time have come when must separate that queen companion accompanied by who must still be mounted must seek shelter in bruce strong castle of kildrummy earl of athole king brother nigel be in charge of party bruce with remaining companion determined to proceed into country of sir neil campbell thence to cross for time to north of ireland sir neil accordingly started to obtain necessary vessel king company followed slowly to reach firth of clyde be

matter for surprise baliol comyn have in turn betrayed country to english bruce have hitherto be regarded a even more strongly devoted to english cause than have be thus people viewed attempt rather a effort to win throne for than a one to free scotland from english domination have naturally confidence in noble who have so often betrayed bruce especially have three four time already after taking up arm made peace with england fought against scot therefore at first people looked on at conflict with comparative indifference be ready enough to strike for freedom a have proved when have rallied round wallace be necessary before did so that must posse confidence in leader such confidence have certainly no cause whatever to feel in bruce time be yet to come when must recognize in leader a bold a persevering a determined a wallace people of rathlin be rude ignorant simple hospitable island contained nothing to attract adventurer trader be seldom therefore that ship touched there consequently there be little fear that news of sojourn of scotch king companion must reach mainland indeed english remained in profound ignorance a to what have become of fugitive deemed to be still in hiding

have not yet be broken feel battle with will against mine bound rear curvet in endeavour to throw until at last be conquered obeys slightest touch of rein doubt be same feeling archie replied be joy of strife in form for own must rather fight on foot than on horseback can trust better than can trust steed can wheel thrice while be turning once can defend side equally well whereas on horseback not only have to defend horse be far more difficult if be wounded fall may be entangled under be helpless at mercy of opponent none acquitted better on horseback at methven than did sir archie young fellow said admiringly did not save king keep at bay foe till retainer came up with pike carried off from centre of english chivalry did best archie said a one must always do felt even then must rather have be fighting on foot be because have so much skill with weapon sir archie douglas said on horseback with mace battleaxe be mainly question of sheer strength though be very strong there be others who be a strong a now be allowed that none of king knight follower be a skilful a with sword even king who be regarded a second best knight in europe owns that on foot with sword have chance against that saw when practiced for amusement of queen lady in mountain of lennox none other must even touch while dented helmet armour finely with sword of yours have continued sport there must not have be whole piece of armour among save own harness archie laughed suppose douglas like best that in most excel there be many knight in english army who must assuredly overthrow in tilting ring in field for have not training on horseback when quite young be needed to make perfect knight while have advantage in learning of sword playing stick to own trade world be beginning to learn that man on foot be match for horseman wallace taught europe that lesson be slow to believe for hitherto armed knight have deemed invincible have held in contempt foot soldier stirling falkirk loudon hill have taught difference will be long time before fairly own fact so mortifying to chivalry time will come be well assured when battle will be fought almost with infantry alone upon brunt of day will fall by will victory be decided while horseman will be used principally for pursuing foe when be broken for covering retreat of infantry by desperate charge by charging into midst of fray when infantry be broken better for scotland james douglas said cheerfully be not nation of horseman mountain hill forest morass be better adapted for infantry than cavalry so if ever change predict come to pas will be gainer by at daybreak next morning archie went down to cove where friend fisherman kept boat old man two son be already there have not launched craft like not look of weather fisherman said when archie joined sky be dull heavy sea be black sullen there be sound in wave a break against rock seems to tell of coming storm think however will be hour before break if have luck may get haul two before come on be ready to go stay archie said have experience in weather here must not urge against own judgment whatever be if put out be ready to go with will try fisherman said for food be running short will not go far from shore so that can pull back if weather get worse boat be soon launched net oar be already on board quickly put out from shore boat carried small square sail be used when running before wind in day art of navigation be in infancy art of tacking against wind have scarcely begun to be understood indeed so high be ship out of water with lofty poop forecastle that be scarce possible to sail on wind so great be leeway made thus when contrary wind came mariner anchored waited a patiently a might for change voyage to port two day sail with favouring wind be matter of week when be foul after rowing mile from land net be put out for time drifted near from time to time old fisherman cast anxious eye at sky must get in net said at last decidedly wind be rising fast be backing from west round to south be quick lad for ere long gale will be on in strength if 't be from south may well be blown out to sea without moment delay fisherman set to work to get in net archie lending hand to assist younger men thoroughly agreed in father opinion of weather knew too well respect due to age to venture upon expressing opinion until have first spoken haul be better one than have expected considering that net have be down two hour 't be not so bad fisherman said catch will be right welcome be added a looked toward land if get safely on shore wind be now blowing strongly if did not rise boat must assuredly make land archie took helm having learned somewhat of steering on previous excursion three fisherman tugged at oar be cross sea for although wind now blew nearly in teeth have until last half hour be from west wave be rolling in from atlantic boat however made fair progress archie began to think that doubt of fisherman a to making shore be in wise justified when suddenly gust far stronger than have hitherto met struck boat keep head straight fisherman shouted wind take one side other stick to boy row hardest be on now in earnest fear three men bent to oar archie felt that be no longer making headway boat be wide high out of water good sea boat very hard to row against wind although men strained at oar till archie expected to see tough stave crack under effort boat did not seem to move indeed appeared to archie that in brief space when oar be out of water wind drove further back than distance have gained in last stroke hoped however that squall be merely temporary that when subsided there must still be difficulty in gaining land hope be not realized instead of abating wind appeared moment to increase in force cloud of spray be blown on top of wave so that at time archie must not see shore before for nearly hour fisherman struggled on archie saw with dismay that boat be receding from shore that have already lost distance have gained before squall struck old fisherman looked several time over shoulder be of use said at last will never make rathlin must even run before gale put up helm young sir take round wait moment till next wave have passed under now in minute boat head be turned from land be speeding before gale in with oar lad rig mast reef down sail to last point must show little to keep dead before wind will have tremendous sea when be once fairly away from shelter of island gale will soon knock up sea with cross swell from atlantic will be a much a can do to carry through mast be stepped mere rag of sail hoisted be sufficient to drive boat through water at great speed old fisherman be steering now when sail be hoisted four men gathered in stern of boat will go between islay jura suppose one of younger men said ay father said sea will be too high to windward of islay must not keep inside jura archie suggested shelter in of harbour on coast of argyle ay old man said must be sure of doing that must be right enough strong a wind be blowing will be stronger still when get in narrow water between island mainland must be impossible to keep even point off wind then if missed making harbour must be driven up through strait of corrievrekan biggest ship sail from scottish port must not live in sea will be running there will be bad enough passing between islay jura if get safely through will try to run into narrow strait between colonsay oronsay there must have good safe shelter if miss that must run inside mull for there will be getting without either shelter behind lismore island far up strait behind kerara into passage to loch etive will not be last hope archie said for there stand dunstaffnage castle land belong to macdougalls be two month back be prisoner there though then escaped assuredly if again get within wall will never go out again a well be drowned here then will hope fisherman said that 't be into other harbour that evil wind may blow a see young sir gale be master not must need go where chooses to take fiercer fiercer blew gale tremendous cross sea be now running boat stout buoyant a be seemed moment a if must be engulfed in chaos of water small a sail have be have be taken down lashed with rope to yard so now only about three square foot of canvas be set can show little more fisherman shouted in archie ear when get abreast of islay for will then be sheltered from sea from west can run more boldly with only following sea till get out of cross tumble must not carry on only want steerage way to keep head straight never before have archie forbes seen great gale in strength at sea for have occurred while at rathlin be a nothing to present although on hillside round glen cairn wind sometimes blew with force there be withstanding there be nothing to impress sens a did wild confusion turmoil of water buoyant a be boat heavy sea often broke on board two hand be constantly employed in bailing still archie judged from countenance of men that did not deem position desperate that believed craft must weather gale towards although wind blew a strongly a ever there be sensible change in motion of boat no longer be tossed up down with jerky sudden motion a wave seemed to rise directly under rose fell on following wave with steady regular motion be well abreast of islay old fisherman said when archie remarked on change to there do not see that dark bank through mist be islay have longer cross sea can show little more sail to keep from being pooped will bear little off toward land must keep in sight not too far on left otherwise may miss strait run on to jura little more sail be accordingly shown to gale boat scudded along at increased speed how far be to colonsay archie asked between fifty sixty mile from rathlin fisherman said be eight o'clock when started ten when squall struck will be dark by four fast a be running will scarcely be in time to catch last gleam of day come boy said to son give little more canvas still for be life death to reach colonsay before nightfall for if miss will be dashed on to mull long before morning little more sail be accordingly shown boat tore through water at what seemed to archie to be tremendous speed be shipping little water now for though great wave a neared stern seemed over over again to archie a if must break upon send instantly to bottom stout boat always lifted lightly upon until at length felt free from apprehension on score presently fisherman pointed out dark mass over other bow be jura said be fair for channel lad must take in sail again to smallest rag for wind will blow through gap between island with force fit to tear mast out of through rest of life archie forbes regarded that passage between islay jura a most tremendous peril have ever encountered strong a wind have be before be a nothing to force with swept down strait height of wave be prodigious boat a passed over crest of wave seemed to plunge down very abyss old fisherman crouched low in boat holding helm while other three lay on plank in bottom speech be impossible for loudest shout must have be drowned in fury of storm in hour worst be over be through strait out in open sea again islay now made lee for sea high a be be yet calm in comparison to tremendous wave in strait of jura more sail be hoisted again in hour fisherman said thank god there be island day be already fading archie must with difficulty make out slightly dark mass to helm pointed be that colonsay asked be oronsay fisherman said island be close together seem a if have once be one have be cleft asunder by arm of giant strait between be very narrow once within will be perfectly sheltered must make a close to point of island a can well go so a not to touch rock then turn enter strait if keep out distance will be blown past entrance then only remaining chance be to try run on to colonsay take risk of being drowned a be dashed upon rock light have almost faded when ran along at end of oronsay archie shuddered a saw wave break upon rock fly high up into air felt how small be chance of escape must be driven on coast like be fifty yard from point when came abreast of extremity then fisherman put down helm turned head towards strait opened on left down with sail mast lad out with oar must row in not moment be lost sail be lowered mast unstepped oar got out with speed showed how urgent be occasion archie who did not feel confidence in power to manager now in such sea took seat by man on stroke thwart double banked oar five minute desperate rowing be under shelter of oronsay be rowing more quickly up narrow strait towards shore of colonsay where intended to land quarter of hour more stepped ashore old fisherman raised hat reverently let thank god saint said who have preserved through such great danger have be nigh fifty year at sea never be out in so wild gale for few minute stood silent bare headed returning fervent thanks for escape be well old man said a moved inland have be so far north before there be few in rathlin who have even be north of islay sometimes when fish have be very plentiful in island boat for ayr have already gone have taken up boatload of fish to good monk of colonsay who although fairly supplied by own fisherman be yet always ready to pay good price for have be in boat with one who knew not water assuredly must have perished for skill courage must have availed there do see light ahead be priory may be sure of welcome there priory door be opened at ring monk who unclosed greatly surprised at visitor on night at once bade enter when heard that be fisherman whom storm have driven to shelter on island fisherman have to lend aid to monk to reclose door so great be power of wind monk shot bolt saying need expect further visitor tonight led into kitchen where huge fire be blazing quick brother austin said to monk who acted a cook warm up hot drink for poor soul for must assuredly be well nigh perished with cold seeing that have be wet for many hour exposed to violence of wintry gale archie companion be indeed stiff with cold exposure must scarce answer question monk asked have patience brother have patience brother austin said when tongue be unfrozen doubtless will tell that want to know only wait pray till have drunk posset be preparing monk curiosity be not however destined to be so speedily satisfied for just a voyager be finishing hot drink monk entered with message that prior having heard that stranger have arrived must fain welcome speak with in apartment rose at once when prior have done questioning brother austin said return hither at once will set about preparing supper for for warrant must need food a well a drink fear not however great appetite may be will have enough to satisfy ready by time return welcome to colonsay prior said a four men entered apartment stay see be drenched to skin be poor hospitality indeed to keep standing thus even to assure of welcome take said to monk to guest chamber at once furnish with change of attire when be warm comfortable return with in ten minute archie companion re entered prior room prior looked with astonishment at archie for in previous short interview have not noticed difference in attire have supposed to be four fisherman monk however have marked difference on inquiry finding that archie be knight have furnished with appropriate attire good monk kept wardrobe to suit guest of rank seeing that many visitor came to holy priory that sometimes wind wave brought to shore in such sorry plight that change of garment be necessary ah prior said in surprise crave pardon sir knight that noticed not rank when first entered light be somewhat dim a stood there together at door way noticed not that be of superior condition to others might well be holy prior archie said seeing that be more like drowned beast than christian men have have marvellous escape from tempest thanks to god saint seeing that be blown off rathlin have run before gale down past islay through strait of jura next to protection of god saint escape be due to skill courage of brave companion here who be a cool calm in tempest a if have be sitting by ingle fire at home from rathlin prior said in surprise through strait islay jura truly be marvellous voyage in such gale a suppose in open boat how come sir knight if may ask question without prying into private affair that knight be at rathlin in wild lonely island men of rank be seldom to be found there be many there now holy prior far higher in rank than archie replied seeing robert bruce crowned king of scotland james douglas others of noble knight be sheltering there with from english bloodhound bruce at rathlin prior exclaimed in surprise last ship came from mainland told that be hunted fugitive in lennox deemed that seeing macdougalls of lorne surrounding chief be hostile to english scattered thickly over low country must long ere have fallen into hand of enemy thanks to heaven protection archie said devoutly king with few follower escaped safely reached rathlin thou shouldst not speak of heaven protection prior said sternly seeing that bruce have violated sanctuary of church have slain enemy within wall have drawn down upon anathema of pope have be declared excommunicated accursed pope holy father archie replied although supreme in holy thing be little qualified to judge of matter seeing that draw information from king edward under whose protection life good bishop of st andrew glasgow with abbot of scone many other dignitary of scottish church have condoned offense seeing that be committed in hot blood without prior intent king bitterly regret deed prey sorely upon mind can answer for bruce have thought of meeting comyn at dumfries speak boldly young sir prior said sternly for one over whose head scarce two twenty year can have rolled enough now be storm staid wearied be guest of convent will not keep further now for have need of food sleep tomorrow will speak with again so saying prior sharply touched bell stood on table near monk re entered prior waved hand take guest to refectory see that have stand in need of that bed chamber be prepared in morning must speak to again chapter xv mission to ireland father austin be a good a word be long indeed since archie have sat down to such meal a be spread for hungry a be however must scarce keep eye open to conclusion so great be fatigue of mind body on retiring to chamber monk have prepared for threw on couch instantly fell asleep in morning gale still blew violently with somewhat le fury than on preceding evening joined monk at morning meal in refectory after repast gathered round to listen to news of what be doing in scotland for although at ordinary time pilgrim came not unfrequently to visit holy isle of colonsay in present stormy time men stirred little from home be seldom that monk obtained news of what be passing on mainland presently servitor brought word that prior must see archie be ill talking last night prior said with man hungry worn out gathered from what said that be not only follower of bruce that be with at fatal day at dumfries when drew dagger upon comyn in sanctuary be there holy father archie replied can testify that occurrence be wholly unpremeditated bruce have received sufficient provocation from comyn to afford fair reason for slaying wheresoever might meet none can regret more than doe that place of meeting be in sanctuary comyn bruce have made agreement together whereby former relinquished own claim to throne of scotland on condition bruce on attaining throne must hand over to lordship in carrick annandale be bad bargain prior said seeing that comyn must then be more powerful than king so ventured to tell bruce archie replied thou prior said be young sir to be in position to offer counsel to robert bruce be young holy prior archie said modestly king be good enough to overlook youth in consideration of fidelity to cause of scotland name be archibald forbes sir archibald forbes prior repeated rising be really that loyal faithful scottish knight who fought ever by side of wallace have almost alone refused ever to bow knee to english even to lonely isle tale have come of valour how fought side by side with wallace be with sir john grahame most trusty friend confidant many of highest noblest of scotland have for century made way to shrine of colonsay none more worthy to be guest often have longed to see so brave champion of country little thinking that must one day come storm driven guest truly be glad to see say even though may have shared in deed at dumfries for must fain hope from word there be fairer excuse to be made than have hitherto deemed have thought that bishop of st andrew glasgow be wrong in giving countenance to man whom holy father have condemned man whose prior history give ground for faith in patriotism who have taken up arm now for now against english have ever be ready to make term with oppressor to parade a courtier at westminster in such man can have faith deem that while pretend to fight for scotland be in truth warring for own aggrandizement since follower friend of disinterested intrepid champion of scotland speak for bruce maybe that judgement have be too severe upon archie now related incident of journey to london to urge bruce to break with edward to head national movement told how even before discovery of agreement with comyn brought about by treachery of latter bruce have determined definitely to throw in cause with of scotland how upon discovery have fled north happening to meet comyn at dumfries within limit of sanctuary have in indignation ire at treachery drawn slain then told tale of what have taken place after rout of methven how bravely bruce have borne have ever striven to keep up heart of companion how cheerfully have supported hardship how valiantly have borne at methven when attacked by macdougalls of lorne past may have be archie concluded hold now bruce be a earnest in cause of scotland a be even dear leader wallace in strength in courage rival that valiant knight for though hold that wallace be far more than match for man of time yet bruce be worthy second to for assuredly one in scotland must cross sword with on equal chance that will succeed in enterprise be rash to say for mighty indeed be odds against if courage perseverance endurance can wrest scotland from hand of english robert bruce will if life accomplish task right glad be prior replied to hear what have told hitherto owing to memory of past horror at crime for though from what tell there be much to excuse still be grievous crime have have little interest in struggle henceforth will be changed may tell king that from day until death victory crown effort prayer will be said to heaven night day at colonsay for success be four day before storm be over sea sufficiently calmed to admit of archie departure during time remained a honoured guest of priory good monk vied with prior in attention to young knight tale of whose doings a one of scotland foremost champion have so often reached lonely island at end of time sea being now calm smooth with light wind from north archie bade adieu to host sailed from colonsay light a wind be sufficed to fill sail a boat glided over scarce rippled water archie must not contrast quiet sleepy motion with wild speed at boat have torn through water on northern way be not until following morning that rathlin again came in sight a boat be seen approaching be declared by islander to be have regarded a lost in storm week previously king douglas rest of follower made way down to shore loud be shout of welcome arose when archie stood up waved hand verily archie forbes king said a warmly embraced young knight will begin to think that fairy presided at birth gave charm to preserve life alike against wrath of men of element never assuredly did anyone pas through so many danger unscathed a have done hope to pas through a many more sire in service archie said smiling hope so indeed bruce replied for be evil day for for scotland saw fall henceforth will fret more concerning alone of wallace early companion have survived got free from dunstaffnage by miracle have never fully explained to now must seem that even sea refuse to swallow trust archie said more gravely that old saying be not true in case that hanging be not to be fate assuredly will be if ever fall into hand of edward will think cruel fate indeed if fortune have spared so often in battle lead to cruel end at last trust not indeed sir archie king said though hanging now have ceased to be dishonourable death when so many of scotland best bravest have suffered at english hand however can not think that fairy godmother must have reserved for fate of hero of most of story of old nurse always wound up with 'and so married lived happily ever after ' now archie tell have befallen where have be how fared by what miraculous chance escaped tempest eye be fixed on boat when laboured to reach shore have heard groan uttered when saw give up effort a hopeless fly away to sea before wind must have known how truly comrade love gave up a assuredly lost for islander here agreed that have chance of weathering gale that boat must ere many hour be dashed to piece on islay jura must even reach so far most thought that must founder long ere came in sight of land accompanying king with principal companion to hut occupied archie related incident of voyage of final refuge at colonsay be wonderful escape king said when finished holy virgin saint must assuredly have have in especial care have cost well nigh fortune for not one of vowed offering for safety be perchance more liberal since deemed chance of paying so small however will be redeemed for assuredly have be well earned for share be bound when come to own to give piece of land of value of one hundred mark year to good monk of st killian to be spent in mass for soul of drowned at sea day later king said to archie have mission for 't be one of danger know that be drawback in eye be ready archie said modestly to carry out to best of power errand with majesty may intrust have be thinking sir archie might well make sort of alliance with irish chieftain many of be like most of scotch noble on term of friendship with england still there be others who hold aloof from conqueror must be well to open negotiation with so that by rising might distract edward attention from scotland while by effort must hinder english from sending force thither might thus mutually be of aid to other at present be certes in position to promise aid in men money will bind by oath that if affair in scotland prosper will from treasury furnish money to aid in carrying on struggle that if clear scotland of oppressor will either go send one of brother with strong force to aid irish to follow example mission be a will see sir archie dangerous one for must of english irish ally lay hand on doom must be sealed still may do scotland great service must succeed in mission even minor rising must be of much utility seeing that must at rate prevent edward from bringing over troop from ireland to assist in conquest have thought matter over deeply conclude young a be can intrust to with confidence that be indeed best fitted among with to undertake be boy brother edward be too hot rash boyd be impatient headstrong trusty devoted to though be be sure that in there be lack of prudence courage hence sir archie if will undertake will intrust to will willingly undertake sire since think fitting for deem high honour indeed that have chosen when will that start be best to lose time king replied if have reason for delay must that must embark tonight so that before daybreak may have gained irish shore tell that there be many desperate men in refuge among cave on coast among might choose few who might be useful to in project be not in part that rising can be effected for country inland be comparatively flat wholly in hand of english be on west coast that resistance to english be continued to last here from time to time blaze out again in part a tell not only be there wild mountain fastness such a have in scotland there be great morass swamp extending over wide tract where heavy armed soldier can not penetrate where many people still maintain sort of wild independence defying effort of english to subdue people be wild savage ever ready to rise against english here then be country where be most likely to find chief who may enter into plan agree to second effort for independence here be ring gold chain be remain to of possession money have none with may succeed in winning heart of of savage chieftain take too royal signet will be guarantee that have power to treat in name need not tell to be brave sir archie be prudent remember that life be of utmost value to want not to fight simply to act a envoy if succeed in raising great fire in west of ireland remain there act a councillor to chief remembering that be just a much fighting for scotland there a if be drawing sword against foe at home if find that english arm be too strong people too cowed disheartened to rise against then make way back here by end of three month by time hope to sail hence to raise standard in scotland again on leaving king archie at once conferred with duncan fisherman who willingly agreed that night to set ashore in ireland will land said at place where need not fear that english will meet be true that have castle three mile away perched on rock on coast be called dunluce command wide seaward view for reason be well that boat be far out at sea again before morning dawned so that if mark will not suppose that have touched on coast else might send party to search if have landed not even then that need fear discovery for coast abounds in cave hiding place son have often landed there for do certain trade in summer from island in fish other matter with native there if plea son ronald who be hardy intelligent will land with accompany a retainer while remain in ireland people there speak language quite different to use in lowland of scotland in england language speak among closely resembles can be easily understood by people of mainland must be lost did go among native irish without interpreter archie thankfully accepted offer that night after bidding adieu to friend comrade started in duncan boat 't be strange place where be going to land fisherman said place a nowhere else have eye beheld though say that at isle of staffa far north of colonsay similar sight be to be seen rock instead of being rugged square rise in close column like trunk of tree like column in church of priory of colonsay truly seem a if wrought by hand of men rather of giant seeing that men must carry out so vast work native have legend that be work of giant of old time how may be know not though why giant must have engaged in so useless work pass understanding however there be pillar placed there of be down by level of sea here head seem to be cut off so a to form landing place to native give name of giant causeway others in low row stand on face of cliff though how must have stood there to work seeing that human foot can reach base be more than can say 't be strange wonderful sight a will say when morning light suffers to see be fortunate that duncan knew coast so well be able by light of star to find landing place for quiet a sea appeared swell rose a neared shore wave beat heavily on wild rocky coast duncan however steered boat to very foot of causeway then watching opportunity archie sprang ashore followed by ronald few word of adieu be spoken then boat rowed out to sea again while archie ronald turned away from landing place be best young fisherman said to find seat among rock there to await dawn when can guide to cave hard by in darkness might well fall break limb did try make way across coast niche be soon found archie companion sat down for while archie however soon discovered that side back of seat be formed of strange column of duncan have spoken that be sitting upon top of others have broken off eagerly passed hand over surface of strange pillar questioned companion a to what knew about ronald must tell no more than father have done archie be forced to await dawn to examine more closely strange column daylight only added to wonder on side of stretched column packed in dense mass together while range above range stood on face of great cliff above more examined more wonder grew can neither be work of men giant said must have be called up by fantastic freak of powerful enchanter hitherto have not believed tale of mysterious being of old time after seeing wonderful pillar can no longer doubt for assuredly mortal hand must have done work ronald now urged that have better be moving a be possible although unlikely enough that one passing along top of cliff might get sight of accordingly moved along shore in quarter of mile reached mouth of great cave bottom be covered with rock have fallen from roof thickly clustered over with wet seaweed indeed hung from side far up showing that at high tide sea penetrated far into cave ground rise beyond ronald said will find recess there tide never reach moved slowly at first until eye became accustomed to darkness then kept on ground getting more even a ascended until stood on dry level floor now will strike light ronald said light torch brought with be sure to find plenty of driftwood cast up at highest point tide reach then can make fire while remain here will go out find of native engage guide to take forward tonight taking out flint steel ronald proceeded to strike light after several effort succeeded in doing so in igniting dried moss have brought with carefully shielded from damp in fold of garment a light flame rose applied torch to a did so came exclamation of astonishment for gathered in circle round be dozen wild figure be armed stood in readiness to strike down intruder into hiding place be barefooted have doubtless be asleep in cave until when awakened by approaching footstep voice have silently arisen prepared to fall upon intruder be friend ronald said in native language when recovered from start of surprise be ronald fisherman from rathlin be over here in summer exchanging fish for sheep recollect one of men said what do here so strangely secretly be english hunting too from island a have done have not come to rathlin yet ronald said doubtless must do so be too poor to offer temptation for greed be enemy a be yours be here to guide scottish knight who be staying at rathlin fugitive from vengeance like who be charged with mission from king of scotland to chief whom must fain induce to join in rising against power of english be welcome man who appeared to be leader of party replied may succeed in object continued bitterly fear that chance be small one norman foot be on neck most of who must be leader have basely accepted position of vassal to english king still there be brave heart yet in ireland who must gladly rise did see even faint chance of success hundred be there who like prefer to live life of hunted dog in cave in mountain fastness in bog rather than yield to english yoke tell plan whither must go will give guide who know foot of country who can lead to western hill where though open resistance be made english have scarce set foot there generally find refuge be only at time when longing to see home of childhood becomes too strong for see of whom be born reared between coleraine come hither for time when at night can issue out prowl round ruin of home of father while conversation have be going on others seeing that visit be friendly one have set to work bringing up driftwood from below piled round little blaze ronald have commenced soon have great fire lighted then produced carcass of sheep have evening before carried off ronald have brought with large pile of oaten cake meal be speedily prepared archie must not look with surprise at wild figure around lit up by dancing glare of fire hair lay in tangled mass on neck attire be of most primitive description consisting of one garment secured round waist by strap of untanned foot leg be bare hair be almost black eye small glittering with heavy overhanging brow differed altogether in appearance even from wildest poorest of scottish peasantry in belt bore long knife of rough manufacture most of carried sling hanging from belt in readiness for instant use in spite of wildness of demeanour seemed kindly hospitable many be question asked ronald concerning king of scotland knight who be in refuge at rathlin when meal be over stretched on sand like so many animal without further preparation went off to sleep archie knowing that nothing must be done until followed example fire have by time burned low soon perfect stillness reigned in great cavern save far away at mouth low thunder of wave upon rock came up in confused roar chapter xvi irish rising when night came on archie started for west accompanied by ronald two of irish a guide crossed country without question interference reached wild mountain of donegal in safety archie have asked that conductor must lead to abode of principal chieftain of district miserable appearance of sparsely scattered village through have passed have prepared to find that superior of such people must be in very different position from feudal lord of highland of scotland be not surprised therefore when attendant pointed out small hold such a must appertain to small landowner on scottish border a residence of chief around be scattered number of low hut composed of turf roofed with reed from when approach of stranger be reported number of wild looking figure poured out armed with weapon of most primitive description shout from archie guide assured people that newcomer be not a appearance betokened norman knight visitor from scotland who sought friendly interview with chief insignificant a be hold be evident that something like feudal discipline be kept up two men armed with pike be stationed on wall while two others leant in careless fashion against post of open gate on approach of archie elderly man with long white beard came out to meet ronald explained to that archie be knight who have come a emissary from king of scotland to irish chieftain desired to speak with great fergus of killeen old man bowed deeply to archie then escorted into house room entered occupied whole of ground floor of hold be thirty foot wide by forty long a apparently tree of sufficient length to form beam of so wide apartment must not be obtained floor above be supported by two row of roughly squared post extending down from end to end wall be perfectly bare beam plank of ceiling be stained black by smoke of fire burned in one corner floor be of clay beaten hard strip ten foot wide at further end be raised eighteen inch above general level forming sort of dais here in carved settle of black wood sat chief female evidently lady of family be seated on pile of sheepskin be plying distaff while aged man be seated on end of dais with harp of quaint form on knee finger touched last chord a archie entered have evidently be playing while lady worked near on dais be fire composed of wood ember be replenished from time to time with fresh glowing piece of charcoal taken from fire at other end of room so that occupant of dais must not be annoyed by smoke arising close to chief be fine looking man about fifty year old be clad in loose fitting tunic of soft dark green cloth confined at waist by broad leathern band with silver clasp ornament reaching to knee arm be bare on foot wore sandal heavy sword rested against wall near hand lady wore dress of similar material of somewhat similar fashion reaching to foot wore gold armlet chief wife have light band of gold round head chief rose when archie entered upon seneschal informing of rank mission of visitor stepped from dais advancing greeted warmly then led back to dais where presented to lady of family ordering retainer of whom about score be gathered in hall to place two pile of sheepskin near fire on one of sat down motioned to archie to take place on other own chair being removed to corner then through medium of ronald conversation began archie related to chief effort scotch be making to win freedom from england urged in king name that similar effort must be made by irish a force of english being thereby divided distracted there might be better hope of success chief heard communication in grave silence lady

beauty be of kind new to archie dark glossy hair be kept smoothly in place by fillet of gold in mother case by purple ribbon in of daughter eyebrow long eyelash be black eye be gray a light a to archie be accustomed under fair tress of countrywoman thing struck most in face of girl be mobility expression changing a seemed in instant from grave to gay flushing at one moment with interest at tale of deed of valour paling at next at recital of cruel oppression wrong when archie have finished narrative presented to chief beautifully wrought chain of gold a token from king of scotland chief be silent for time after interpreter concluded archie narrative then said sir knight almost seems to a if have be listening to tale of wrong of ireland save that appears that mastery of english here have be more firmly established than with may be from nature of country hill be for most part bare while yours say be covered with forest thus norman must more easily when have once gained upper hand crush out last vestige of opposition than must with a judge from what say english in scotland hold fortress when people rise remain sheltered in until assistance come from england with be different first conquer country then from wide tract third perhaps of island drive out whole of people establish firmly there portioning land among soldiery repeopling country with english race outside district irish chieftain like retain something of independence pay tribute be in position of feudatory being bound to furnish so many men for king of england war if called upon to do so english seldom come beyond pale so long a tribute be paid yoke therefore weighs not so heavy upon be to rise english army must pour out from pale carry fire sword throughout country like have be without one who must unite against common enemy great chief have for most part accepted english title since power over minor chief be extended rather than decreased by changed circumstance be well content for rule now over district not only a irish chieftain a english lieutenant have seen a journeyed here how sparse be population of hill how slight must be opposition must offer did earl of ulster sweep down upon with trained english soldier be there chance of success fergus of killeen must gladly draw sword again will not bring ruin upon family people by engaging in hopeless enterprise did raise standard donegal must take up arm donegal alone be powerless against england know people be ready for fray must rush to battle perish in thousand to win victory one great defeat must crush story of long fight wallace with small following made against power of england will never be told of irish leader have bravery reckless courage have none of stubborn obstinacy of scottish folk be flag raised people must flock to must fight desperately if lost there must be utter complete collapse fortitude to support repeated defeat to struggle on when prospect seems darkest doe not belong to people be for reason have hope that ireland will ever regain independence may struggle against yoke may blaze out again again in bloody rising son may die in ten of thousand for never believe a long a men of two country remain what be will ireland recover independence for in long run english perseverance determination will overcome fitful courage of irish grieve must say mourn that feel duty to repress rather than to encourage eager desire of people to draw sword strike for freedom such be conviction understand sir knight that may think will not be backward in doing part if ireland again rise must other native chieftain determine to make one more effort to drive english across channel be sure that fergus of killeen men of donegal will be in front of battle heart beat more warmly for freedom than mine did stand alone must take to bog join who shelter there defying might of england have people to think of have seen how english turn land to desolation a sweep across will not bring fire sword into mountain valley unless ireland be banded in common effort have seen scotland wasted from sea to sea city burned people slain by thousand dale valley wasted can tell that after year of struggle have gained such advantage a must warrant advising to rise against england archie be silent thinking over struggle in have taken part for so many year remembering woe that have brought on scotland that after fighting so long bruce handful of fugitive at rathlin be sole survivor of patriotic party must not acknowledge at heart justice of chief word sole hope for scotland now rested in perseverance personal valour of king stubborn character of people felt assured must lead to rise again again in spite of disaster defeat until freedom be won irish possessed bruce country be le defendible than scotland if a fergus said have none of indomitable perseverance enabled scotch people again again to rise against yoke what hope must there be of final success how must be justified in urging upon chieftain step must bring fire sword into quiet valley for time therefore after ronald have translated chief speech remained silent will not urge further sir said for be surely best judge of what be good for people have seen such ruin desolation in scotland so many score of ruined town village so many thousand of levelled homestead will not say single word to urge to alter resolution be enough for that have said that if ireland rise will also draw sword must carry out instruction hence will travel south visit other chief may view matter differently may see that what ireland can not do alone may do in conjunction with scotland so be fergus said believe if raise flame through west north will not hang back now trust that will remain here for few day a guest have be yours wife daughter will do best to make time pas pleasantly for archie remained three day at chief hold where primitive life interested greatly lavish hospitality be exercised several sheep be killed roasted day comer be free to join repast chief more immediate retainer twenty in number ate lived slept in great hall while table be spread outside at who came sat down without question upper room of hold be occupied by chief lady of family female domestic here retired when felt disposed meal be served on dais in evening harper played sang legend of deed of bravery in day of ireland independence a ronald translated song to archie must not conclude privately that civil war rapine strife massacre must have characterized country in day at conclusion of stay fergus appointed two of retainer to accompany archie south to give assurance to various wild people through whom might pas that archie mission be friendly one to ireland that be honoured friend guest of chief of killeen on arrival in mayo archie found matter more favourable to mission insurrection have already broken out headed by of local chieftain originating in broil between english soldier of garrison native garrison have be surprised massacred wild irish be flocking to arm by chieftain here archie on explaining mission be warmly welcomed a be already in arm urging on part be needed despatched messenger throughout country saying that emissary from scotland have arrived calling upon to rise to join with scotch in shaking off yoke of england archie have therefore to travel farther decided that must best carry out mission by assisting to organize lead irish force speedily discovered be beyond comparison inferior in arm in discipline in method of fighting to scot for dashing foray must be excellent hardy agile full of impetuosity must bear down resistance instantly be resistance not too strong against stubborn well armed troop must break like wave against rock archie saw that with such troop anything like regular war must be impossible that struggle must be one of constant surprise attack foray that must succeed only by wearing out not by defeating enemy with such tactic a might by long perseverance succeed be just what fergus have warned must not practise that courage be rather of kind must lead to dash desperately against line of levelled spear rather than continue long weary struggle under apparently hopeless circumstance chief hearing from archie that have acted a one of wallace lieutenant in battle where english have be heavily defeated willingly consented that must endeavour to instil tactic by battle have be won into own follower when found that proposed that men must remain stationary to withstand english charge shook head will never do for people said must attack sword in hand will rush fearlessly down against odds will never get steadily to withstand charge of men at arm archie however persuaded to allow to organize band of two hundred men under immediate order be armed with long pike be to form sort of reserve in order that if wild charge of main body failed in object must cover retreat serve a nucleus around must rally army swelled rapidly day fresh chief arrived with score of wild tribesman presently news came that english force be advancing from pale against council be held at archie be present very strongly urged view upon chieftain namely that must altogether decline pitched battle divided into numerous party must enter pale destroying weak garrison ravaging country trying to wear out english by constant skirmish night attack refusing always to allow to be tempted into engagement english can not be everywhere at once urged let hold only ground on foot stand a advance retire close ever in on rear drive off cattle destroy crop granary in pale force to live wholly in walled town a gain in strength capture one by one a did in scotland so so only can hope for ultimate success advice be received with silence at once saw betokened disapproval one after of irish chieftain rose declared that such war must not be sustained retainer said be ready to fight after fighting will want to return to home besides be fifteen thousand strong english men at arm marching against be eight hundred must be shameful cowardly to avoid battle be willing to do so follower must not obey let first destroy body of english then will be joined by others can soon march straight upon dublin archie saw that be hopeless to persevere set out following day with wild rabble for must not be termed army to meet english leader yielded so far to advice a to take up position where must fight with best chance of success spot lay between swamp extending vast distance river be thus open only to attack in front must if defeated take refuge in bog where horseman must not follow on following morning english be seen approaching in addition to men at arm be lightly equipped footman for experience have taught english commander in country lightly armed men be necessary to operate where wide extending morass prevented employment of cavalry english advanced in solid array archer led way be followed by spearmen men at arm brought up rear irish be formed in disordered mass under own chieftain english archer commenced fight with shower of arrow scarcely have began to fall when irish with tremendous yell rushed forward to assault english archer be swept like chaff before with reckless bravery threw next upon spearmen solid array be broken by onslaught in moment party be mixed up in wild confusion sight be too much for archie band to view unmoved in spite of shout left ground rushed at full speed after companion threw into fight archie be mounted having be presented with horse by one of chief now although hopeless of final result rode forward just a joined confused struggling mass english men at arm burst down upon a torrent must cleave way through mass of loose sand so english men at arm burst through mass of irish trampling cutting down in path not unharmed however for irish fought desperately with axe knife hewing at men at arm stabbing at horse even trying by sheer strength to throw rider to ground after passing through mass men at arm turned again burst down upon be repetition of first charge irish fought desperately be for there be order cohesion man strove only to kill foe before being slain archie chief with few mounted men among retainer strove in vain to stem torrent under order of leader english kept in compact mass weight of horse armour bore down opposition four time did men at arm burst through struggling mass of irish a formed to charge fifth time latter lost heart a if acting under simultaneous influence turned fled english horse burst down on rear of mass of fugitive hewing down in hundred nearest to river dashed in number be drowned in striving to cross main body however made for swamp though in crush many sank in perished miserably here great majority leaping lightly from tuft to tuft gained heart of morass pursuing horse reining up on edge ronald have kept near archie in fight when be lost ran along by side of horse holding fast to stirrup leather horseman still pressed along between river morass archie following example of several of chief alighted from saddle with companion entered swamp be with greatest difficulty that made way across lightly armed companion did good service in assisting several time to drag from treacherous mire when began to sink in at last reached firmer ground in heart of swamp here fugitive be gathered at least have fallen on field many have escaped across river although number have lost life in attempt others scattered fled in various direction few of chief be gathered in council when archie arrived agreed that be lost there be nothing to do scatter to home archie took part in discussion day experience have convinced that nothing like permanent determined insurrection be possible only by such movement must scottish cause be aided by forcing english to send reinforcement across st george channel after seeing slaughter have taken place be rejoiced at heart that rising have commenced before joined be in way result of mission be one of sporadic insurrection frequently broke out in ireland only to be instantly sternly repressed have failed sir knight one of chief said to be not for want of courage on part of men indeed archie replied through interpreter never did see men fight more fiercely without discipline organization victory be well nigh impossible for lightly armed footman against heavy mailclad cavalry tactic advised be doubtless good chief said see wisdom be well nigh impossible to carry out with such following a ours be ever impatient for fray quickly wearied by effort ready to die not to wait to prudence mean cowardice only idea of fighting be to rush full at foe see how broke english spearmen be right well done archie replied day when well trained disciplined irish soldier will be second to none in world unless will submit to training discipline can never hope to conquer english now sir knight what do propose doing chief said will make way north archie replied will rejoin king at rathlin will send two of men with know foot of morass of neighbourhood when get beyond point familiar to will procure two others to take place will need prudence courage to get through for english men at arm will be scouring country in group of four hunting come across like wolf see already pointed to horizon be scattering round edge of morass to inclose here be many mile round before tomorrow be gone not man will be left here when darkness fell archie accompanied by ronald guide set out on journey alone must never have found way through swamp even in darkness guide moved along quickly following track known to with instinct of hound archie kept close on heel a step only few inch from track might plunge in deep morass in in few second must sink out of sight on nearing edge of bog guide slackened pace motioning to archie to remain where be crept forward noiselessly into darkness not far off must hear call of english horseman sound be repeated again again until died away in distance showing that cordon have be drawn round morass so a to inclose fugitive from battle of previous day in quarter of hour guide returned a noiselessly a have departed archie continued march at heel even greater caution than before be now necessary in walking for english before darkness have set in have narrowly examined edge of morass have placed three four men wherever must discover slightest sign of track thus archie guide be obliged to leave path by have previously travelled progress be slow now party only moving for few yard at time then halting while guide searched for ground solid enough to carry weight at last archie felt ground grow firmer under foot reconnaissance by guide having shown that none of english be stationed opposite to left morass noiselessly made way across country until far beyond english line night walked at daybreak entered swamp lay down for day in long coarse grass growing on piece of firm ground deep in recess in evening one of guide stole out returned with native of neighbourhood who undertook to show archie way on further journey ten day rather night of steady journeying brought archie again to rocky shore where have landed throughout have found faithful guide whom have rewarded by giving a

steadily in track till gain flatter country where can keep in sight then will have more occasion for hound can gallop on at full speed archie observed with satisfaction that bruce be making up extremely steep hillside deeming probably that horseman must be unable to follow here that must be able to distance pursuer on foot ten minute later pursuer have reached foot of hill pembroke at once

hound hector somehow slipped collar joined be able to shake off pursuer so that danger be over without sacrificing life of good dog archie smiled perchance sir be not from clumsiness that hound got free that be loosed by friendly hand may be so king replied must scarcely have intrusted to hand friendly to must leader even if so disposed have ventured to slip hound seeing that horseman must have be close by at time that deed must cost life be only because hector got away when horseman be unable to follow that escaped seeing that good dog a be speed be not strong point that horseman must

be frequently under arm be thoroughly trained to fight together have greatest confidence in leader having often with spear withstood shock of english chivalry archie knew that must rely upon to fullest therefore took up position on bank of river where ford must enable enemy to cross have be le confident a to result must have defended ford must be only crossed by two horseman abreast

be thickly scattered about must be difficult for cavalry to charge up somewhat steeply sloping ground in anything like unbroken order with eighty of men archie took up position one hundred yard back from stream with great exertion of smaller boulder be removed rock stone be piled to make wall on flank of ground standing two deep occupied remaining seventy men divided equally placing one company under command of of two faithful lieutenant andrew macpherson william orr took post near river one on side of ford at distance of about one hundred yard therefrom orr company be hidden among bush growing by river macpherson lay down among stone boulder be scarce likely to attract attention of english must naturally be fixed upon little body drawn up to oppose in front preparation be scarcely completed when english be seen approaching made halt at river at once commenced crossing at ford confident in power to overwhelm little body of scot whose number have seemed to be exaggerated by fear of country people a soon a hundred of men at arm have passed leader marwilled in line with level spear charged up slope against archie force great boulder broke rank be in straggling order that reached narrow line of scottish spear in vain endeavoured to break through number be of avail to a being on horseback twenty men at time must attack double row of spearmen while conflict be at height archie trumpet be sounded for saw that hundred men have now crossed ford at signal two hidden party leapt to foot with levelled pike rushed towards ford english have force there to resist attack for a men at arm have passed have ridden on to join fray in front head of ford be therefore seized with little difficulty orr with twenty men remained here to hold prevent others from crossing while macpherson with fifty ran up hill fell upon rear of confused mass of cavalry who be striving in vain to break line of archie spear attack be decisive english surprised confused by sudden attack be unable to offer effectual resistance to macpherson pikemen at same moment that fell upon rear archie gave word men rushed forward upon struggling mass of cavalry shock be irresistible men horse fell in number under scottish spear in few minute who must manage to extricate from struggling mass rode off in various direction however be few in number for ninety be killed seventy taken prisoner st

under shelter will ere long begin to send messenger against wall thrice assaulted work beyond drawbridge twice beat back last night came on with force be there after fighting for while seeing be too strong for thought best to withdraw before gained footing in work so have time to draw off men raise drawbridge quite right sandy defender of post must only have be slaughtered assailant might have rushed across drawbridge before must have be raised post be of little importance save to defend castle against sudden surprise must only have be source of constant anxiety loss how many do reckon judging by tent there must be three four thousand about three thousand sir archie make a have time to get tenant in from lady ayrshire estate have two hundred men in castle many of be scarce more than boy have brought hundred fifty with sandy so have a many a can use on wall though must wish have hundred two for sortie hour later great machine began to work hurling vast stone with tremendous force against castle wall strongly a be built archie saw that must ere many day crumble before blow did not reckon on such machine a said to sandy doubtless be of huge machine king edward have constructed for siege of stirling have remained there since castle be taken fortunately have still moat when breach be made will be hard work to cross that day great stone thundered against wall defender be not idle kept up shower of arrow at edge of mound behind machine be hidden although many of working there be killed fresh relay came constantly up machine never ceased work by face of wall be bruised battered many of stone in front have fallen from place twenty four hour archie said to marjory a joined in great hall breach will be begun forty eight will be completed will go on night may expect rest until work be done in hour time will sally out from passage into wood beat up camp expecting attack from rear will do rare damage ere can gather to oppose a soon a do so will be off again scattering in various direction gather again in wood return here hour later archie with two hundred men started sooner have left than marjory called sandy grahame andrew macpherson whom have left in joint command during absence now said be not going to remain quiet here while sir archie doe fighting therefore do gather garrison together leaving only twenty to hold gate see that wheel of drawbridge be well oiled hinge of gate directly see that attack have begun upon camp will lower drawbridge quietly open gate sally out there be great force in outer work when have cleared that if be quick can do without alarming camp seeing what confusion uproar will be going on there will make straight along to point where machine be placed let of men take ax cut rope let others carry faggot well steeped in oil will pile round machine light thus having ensured destruction will fall back again lady marjory sandy began will have buts sandy must just do a order will answer to sir archie will go forth with see that work be properly done two men looked doubtfully at other now andrew marjory said briskly let have hesitation talk plan be good one say that be not good one sandy replied cautiously that be not one sir archie might have carried out if have be here very well andrew then be quite enough give order be responsible if sandy choose to obey will call men together lead without a sandy andrew be quite conscious that lady must be a good a word at once proceeded to carry order into effect wheel of portcullis drawbridge be oiled a be bolt hinge of gate men be formed up in courtyard where presently be joined by marjory who have put on light steel cap shirt of mail who have armed with light sword men gathered round enthusiastically must have burst into cheer have not held up hand to command silence will to wall now said to watch for signal instant attack begin attention of in outwork be called way draw up portcullis noiselessly open gate oil hinge of drawbridge have everything in readiness then will join let drawbridge be lowered swiftly a fall will rush across have suppose told off men who be to remain behind tell when last of have crossed be to raise drawbridge few foot so that none can cross until return then accompanied by macpherson ascended wall be quiet in hostile camp be about quarter of mile distant only creaking of wheel of machine order of directing dull crash a great stone struck wall broke stillness of night for hour watched then sudden uproar be heard in camp scottish war cry pealed out followed by shout yell almost instantly flame be seen to mount up lord be at work marjory said be time for to be doing also so saying ran down to courtyard sandy grahame macpherson few picked men took place around then drawbridge be suddenly run down scot dashed across a marjory have anticipated english in outwork have gathered on farther side be watching sudden outbreak in camp alarmed at prospect of attack perhaps by bruce in quarter be suddenly startled by rush of foot across drawbridge before have time to recover from surprise scot be upon latter be superior in number english already alarmed by attack upon camp offered feeble resistance many be cut down greater part leapt from wall fled towards camp moment resistance ceased outer gate be thrown open at full speed scotch made for machine party here have suspended work be gazing towards camp where uproar be now great wind be blowing briskly fire have spread with immense rapidity already camp be in flame suddenly from bank above scot poured down upon like torrent there be scarcely thought of resistance stricken with dismay astonishment at unexpected attack soldier working machine fled hastily only few falling beneath sword of scot men with ax at once fell upon machine cutting rope smashing wheel lever worked while with faggot piled round in le than two minute work be done lighted torch be applied to faggot flame soon shot up hotly scot waited minute two to see that work be thoroughly done that flame have got fair hold then keeping in close body retired to castle not soul be met with by way leaving andrew macpherson with fifty men to hold outwork until archie must return decide whether must be occupied marjory with rest re entered castle at once ascended to wall again where sandy also posted men to be in readiness to open fire with arrow must english return endeavour to extinguish flame round machine sound of fighting have ceased at camp by light of flame number of english must be seen pulling down tent fire have not yet reached endeavouring to check conflagration while large body of horse foot be rapidly advancing toward castle a soon a came within bowshot range archer opened fire english leader seeing that be already too late to save machine be by time completely enveloped in flame that men must only be sacrificed to good purpose halted troop then moved towards outwork finding in possession of scot fell back again to camp to take council a to next step to be adopted archie attack have be crowned with complete success apprehending no danger from behind english have neglected to place sentry there scot be already among tent before presence be discovered number of english be cut down tent fired a soon a english recovered from first surprise began to form archie gave word for retreat be effected without molestation for first thought of english be to save camp from total destruction report of men who escaped from castle outwork outburst of flame around machine added to confusion reigned leader who have by light of flame ascertained that assault upon camp have be made by small body of enemy deemed of first importance to move at once to save machine if be still possible scot regained entrance to passage without loss of single man passing through soon re entered castle marjory have laid aside warlike trapping awaited husband return at inner entrance of passage have have good success marjory archie said a greeted a will have seen from wall greater part of english camp be destroyed have killed great number have not lost man be good news indeed archie too have not be quite idle while have be away why what have be doing marjory archie asked in surprise come up to wall will show archie mounted with gave start of surprise a looked towards machine great body of fire have died down now beam of machine stood up red glowing while light flickering flame played round see have not be idle archie have destroyed machine retaken outwork be now held by andrew macpherson with fifty men why what magic be wife magic at sir knight have be carrying out work a wise skilful commander must have ordered before left have taken advantage of confusion of enemy by fire in camp have made sortie successful one a see be delighted indeed archie said destruction of machine be indeed great work still sandy macpherson must not have undertaken without order from might have be cut off castle stormed before came back have order from sir be quite sufficient to do justice hesitated about obeying be well nigh ordering to dungeon for disobedience only gave way at last when said must stop at home if liked must lead out retainer of course went in place with armour sword perhaps be a well that have fighting to do do mean marjory that really led sortie think led archie certainly went out with very exciting be there dear look troubled of course a chatelaine of castle be bound to animate men have done bravely well indeed marjory be proud of wife still dear tremble at thought of risk ran more risk than be constantly running archie be rather glad tremble because in future will understand feeling better left here alone while be risking life perpetually with king success of sally courage energy shown by marjory raised spirit of garrison to highest pitch have archie given word must have sallied out fallen upon besieger two day later fresh machine arrived from stirling attack again commenced besieger keeping large body of men near gate to prevent repetition of last sally archie now despatched two three fleet footed runner through passage to find king tell that besieger be making progress to pray to come to assistance two day passed breach be now fairly practicable moat fifty foot wide still barred way to besieger archie have noticed that for two three day water have come down from above have doubt that have diverted course of river upon day after breach be completed besieger advanced in great force up stream from below be going to try to cut dam archie said to sandy place man who can draw bow on side of castle a english approached rain of arrow be poured into covering with shield with large mantlet formed of hurdle covered with hide pressed forward to dam here who have brought with pick mattock set to work upon dam men with mantlet shielding from storm of arrow while number of archer opened fire upon defender very many be killed by scottish arrow work went on gap be made through dam water a rushed through aided effort of at work after three hour labour fighting gap be so far deepened that water in moat have fallen eight foot then finding that must now be waded assailant desisted drew off to camp council be held that evening in castle a to whether hold must be abandoned at once whether one attack on breach must be withstood be finally determined that breach must be held steep side of moat exposed by subsidence of water be slippery difficult force in castle be amply sufficient at once to man breach to furnish archer for wall on side while in event of worst be breach carried by english defender might fall back to central keep thence make way through passage have not be for possibility of early arrival of king to relief agreed that must be a well to evacuate castle at once a in end must fall life spent in defence must thus be useless sacrifice a however troop might at moment appear be determined to hold castle until last next morning party of knight in full defensive armour came down to edge of moat to see whether passage must be effected be not molested while making examination a scottish arrow must only have dropped harmless off steel harness archie be on wall how like prospect sir knight called out merrily fear that sludge slime will sully bright armour smirch plume for will be difficult to hold footing on muddy bank be best for to yield sir archibald forbes without giving trouble of making way across moat have made stout resistance have done enough for honour must see that sooner later must win way in then must rather must be later archie replied may have done enough for honour be not for honour that be fighting for scotland work be begun yet can assure be far from being at end of resource yet will be time enough to talk about surrendering when have won breach outer wall knight retired a hour passed without besieger seeing preparation for assault judged that report carried back to camp be not encouraging one large number of men be however seen leaving camp toward sunset came back staggering under immense load of brushwood have cut in forest intend to fill up moat archie said be wisest course at once directed men to make up large truss of straw over poured considerable quantity of oil early next morning english drew out of camp advanced in martial array man carried great faggot covering with a came within bowshot marched down to moat in turn threw in faggot when have done so returned to camp brought back rapidly process of filling up moat opposite to breach continued besieger kept up rain of arrow dart many of english be killed work be continued without intermission until well nigh across moat broad crossway be formed level with outer bank narrow gap remained to be filled english leader advanced to front to prevent scot on breach rushing down to assault placing faggot somewhat to surprise of english defender remained stationary contenting with hurling great stone at busy enemy suddenly there be movement archie party of best men dashed down breach climbing on causeway for moment drove worker guard back be followed by twenty men carrying great truss of straw be piled against faggot forming end of causeway archie band leapt back a torch be applied to straw in moment hot flame leapt up causing knight who have pressed after retreating scot to fall back hastily shout of triumph rose from garrison one of dismay from besieger saturated with oil truss burnt with fury faggot be soon alight fresh wind be blowing flame crept rapidly along causeway in few minute be in blaze from end to end in hour nothing remained of great pile save charred ash saturated faggot have be below water in moat now floated upon besieger have drawn off when saw that flame have gained fair hold of causeway smoke have scarcely ceased to rise when great outcry arose from english camp lookout from top of keep perceived strong force marching toward by bustle confusion reigned in camp archie doubted not that newcomer be scot garrison be instantly called to arm gate be thrown open leaving small body only to hold gate sallied out at head of men marched toward english camp at approach of scottish force english leader have marched out with men to oppose bruce have be able to collect three hundred fifty men english seeing how small be number advancing against prepared to receive boldly scarcely have combat begun when archie with band entered english camp be almost deserted at once fired tent then advanced in solid mass with level spear against rear of english dismayed at destruction of camp at finding attacked front rear lost heart fell into confusion leader strove to rally dashed with men at arm against spearmen effort to break through be in vain defeat increased panic of footman archie party broke way through disordered line joined body commanded by king whole rushed so fiercely upon english that broke fled in direction pursued by triumphant scot be just in time see sir archie bruce said pointing to breach in wall few hour more methinks must have be too late must have held out longer than sire archie replied have repulsed attack morning burnt causeway of faggot upon attempted to cross moat still be truly glad that have arrived thank with heart for coming so speedily to rescue for sooner later hold must have fallen great machine brought with from stirling proved too strong for wall how have lady marjory borne during siege king inquired right nobly archie replied ever in good spirit showing brave face to men one night when made sortie through secret passage fell upon english camp from other side having left castle in charge headed garrison issuing out recaptured outwork destroyed machine by fire bravely done king said just what must expect from wife did well to take advice in matter will never agree there sire for a know followed own will wed bride have fixed upon for well well sir archie a be satisfied will e'en let be now trust that have still supply left for to tell truth be hungry a well a weary men have marched fast far there be abundance archie replied to last for month right willingly be at service king remained week at aberfilly men aiding archie retainer in repairing gap in dam in rebuilding wall a five hundred men working willingly well can effect wonder by time bruce rode away castle be restored to former appearance archie marched on following day rejoined douglas in galloway chapter xxii prisoner after consultation between leader be agreed to make attempt to capture castle of knockbawn be known to posse garrison of sixty men only although strong archie sir james believed that must be captured by assault be arranged that archie must ride to reconnoitre taking two mounted retainer started force remaining in forest eight mile distant castle of knockbawn stood on rocky promontory jutting hundred fifty yard into sea when neared neck of point be twenty yard wide archie bade follower fall back short distance will ride said close up to castle wall armour be good care not for arrow crossbow bolt be best fell back little for may have horse may sally out in pursuit be well mounted fear not being overtaken be best that must have good start archie then rode forward toward castle seeing knight approaching alone garrison judged that be friendly be not until be seen that instead of approaching drawbridge turned aside rode to edge of fosse that suspected that be foe running to wall opened fire with arrow upon by time archie have seen that required across promontory ran sort of fissure ten yard wide a many deep from opposite edge of wall rose abruptly here assault must be difficult be upon gateway that attack must be made several arrow have struck armour glanced off archie now turned quietly rode away horse being protected by mail like scarce have turned when saw sight caused for moment to draw rein coming at full gallop toward promontory be strong body of english horse flying banner of sir ingram de umfraville be already nearer to end of neck than be there be mode of escape drawing sword galloped at full speed to meet a neared sir ingram one of doughtiest of edward knight rode out with levelled lance to meet at full gallop knight charged other sir ingram spear be pointed at bar of archie helmet a horse met other archie with blow of sword cut off head of lance dealt tremendous backhanded blow upon sir ingram helmet a latter passed striking knight forward on to horse neck then without pausing moment dashed into midst of english rank horseman closed around although cut down several with sweeping blow be unable to break way through conflict must not last long archie received blow from behind struck from horse regaining foot continued fight blow rained thick upon be soon struck senseless to ground when recovered be in room in keep of castle two knight be sitting at table near couch on be lying ah exclaimed one on seeing archie open eye move be glad to see sens coming back to sir prisoner truly sir regret so brave knight must have fallen into hand seeing that in war must need send prisoner to king edward whose treatment of be not must e'en own gentle for indeed fought like paladin deemed not that there be knight in scotland save bruce who must have so borne never did ingram de umfraville come nearer to losing seat than did from backhanded blow dealt head ring with still helmet will never be fit to wear again a leech said when plastering head 'have not skull be of thickest have assuredly cut through ' may crave name of so brave antagonist be sir archibald forbes archie replied by st jago knight said be sorry for seeing that save bruce there be none in scottish rank against whom king edward be so bitter in day of wallace there be one whose name be more often on lip than of sir archibald forbes now under bruce be ever coming to front have thought to have asked edward a boon must have kept a prisoner until exchanged for one on side being sir archibald forbes know that be useless indeed nevertheless sir knight will send to king edward begging to look mercifully upon case seeing how bravely honourably have fought thanks for good office sir ingram archie replied will ask for mercy for have never owed paid allegiance a true scot have fought for country against foreign enemy king edward doe not hold to be foreign enemy knight said seeing that baliol king with comyn great noble did homage to a lord paramount of scotland be easy way archie rejoined to gain possession to nominate puppet from among noble already vassal then to get to do homage sir knight comyn baliol other of anglo norman noble who hold estate in scotland have right to speak for to barter away freedom be what wallace thousand of scotchman have fought died to protest against what scotchman will do until country be free be not question for to argue upon sir ingram said surlily king edward bid fight in scotland a knight vassal put on harness without question own to that seeing have fought beside in gascony when a feudal vassal of king of france made war upon lord can not see that offence be unpardonable one when scotchman do same here concerning lawfulness of claim to be lord paramount own that know care one jot however sir regret much that have fallen into hand for to carlisle where king have long be lying a have doubtless heard grievously ill must forthwith send must leave here with governor for in hour mount ride away with troop will do best to make sojourn here easy until such time a may have opportunity of sending by ship to carlisle now farewell sir said giving archie hand regret that unkind chance have thrown so gallant knight into hand that duty to king forbids from letting go free thanks sir ingram archie replied have ever heard of a brave knight if misfortune must fall upon must sooner must have be captured by than by one of le fame honour governor now have meal with wine set before archie then left alone be not at carlisle yet archie said to unless mistake will have sir james thundering at gate before morning cluny will assuredly have ridden off at full speed to carry news when saw be cut off e'en now will be marching towards castle a expected archie be roused before morning by tremendous outburst of noise heavy blow be given followed by crash archie judged to be fall of drawbridge across fosse guessed that of douglas men have crept forward noiselessly have descended fosse managed to climb up to gate have then suddenly attacked with ax chain of drawbridge prodigious uproar raged in castle order be shouted garrison aroused from sleep snatched up arm hastened to wall outside rose war cry douglas douglas mingled with others of glen cairn to rescue for few minute be confusion then light suddenly burst up grew instant more more bright douglas have piled faggot against gate archie said to quarter of hour castle will be three four minute later governor with six soldier two of whom bore torch entered room must come along at once sir knight governor said attack be of fiercest know not whether will make head against at rate must not risk being recaptured must therefore place in boat send off without delay to castle at port patrick be in vain for archie to think of resistance be unarmed helpless two of soldier laid hand on hurried along until reached lower chamber of castle governor unlocked door with one of torch bearer led way down narrow step be fifty in number then level passage ran along for distance door be opened fresh breeze blew upon a issued forth stood on rock at foot of promontory on castle stood large boat lay close at hand drawn to shore archie six soldier entered four of latter took oar others seated by prisoner then boat rowed away while governor returned to aid in defence of castle boat be quarter of mile away when on night air came sound of wild outburst of triumphant shout told that scot have won way into castle with muttered curse men bent to oar minute took further away from knockbawn archie be bitterly disappointed have reckoned confidently on effort of douglas to deliver possibility of being sent off by sea have not entered mind seemed to now that fate be sealed have noticed on embarking that there be other boat lying at foot of promontory pursuit must therefore be impossible after rowing eight hour party reached port patrick where archie be delivered by soldier to governor with message from commander saying that prisoner sir archibald forbes be captive of great importance be by order of sir ingram de umfraville who have captured to be sent on to carlisle to king when ship must be going thither fortnight passed before vessel sailed archie be placed in iron so securely guarded in dungeon that escape be altogether impossible so harsh be confinement that longed for time when vessel must sail for carlisle even though be sure that same fate have attended so many of scotland best bravest knight awaited there wind be contrary vessel be ten day upon voyage upon reaching carlisle archie be handed to governor of castle next morning be conducted to presence of king aged monarch in last extremity of sickness lay upon couch several of noble stood around so said a prisoner be brought before be archibald forbes one companion of traitor wallace who have hitherto escaped vengeance so young sir have ventured to brave anger to think capable of coping with lion of england have done utmost sir king archie said firmly such a be for freedom of country traitor be be leader wallace ever took vow of allegiance to maintaining ever that king of england have claim right over scotland have be murdered foully dishonourably a will doubtless murder a have killed many nobler knight gentleman others will take place so fight will go on until scotland be free scotland will never be free king said with angry vehemence rather than that will cease to exist will slay till there be not one of scottish blood man woman

of sword from peasant of village armed with started with marjory two woman over hill be early autumn now weather be magnificent made distance in quiet stage crossing pentlands came down upon aberfilly without meeting with single danger obstacle need not to describe joy of archie mother at return news spread like lightning among tenantry in hour after wayfarer reached castle men woman must be seen flocking over hill at top of speed to express delight enthusiasm at lord return by tenant on estate save prevented by age illness have assembled at castle rejoicing have taken place at marriage of lord be tame quiet beside boisterous enthusiasm be now exhibited although marjory have at first be welcomed for sake of husband fact that be kerr have excited deep though hidden hostility to in mind of who have be father vassal at aberfilly old retainer of forbeses at glen cairn devotion courage have shown in defence of castle in enterprise for rescue of lord swept away vestige of feeling henceforth marjory ranked in affection with archie there be not man upon estate felt that must die for if need be after week stay at home archie rode away joined king taking however four five retainer with bruce received with extreme warmth have heard of capture news that be condemned to die at berwick have also reached have doubt archie have shared fate have befallen own brother so many of bravest

kerr have wished to abandon for sake mistress marjory niece of alexander macdougall who have set free from uncle hold of dunstaffnage now archie king said when be again alone together suppose seeing that have come hither without following that wish for time to remain quiet at home seeing that have suffered severe imprisonment grievous risk of death in cause methinks have well earned right to rest quiet for while with brave lady at present can dispense with service of retainer most of low country be now in hand english garrison dare not venture out of strong place army that king of england collected to crush have be hear much disorganized by death baron will doubtless wring concession privilege from son before spread banner to wind again from report new king have little of father ability energy month may elapse before serious effort be made against be despatching brother edward to join douglas in subduing galloway during absence will be content to remain here in field with small following for english governor of town will methinks stand only on defensive until strong army march north from england when galloway be subdued lowland will be in hand save for english garrison will on edward return set to punish comyns other traitor noble of north who be well nigh hand glove with english so long a scotland have such powerful enemy in midst can not hope to cope with force england can send against alone united task be one will tax strength to utmost seeing that england be in wealth population so far superior edward disposes of force of ireland of wale of gascony therefore first task must be to root out traitor noble from among when move north will need company strength until edward have cleared english out of galloway captured stronghold reduced to obedience can stop in aberfilly there at time when have enterprise on hand can take few day will come rest if will give hospitality so until following spring archie forbes remained quietly most happily at home several time king came stayed few day at aberfilly where be safe against surprise treachery not long after archie return home father anselm arrived to archie satisfaction great joy of marjory took up

by taking opposite side comyn of badenoch be son of man bruce have slain at dumfries while buchan hated even more since wife countess have espoused cause of bruce have crowned at scone be now shamefully imprisoned in cage at berwick must be supposed that buchan anger against countess be a deep implacable a of edward for a english king most powerful ally in scotland must surely have obtained pardon release of wife have desired on other hand bruce have private grudge against comyn for upon have be conferred bruce lordship of annandale have entered into possession even occupied family castle of lochmaben king army marched north be joined by alexander simon frazer with follower marched to inverness with various other castle in north captured of castle be when taken destroyed

please will guide party to top of rock look impossible randolph said gazing at precipice a tell that have done others can do same will myself follow guidance archie said what sir archie think be smallest number of men with whom having once gained footing on wall may fight way to gate let in friend must think archie replied that with thirty men might manage to do so confusion in garrison will be extreme at so unexpected surprise if divide in two party press forward by different way will think rather of holding together defending than of checking course one other of party must surely be able to make way to gate thirty let be then randolph said do choose fifteen active vigilant men from among retainer will pick a many from mine a there be use in delaying let carry out enterprise very

not much longer hold out induced edward bruce to agree to raise siege on condition that if by th of june next castle be not effectually relieved by english force must then be surrendered satisfactory explanation have ever be given of reason induced edward bruce to agree to so one sided bargain have already invested place for four month there be possibility of army being collected in england for relief for many month to come long ere must arrive garrison must have be starved into surrender by giving england year to relieve place virtually challenged country to put forth strength held out inducement to to make effort internal dissension have hitherto prevented only feasible explanation be that edward bruce be weary of being kept inactive so long time before wall of fortress be unable to capture that made arrangement from sheer impatience thoughtlessness without consideration of storm be bringing upon scotland have be otherwise must surely have consulted king before entering upon agreement of such extreme importance bruce when heard of rash treaty be highly displeased nevertheless accepted term party began at once preparation for crowning struggle of war english saw now never

bruce however must suffer change in position said that randolph must stand fall by douglas however urged that must be allowed to go forward with small body of retainer have with king consented douglas set off with men when english saw approach recoiled somewhat from square douglas being now better able to see what be going on commanded follower to halt saying that randolph must speedily prove victorious without help be now to take part in struggle must only lessen credit of who have already all won victory seeing enemy in confusion from appearance of reinforcement randolph archie now gave

back again to position have quitted reformed array douglas edward bruce randolph archie forbes now gathered round king remonstrated with on rashness of act might have proved fatal to whole army king smiled at such remonstrance from four men who have above others distinguished for rash daring exploit shrugging shoulder observed only that be pity have broken shaft of favourite axe english array now withdrew to short distance became evident that great battle must be delayed till morrow scotch army therefore broke rank prepared to pas night on spot where stood king assembled principal leader round after thanking god for so fair beginning of fight a have that day be made pointed out to how great effect two preliminary skirmish must have upon spirit of army expressed confidence in final result

prisoner so long a battle lasted a whole rich of english camp must fall into hand if successful pledged that heir of who fell must have succession of estate free from usual feudal burden on such occasion night passed quietly in morning army formed array for battle bruce a be customary conferred honour of knighthood upon several of leader then proceeded to allotted place awaited onset beyond stream extending far away towards rising ground be english squadron in glittering arm first division in line others in heavy mass behind now that scotch be fairly drawn up in order of battle english must see how small be number in comparison with own king in surprise exclaimed to sir ingram de umfraville what will yonder scot fight that verily will knight replied for have many time be engaged in stout conflict with knew how hard be even for mail clad knight to break through close line of scottish spear so high respect have for valour that urged king to pretend to retire suddenly beyond camp when scot in spite of leader must be sure to leave rank flock into camp to plunder when might be easily dispersed cut to piece king however refused to adopt suggestion saying that one must be able to accuse of avoiding battle of withdrawing army before such rabble a army stood confronting other in battle array priest passed along scottish front crucifix in hand exhorting to fight to death for liberty of country a passed along line company knelt in attitude of prayer king edward seeing exclaimed to sir ingram see yonder folk kneel to ask for mercy ay sire knight said looking earnestly at scot kneel ask for mercy not of be for sin ask mercy of god know men have met fought tell assuredly will win die not even when death look in face will turn to fly then if must be so said king let charge trumpet sounded along line first immense body of english archer crossed burn opened battle by pouring cloud of arrow into scottish rank scotch archer who be in advance of spearmen be speedily driven back to shelter beyond line for not only be english vastly more numerous shot much further more accurately now knight men at arm on steel clad horse crossed burn be aware of existence of milton

line of spear four deep scotch held own horse wounded riderless turned dashed through rank of english added to confusion be much further increased by deep hole into horse be continually falling breaking up order in rank behind pressed forward to reach front very number added to difficulty english be divided into ten division battle one by one crossed stream with banner flying still avoiding centre followed line taken by first pressed forward to take part in fray randolph now moved with centre to support of hardly pressed right division a well a of edward bruce seemed to be lost among multitude of opponent stewart douglas moved division to right threw into fray three scottish division be now fighting side by side with much smaller front than have originally occupied for time battle raged furiously without superiority on side scotch possessed great advantage that standing close together in rank four deep man be engaged while of mounted knight men at arm who pressed upon only front line be doing efficient service not only therefore be vast numerical superiority of english useless to actually far larger number of scottish than of be using weapon in front rank while great proportion of english remained helplessly behind fighting line unable to take part in fight now english archer came into play again firing high into air rained arrow almost perpendicularly down upon scottish rank have continued must have be a fatal to scot at bannockburn a be at falkirk happily scottish horse told off for special service be here commanded by traitor at critical moment king
