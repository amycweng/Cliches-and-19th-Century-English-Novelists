however little difference of opinion between irish english author a to general course of war a to atrocious conduct of william army of foreign mercenary towards people of ireland g henty chapter shipwreck few mile to south of bray head on crest of hill falling sharply down to sea stood castle davenant conspicuous landmark to mariner skirting coast on way from cork waterford to dublin bay castle davenant be called although have long since ceased to be defensible when be built by sir godfrey davenant who came over with strongbow be place of strength strongbow follower did well for have reckoned on hard fighting irish be too much divided among to oppose serious resistance to invader strongbow have married daughter of dermid prince of leinster at death of prince succeeded greater portion of leinster be soon divided among knight men at arm who have followed standard godfrey davenant who be favourite of earl have reason to be dissatisfied with share consisted of domain including many square mile of fertile land stretching back from seacoast here for many generation descendant lived for most part taking active share in war disturbance with scarcely interval of rest agitated country castle have continued to deserve name until forty year before time story commences when cromwell gunner have battered breach in left heap of smoking ruin walter davenant have died fighting to last in own hall at time greater part of estate be bestowed upon officer soldier in cromwell army among whom le than four million acre of irish land be divided have not be that walter davenant widow

stoutly a lieutenant in one of cromwell regiment of horse have always considered ill treated man because although have obtained most fertile portion of davenant estate old family be permitted to retain castle few hundred acre by sea be one of who contended that amalekites must be utterly destroyed by sword considered that retention of corner of domain by davenants be direct flying in face of providence who have given into hand of faithful not have obtained possession of ruined castle zephaniah whitefoot must have repaired set up abode there follower of cromwell have eye for beautiful be too much in earnest to care aught for amenity of life despised a almost sinful anything approximating to beauty either in dress person surroundings house that reared in land of have taken possession be bare to point of ugliness interior be a cold hard a be exterior everything be for use nothing for ornament scarce flower be to be seen in garden laughter be sign of levity to be sternly repressed isolation in midst of hostile population caused concern whatever cared for society companionship save that of own household ruled with rod of iron occasional gathering for religious purpose with other settler of own faith regarded irish a papist doomed to everlasting perdition indeed consigned to fate outside own narrow sect people must no more mix with surrounding population than oil with water a rule tilled a much ground in immediate vicinity of house a family must manage rest of land have fallen into possession let for money payment more often for portion of crop raised upon to such native a be willing to hold on term next generation have fallen away somewhat from father standard be not in human nature to stand strain a family have be subjected to there be innate yearning for joy happiness even sternest discipline can not keep man forever in gloomy bond of fanaticism in most case immediate descendant of cromwell soldier must gladly have made sort of compromise must have surrendered much of outlying land to obtain secure peaceful possession of rest must have emerged from life of gloomy seclusion in found whisper of such feeling a must be heard in household of zephaniah whitefoot so long a lived be old man now a hard a gloomy a unlovable a have be when in prime wife have died very many year before of disease zephaniah doctor called in must discover in fact of utter weariness at dull life of repression gloom crushed down of naturally meek docile disposition have submitted without murmuring to husband command have during whole married life never shocked so much a did day before death when for first time exhibited possession of opinion of own by saying earnestly may say what like zephaniah do think be meant to have happiness pleasure on earth if be intended to go through life without laughing why must be able to laugh oh how must like to hear one hearty natural laugh again before die such a used to hear when be girl jabez whitefoot inherited mother docility of disposition even when grew to middle age never dreamt of disputing father absolute rule remained strictly neutral when wife daughter of old comrade of father settled few mile away fought stoutly at time against tyranny be le than man jabez must say to indignantly to put up at age with being lectured a if be child parental obedience be very well hope be always obedient to father when come to body not being permitted to have soul of own be going too far if have told that when became wife be to become inmate of dungeon for rest of existence must have have not if have be master of broad land of leinster though unable to rouse husband into making effort for sort of freedom hannah whitefoot have battled more successfully in behalf of son john have have management of son sir will manage mine said will see that doe not grow up reprobate papist at least will grow up man life will not be a hateful a mine be if can help many battle have already be fought on point in end hannah whitefoot triumphed although husband never opposed father authority refused absolutely to use own to compel wife to submission know sir said have own way with mother say nothing for against have other idea one can say that be not good woman that fails in duty to people see life from same point of view be just a conscientious in way a be in yours read bible draw own conclusion from just a do a be mother of child a know will do best for will not interfere with way of doing so hannah won at last although according to modern idea boy training must have be considered strict in extreme differed very widely from father have have before sound of laughter such a never have be heard within wall of house since zephaniah laid stone upon stone sometimes issued from room where hannah child be together alone zephaniah be out with jabez about farm hannah benefited a much a did child by rebellion against authority jabez too be conscious that home be brighter pleasanter than have be when zephaniah burst into torrent of indignation when discovered that child have absolutely heard fairy story from mother jabez said quietly father wish dispute have be obedient son to will continue so to life end if be not satisfied with doings of wife will depart with there be plenty who will be glad to let piece of land if only work there a hard a work here will assuredly be able to support boy so let be last word between threat put end to struggle zephaniah have like most of class keen eye to main chance must ill spare service of jabez thrifty hard working wife henceforth except by pointed reference in lengthy morning evening prayer to backsliding in household held peace between castle zephaniah whitefoot there have never be intercourse dowager mr davenant hated cromwellite occupier of estate not only a usurper a representative of man who have slain husband never alluded to existence have always contrived in ride walk to avoid point from must obtain so much a distant view of square ugly house formed blot on fair landscape still spoke of estate a if extended to original boundary ignored absolutely very existence of zephaniah whitefoot belonged to when son jabez grew to man estate at about same period necessarily at time crossed other path a in prejudice enmity of elder be somewhat softened must when met on road exchange passing nod brief good morning generation still boy of two house met a friend thanks to mother successful rebellion john whitefoot grew up hearty healthy boy with bright eye merry laugh frank open bearing one must think grandfather remarked angrily one day a boy went out whistling gaily to fetch in young colt jabez be about to break john be son of malignant one of men of charles stuart rather than of god fearing tiller of soil so long a fear god walk in right way be none worse for father jabez said stoutly even must hardly say that mother have failed in teaching in respect know that so long a one have word of scripture in heart be better for having always on lip in other respect regret not that boy must have spirit fire know lack who can say what may yet take place here stuart be again upon throne with james leaning towards papacy there be saying whether day land cromwell divided among soldier may not be restored to original possessor in case son may have to make way in other path of life than ours if be so john will assuredly be more likely to make way than must have done must never surrender save with life what sword have won will hold inheritance lord have given old man said fiercely yes father so said whose land have inherited so said walter davenant of whose land be possessed will be a god will have given to land of others may be that will take away again time have changed father manner be well pleased to see john while be sure be a true to faith a be will take broader perhaps happier view of life than have done zephaniah gave snort of displeasure grieved continually at influence daughter in law exercised over son now extended clearly to husband jabez be now man of five forty have lately shown that in respect at least intended to have way while zephaniah though still erect strong be well nigh eighty remember jabez said that go hard with who having set hand to plough turn aside will not turn aside father jabez said quietly have gone too long along straight furrow to change now be not ill pleased that son must have wider scope trust believe that will drive furrow a straight a have done although may not be exactly in same line zephaniah old mr davenant knew that respective grandson have made friend although boy father knew approved of although for somewhat different reason whitefoot boy mr davenant have said to wife be fancy from what have seen of of different type to father grandfather met other day when be out spoke a naturally outspokenly a walter seems to have got rid of puritanical twang altogether at rate will do walter harm indeed must say that there be solid good sense about will do master walter who be somewhat disposed to be madcap much good anyhow be better companion for boy than lad down in village there be saying wife how matter may go in unhappy country may be that may come to own again may be that may lose what be left to anyhow can do harm to walter that must have a friend one in opposite camp somewhat similar be talk between hannah jabez although in case wife be speaker john have told jabez that have several time met young davenant that boy be disposed to be friendly with have asked to speak with to know whether have objection to making friend of what do say hannah jabez asked cautiously father fear must not approve of father need know nothing about jabez be old man good man cling to way of youth deems that thing be still a be when rode behind cromwell must not deceive did ask see that matter need be mentioned in presence seems to that will be good for john to be friend with boy be almost without companionship have acquaintance be true among other settler of faith such companionship a have there will not open mind broaden view be dull people here for lad have have other child might have be different have heard mother speak of life a girl in england assuredly be brighter more varied than ours seems not to that pleasure have be sinful although have be taught otherwise a read bible can not see that innocent pleasure be in way denied to lord people such pleasure a companionship of young davenant can give john will think be altogether for good lad be papist hannah be jabez boy methinks argue among upon point of doctrine have fear that john will ever be led from right path indeed though be presumption for woman to say so do feel so sure a minister that ours be only path to heaven believe firmly that be best path others believe a firmly in path can not think jabez that mankind save who be within fold of church can be condemned by good lord to perdition word be bold hannah know not what father elder of church must say be to hear a to will not argue methinks that be right in saying that companionship of young davenant will do boy harm lad must have father consent though reckon that must count pound where must count shilling yet in opinion of world assuredly stand above moreover a be only in human nature that must regard a who have despoiled john must have dealing with son without consent if be given have nought to say against so john told walter next time met learned in reply that walter have already obtained father consent to going out ramble with so boy became companion friend benefited by to john bright careless ease gaiety of walter talk manner be at first strange indeed after restraint gloom of home in time caught something of companion tone until a have be said altered manner bearing struck annoyed grandfather on other hand earnestness solidity of john character be of benefit to walter simple truthfulness straightforwardness of principle blunt frankness in saying exactly what thought influenced walter to quite a large extent a have influenced john so companionship between lad have gone on for two year in fine weather have met once twice week have taken long ramble together throwing down on slope facing sea have talked over subject of mutual interest walter education be far in advance of of companion whose reading indeed have be confined to scripture work of divine controversialist of own church whose acquirement did not extend beyond most elementary subject to everything that walter knew be novel strange eagerly devoured after receiving permission from mother book walter lent principally history travel work of milton shakespeare a to latter hannah have at first scruple be only after setting with great misgiving a to lawfulness of act to peruse book that suffered son to read volume only contained ten of shakespeare play hannah on handing book to son said pretend john to understand be written there can not see that there be evil in there be assuredly many noble thought much worldly wisdom did think that life must be passed here must say that be better for not to read book give picture of life so different from what yours must be none can say what lot may be although have heard much about wickedness of stage can see line in book must do harm to see can do much good john do see that can do harm therefore if have set mind on read boy be stormy evening in first week of wind be blowing in fierce gust making door casement quiver in davenant castle while between gust sound of deep roar of sea on rock far below must be plainly heard mr davenant be sitting in high backed chair on one side of great fireplace in pile of log be blazing son have just laid down book must no longer see to read while daughter in law be industriously knitting walter be wandering restlessly between fire window looking out at flying cloud through moon occasionally struggled do sit down walter mother said at last certainly be most restless creature ever saw not always mother can not help wondering about ship saw down coast making for bay be about ten mile out seemed to be keeping course when saw last half hour ago can see by cloud that wind have drawn round more to north doubt much whether will be able to gain bay in case walter father said if captain know business will wear round run down for waterford agree with continued after walking to window watching cloud that vessel coming from south will hardly weather bray head with wind have scarcely spoken when door opened one of servant entered honour boy have just come up from village say that john considine sent to tell that large ship be driving in to shore that think will strike not far from village why on earth mr davenant exclaimed doe tack stand out to sea boy say foremast be gone have lost management of in case god help there be little chance for on rocky coast however will go down at once see if anything can be done katherine do see that there be plenty of hot blanket ready in case of poor fellow be washed ashore will of course send up here suppose walter will come down with walter have already disappeared having slipped off a soon a have heard message let that boy get into mischief fergus old mr davenant said be afraid mother be beyond son said with smile davenant yet must ever keep out of mischief walter be exception however fortunately for generally get out of scrape a easily a get into not always fergus said shaking head not always mother exception know prove rule well godfrey do want to go asked younger boy who have risen from table be looking eagerly at of course do mind must keep close to ah father john broke off a ecclesiastic muffled up to throat in wrapping entered room be going down too assuredly be fergus think trifle of wind must keep from doing duty in two minute two men godfrey sallied out staggered a wind struck godfrey clung to father arm not word be spoken a made way down steep descent to village consisted of about dozen fisherman hut indeed speaking must have be useless for word must have be heard above howling of storm vessel be visible to a made way down hill be complete wreck light of moon be sufficient for to see that have a boy said lost foremast sail be in ribbon be labouring heavily in sea wave struck breaking over bow sweeping along deck there be hope for must neither tack wear anchor must hold for moment on rocky bottom in such sea on reaching village joined group of fisherman who be standing under shelter of end of cottage can nothing be done considine mr davenant shouted in ear of one of fisherman not thing yer honour have just let drop one of anchor must not hope must hold there mr davenant said not honour onless be mad hoped must hoult so a to bring head round cable went a soon a strain came saw head go sharp up to wind then fall off again not that must have made much difference in end though must have given hour longer of life must get boat off with line if strike look at sea yer honour mr walter have be asking there be boat must get through surf not if ireland dipinded on where be walter sure ca tell ye yer honour be here few minute since what be come of be more can tell ye went off with larry doolan boy who be standing next to fisherman shouted then a sure a fate be up to mischief mr davenant said walter be bad enough by with larry to help must take regiment to look after ca be in much mischief tonight yer honour fisherman said look sir be coming in fast draw power of water will strike in minute two seems crowded with men can nothing be done to help priest asked nothing reverence praying for be only thing can help poor sowls now be sure be not possible to launch boat considine look for yer honour there be not boat on coast must get through breaker there go even above noise of storm loud cry be heard crash of breaking timber a with shock main mizzen mast weakened by loss of foremast went over side next great wave drove vessel forward two three fathom be last move considine said rock will be through bottom now be off boy shouted running up who be off considine asked young squire larry doolan off where mr davenant exclaimed off in curragh yer honour tim connolly helped carry round nose launched there there be sure can see for party rushed out from shelter there quarter of mile along on right small boat be seen making way over wave be jabers yer honour have done boatman said a mr davenant gave cry of alarm did think of curragh if have must not have be launched here mr walter have hit on only place where there be chance under shelter of nose might be done nowhere else nose be formidable reef of rock running off from point trending to south many ship have gone ashore on jagged edge with wind from northeast formed somewhat of shelter be under lee that walter larry have launched curragh curragh be still found on irish coast be boat whose greatest width be at stern so much so that look like boat cut in two floor be almost flat rise so much to bow three four foot be entirely out of water be roughly built by mean fast be wonderfully good sea boat for size can live in sea must swamp boat of ordinary build walter have with assistance of larry doolan built boat for going out fishing be extremely light being mere framework covered with tarred canvas a soon a walter have reached village found that fisherman considered that boat must possibly be put out have found held consultation with larry do think curragh must go out larry not yer honour must just be broke up like eggshell with breaker might float if got beyond larry might larry agreed seeing how light be well will go with larry sure must go anywhere with yer honour must never get out be thinking larry that if carry along beyond nose might find calmer there well might larry agreed at rate can try so calling together two three other boy have lifted light boat carried with oar along shore until got beyond nose even here be formidable business to launch for although rock broke full force of sea throwing spray hundred of foot up in air wave poured through interval dashed over lower rock in such mass formidable wave rolled in to shore after much consultation boy agreed that best plan be to scramble out on rock a far a possible so a to launch boat beyond break of surf be hazardous enterprise whole party be several time nearly washed into water a struggled out at last reached spot beyond must go no farther a deep passage be here broken in rock be now beyond line of breaker after several vain effort to launch boat in of narrowly escaped destruction agreed that only plan be after wave passed to drop on to flat rock then showed above water to jump into two boy on shore be to hold head rope to prevent being dashed towards land by next wave while larry worked with oar to get away from ridge moment wave have passed under head rope be to be thrown off plan be carried out two boy have just time to jump into boat get out oar when next wave lifted boat high on crest lad holding rope be nearly torn from rock held on till strain ceased then threw in rope walter larry bent to oar row easy larry walter said a next wave passed under put head to wave terrible a be sea curragh floated buoyantly over though several time a rose to steep wave walter thought that must be thrown right over worst part of task be over when got beyond end of nose for up to point be forced to row across course of wave continually to turn boat to face great mass of water ran between rock once beyond end of reef turned head north rowed straight towards ship have struck master walter larry said glancing over shoulder mast be gone lay out then larry there be time to lose in spite of effort boat moved slowly through water for wind caught high bow with such force at time needed strength skill to keep head straight at last be close to ship already showed sign of breaking up ranged up alongside of fasten line to keg throw in walter shouted in minute keg be thrown overboard with line attached a soon a drifted little way from vessel side hauled into boat now back larry wave must sink in moment if turn stern to wreck lay within hundred yard of shore boat backed until close to line where wave toppled over in torrent of foam now larry keep steady be a near a dare go then walter stood up in boat took keg foot two of line in hand waited till next wave passed under boat swung keg round head hurled towards shore then dropped into seat gave two three vigorous stroke when safely beyond line of breaker sat quiet watched result have missed first time said look be going to run into surf for group on shore joined hand next time keg be borne forward in tumble of foam considine ran forward seized back rush took from foot others held on before next wave came line be safely on beach strong cable be soon pulled ashore firmly fixed light line be attached to sailor at once began to pas along will turn back now master walter will keep near wreck for few minute longer larry ca hold together long maybe can pick somebody up vessel be indeed breaking up fast stern be burst in wave a poured in at opening smashed up deck many of crew have be washed overboard have instantly disappeared a boat approached wreck officer who have climbed shroud shouted out will boat hold yes walter shouted back will hold two more will try swim to officer said threw off long cloak in be wrapped unbuckled sword let drop unbuttoned took off military coat with difficulty got rid of high boot can come bit nearer shouted dare walter said touch from one of floating timber must send to bottom officer waved hand then sprang head foremost into sea so long be in water walter began to think must have struck against something be not coming up again when suddenly appeared within twenty yard of boat rowed towards instantly must get in over stern walter said officer be perfectly cool placing hand on stern drew partly over walter grasping hand dragged in sooner be in than walter again hailed wreck can carry one more who be still on board be huddled up in bow waiting turn for rope there be big un coming now larry exclaimed will finish wave towering far above fellow be indeed approaching higher higher rose there be wild cry from wreck a surged over when have passed sea be covered with floating timber vessel be gone can hing now walter said dare go in among wreckage who get hold of floating plank will drift ashore now larry back quietly let drift down round nose must keep head to wave ten minute be abreast of reef a soon a be past gave word rowed along under shelter to point where have embarked now sir walter said will back up to rock when be close enough must jump be safely accomplished now larry row alongside when next wave come must scramble out a well a can by time help be at hand boat have be anxiously watched from shore when on disappearance of wreck be seen to be making way back to nose mr davenant with considine priest boy who have assisted in getting afloat hurried along shore to meet rest of fisherman remaining behind to aid who might be washed up from wreck a soon a be seen that intended to land at spot where have started considine mr davenant made way along rock joined officer just a leapt ashore boat came alongside on top of wave a sank grazed rock capsized walter larry grasped hand stretched out to be hauled on to rock while next wave dashed curragh in fragment on beach chapter for james william dear walter father exclaimed a embraced son a scrambled on shore have behaved like hero indeed ought to have done too larry deserve sound thrashing for fright have given may have frightened sir officer said assuredly owe life to brave lad have scarcely thanked yet for indeed until felt foot on rock have small hope of reaching shore safely in cock boat of theirs after feeling that great ship so helpless against wave seemed impossible that mere eggshell must float over name sir be colonel l'estrange at service name be davenant colonel be truly glad that son have rescued sooner be up at place better sir be weather for standing talking in shirtsleeve now made way along rock back to shore then hurried to village there learned that six men have succeeded in getting to shore along rope before vessel broke up telling larry have best have glass of hot spirit then turn into bed at once that be to come up to house first thing in morning mr davenant with priest colonel l'estrange walter made way up to house to men who have reached shore have be already taken party be met at door by mr davenant who have be extremely anxious for godfrey have be sent home by father a soon a wreck went to piece have brought news of walter doings up to time be quite safe katherine mr davenant said must stop to scold praise at present hurry off walter get between blanket will bring up hot spiced wine directly katherine be colonel l'estrange whom walter have brought ashore in boat will excuse at present for have be for hour exposed to storm must be half frozen a well a half drowned now colonel if will come along with will find bed with hot blanket ready doubt not blazing fire ah here be spiced wine take draught of before go upstairs can have after be in bed three more survivor from wreck be presently brought up have be washed ashore on plank a indeed have many others rest have be beaten to death against rock by breaker walter slept late next morning when came downstairs found that others have already finished breakfast when have eaten meal listened to gentle scolding mother gave for risking life joined father who be with colonel l'estrange pacing backwards forward on terrace in front of house first fury of storm be over still blew strongly very heavy sea be running ah young friend colonel l'estrange said advancing be glad to see to be able to thank more warmly than be able to do last night when very word seemed frozen on lip for having saved life be gallant deed one father may well be proud of showed not only bravery of highest kind coolness judgment be virtue even more rare predict brilliant future for if in way aid may be of use to believe will be at service be well be good swimmer sir walter said for must not have helped if have not be able to help for sea be covered with piece of wreck a boat be only covered with canvas slightest touch from one of jagged end must have made hole in be very much obliged to for kind offer of assistance at present have not made up mind what be to be have father indeed walter have told that must like at rate for time to see something of world before settling down here for life be easy matter to say what be best for to do ireland offer little field for anyone ambition since king james came to throne especially since tyrconnell became governor thing have be little more favourable for have hope yet justice will be done to catholic population of unhappy country be not monstrous colonel l'estrange that very men who have hand in rebellion against king charles first must still be in possession during reign of son of land be taken from father because be loyal to king so be over ireland descendant of cromwell men lord in home of who be faithful to king charles certainly seems so sir colonel l'estrange said be politician be simply soldier obey order own that doe seem cruel injustice that great portion of land of country must be held by descendant of cromwell soldier while lawful owner whose only fault be that be loyal to king must still be dispossessed of think better time be coming mr davenant said there can be doubt of king leaning towards religion have be restrained from carrying goodwill towards into effect by privy councillor by english party here whose interest be to prevent change being made who constantly misrepresent feeling of country from day when strongbow first landed island have be prey of adventurer whose only object have be to wrest land from native population be descendant of one of early english settler mr davenant be true enough mr davenant said smiling doubt be a bad a rest of see have held land for century now like other descendant of strongbow men have come to look at matter from irish point of view rather than english however hope for better time have heard news then about prince of orange what be news mr davenant asked there have be rumour for year that intended to make bid for english throne have heard nothing else there be report before left london that have already sailed from holland colonel l'estrange replied indeed have doubt rumour be well founded will never succeed mr davenant said eagerly will be put down a easily a monmouth be know colonel l'estrange said gravely protestant feeling in england be very strong monmouth be vain empty headed wrecked own cause dutchman be different sort of man altogether one thing be certain if king james can make mess of matter be sure to do so stuart have always be feeble indecisive james be most feeble indecisive of if william succeeds in effecting landing think chance of success be good one may reign in england mr davenant broke in passionately will not reign in ireland forgive broke off forgot for moment that be englishman guest need not apologize mr davenant a said be soldier politician ancestor be royalist have great love for dutch stadtholder who will be supported in england by class who rose against king charles at same time be difficult to feel much enthusiasm for stuart first be pedant second threw away chance over over again by duplicity want of faith third be utterly selfish unprincipled fourth be gloomy bigot charles be james be pensioner of france how can men be ready to sacrifice everything for such race a be not way in look at in ireland mr davenant said war here be waged under various pretence someone be goaded into rebellion false charge be preferred wholesale there be religious pretext know what be at bottom of simply greed of english adventurer for irish land not content with having dispossessed ancient owner of three fourth of cultivated land of country want remainder under pretence that descendant of early settler be in sympathy with irish neighbour have marked out for destruction already great portion of estate be in hand of cromwell men so gross have be abuse that commission king appointed to inquire into seizure of estate only ventured to sit one day for proof brought forward be so overwhelmingly strong that be seen at once did inquiry continue must be made manifest to world justice must be satisfied by nothing le than clear sweep of men who have seized estate if ireland rise in favour of king james will not be for love for stuart will be to recover land have be illegally wrested from if dutch william whig adherent gain upper hand will be taken from forever religious element will of course count for much already have suffered persecution for religion if whig must have way must stamp out utterly with fire sword thing have looked better during last five six year than have done since cromwell first put foot in ireland have begun to hope for justice tyrconnell have stood up for with goodwill of james have gained many concession have now what never have before irish army land thief have be fairly alarmed for have seen that long delayed justice will be done at last many have sold back land to original owner have left country others be only holding out for better term ten year of james reign thing must have righted if dutchman ascends throne of england there be hope for ireland save in sword well must hope will not come to colonel l'estrange said be ready to fight battle of england on continent civil war with horror sickens civil war here be not like civil war in england there be race animosity there memory of cruel wrong on one side other men fought for principle there be atrocity committed on side like have devastated peasant ploughed land trader kept open shop unmolested be true that towards end there be confiscation of property of who still continued strife few execution of individual taking a whole war have ever caused so little suffering to people at large a did civil war in england assuredly war in ireland now like have gone before must be marked by foulest atrocity massacre destruction on side yes mr davenant said must own for downright brutal bloody ferocity war in ireland rival of hun walter have listened in silence to conversation father now turned to have heard whether larry have recovered from adventure of yesterday a well a have father have not heard anything about came out here directly finished breakfast how

do a to yesterday just came because young squire tould to thankful be that got back safe to shore for if have be drowned know must have said to squire two day after shipwreck walter john whitefoot met at place have agreed on when last saw other four day before heard of brave deed on night of storm walter everyone be talking of even grandfather who have seldom good word for of at castle said that be noble deed be a much a must to say 'yes be friend of mine ' for felt proud of can tell be nonsense john have often be out in curragh in bad weather though never in quite such storm a once launched rode lightly enough scarce shipped spoonful of water must like to have be there john said must have be use people have always be against going down to sea deeming pure waste of time except that let go down to swim can do well know have always forbidden going out in boat now see be proved that be not waste of time for have be able to save many life thought must make very happy well know that doe particularly walter said carelessly of course be glad at time have not thought much about one way other since see news have come have driven everything else out of head be true then report that heard yesterday that william of orange have set out for england yes be true enough be afraid by what hear that be likely to cause sort of trouble suppose john said gravely of course in matter people think differently from yours know agreed that must never talk on subject be afraid time be coming when there will be nothing else to be talked of be afraid so too john father think that there will be civil war again of course grandfather be delighted john said quietly have be greatly disturbed in mind for month owing to leaning of king james towards irish seem to point to having to give up small portion of land thought so too john although be father who must lose mine who must gain think that even can deny that must be reasonable grandfather got land from mine because fought for cromwell against king cromwell got best of well seems only reasonable that when king again came to throne who fought for must get own again doe seem so walter must own be sure must not have cared for if land be given back again to father tomorrow then suppose must go back to england a know grandfather have done well have laid by good deal of money must take farm there there must be more chance of letting enter upon handicraft must rather that by great deal than farming book have lent walter have shown what great noble deed there be to be done in world mean in fighting know in other way make life here toiling on farm from sunrise to sunset with object save that of laying by year more money seem terribly empty worthless by way grandfather be yesterday evening rating father because instead of always keeping hard at work allowed once twice week to be away for hour wasting time mean though did know going about with father said stoutly that did not think time be altogether wasted for in last two year have made notable advance in learning be satisfied that have benefited much by interval of recreation thereupon grandfather grumbled be too fond of reading be filling mind with sort of nonsense whereas true wisdom be to be found in one book only father said be true of religious wisdom that for advancement of world be needed that men must learn other thing of course grandfather have three four text ready at hand father have by saying 'you see father command issued to jew be not strictly applicable to for example be ordered not to use horse remember cromwell felt that be doing wrong when raised ironside be poser so matter dropped ten day later when boy met john said be last time will meet for time walter for be going up to derry to stay with cousin of father who be settled there exercise trade of currier said month ago must like to learn trade everyone be against then seemed to think that a must day have land be flying in face of providence to think of anything else suppose fact that everything be so unsettled now that there be saying what may come of event in england may have made think differently at rate father said to yesterday 'we have be talking over what said about wishing to learn trade if go on well there be occasion for to learn business save that of farming none can say what lord may not have in store for what trouble may come upon in case will do harm to see little of world outside farm therefore grandfather have settled that will go for few month to cousin who a know be currier in derry have often written asking to go stay with seeing that have child of own learn what can of business if must be that find more to liking than farming must not be one to hold back from following bent of inclination be between father idea on subject know must cause much trouble did think that have idea of not following in path in have trod to seems better that must go on path towards mind be turned be when have made quite sure after long reflection prayer that be idle whim settled earnest desire if then after visit to uncle feel that be truly called to follow life other than that must lead here will not oppose lord have blessed labour land be fertile can well provide money will be needful to start either in business with cousin in such way a may appear best thanked gravely indeed walter have difficulty in restraining from shouting with joy for life like of father grandfather here must be very grievous to have desire to gain greater wealth than have long for higher life than know john walter said doubtfully unless a say trouble make difference will be large landowner day bitterness will die out in time will take very different position from grandfather hold of course regard a usurper know in third generation grandson of usurper becomes legitimate monarch ancestor usurped land from native irish by sword just a grandfather did from came in time to be regarded a natural lord of soil so will to be currier strike a tremendous come down care nothing about coming up coming down john said simply long only for honest mode of life in instead of dwelling solitary seeing one from year to year save at sabbath meeting may mix with others take part in more active busy life in suppose that trade of currier be very pleasant one that matter little if when work be done one have leisure for sort of communication with others for improving one mind will be to something like what going to court in london must be to walter be most grieved about mother will miss sorely said to last night fear somewhat john that course have taken with have greatly unfitted for settling down here a have done before although will miss sadly blame for what have done think son that there be higher life than spent in tilling soil from boyhood to old age be true soil must be tilled there must be ever hewer of wood drawer of water god have appointed for place think son that have within must render life with father grandfather have be well contented irksome one for ' have fear that will be always separated grandfather be old man when lord plea to take father will be free to do a choose can if like dispose of land quit troubled country settle in england elsewhere near where may be be true that will get little for land for broad a be acre who will give much for doubtful title there be ample laid by for old age see not sense of labouring incessantly a doe grandfather merely to lay up store will never enjoy did see sign of decrease in bitter animosity party feel towards other here might think differently there be prospect of peace goodwill returning in time therefore object in father toiling on for rest of life when return of labour will be of little worth to such being so regret that thought turn to world of have read in book world be secondary consideration to be true can see special goodness in life of dull monotony wonder where mother got hold of idea john be so different from most of people be indeed john agreed be from mother that received teaching know be not happy with husband who be a gloomy fanatical a be grandfather ever looked back to happy day of girlhood in england think did for mother just what mother have done for only difference be that never have sufficient influence with husband to enable to carry out view for daughter while mother have managed to have own way walter laughed suppose so that in spite of grandfather certainly owe everything to for be sure if have be for father must never have ventured to oppose old man even so far a to let know make one sad to think walter religion must sometimes make who think most of tyrant in family grandfather be terribly earnest in religion there be pretence mistake about for rather because of must if must allow one else to have will opinion of own think be religion john manner of religion mother grandmother be a religious a anyone must be think ever heard of say hard word of soul religion be pleasure to not task know that year ago when have priest who be always denouncing protestant very soon managed to get changed for what funny thing be to be sure that people must quarrel about religion after believe same important thing a to others what doe matter provided do best in way seems right to be too liberal for john have be brought up in too strait sect to subscribe to opinion a do think make difference walter said slowly walter said be just matter of bringing up if have be born in castle have be born in place must have thought a do must have thought a do of course still more if have be born in catholic country like italy where must never have heard of protestantism have be born in protestant country like holland where must never have have chance of becoming catholic very few people ever change religion just live die a have be born educated seems so john said after pause question be too deep for quite so walter laughed want to argue well when be going to start be off tomorrow morning father have acquaintance in dublin who be starting for derry be to go in charge for hour boy chatted together then with mutual promise of writing regularly whenever have chance said goodbye following morning john started with father to dublin next day journeyed north towards derry chapter king in ireland on th of november vessel arrived in dublin with news that william of orange have landed at torbay on th news created wildest excitement protestant who have be deeply depressed by apparent intention of james to hand back to original owner land have be wrested from now took heart began openly to arm upon other hand catholic felt that if william whig succeeded to chief power in faith remaining property life be alike menaced too prepared to fight to last for held dear walter rode several time with father into dublin street presented strange spectacle be crowded with protestant fugitive from country district have forsaken flocked into dublin fearing that irish must retaliate for past grievance by general massacre bank of liffey be crowded by fugitive who with tear cry besought captain of vessel lying there to give passage to england sort of rumour of bloodshed massacre destruction circulated through city protestant in north be said to have fallen upon catholic population to have put to sword while in south west be said catholic have taken same measure against protestant report be equally false be generally believed added to panic dismay in fact however party be waiting protestant dared not commence hostility until assured that william be firmly seated on english throne ready to come to assistance catholic be equally desirous to maintain peace until assured that hope remained save sword month after john whitefoot have left walter received letter from dear friend walter will have heard doubt of trouble have arisen here father sent here to learn trade at present men mind be so agitated that there be talk save of arm of fighting kinsman be a bad a others spends day going hither thither among townsfolk have be made officer in one of six company have be raised here pay further heed to business town be mightily divided younger more zealous spirit be for fighting while almost older wealthier citizen be opposed to be how trouble began earl of tyrconnell sent a know three thousand soldier to help king james at first news of landing of prince to do so withdrew regiment be in garrison in town on th of month of december people here heard that regiment of earl of antrim be approaching town to take place of troop when news arrived there be sort of panic in town news be spread that regiment be intended to massacre people why must be know can not think that alarm be false one however regiment arrived on river bank of officer crossed entered city when be in council with of leading citizen party of apprentice with of rabble shut gate for time there be great debate older citizen be mostly in favour of admitting earl regiment why asked must derry alone defy power of tyrconnell king james if king william made cause good came over to ireland to aid protestant must be time enough for men of derry to join to fight for faith if now stood alone must do good to cause of king william must bring destruction on city argument be of avail apprentice young men of town fugitive who have come in from country round be for fighting so gate be kept shut lord antrim seeing that must hing against strong place a derry marched away with regiment seems to fair account of what have happened what will come of know not being protestant feeling must incline to side of william yet seems to that friend here have acted hastily in thus adventuring against force of king james sore trouble be like to come upon town however be not for to judge be a warm a of in defence of religion will try to do best in case of need be sorry dear walter that have to take different side in quarrel of course be of opinion of elder must not blame other for what be indeed not of own choosing be fair city standing on rising ground by stately river with strong wall at other time life must be very pleasant here although living among so many people seems strange to after life on farm hear sort of tale about fighting in other part of slaughter of protestant by rapparees know not whether be true a cousin who be earnest man be wholly taken up with present affair business be at stand have little to do spend much of time by river side have taken to fishing like mightily yesterday caught fish weighing three pound have for dinner often wish be with write long letter tell that be doing affectionate friend john whitefoot indeed throughout ireland preparation for war be going on over north protestant be banding in arm under excuse of outrage committed by few isolated party of peasant known a rapparees be everywhere harrying catholic carrying fire sword into quiet village burning slaying carrying off grain cattle throughout whole of ulster charlemont carrickfergus alone remained in hand of king james troop england scotland have now accepted william a king james have fled to france with exception of ulster ireland remained staunch to king james in south lord inshiquin in connaught lord kingston have raised corp among protestant settler for william be first to commence hostility latter marching north made attack on carrickfergus tyrconnell now issued commission to several of catholic nobility gentry to raise troop for king service a people responded to call readily fifty regiment of foot several troop of horse be soon raised though men be forthcoming in abundance there be great want of arm munition of war there be in government store only twenty thousand arm most of be old weapon have be returned to store a unserviceable only about thousand musket be found to be of use there be artillery ammunition money with necessary must be purchased abroad gentry must have willingly contributed have be well nigh ruined by confiscation of property must do little towards filling treasury never did nation enter upon war so badly provided with necessary a did ireland when resolved to adhere to cause of king to resist power of england scotland aided by of holland protestant state of germany mr davenant have be one of first to respond to invitation of tyrconnell have set about raising troop of horse have difficulty in getting number of men in bray surrounding village difficulty in mounting be overcome by patriotism of sundry gentleman citizen of dublin who willingly contributed spare horse to king service arm be various have sword short pike while few only have pistol smith everywhere toiled hard converting scythe reaping hook into sword pike before be ready to take field whole troop be provided with sword walter have eagerly begged father to appoint cornet of troop mr davenant might have yielded have not be for wife entreaty even old mr davenant intensely loyal a be to cause of james sided with daughter in law of course fergus will do duty to king must indeed be shame for davenant to hold back at walter age there can be occasion for a yet to take commission be ready to give son a gave husband to king when walter becomes man too must go if duty demand for present assuredly there be reason why boy must mix up in unhappy struggle besides if aught befalls be to that mother will have to look in future there be hundred thousand of strong active men in ireland necessity have not yet come for boy to take field so walter to intense disappointment be refused cornetcy of troop father who fully entered into feeling finally told that when troop took field must accompany be not to carry arm walter to mix up in way with will be sort of camp follower know will see go on will be able to prepare to take place in rank if war must unhappily go on for time with walter have to be satisfied indeed although somewhat disappointed at not being at once allowed to join troop felt sure that must not be very long before father once away from influence of wife mother must allow to join may take larry with father must look after horse must be useful to for running message sort of thing want to go very much see uncle two three of cousin have joined troop must have joined too if have not thought too young worst of larry be that be always getting into scrape together mr davenant said with smile must not get into scrape on business a walter said indignantly be serious affair of course going with must be very particular yes a long a be close by walter however mind taking larry must a say be useful will want somebody to look after horse act a servant may be separated sometimes for troop may be sent on detached service when must not take with permission to take larry quite reconciled walter to downfall of hope of going a cornet in high spirit hastened down to village to tell larry that father have consented to accompanying through january mr davenant be busy drilling troop throughout ireland party be preparing for storm be soon to burst lord mountjoy protestant nobleman be sent with regiment consisted for most part of protestant to derry held meeting with leading townspeople who agreed to admit protestant soldier upon condition that more troop be sent accordingly protestant troop under colonel lundy entered town lord mountjoy assumed governorship tyrconnell soon perceived that have made mistake in sending mountjoy to derry for instead of overawing inhabitant regiment have in fact become part of rebel garrison therefore recalled mountjoy sent over to france on pretence of embassy to king james a soon a arrived there be treacherously thrown into prison people of derry received quantity of powder arm from scotland on th of february prince of orange be formally proclaimed king in derry example be followed throughout ulster be in fact beginning of war anxious to save ireland from horror of civil war lord granard other protestant nobleman of council joined tyrconnell in issuing proclamation ordering protestant corp to lay down arm a did not obey lieutenant general hamilton be despatched to north with thousand regular troop considerable number of irregular came up with insurgent at dromore defeated with great slaughter rallied at hillsborough again be defeated scattered hamilton divided force marching through north reduced ulster to submission with exception only of fortified town of enniskillen derry in south general m'carty be equally successful in clearing munster of william adherent defeated lord inshiquin in encounter on th of march mr davenant who have ridden into dublin returned in evening with news that king have landed at kinsale two day before with fifteen hundred irish troop in pay of france hundred french officer intended to aid in drilling new levy be glad indeed that have arrived for have be met on sea by english fleet hope might have be dashed at blow now that be with will rouse enthusiasm of people to utmost if be wise will surely be able to unite ireland under save of course fanatic of north who however can hing against whole strength of country since hamilton little force alone have be sufficient to put down opposition save where remain shut up behind wall of derry enniskillen be not with that have to cope alone must be utterly powerless be with army of england scotland will have to fight unfortunately have fleet can land wherever choose now king be really among who have hitherto wavered will join let england scotland choose king a will there be reason why ireland must desert rightful monarch at bidding when will king arrive at dublin father go first to cork walter tyrconnell have set out will meet there say will be here in about ten day time french ambassador marquis d'avaux come with many french noble do think father will at once order that friend will receive land again be taken from by cromwell soldier hope not boy be interest not own must think of now if ireland be to resist successfully english continental troop of dutch william must be united must be irishman first catholic protestant afterwards trust that will issue such proclamation a will allay alarm of protestant bind together king james be not like father in single case since came to throne have broken royal word once given therefore may feel confidence in promise may make have of course hope that anything can say will influence fanatic of derry enniskillen can afford to disregard be entailing misery suffering upon without slightest benefit to cause advocate if beat english of course place must finally surrender if english beat will get dutch william a king without effort on part think that will be very unwise to attempt anything against two place people there can shut up in wall a long a like by so doing can in way harm if take town will only add to bad blood already exists better by far leave to until main battle be fought out on rd news came that king be to arrive in dublin next day mr davenant a be now called captain davenant went over with gentry of neighbourhood to meet king james be received with enthusiasm address be presented to by several public body by clergy of established church answer to address gave satisfaction to promised favour protection to established protestant church issued invitation to protestant who have fled kingdom to return to home assured of safety particular care commanded that with exception of military catholic must carry arm in dublin finally summoned parliament to meet in dublin on th of may one day messenger arrived with despatch for captain davenant be to move into dublin tomorrow walter said when read be to take field at once king be going to march in command of against derry think majesty be wrong know tyrconnell have argued strongly against intention there be three reason against first a told think be better to leave derry alone until main issue be settled secondly king james have military experience if ought go wrong with expedition will lose prestige thirdly although be well for to be with army when fight foreign foe be better that must not lead against men who be however much may rebel against own subject know tyrconnell have set forth objection to unhappily obstinacy be fault of stuart race generally happens that be most obstinate when most wrong however trust that when derry see so strong force marching against will open gate without resistance siege can only entail horrible suffering on town that suffering will in end tell against james cause for will excite sympathy of protestant in england scotland make hotter to conquer ireland following day troop be mustered in front of castle after tender farewell to wife mother captain davenant placed at head rode off quarter of hour later walter with larry doolan on rough little pony by side rode after troop dublin be reached in afternoon town presented festive appearance principal street be still draped with flag have be hung out at king entry five day before street be thronged with people for loyalist have come in from

cheered by crowd a passed through town to spot assigned to in camp of force gathered near city walter larry rode short distance behind troop joined a soon a reached ground allotted to be brave sight father be not to see city decked out people cheering for king dublin be setting fine example be must not set much weight upon cheering of crowd walter say that people of dublin may not at present moment be loyal to king if be defeated be to march in must see that must cheer just a heartily mob of london cheered king james a passed through week before be so ill advised a to fly threw up hat for joy fortnight later for william boy there be dependence on mob worship success king who be present be sure to be vastly more dear to than king who be absent now have better help larry picket horse put

made to make comfortable few only of officer have tent for a well a other necessary of war be wanting troop who have for little time be in camp there have raised sort of shelter from weather have constructed little hut of turf thatched with straw rush others have erected little tent of sailcloth obtained from shipping others of blanket coarse linen cloak other article on must lay hand be in high spirit at prospect of termination of monotony of continued drill of commencement of active campaigning huge fire blazed everywhere country for distance round have be completely stripped of wood everywhere be life bustle men be cleaning arm preparatory to march of next day others be cooking at fire trooper be grooming horse snatch of song loud laughter rose in air after wandering about for hour walter rejoined father captain davenant be sitting with two officer of troop lieutenant o'driscoll cornet heron by fire material for three trooper who acted a servant have collected there be

toast then continued meal three chicken vanished rapidly trooper kept horn filled with claret if always do a well a captain davenant said a finished meal will have reason to grumble fear that be too much to expect bring pipe tobacco larry will find in holster of saddle fergus do undo truss lay straw out even will do now lad will find plenty more provision in wallet do go get own supper then give eye to horse will not want anything more for two three hour three officer walter sat chatting by fire occasionally piling on fresh log gradually din of voice in camp died away bright fire burned down think have better turn in captain davenant said at last must be astir hour before daylight for march a soon a be light rolling in long cloak lay down upon straw be time before walter got to sleep novelty of situation strangeness of lying with night air blowing in face made unusually wakeful occasionally too laugh from party who be sitting late round fire attracted attention sound of snorting pawing of horse also kept awake at last too went off to sleep in spite of warm cloak felt stiff chilled when sound of trumpet drum roused camp well walter how do like sleeping in open father said a rose to foot shook mind sleeping father waking be not so pleasant however will soon get accustomed to suppose always did hate getting up in dark even when be going out fishing wo always get a comfortable bed a walter so expect time will come ere long when will look back upon a absolute luxury be not likely to get straw night can tell now fergus bring wallet here must breakfast before get in saddle walter came to conclusion that breakfast eaten in dark be very inferior meal to dinner before great fire however kept thought to a soon a have finished went to aid larry in saddling horse suppose can ride with today said a mounted yes there will not be military display by way many of soldier have got nothing in way of uniform at present so can ride with if general officer come along must draw off little drop behind with larry who will follow in rear of troop a soon a daylight appeared bugle gave signal force preceded by cavalry started on march towards north chapter siege of derry there be air of excitement in street of derry knot of people be gathered talking excitedly woman stood at door of house while men moved aimlessly restlessly about between group listened for time to speaker then moved on again work of strengthening defence have gone on incessantly for last three month have ceased while number of person be gathered on wall looking anxiously towards south general air of gloom despondency hung over place storm derry have braved be gathering around at last king james troop be advancing against opinion be strongly divided in city almost without exception older citizen deprecated resistance wall indeed be strong position formidable king have artillery worth speaking of wall manned by brave men might well for definite time resist assault store of food must not long support large population now gathered in town there seemed possibility whatever of assistance from england before horror of famine must be upon to what purpose then oppose resistance must even if successful cause frightful suffering to inhabitant if unsuccessful must hand over city to vengeance of james garrison have be strengthened by two regiment vast quantity of supply including everything there be provision for ten day a many week might elapse before assistance must come younger more ardent spirit be for resistance to last better said die of hunger than surrender protestant stronghold to papist hour brought crowd of fugitive inhabitant of village deserting home at approach of royal force flying with what good must carry to derry archdeacon hamilton have arrived with message from king offering if city must within four day surrender there must be amnesty to for past offence that property of inhabitant must be respected proposition be now being considered by governor council together with principal officer of english regiment john whitefoot have be out day have just returned to cousin house be crowded with fugitive a tanner have friend connection in village have opened door to who sought shelter until room be filled be pitiful sight to see woman with baby in arm child gathered round sitting forlornly almost indifferent to momentous consultation be going on thinking only of deserted home wondering what have befallen men have for most part be out in street gathering news tanner wife assisted by two three of woman be busy at great fire on hearth over hung huge pot in porridge be being prepared one by one men dropped in news have yet be heard a to decision of council be dark when tanner entered face be stern pale be settled said shortly council have broken up have just spoken to one of member officer be unanimously in favour of accepting term of james exclamation of anger broke from of men can not say aught against tanner said though heart feel well nigh broken have only men here must say let fight to last look at woman child think what thousand thousand of be in town truly can not blame council that have decided not to bring terrible suffering upon city lord will provide for own minister who have come in with flock said friend have looked for better thing from thought that be steadfast in cause of lord now that time of trouble come fall away at once remember how sennacherib host died before jerusalem can not lord protect londonderry likewise age of miracle be past tanner said did not see in germany how magdeburg other protestant city be destroyed with inhabitant by papist brother williams wicked be suffered to work will here when be stronger than godly must look for miracle be ready to fight have council decided otherwise must have done share to last heart sickens a look round on woman weak ailing did james demand that must renounce religion must say let die by sword famine rather than consent have offered toleration to that none will suffer for have be done that property a well a life of will be respected truly seems to that resistance must be not bravery sort of madness there be promise of aid from england how long may have to wait for there be ten day provision in town if english officer of king william think that resistance be hopeless why must who know nought of war set against because have not faith minister said must have faith because think only of carnal weapon must trust to lord remember leyden how help came when seemed lost do tanner replied remember how woman child suffered died how dropped in street perished with famine in house remember shrink from saying 'let resist to end must rejoice if have decided that derry must be deserted that woman child must be sent away to shelter in mountain of donegal that man must march out do combat with army of james be numerous far better armed than papist victory might be ours be otherwise be man fated to fall on field must still say let march forward be not death that fear seeing weak helpless one suffer must not envy feeling of men who decided on resistance when time came that woman child be dying of hunger around there be time to fight time to sheath sword to wait until chance of drawing successfully again arrives methinks that having such good term offered present be time for waiting preacher waved hand impatiently wrapping in cloak left house without word next day capitulation be signed following day army of james be seen approaching presently halted on hill within cannon shot of town londonderry stand in bend of river foyle position army took up at once isolated from surrounding country offer of capitulation have already be sent out to general hamilton by captain white bearer receiving instruction to stipulate that army must not advance within four mile of town until be ready to hand over city in meantime general rosen who be in chief command of army stationed so a to extend from one corner of bend of river to other so to cut off communication between city surrounding country in course of day country gentleman named murray made way through line with body of cavalry rode up to gate of town governor refused to open in spite of order of townspeople opened gate murray rode into town going from point to point exhorted people not to surrender to resist to last accusing governor council of foul treachery in thus handing over city confusion excitement in street be now great while be going on governor sent trumpeter to king requiring one hour time before city must surrender rosen took notice of believing that be arranged rode forward with king portion of army murray exhortation passionate harangue have effect number of townspeople ran to wall loading cannon opened with musket heavy fire on approaching troop several of soldier be killed among be captain troy who be riding close to king astonished at unexpected resistance troop drew back a be entirely without mean of making assault upon city governor council at once sent archdeacon hamilton to royal camp to excuse for what have happened to explain that firing be action of turbulent body of men whom be unable to restrain whom represented a drunken rebel better class of citizen said be resolved to surrender dutifully be doing must to persuade common people to do same a royal artillery have not yet arrived james drew off troop to saint johnston murray with body of horse went out skirmished with returned into town on hearing that council still intended to surrender again harangued people eight thousand men assembled on parade after listening to passionate harangue declared that must resist to last at once chose preacher named walker mr baker a joint governor appointed murray a general in field divided into eight regiment took entire control of city into hand archdeacon hamilton lundy several of principal citizen at once left town in disguise be allowed to pas through besieging army john whitefoot have be present at event have taken place day although have quite agreed with cousin that resistance must do good to cause must entail fearful suffering on besieged be carried away by general enthusiasm shouted a loudly a in reply to exhortation of murray tanner be also present john be by side saw that be deeply moved by speech did not join in acclamation when be over laid hand on john shoulder die be cast boy be glad that act voice of mine have have aught to do with bringing about that weight of what be to come will not rest upon conscience now that be decided will not be one to draw back will do share with what strength lord have given may join one of regiment too john asked be young be a strong a many men be better not at present john before end come arm can bear weapon may be needed at present there be reason why must do so doubtless plenty of work will be found for younger hand besides absolute fighting think not that there will be much fighting save against famine wall be strong have well nigh forty piece of cannon while say that james have six piece most of be small methinks then that will not even attempt to take city by storm why must waste men in doing so when can starve out be famine have to fight in sort of war think that james have in ireland cannon sufficient to batter down wall ten day will bring provision to end will be with a with leyden have only to suffer wait if be god will succour will come in time if not must even perish with spirit somewhat damped by cousin view of case john returned with to house must willingly enough have gone out to fight against besieger thought of long slow agony of starvation be naturally terrible to lad of good health appetite mob of derry have shown good sense in choice made of governor baker indeed who be military man be mere cipher in matter walker be in reality sole governor be man of energy judgment a well a enthusiastic fanatical at once gave evidence of fitness for post set diligently to work to establish order in town issued order that unable to bear arm who wished to leave town must do so while able bodied men now formed into regiment be assigned man place regiment quarter on wall le than thirty thousand fugitive exclusive of garrison be shut up in wall of derry army be besieging town numbered twenty thousand gun of besieger soon opened fire on wall replied briskly besieger threw up work carried on siege languidly feeling sure famine must ere long force town to surrender fearing perhaps to engage fresh ill trained levy against multitude animated by desperate resolution religious fanaticism of defender of town now that die be once cast there be longer difference of opinion among inhabitant class joined enthusiastically in measure for defence provision in town be given into one common store to be doled out in regular ration so made to last a long a possible a ration be from first extremely small suffering of besieged really began from first day john whitefoot found that there be little for to do spent much of time on wall watching throwing up of work by besieger regular cannonade be now kept up on side though shot occasionally fell inside town danger to

help poor lad if must fall into hand of people let mention name rosen must doubt disapprove of can not help that irish gentleman in army must agree that have done rightly even if did own conscience must be quite sufficient for to act upon be fighting against king enemy not warring against woman child how soundly poor lad sleep how changed be be mere skeleton must not have known in least if be condition into strong healthy lad have fallen must woman child have suffered wish kirk have not turned coward have landed troop must then have brought up scattered force must have fought in fair field with something like equal force must have be vastly more to taste than starving like rat in hole chapter relief of derry be late in afternoon before john woke started up a eye fell upon captain

captain davenant said a rode away from ground on have be so long encamped if whole force of ireland doe not suffice to take single town prospect of waging war successfully against england be not hopeful seems to that must have be much better to have left derry alone father walter said must have be better a have turned out walter have king taken place a expected without difficulty must have crossed with portion of army to scotland where considerable part of population must at once have joined defence of derry have entirely thwarted that plan fear now that will never be carried out however have have advantage of making soldier out of army of peasant when came here officer men be alike ignorant of everything relating to war now have at rate learned certain amount of drill discipline think will give much better account of ourselves in open field than have done in front of strong town have mean of storming still have be frightful waste of life on side with result beyond horribly embittering feeling of hatred unfortunately prevailed before between catholic protestant population mortification disgust caused by failure of londonderry be increased by severe defeat of force under general justin mccarthy lord mountcashel at newtown butler on very day that derry be relieved general mccarthy have be detached with corp of six thousand men against enniskilleners came up with near newtown butler although two thousand strong enniskilleners who be commanded by colonel wolseley english officer at once attacked irish only portion of whom have come upon ground mccarthy who be brave experienced officer sent order to cavalry to face to right march to support of wing be attacked officer gave order right about face cavalry turned trotted towards rear infantry believing that be deserted by horse at once lost heart fell into confusion mccarthy while endeavouring to remedy disorder be wounded taken prisoner flight became general enniskilleners pursued with savage fury during evening whole of night greater part of next day hunted fugitive down in bog wood slew in cold blood five hundred of irish threw into lough erne rather than face death at hand of savage enemy only one of number saved by swimming after leaving derry army returned to dublin where parliament james have summoned be then sitting most of soldier be quartered on citizen a pressure be very great captain davenant easily obtained leave for troop to go out to bray where be within very short distance of own house day after return home walter went over to give jabez whitefoot wife news of john from whom have heard nothing since fortnight before siege have begun son be alive well be first word have be through siege of derry have behaved like hero lord be praised jabez said while wife burst into tear of relief for have gone through terrible anxiety during long week that derry have be suffering from starvation how do know master walter jabez asked seeing that be on side of besieger how must tell what be passing on inside of wall how do know john be alive because saw first month before end of siege because came regularly afterwards to fetch away provision have placed for walter then gave full account of john visit to camp in search of food for child who be sheltered in tanner house be just like john mother said be ever thoughtful for others be more pleased hundred time that must have so risked life to obtain food for little one than if have taken part in fighting proved very champion of derry parliament have met on th of may session have be opened by speech from throne in king commended loyalty of irish subject declared intention to make difference between catholic protestant loyalty good conduct must be only passport to favour stated earnest wish good wholesome law must be enacted for encouragement of trade of manufacture of country for relief of such a have suffered injustice by act of settlement be act by land of catholic have be handed over wholesale to cromwell soldier other protestant bill be speedily passed abolishing jurisdiction of english court of law of english parliament in ireland other bill be passed for regulation of commerce promotion of shipbuilding bill for repeal of act of settlement be brought up on d of may be opposed only by protestant bishop peer became law on th of june act of attainder be speedily passed against two thousand protestant landed proprietor of whom have obtained land by settlement of cromwell land tax be voted to king of twenty thousand pound month proceeded to raise other levy by private authority result be that resource of ireland be speedily exhausted money almost disappeared james being at wit end for fund issued copper money stamped with value of gold silver law be passed making base money legal tender promising at end of war must be exchanged for sterling money be measure inflicted enormous loss damage at first people raised price of good in proportion to decrease in value of money james stopped by issuing proclamation fixing price at article be to be sold having done proceeded to buy up great quantity of hide butter corn wood other good paying for with few pound of copper tin then shipping to france where be sold on own account need hardly be said that conduct of kind speedily excited great dissatisfaction even among who be most loyal in cause captain davenant be shocked at state of thing found prevailing in dublin regret bitterly said when alone with wife mother have taken up sword success appears to to be folly of stuart be incredible must ruin best cause in world with spark of wisdom firmness james might have united ireland in cause instead of have absolutely forced protestant into hostility folly be only equalled by rapacity be stupendous be said one evening when have just returned from visit to dublin depressed disheartened by heard there be astonished fergus mother said sharply to hear speak in way who must have thought that be davenant who be speaking doubtless there have be mistake a be only natural everything will come right in time have be longing for to come home looking forward with such joy to welcome a possessor of broad land of davenants thank god have lived to see restoration of dear husband land discomfiture of cromwellian knave who have so long possessed be grand day when act be passed repealing cromwell grant handing over best part of ireland to soldier saw in gazette among two thousand grant specially mentioned a cancelled be that of davenant estate to zephaniah whitefoot be told that old man son have taken notice of act go about work a if be still owner of land of course now that be back there will soon be end of captain davenant be silent will be in hurry mother said after pause be true that act of irish parliament have cancelled iniquitous work of cromwell restored land to rightful possessor say that be not just be quite sure that be not politic men have be planted on soil for two generation have built house tilled field made home for be essentially case for arrangement not for setting right first act of confiscation by a sweeping have rendered protestant desperate have enlisted sympathy of protestant of england in behalf have done much to popularize war there must have be vastly wiser have commission be ordered to examine into circumstance of case in great proportion of case estate cromwellites took possession of be vastly larger than be able to till a in case of zephaniah whitefoot let out greater portion to tenant land must have restored to former owner leaving to cromwellites land till house have built upon a to turning whitefoots out will certainly take step way at present will be time enough to do so when king james be firmly established on throne a thing go at present have very faint hope will ever be have utterly failed to conquer protestant of north of ireland have strength of england to cope with yet will be well mother if at end of strife can keep davenant castle over head with few acre still remain to two day afterwards captain davenant mounted horse rode over to whitefoots zephaniah jabez came to door suppose have come over to turn out fergus davenant old man said warn that will not be for long triumph of ungodly be short lord will care for own people be mistaken captain davenant said quietly have come over for such purpose be of course aware that parliament have passed law reinstating in father land came over to tell that at present propose to take advantage of law will hing until war be at end if king william cause triumph act will remain dead letter if king james win act be upheld wish to tell that will never disturb in land yourselves occupy tenant on other hand will be tenant in house have built in field have tilled will remain master have thought matter over appears to to be just settlement one give word will hold to must king james triumph in end think that law turning out protestant settler from land have held for forty year be well nigh a unjust a gave to will take gift at hand of wicked zephaniah began jabez interrupted hush father said be not thus that kindness must be met then stepped forward leaving father too surprised at sudden assumption of command on part of son to interrupt captain davenant said thank most sincerely on part of wife son may say of father too although at present may not realize kindness of offer think likely that if james stuart prevails ireland be rent from england will avail ourselves of offer for have more than sufficient of world good to remove to england there settle ourselves son for assuredly ireland must be place where protestant must dwell in peace quietness nevertheless thank heartily will ever gratefully bear in mind promise have made fact that although have power to turn from home have stayed from doing so there have be much wrong done on side from boy when have seen ride into from home have felt that mine wronged by being possessor of father land be spoil of battle

possession of land israelite took land of canaan zephaniah interrupted be speaking of modern war father for century such act of wholesale spoliation be ever perpetrated considering a do that act be iniquitous one although have benefited by consider offer captain davenant have made to to be noble one have to thank sir also for kindness to son kindness doubtless saved life a well a of many others in londonderry believe that come of horrible war mine will never forget kindness have received at hand affair be son rather than mine captain davenant said be glad to be able to assist in aiding brave boy be noble fellow have reason to be proud of must add thanks to of husband hannah said coming out from house having listened to conversation through open window have suffered so until son brought news of john two day since be strange indeed that son must have be mean of saving one of household whom can not have learnt to regard a usurper of father right be last night be reading of jonathan david seemed to that assuredly same spirit that felt for other be in son boy be very fond of other mr whitefoot be glad of be manly fellow there be reason why feud of father must descend to child with cordial goodbye captain davenant rode off jabez zephaniah said a turned into house have not thought to hear son of mine rise in rebellion against father father jabez said for forty five year have be

for brother throughout ireland did original owner of land so treat thousand who few month since be prosperous men be now without shelter wherein to lay head storm be sweeping over elect be everywhere smitten must james stuart conquer not protestant in ireland must leave shore therefore although must counsel no giving up of principle abandonment of faith yet must say that be time for enforcement of view upon weak vessel mourn that son must for time have fallen away from high standard say be best to be patient with at home there be few word spoken after zephaniah have gone out hannah have thrown arm round husband neck have said thank god for word jabez now be proud of a have never be proud before that have boldly spoken out for liberty of conscience feel like one who have for many year be slave who be at last free jabez kissed be silent to have be great trial to rebel knew that be right must have done again if necessary be terrible thing to to have openly father to whom have from childhood rendered almost implicit obedience on return zephaniah did not renew subject from time there be great change in moral atmosphere of house zephaniah be still master in matter of daily work in other respect jabez have completely emancipated chapter dundalk after failure before derry utmost confusion prevailed in military council arising chiefly from jealousy conflicting authority of french irish commander james be entirely under control of french ambassador who together with countryman in ireland affected to despise irish a rude uncivilized people while irish in turn hated french for arrogance insolence many of irish gentleman who have raised regiment at private expense be superseded to make room for frenchman appointed by influence of french ambassador gentleman returned home in disgust be soon followed by men who be equally discontented at being handed over to command of foreigner instead of native leader day breach widened between french irish discontent caused by king exaction be wide general if william at time have offered favourable term to catholic be probable that arrangement must have be arrived at william be busily at work preparing army for conquest of country have ireland stood alone be probable that england must at rate for time have suffered to go own way close alliance with france fact that french influence be powerful with james rendered impossible for england to submit to establishment of what must be foreign hostile power so close to shore besides if ireland remained under dominion of james power of william on throne of england must never have be consolidated although have met with resistance on assumption of throne have hearty support of mere fraction of english people accession be work of few great whig family only rule be by mean popular dutch favourite be a much disliked in england a be james french adherent in ireland in scotland jacobite party be numerous powerful be in open rebellion to authority thus then if william position on throne of england be to be consolidated be necessary that blow must be struck in ireland torn by dissension without plan leading irish army remained for month inactive most of regiment having after northern campaign returned to district in be raised thus preparation be made to meet army be preparing to invade country ten thousand strong under command of general schomberg who although eighty year of age be still able active spirited commander embarked on th of august at chester on th landed near bangor in carrickfergus bay there be force there of sufficient strength to oppose schomberg found antrim belfast deserted garrison at carrickfergus consisting of two regiment prepared vigorously for siege schomberg at once prepared to invest in short time attacked by land sea siege be pressed with vigour garrison under m'carty moore defended with greatest skill bravery a fast a breach be battered in wall repaired repulsed attempt of besieger to gain footing in town garrison be badly supplied with ammunition stripped lead from roof of castle church to make bullet time attempt be made to relieve french irish general be disputing a to what be best plan of campaign king be busy making money with trade with france after holding out until have burned last grain of powder gallant garrison be forced to capitulate schomberg be too glad to get place to insist on hard term garrison marched out with honour of war drum beating match alight be conveyed with store arm public private property to nearest irish post effect of determined resistance on part of little garrison at carrickfergus be to impress schomberg with fact that difficulty of task have undertaken be vastly greater than have supposed success with londonderry have defended against irish army have impressed with idea that levy of king james be simply contemptible fighting quality of garrison of carrickfergus have shown that be foe by mean to be despised convinced that force at command be altogether inadequate to necessity therefore moved south with extreme caution found country altogether wasted deserted protestant have long since fled be gathered round derry enniskillen catholic have now deserted home at approach troop in retreat have burned wasted everything so that have mean of subsistence for army be obliged to rely upon fleet ordered to follow down coast schomberg be soon joined by three regiment of enniskillen horse appearance of troop astonished english resembled rather horde of italian bandit than body of european cavalry observed little order in military movement uniformity of dress accoutrement man be armed clad according to own fancy accompanied by mounted servant carrying baggage like cossack whom closely resembled be distinguished by extreme rapidity of movement fierceness contempt of difficulty danger calculated chance number rushed to attack of foe with ferocity fanaticism almost ensured success regarded slaughter of papist a acceptable service to lord plundered wherever went be scourge to irish protestant a well a catholic troop furnished by derry be similar in character to from enniskillen must not endure restraint of discipline be little use in acting with regular army like cossack be formidable only when acting by schomberg successor indeed whole of english officer soon came to abhor savage undisciplined ally still irish army made move report have magnified schomberg strength to more than twice real number military leader must not believe that after so many month of preparation william have despatched so small army for conquest of ireland confusion dismay reigned in dublin french marshal de rosen advised that dublin drogheda must be abandoned that irish army must be concentrated at athlone limerick tyrconnell went to drogheda where council of war be sitting strenuously opposed promising by next night twenty thousand men must be assembled there express be sent out in direction by forced march irish troop stationed in munster directed course to drogheda in high spirit anxious to meet enemy schomberg although have be reinforced by six thousand men from england fell back at news of gathering formed intrenched camp in strong position between dundalk sea approach be covered by mountain river morass communication be open to sea here resolved to wait for reinforcement captain davenant became more more despondent a to cause in have embarked without king without french ally said bitterly to wife might hope for success be enough to ruin cause be king object to excite discontent disgust among subject must not act otherwise than be now doing whole thought be devoted to wringing money out of people time have to spare be spent upon superintending building of nunnery in be so interested a to french paralyse military operation regard a inferior race act a if with own five six thousand troop must defeat power of england be heartbreaking seeing chance so wasted have advantage be taken of enthusiasm excited when king james landed have be wise prudent disinterested for desirous of obtaining affection of class have brought with none of french adventurer must long ere have be undisputed king of ireland from end to end must have stood a one people in arm ready to oppose ourselves to force that england must send against never be chance so frittered away never such succession of blunder folly be enough to break one heart do hope father when troop march again will take a cornet be six month older than be have learned lot in last campaign have not filled up place of cornet o'driscoll did think when be killed in last fight have before derry must have appointed in respect be le inclined than ever walter captain davenant said for begin to regard success a hopeless will make difference father in way for if be beaten be sure to hand land over to protestant besides thing may turn out better than think whether must certainly like to do best for ireland well will think about captain davenant said walter be satisfied for felt sure that father must finally accede to wish be late at night when mounted messenger dashed up to door of castle handed in order captain davenant opened be to march in hour time to drogheda whole army be to assemble there hurray walter shouted something be going to be done at last man be sent down to village at once to order twenty men quartered there to saddle mount instantly ride up to castle while on horseback started for bray to get main body under arm mr davenant busied in packing wallet of husband son be very pale said little god bless said when be finished bring back again safely wo ask to take care of yourselves because of course must do duty with love must not wish to draw back from that when home religion country be at stake even woman must not wish to keep love beside there be last embrace then captain davenant son sprang on horse be waiting at door took place at head of party have come up from village rode away into darkness while two mr davenants gave free vent to tear have hitherto so bravely restrained at bray captain davenant found rest of troop drawn up in readiness after brief inspection to see that be present with proper arm accoutrement started with for dublin after few hour rest there continued way towards drogheda army then proceeded north to dundalk bitter be disappointment of troop when on arriving there found that schomberg instead of advancing to give battle have shut up in intrenchment have formed must not be induced to sally out in vain king james who accompanied army formed up in order of battle within sight of invader line schomberg be not to be tempted out a position appeared to be too strong to be attacked irish be forced to endeavour to reduce by slow process of starvation english army be soon reduced to pitiable strait not from hunger for be able to obtain food from ship from disease situation of camp be low unhealthy fever broke out swept away vast number of men dutch enniskilleners suffered comparatively little be accustomed to damp climate of english troop nearly eight thousand died in two month that blockade lasted have james maintained position whole of army of schomberg must have perished most unfortunately for cause insisted on personally conducting operation when complete success be in grasp marched army away in middle of november to winter quarter thereby allowing schomberg to move with eight thousand men who remained to from pest stricken camp to healthier quarter disgust of of james officer who understood anything of war at termination of campaign be extreme men indeed be eager to return to home must gladly have attempted assault on english camp before doing so a defender be reduced to half original strength while most of survivor be weakened by disease attack must probably have be successful james be several time on point of ordering attack own vacillation of character be heightened by conflicting counsel of general who seemed more bent on thwarting other than on gaining cause for fought cavalry be not idle while blockade of schomberg camp continued frequently making excursion over country to bring in cattle for army for villager have for most part deserted home herd of cattle be grazing without master one day captain davenant troop have ridden thirty mile out of camp have halted for night in village in morning broke up into small party

sitting on doorstep eating food have brought with when one of outpost dashed in at full gallop shouting that enemy be upon warning came too late for close behind came body of wild looking horseman shouting yelling there be cry of enniskilleners men ran to horse have scarcely time to throw in saddle when enniskilleners charged down for minute two there be confused medley then three four of

exception of skirmish round derry have seen nothing whatever of fighting operation have be attended by decisive result have inflicted extreme misery suffering upon enemy in be success aimed at attained at same time novelty of life companionship of father other officer of regiment not least good humour fun of attendant larry have made time pas far more cheerfully to than to majority of in army a before when army arrived at dublin captain davenant troop be posted in around bray greater portion of being permitted to reside in own home until again wanted for active service walter on return be glad to find that friend john whitefoot have made way home from derry pleasant intercourse be at once renewed schomberg army when moved to healthy quarter bountifully supplied with kind of food necessary from england speedily recovered health discipline in very short time be again in condition to take field early in february brigadier wolseley with detachment of enniskilleners english marched against cavan james have longer army with must oppose schomberg enterprise while latter have be recovering from effect of heavy loss nothing have be done to put irish army in condition to take field again lacked almost necessary for campaign magazine have be formed to supply when must again advance so short of forage be that be considered impossible to make move in force until grass must grow sufficiently to enable horse to get into condition nevertheless duke of berwick marched with eight hundred men from dublin brigadier nugent with like force from west meath longford arrived at cavan few hour before english reached town irish force be composed entirely of infantry with exception of two troop of cavalry english force consisted of seven hundred foot three hundred cavalry a cavan did not offer advantage in way of defence duke of berwick moved army out into open field english lined hedge stood on defensive irish horse commenced battle with furious charge on enniskilleners dragoon drove from field english infantry maintained position so stoutly that after prolonged fight irish retreated into fort near town english enniskilleners entered cavan at once began to plunder place hearing what be going on duke of berwick sallied out from fort to attack gained considerable advantage brigadier wolseley being unable to restore discipline among enniskilleners who formed great majority of force ordered town to be set on fire in several place troop then collected repulsed irish with considerable loss duke of berwick have two hundred killed amongst whom be brigadier nugent many officer a irish remained in possession of fort town be almost entirely destroyed by fire brigadier wolseley returned with force to dundalk shortly afterwards fort of charlemont be invested by

schomberg humanely ordered that loaf of bread must be given to man at irish army be not in condition to render assistance to hard pressed garrison of charlemont until after have capitulated in meantime great army be to be led by king william in person be being collected in england consisted of strange medley collected from almost european nation english scotch irish protestant french huguenot dutch swede dane brandenburghers swiss norwegian hessian more than half indeed be foreigner be well disciplined armed clothed in including force under army amounted to forty three thousand men fifty cannon king william landed at carrickfergus on th of june combined army at once began southward march against force king james collected twenty thousand men of six thousand be french have arrived under command of count de lauzun in march have not increased number of king james troop for have be obliged to send in exchange equal number of best trained soldier under lord mountcashel for service in france of fourteen thousand native troop irish horse be raised officered by irish gentleman be excellent infantry be composed for most part of raw levy half armed only artillery consisted of twelve gun have arrived with infantry from france be sad parting when captain davenant walter left home for front former be filled with gloomy foreboding must scarcely hope that ill trained levy of james must succeed against vastly superior force of disciplined troop with whom have now to cope especially a latter be led by able energetic general while former be hampered by incompetence vacillation of james day before started captain davenant rode over to whitefoots have talk with jabez know not how campaign will go said if be beaten will probably retire to west maintain war there in case dublin will of course fall into hand of william must be so will ask to reverse late position to extend what assistance can to wife mother may be that if return here none will disturb have not made obnoxious to protestant neighbour one may take trouble to bring before notice of english that be absent fighting with army of king james if however must do so castle what remains of estate be confiscated will lend what aid can to lady younger boy until walter return from war will do right gladly jabez said heartily must hear talk of what speak of will go up to dublin with of friend minister will testify to good relation have existed between protestant neighbour entreat that measure be taken against estate must not prevail be assured will look after comfort of lady a if be of own family can well understand mr davenant elder must not accept shelter of roof extremity belongs to generation of father can not forget past will see that be well lodged in bray have protection from molestation annoyance there must find a ala may be case that spirit of religious persecution be fiercely abroad will consult with a to whether may wish to cross sea until can join will make arrangement a may direct for passage be truly obliged to captain davenant said will make comfortable to know whatsoever may befall will have friend in stormy time say nought about jabez replied did not son succour boy in extremity if do more than can in matter will not deem that be quits irish army moved forward to boyne william be approaching from north james officer endeavoured to dissuade from setting everything on hazard of battle represented that army though now quite unequal to contest be rapidly improving in skill confidence in that reinforcement be day expected from france must at least make equal to enemy in number that be in want of arm artillery store might be expected also from france in short period that policy be clearly to protract war wear out enemy by contest of post siege unskilled a troop might be in field have proved steady resolute in defence of fortified place held great fortress of kingdom must be easy to provide for defence of to occupy william army in small affair till winter when climate must do execution upon invader while irish must suffer little then must be time to fight in meantime be urged intrigue french be actively carrying out in britain must have produced effect french fleet be day expected on coast of england william must soon be compelled to return to country if not to recall greater part of army in scotland too french be busy there be material in country for creating powerful diversion to fight now must be to forego advantage to meet view of william whose obvious interest be to bring contest to immediate decision now while circumstance be in favour james who have hitherto shown nothing timidity hesitation be now seized with impulse of valour having acted with unfortunate cowardice before derry schomberg camp at dundalk be a unfortunately now seized with ardour to fight when prudence discretion must have be best policy while james be determining to fight in teeth of opinion advice of bravest officer true character be shown in taking precaution for personal safety sent off heavy baggage engaged vessel at waterford to convey to france william on other hand be naturally eager for early engagement be still very insecurely seated upon english throne people be either discontented indifferent looked with impatience indignation at crowd of dutch officer civilian whom william have brought over with while cold ungracious manner of king contrasted most unfavourably with bearing to have be accustomed in english monarch in scotland jacobite spirit be gathering in strength william knew that unless speedily broke strength of james party in ireland must very shortly be confronted with difficulty danger on side position irish army occupied be strong one right rested upon drogheda strong town in possession in front be boyne with steep bank lined with thick hedge with cottage scattered here there offering excellent position for light troop on left boyne turned almost at right angle formed defence on flank to rear irish position be covered by high hill village of donore further back be pas of duleek hedge cottage by river side be occupied by irish infantry upon little hillock ran along water edge erected light battery king william reconnoitred position with great attention saw that have be well chosen advantage turned to account notwithstanding report of deserter others showed much anxiety to determine exact strength of irish after examining position for time from height rode down towards river accompanied by several of officer when within musket shot of bank near ford village of old bridge perceived that small island in boyne be occupied by party of irish horse near ford field work have be thrown up be at point that king determined to cross river spent time conversing with officer a to arrangement for passage then rode slowly along river bank until arrived nearly opposite left of irish line here alighted from horse sat down on rising ground watching own battalion be marching with greatest regularity order into position assigned to while be so engaged officer of james army be observed riding quietly along opposite bank of river also engaged in watching movement of british troop be general sarsfield duke of berwick marquis of tyrconnell count de lauzun others of english dragoon approached river be fired upon by irish returned fire while attention of side be engaged by skirmish party of irish cavalry moved slowly down towards river halted behind low hedge then wheeling about again retired movement of king group of officer accompanying have be observed in irish army two field piece be sent down concealed in centre of cavalry gun have be placed behind hedge when horseman withdrew when william rose from ground mounted horse fire be opened first cannon shot killed two horse man by side next grazed king right shoulder tearing away coat inflicting slight flesh wound have aim be slightly more accurate have gunner fired with grape instead of round shot be probable that whole course of history must have be changed rumour spread through army that king be killed wound be slight one having have hastily bound up king rode quietly through camp in order to show men that hurt be not serious in evening called council of war duke of schomberg be strongly opposed to attack upon enemy while posted in so strong position urged that by making turning movement marching straight upon dublin enemy must be obliged to fall back fight under le advantageous circumstance king relying upon superior number discipline of veteran troop determined to attack at once knowing that be important to bring matter to decision a early a possible schomberg then urged necessity of occupying pas of slane upon boyne considerably to west of irish line a must thus cut off retreat in event of victory render defeat decided one king saw that must require whole force to dislodge irish from position that be useless to occupy pas of slane with small detachment a must be overwhelmed by retiring irish be twelve o'clock at night before council terminated then king mounted horse rode through camp examined into state preparation of regiment saw that soldier be abundantly supplied with food refreshment for morning sufficient ammunition for day work have be served out directed men to wear green branch in cap gave westminster a word for day order of battle finally determined upon be that right wing of army under general douglas count schomberg son of duke must pas river at slane endeavour to turn irish left between slane duleek left wing be to penetrate between irish right drogheda centre to force passage of river at ford of old bridge council be also held in james camp here also there be difference of opinion of general wished to hold pas of slane in force james decided against a morning approached king newborn courage began to die out ordered movement to rear sent forward more of baggage must probably have declined combat altogether have not be too late finally just a day be breaking over council determined that army must retreat during battle not commit in decisive engagement french formed left be to lead retreat while irish held right centre be almost certain that if james have kept to resolution to fight imprudent a appeared to be have brought french battalion into action instead of leading out of field result of battle of boyne must have be very different one chapter boyne water morning of tuesday st of july broke calm bright at about six o'clock in morning english right wing under general douglas count schomberg marched towards slane consisted of twenty four squadron of horse six battalion of infantry a marched along at back of river discovered several willow crossed without proceeding a far a slane serious resistance be offered to passage of boyne a irish have here only party of skirmisher who fell back a advanced after forming troop in order douglas schomberg advanced presently perceived french battalion great part of irish cavalry forming left wing of james army drawn up in order at distance consequently halted sent for reinforcement when arrived extended line to right so a to outflank enemy supporting cavalry by alternate battalion of infantry again moved forward irish skirmisher fell back before advance taking advantage of bank of ditch divided ground into small field keeping up galling fire upon british a advanced with difficulty latter passed over broken ground formed in order of battle on edge of what appeared to be plain be in fact deep bog completely covered irish left here came to standstill william have waited until believed that right must have have time to fall upon irish left then ordered centre to advance force passage at old bridge dutch guard whom william relied upon a best most trustworthy troop advanced in splendid order to river side with drum beating march when reached water edge drum ceased soldier entered river stream rose a dense column marched in dammed up water reached shoulder of grenadier still moved on in regular order keeping arm ammunition dry by holding above head on opposite bank hedge near brink of river be lined with skirmisher while in rear in hollow covered by little hill seven regiment of irish infantry supported by ten troop of horse tyrconnell regiment of cavalry be drawn up hill protected from fire of british battery passed over head dutch troop continued way unmolested until reached middle of river when hot fire be opened upon from irish skirmisher dutch moved on unshaken soon gained opposite bank where rapidly formed up skirmisher retiring before scarcely have dutch formed square when irish horse burst down upon at full speed charged with impetuosity stood charge unbroken again again irish horse charged down upon with greatest gallantry william pushed two regiment of french huguenot one of british across river to assistance of dutch guard ordered sir john hanmars count of nassau regiment to cross lower down stream to support a support be making passage general hamilton advanced at head of body of irish infantry to water edge dashing into river encountered french huguenot regiment in middle of stream desperate fight ensued french made way across hamilton falling back with infantry opened to right left permitting irish horse to charge through rushed with fury upon french regiment of colonel la callimot cut way right through then wheeling charged in flank again broke drove into river la callimot be killed few of regiment regained opposite bank in meantime dutch guard now reinforced be advancing slowly irish infantry holding fast to hedge brushwood contesting inch of ground while wherever ground permitted irish horse burst down upon evincing gallantry determination must have done honour to finest cavalry in europe king continued to make repeated effort to support dutch troop after french be broken pushed forward danish horse sooner have crossed bank than irish cavalry burst down upon broke drove back into river fled across stream in disorder dispersed in direction so far success have rested principally with irish dutch guard alone remained unbroken in centre french infantry danish horse be broken destroyed old duke schomberg exerted to utmost to restore battle at point having rallied french infantry advanced with few french cavalry towards river where be met by of irish horse returning from pursuit of dane old duke be cut down party again routed at same moment walker clerical commander of derry received mortal wound after successful defence of derry man have gone to london where have be feted made much of have then attached to king william army where posed a high military authority although much discouraged by king whom arrogance air of authority displeased while in centre william force be getting worsted on right douglas count schomberg be inactive powerless be leading left wing across river passage be difficult one king be only extricated with much exertion from quicksand into horse have plunged irish did not oppose crossing a soon a force be across stream william ranged in order consisted of large body of danish dutch enniskillen horse considerable force of infantry a soon a be in order king though still suffering from wound have received day before drew sword put at head of troop irish right wing consisted chiefly of infantry moved forward to meet perceiving numerous cavalry led by king preparing to take in flank halted faced about marched slowly to little hill of donore having gained point again faced round charged down upon british who have followed closely at moment irish cavalry who have moved rapidly from centre to support of right charged down upon danish dutch horse led by king sooner have come in contact than dane dutch turned rode off with irish cavalry in pursuit king rode towards enniskilleners colonel wolseley told men that be king asked if wished to follow replied with shout king placing at head rode towards irish infantry a advanced be met by well directed volley being much more fond of plundering slaughtering than of close fighting turned horse rode away again again king rallied infantry brought back to fight irish infantry stood ground with great steadiness until general be wounded taken in charge of cavalry after fell back from donore upon duleek in good order enemy not wanting to molest rest of irish infantry followed example more singular battle than of boyne be ever fought in morning at break of day part of james army with most of artillery be in march for pas of slane actually on retreat left wing composed chiefly of french infantry supposed to be best troop in army never fired shot centre right composed entirely of irish most of whom have never before be in battle be alone engaged with exception of dutch guard william foreign troop have be repeatedly broken cavalry have be driven off field by irish horse while division of irish be broken suffered decided defeat until infantry from hill of donore be compelled to retreat did in perfect order throughout day irish cavalry showed vast superiority to of british even broke destroyed regiment of infantry when whole army fell back closed up rear effectually prevented attempt at pursuit thus battle of boyne be fought rather to cover retreat than defend position loss on side be estimated at about five hundred general hamilton be only prisoner taken by british honour of fight certainly rested with irish who against vastly superior force comprising of best troop in europe maintained throughout day gained indeed in most point decided advantage king james valour have entirely evaporated before first shot be fired instead of following william example leading troop in conflict be to decide fate of crown have precipitated took up position at safe distance from danger on hill of donore a soon a battle approached that point rode off to duleek where placed at head of french troop led retreat soon however rode on ahead arrived in dublin in state of consternation despair first fugitive from field of battle in meantime army be whole unbroken marching in perfect order from field of battle while king commander be doing best to ruin cause by spreading dismay alarm throughout country next morning king sent for mayor corporation of dublin told that be under necessity of taking care of recommended to do same to make best term must with enemy then at once mounted made flight to waterford ordering bridge to be broken down behind although british army have not yet moved from position on boyne on reaching waterford james at once embarked on board ship have ordered to be in readiness sailed for france conduct conduct alone converted battle of boyne be in effect kind of drawn battle into great victory for william have indeed more than answered object irish commander proposed to plan be to accustom new badly armed levy to stand firm against steadiness experience of william veteran troop then to withdraw without committing to decisive combat with view of protracting campaign until william must be forced to leave ireland foreign army must be worn out by winter service in uncongenial climate day must calculated improve own army weaken reduce of enemy position at boyne enabled to try plan of partial combat to what extent chose without danger of being forced into more extensive action than deemed expedient irish troop have greatly surpassed expectation of own officer have filled william general with amazement be probable that if large part of infantry artillery have not be sent off early in day experiment might have be turned into brilliant victory a be william be so surprised alarmed at resistance have encountered that remained day at boyne without advancing have be told by except duke of schomberg that resistance of irish must be contemptible most forward of who have scoffed at courage of irish have be enniskilleners who have on day of battle shown so unmistakably white feather after king disliked despised troop hung without ceremony when taken in act of plunder slaughter to be so much addicted so far from flight of king james discouraging army caused universal joy be constant vacillation interference cowardly action have paralysed troop felt that now be free to act without interference must be able to cope with invader william at once offered favourable term if ireland must submit to authority be declined partly owing to powerful influence of france partly to fear that term must not be observed partly to apprehension of gentry that land have just recovered from hand of cromwell settler must be again taken from at battle of boyne walter davenant with father troop have taken part in desperate charge upon enemy during long hour battle have lasted cavalry have be incessantly engaged time after time have charged down upon dutch square sooner have rank be reformed after recoiling from line of fixed bayonet than be called upon to charge in direction walter heart beat high a dashed into midst of french infantry shattered drove before danish horse there be little time to think looking back upon day when be over seemed to chaos of excitement confusion of must hardly recall even chief incident a troop halted for night be in way dispirited at result of battle a retreat have be begun before blow be struck knew that be neither intended hoped that ground must be successfully held man felt pride in thought that eighteen thousand newly raised irish levy of whom small portion of infantry be armed with musket have sustained throughout long summer day attack of more than double number of veteran troop supported by fifty piece of artillery loss of irish horse have be comparatively small charging square in day when bayonet be fixed in muzzle of gun be not desperate undertaking that now be when from hedge of steel issue rolling continuous fire french regiment once broken have be cut down with scarce resistance while mercenary cavalry have be defeated with greatest ease thus among brigade of irish horse there be few fallen friend to mourn nothing to mar pride man felt in behaviour of irish troop against such overwhelming odds that king have fled everyone knew feeling be one of relief absence be more than victory to captain davenant said a with group of officer sat by fire made of fence hastily pulled down majesty have virtue with good counsellor must make worthy monarch among virtue military genius be not conspicuous must be glad if lauzun french must also take departure let have mountcashel division back again from france if be left to ourselves with own general sarsfield mountcashel can tire out continental riffraff william have gathered together dissension caused by french interference have be ruin so far leave to ourselves will do irish today have proved fighting quality if proper use be made of resource difficulty of country defy to conquer feel more hopeful now than have done since first day took field do think will fight battle before dublin father walter asked have idea what general will decide walter must imagine that will march to west have strong position today in open field at present must not hope to cope with william superior number great artillery train gun be little use to yesterday on level ground must tear rank to piece without being able to make return among river bog mountain of west must find score of place must hold against besides in opinion must not fight pitched battle must harass with continuous march attack leaving master only of ground stand on until at last completely wear out exhaust then think will abandon dublin altogether think so walter will not persecute catholic when have in power there may be disturbance in city walter before english troop march in william will doubt put end to a soon a arrives can not wish to drive catholic of ireland to desperation at rate think need feel at uneasy about at home lying on coast to east of town of dublin altogether out of track of movement of troop there be little fear of trouble there in district there be little preponderance in number of one religion over other unless presence of troop worse of savage from enniskillen derry excite there be little fear of protestant of neighbourhood interfering with people especially a have ground for complaint in past think that need disquiet in slightest about at home a captain davenant have thought probable irish army after marching into dublin in good order with flag flying music playing left on following day for west be accompanied by most of leading catholic family on departure corporation at once wrote to william inviting to enter capital before arrival however protestant mob destroyed great quantity of property belonging to catholic carried excess to such point that town must probably have be destroyed by fire have not better class of protestant armed taken energetic step to repress tumult a troop marched into dublin walter said to captain davenant can ride over to see how be at home will have heard of battle mother grandmother must be terribly anxious will be glad for to go walter for must greatly ease mind at home be to start again almost immediately probably whole army will have marched off before get back in morning there be saying what may occur after have gone there may be general attack upon catholic at rate will be dangerous in extreme for single officer in uniform to be riding through town after have left even in country village there must be intense excitement anyone in king uniform might be fired at in passing through of protestant settlement well father suppose start until get dark then can get home without attracting notice there can put on suit of old clothes bring uniform out in valise well perhaps might manage in way walter must be very glad to relieve mind at home to know how be going on if like can stop there for day two suppose that william will be here with troop for few day have learned that army be not to be despised may hesitate to advance upon dublin until receives certain news that have moved away that will not have to fight battle for possession of city must hear that william troop have arrived in town will of course make detour so a to avoid on way to rejoin now will write letter at once for to take to mother a soon a be dark walter mounted started for bray where arrived without molestation on way arrival be immense relief to lady who have be suffering agony of suspense since news of battle have reached king james hurried arrival panic flight to waterford have caused most alarming report a to battle to circulate throughout country by many be supposed that army have be utterly destroyed walter arrival then with news that father a well a have passed through day unhurt be immense relief be grateful to learn so far from having be routed irish army have accomplished object of fighting battle then falling back in perfect order without molestation father say mother that belief next time when will be no longer hampered by interference of king will be able to make even better fight of especially if a hope french officer will follow king example take off how long be going to stay walter will stay over tomorrow mother start next morning early ought to be able to come up to army before night if not will overtake on march next day wish be older godfrey who have be listening to account of battle said be so hard to have to stay at home here while be having such fun must not think be fun if be with godfrey walter said used to think must be fun think so now just while fighting be going on one be so excited that one doe think of danger when be over be awful to see gap in rank to know so many of who be riding with have fallen that may be turn next time ah be very well for to talk walter because be going through must think just same a do if be in place be true enough godfrey anyhow be glad be not old enough mean must not like to have with then there must be nobody at home with mother now if anything happens to father have got a grow up will be able to look after take care of be bad enough for having two of in war must be worse still if there be three a next evening walter heard that there be news that william troop have not yet moved from boyne thought that be safe to take direct road through dublin have laid aside uniform on reaching home in morning started in civilian clothes with uniform in valise strapped behind saddle carried sword a usual for almost gentleman at time rode armed must therefore excite comment attention carried also brace of pistol in belt underneath coat on arriving in dublin found greatest uproar excitement prevailing mob of men be marching through street smashing window of catholic sacking house fortunately be warned before got into thick of tumult by meeting woman running cry loudly asked what be matter learned that house have be sacked that catholic found in street be being beaten ill treated a walter be anxious to avoid anything might arrest journey westward made way out of town a soon a possible be heartily glad when reached outskirt gave rein to horse passed many group of people a rode be protestant making way to dublin to join in greeting to william army on arrival others be catholic afraid to remain in abode now that army have retired west journeying to capital where believed that william must prevent disorder pillage needed no inquiry a to religion of respective group protestant be for most part men came along shouting waving weapon wild with exultation over triumph of cause catholic be of age sex many of have cart be carrying with most valued possession wore expression of grief anxiety a walter rode into one village fray be going on party of protestant riding boisterously along have knocked down woman with child in arm have answered angry remonstrance of peasant with jeer laughter stone have begun to fly protestant have drawn sword villager have caught up hoe spade other weapon fierce fight be going on woman with shrill cry encouraged peasant aided by hurling stone at rioter walter saw that interference must be of avail with heavy heart at bitter hatred two party in ireland exhibited for other turned from road made circuit round village continued way after that avoided town village slept at night in cabin of peasant lying little distance from road following day again pressed on before evening overtook retiring army on arrival of king william with army in dublin proclamation be issued assuring save who resisted authority of protection threatening severity against who disturbed peace committed outrage on personal property letter of protection be granted to who applied for hearing jabez whitefoot at once went into dublin to apply for protection for family of captain davenant on hearing however that persecution of catholic must be allowed that army be likely to march west at once in pursuit of irish thought better to leave matter alone a application must only draw attention of authority to fact of captain davenant son being engaged in hostile army felt sure that lady need fear molestation save from soldier northerner a own influence with protestant of neighbourhood must suffice to prevent from interfering with household at castle irish army marched towards shannon be concentrated part in neighbourhood of athlone part at limerick william shortly prepared to follow too divided army into two column main body under own command took road to limerick while other division consisting of five regiment of cavalry twelve of infantry be despatched under command of general douglas for purpose of investing fortress of athlone a army marched west path be marked by wholesale outrage destruction although protection be granted to peasant inhabitant of town village through army marched be entirely disregarded by soldier who plundered ill used sometimes murdered defenceless people carrying away without payment provision on must lay hand king sometimes hanged who be caught in act of plunder slaughter have little effect dutch soldier alone maintained order discipline foreign mercenary composed for most part of sweeping of great city behaved with brutality cruelty almost without example be acknowledged by historian of time protestant a well a catholic indeed protestant inhabitant suffered even more than catholic for many of latter fled at approach of army while protestant regarding a friend deliverer remained quietly at home suffered insult outrage at hand of horde of savage who be perfectly indifferent a to religion of plundered captain davenant troop be with force have retired to athlone there awaited approach of column of general douglas report of conduct of enemy be brought in by flying peasant filled irish troop with indignation rage when on arriving before town general douglas sent messenger to demand surrender colonel grace who commanded only replied by firing pistol towards athlone stood on

douglas to lanesborough mile north of town with order to pas river at point post be held by irish troop who easily repulsed attempt be next proposed to pas river at ford short distance from bridge troop have little heart for enterprise a ford be covered by field work erected by irish assailant be already reduced to considerable strait have consumed provision found in town plundering without protestant inhabitant who have be well treated by irish troop while conduct of army effectually deterred country people from bringing in provision circulation of report that general sarsfield with fifteen thousand men be on march to cut off besieger of athlone determined general douglas to make speedy retreat in fear of being cut off abandoned heavy baggage quitting high road made way by unfrequented route added to hardship of march in retreat column be accompanied by unhappy protestant inhabitant who feared to remain behind lest irish must retaliate upon suffering have be inflicted upon countryman in meantime main english army have done little in dublin commission have be appointed to examine into forfeit land of catholic adherent of king james having set machine at work king proceeded with army southward through carlow kilkenny waterford of place surrendered garrison being allowed to march out with arm baggage to join main army on shannon at waterford king received such serious news a to state of thing in england that determined to return home on arriving at dublin be overwhelmed with petition from inhabitant a to shameful conduct of troop left in garrison there especially of trelawney schomberg other regiment of horse who people complained treated although protestant far worse than james catholic soldier have done inquiry showed complaint to be well founded finding impossible to restore order discipline among king at once sent regiment back to england then receiving better news from home again started to rejoin army marched towards limerick being joined on way by division under douglas have driven along with cattle horse of country through have passed limerick be at time second city in ireland country for long distance along mouth of shannon be much

english town be indeed almost impregnable be built upon rock of considerable extent land outside wall be low marshy must at time be flooded shannon be broad rapid irish town on limerick shore be not strong being defended only by ordinary wall if be captured however english town must still hold out king made approach to city slowly being obliged to level numerous inclosure a moved on be occupied by irish infantry who lining hedge kept up galling fire falling back gradually a heavy body of troop be brought up against until reached cover of gun of city fort upon opening fire william army halted encamped before irish town here a at boyne king have narrow escape cannonball from wall striking ground at foot a be passing through gap in hedge king have learned that great dissension existed between irish french relied upon a much a upon strength of arm to obtain possession of city information be indeed correct king james in flight have left no order a to who must assume supreme command duke of berwick have considerable claim lauzun french officer declined altogether to receive order from tyrconnell irish officer equally objected to act under command of frenchman consequently during whole siege main irish army by acting upon william rear must speedily have made position untenable remained inactive monsieur boileau french officer be governor of town lauzun having examined fortification pronounced place wholly incapable of defence declaring that wall must be knocked down with roasted apple so ordered entire french division to march to galway there await opportunity for embarking for france leaving irish to defend city if chose lauzun in fact be courtier not soldier desired to get back to versailles at hazard have so inspired officer men with own sentiment that there be general cry among to be recalled to france have indeed interest in cause in fought looked with contempt at half armed half trained ally grumbled continually at hardship have to undergo be indeed evil day for king james cause when exchanged mountcashel fine division for useless ally who throughout war not only did service be cause of endless dissension disaster a soon a king william have taken up position in front of limerick sent summons to boileau to surrender latter consulted with tyrconnell sarsfield other officer for even to last moment be question whether place must be defended at last however decision be made reply be addressed to william secretary sir robert roultwell a boileau must not acknowledge prince a king be too polite to hurt feeling by denial of royal title expressed great surprise at summons have received said that hoped to merit good opinion of prince of orange better by vigorous defence than by shameful surrender of fortress have be committed to charge by master king james second king camp be now formed in regular order taking place on right having near horse guard blue dutch guard who be always main reliance to left of be english dutch regiment further on french dane while brandenburghers other german regiment formed extreme left of line to great satisfaction post assigned to dane be one of rude circular redoubt called in ireland danish fort

ordered to take up quarter at house of protestant gentleman named conyers four mile from town on limerick side of river be mansion of considerable size standing in large ground for proprietor be one of largest landowner in county of limerick grandfather having be colonel in one of cromwell regiment mr conyers have gone to dublin upon passing of act sequestrating property of protestant by james parliament to endeavour to obtain remission of decree so far a concerned house adjoining ground a have influential friend there have remained urging petition until battle of boyne entry of king william into dublin entirely changed position then owing to disturbance of country fact that irish army have retired to limerick found impossible to return home have however travelled with william army to be able to give much useful information regarding defence detail of country round town a captain davenant troop rode up to house lady with girl of sixteen year old appeared at door looked very pale for feared that brutal conduct of have heard of william army must be followed by reprisal on part of irish be somewhat reassured however by captain davenant manner a officer dismounted raised hat said madam have received order to quarter troop in house be anxious can assure to cause a little inconvenience annoyance a possible under circumstance be only woman here sir mr conyers said house be at disposal daughter will move to gardener cottage trust that will give order to men that will be free from molestation there must not think of disturbing in manner captain davenant said have wife mother alone at home will gladly treat with same courtesy trust will receive allow in first place to introduce to lieutenant mr obeoore cornet who be also son walter see that have extensive stable outbuilding be sure that men who be good fellow many of son of farmer will make very comfortable in two officer will quarter in gardener cottage speak of be good indeed sir mr conyers said gratefully must not think of allowing to do will indeed be pleased if officer will take up residence here a guest thank kindly must not do men will be well content with outhouse if see that be content with cottage might not be so if saw that took up quarter in house therefore if will allow will carry out own plan need not say that will be very pleased to visit in house at such time a may be agreeable to after expressing grateful thanks mr conyers daughter withdrew into house captain davenant then addressed few word to men house will not hold lad there be only lady here be sure must not wish to disturb annoy by crowding house therefore have arranged that will take up quarter in outhouse that will occupy little cottage on ground hope lad that for honour of country cause will behave a peacefully quietly a if in own home must be poor excuse that because william soldier be behaving like wild beast must forget respect due to lonely woman fortnight be spent here pleasantly for first alarm past mr conyers felt safer than have done for month ever since trouble have began have felt loneliness of position a protestant must have long before made way with daughter to dublin have not be that thought that so long a continued in house might be respected by catholic peasantry while be to desert must probably be plundered perhaps burned to ground still position be very trying one especially since jacobite army began to gather in force round limerick now felt that trouble be comparatively over troop caused annoyance heard little of while found in captain davenant officer pleasant guest troop on part be well satisfied mr conyers gave instruction that be to be supplied with needed ration of bread meat be supplemented with many little comfort luxury from house while mr conyers entertained two elder officer walter naturally fell to share of daughter two soon became great friend wandering in ground sometimes riding together when walter be not engaged with troop news came daily of movement of william army when approached captain davenant troop went far out to observe movement obtain accurate idea of strength be late in evening when returned captain davenant said at supper be last meal with mr conyers leave at daybreak few hour afterwards william army will arrive before limerick will be loser will be gainer if a suppose mr conyers be with will be really sorry for going captain davenant seemed terrible thing having troop of hostile horse quartered upon one in reality have be pleasant operation rather than not have felt safer than have done for month do hope that when trouble be over will renew acquaintance that will give husband opportunity of thanking for kindness with have treated thanks must be on side captain davenant said have made what promised to be unpleasant duty most pleasant one stay here have be like visit at friend regret deeply that have to come to end regret be sure lieutenant obeoore son share do indeed lieutenant said walter claire conyers said nothing have talked over early that morning before troop started walter have expressed deep regret that pleasant time be at end although girl have said little be far le bright happy than

order there to take up quarter in village four mile up river thus be le than mile distant from mr conyers house although separated from by shannon from eminence near village roof chimney of mansion must be seen rising above tree by be surrounded during day sound of firing before limerick must be plainly heard little attention be paid to for be certain that attack must be made in earnest upon town until battering artillery came up there be little hope that cavalry must be called up for active service at present after dinner walter strolled out to eminence looked across towards house where have spent so happy time wondered whether mr conyers have by time arrived whether in pleasure of coming thought of late visitor have be forgotten presently larry sauntered up took seat on wall few

country unperceived gentleman of county clare named o'brian thinking that must gain honour advantage by reporting passage to william set out for british camp being unknown there be long time before must get access to king officer to whom spoke paid little attention to story about body of irish horse passing through country be much more interested in gaining information from a to state of stock of cattle sheep pig in part of county for owing to terror excited by conduct of william soldier people for many mile round have driven off stock left village provision be already becoming scarce in camp at length however one of to whom have spoken mentioned story to king who at once sent for saw importance of news brought o'brian have idea of object of sarsfield expedition king instantly guessed that be siege train therefore ordered large body of cavalry to be immediately despatched to meet artillery on way protect into camp day sarsfield remained in concealment among mountain until towards

have be goaded into fury by evil conduct of troop be now in state of insurrection cutting off murdering straggler driving in small party have good reason to regret that have brought with so small

esteem there have with now regiment of english grenadier few line regiment bulk of army be composed of dutch troop foreign mercenary latter have shown at battle of boyne that courage be not of high

grenadier leaped from trench than gun on wall musketry of defender poured fire upon while battery of besieger opened at same moment to cover assault through hail of fire grenadier kept on without faltering a neared breach irish rushed out through opening to meet there be desperate struggle half hidden from eye of on wall by cloud of smoke dust arose from combatant grenadier fighting with greatest gallantry won way to counter scarp regiment forced way through breach entered town irish troop clustered behind wall then closed in again barred breach to following dutch english regiment be marched up to aid rest of grenadier to cut way in after comrade troop be unable to imitate valour of grenadier got a far a counter scarp fire from wall be so deadly that must not be prevailed upon to

from a to peasantry can not say village within reach of william army in advance retreat have be destroyed vilest atrocity have be committed upon people greater part of men have in despair taken up arm when get chance will avenge wrong upon inoffensive protestant who have ventured to remain in dwelling savagery have begot savagery even protection order a have received must go for little with half

decidedly will take day two to pack up such valuable a must like to take away leave at limerick till return of happier day when be accomplished will carry out intention of making for galway leave house to take care of in meantime madam captain davenant said will leave son four of men who be now convalescent a protection fancy be fit to take saddle can strain point little leave still on sick list thank very much indeed mr conyers said while glance of satisfaction passed between walter claire will be satisfaction indeed will feel quite safe so long a son be here wish now have moved thing before have hoped that must have be allowed to remain in quarter here winter have not be for must never have decided a did next morning troop started place seems strangely quiet walter said a strolled out into garden with claire after breakfast seems terrible to think that in three four day will be deserted altogether that will have gone be horrid girl said with tear gathering in eye hate king william king james went on petulantly why ca fight quarrel out alone instead of troubling everyone else know of hate most there be compensation walter said with smile be sure see compensation girl said what do mean walter mean walter said that if have not quarrelled might never have met there be something in claire said softly know ought quite to hate after by will be seen that walter davenant claire conyers have already arrived at thorough understanding a to feeling towards other after a be natural between young person so situated talk wandered away into future present be already forgotten in house everyone be at work mr conyers servant have returned when came back to house be now busy with assistance of larry four trooper left behind in taking down packing picture taking up carpet getting furniture ready for removal in afternoon walter assisted in work of packing a be dressing for dinner larry a usual came into room suppose honour said after putting out walter clothes will be setting watch tonight yes larry be intending to do so think there be special occasion for do know honour hear tale of rapparees burning protestant house in district a long a troop be here av coorse boy kept away there be powerful lot of plunder in house news that troop have gone will go through country quick enough boy have have enough to turn into devil with what have gone through small blame to if take chance when find know yer honour that mr conyers miss claire be well nigh angel there be small fear that people around will lift finger agin in spite of having have own home burnt over head folk from distance know news that there be rich protestant house ready for sacking will travel quick hope honour will get lady to move out of place tomorrow whether ould picture thing be ready not do think be a serious a larry faith do yer honour know how bitter folk be there can not be danger larry a long a be here rapparees must never attack house have general protection with officer trooper of king to guard be must not answer for larry said shaking head boy be just disperate must care nothing for protection unless there be force to back think that a catholic have be robbed by protestant be only fair that must get turn now if be honour must lay plan out tonight how to get away rest of just a if be assured must come before morning why have heard nothing certain larry have not must tell honour at once know what people think feel know that rapparees have be plundering destroying protestant house around will guess that lady will be moving now that troop be gone besides wo have heard that news have gone round for waggon to come to take away thing earnestness with larry spoke convinced walter that danger be serious larry be not given to magnify danger usually treated risk with carelessness indifference walter knew that must gather from stableman people who brought in provision much more a to state of popular feeling in country than be likely to know accordingly went down to dinner grave preoccupied mr conyers soon noticed change in manner a soon a servant have retired asked if have received bad news no said trying to speak lightly boy larry have be trying to scare about rapparees although think that there be danger to be apprehended from do think that must be just a well to hurry on preparation a much a possible for claire to go in to limerick tomorrow afternoon can finish packing up of good wish to take can not get off tomorrow can be sent in next day mr conyers looked grave have heard of rapparees in neighbourhood walter said have heard of sad excess in part of country nothing in neighbourhood there have be small temptation for about here walter said for house within mile be stripped by williamites catholic protestant be same to besides knew well that sarsfield horse must soon have put stop to sort of thing now wish to alarm in slightest think that there be real cause for anxiety even if be in neighbourhood rapparees will hardly venture attack upon house occupied by even few of troop still be always wisest to be prepared therefore must like for to arrange exactly what have best be done in event of attack of course will see that door lower window be securely fastened will have men from stable into house so will be nine ten men in enough hope for circumstance still merely a matter of discussion let suppose worst let imagine house surrounded door burst in resistance on point of being overpowered what must be best plan for making escape be frightened claire went on seeing how pale girl have become general when be going to fight battle however sure may be of success decides upon route by army will retreat in case of defeat be only taking same precaution if there be to be retreat made at mr conyers said prefer that must be made now do really think that there be real danger of attack think that there be danger of attack mr conyers have reason for supposing that there be particular danger night then claire will at once start for town under escort of two of men must be folly indeed to run risk of attack here if house be to be burned must be burned for if be beaten off once must come again when house be undefended a for thing must be quiet tonight can be sent in tomorrow a arranged thing be to go be got together do think that best way walter said of course will ride in with hand over to friend be going to in town will then come back here again with light heart own be nervous at thought of claire being here must rapparees attack house mind walter there be to be fighting if come tonight have rather that took everything than that must risk life in defence silver valuable took across before be safe in limerick a for other thing can go now mind will not leave unless have promise that if band of men come tonight to sack place men will offer resistance if come in number render successful resistance out of question promise that will not draw trigger mr conyers in case be satisfied walter against men peasant have quarrel walter at once called larry larry get horse saddled tell browning to saddle place two pillion behind saddle mr conyers daughter be going to ride into limerick at once lord be praised larry said piously be best news have heard many day larry mr conyers said tell three boy in stable to saddle three best horse ride with if lose everything else may a well retain for must not be easy to buy others now in ten minute be ready for start walter trooper took place in saddle chair be brought out mr conyers claire mounted behind walter have asked mr conyers to take seat on pillion on horse did not answer when walter turned to see that be comfortably placed behind found that be claire who be seated there mamma told to girl said suppose thought be perhaps last ride must take together for present claire must say for present hope will not be long before be together again for good added in low voice mr conyers made comment when dismounted entered house of friend at limerick upon claire swollen eye flushed cheek said goodbye lightly to walter thanked for escort said that hoped to see with household good on following afternoon on leaving went straight to house where officer of acquaintance be quartered hullo davenant did expect to see here at time of evening heard be still laid up with wound be old affair now walter said be not quite strong again there be little matter now have come in to ask if will let have five twenty of men have strong reason to believe that be likely one of band of rapparees will make attack on mr conyers house tonight tenant have be asked to send in waggon tomorrow to remove of furniture in here think probable will try to take what fancy before start have brought mr conyers daughter into town a have only four men can not defend house if be attacked in force wish must let have five twenty men sergeant just for tonight will march in with baggage in afternoon certainly will captain donovan said need not disturb colonel at time of evening will take on there be just that number quartered in storehouse close to gate will go down with at once turn out give order will be good thing for rapparees to have lesson bring disgrace upon cause by doings in few minute men who have not retired to bed be turned out have got four mile march before boy walter said when be drawn up there will be pint of good wine supper for when get there so step out a briskly a can after cordial goodnight to captain donovan walter placed at head of infantry in little over hour arrived at house knocked loudly at door minute later larry put head out of window above who be there what do want knocking at peaceful house at time of night have best go away boy for house be chock full of soldier be only waiting for order to blow to smithereens walter burst into laugh very well done larry be with soldier so need give order to men to fire larry gave cry of satisfaction ran down to open door be glad be to see master walter entirely have be listening ever since went when tramp of foot made sure be boy gave order that there be to be resistance larry be going to resist honour thought might just frighten away now larry get up pint of wine for of good fellow what victual can find in house need have fear of attack tonight when soldier have finished supper lay down in hall walter placed sentry at window at side of house then lay down on sofa for ride to limerick back have greatly fatigued much to surprise for have idea how far strength have be pulled down be aroused just a day be breaking by loud knocking at door at same moment shot be fired from window above soldier have started to foot seized arm a ran out bade follow upstairs threw up window who be what do want never mind who be voice replied want door opened have best do quick look here man walter said in loud steady voice there be thirty soldier in house if give word will get such volley among that half of will never go home to tell about so warn to depart quietly be lie man said if be officer have got only four men know want to do harm want to harm lady what be in house be ours be law of william troop mean to act up to chorus of approbation rose from throng of peasant gathered round door few of carried musket greater part be armed with rude pike show yourselves at window boy walter said to men level musket fire until give word be light enough for without to make out threatening figure showed at window with cry of alarm ran back among shrub for shelter now see walter said that have spoken truth have thirty soldier here know a well a do what will come of if attempt to break into house for shame men deed bring disgrace on king cause on religion be not because scum who march with dutchman behave like brutal savage that must do same there be plenty of work for in fighting against enemy of country instead of frightening woman pillaging house return to home better still go join king army fight like men for home religion listened there be answer rapparees knew have chance of breaking into house so defended when walter ceased man slunk away in darkness next morning number of waggon arrived walter with aid of soldier have satisfaction of loading with everything of value in house of escorting without interruption to limerick mr conyers be filled with gratitude when heard event of night how narrowly daughter have escaped attack one of principal tenant have come in with waggon agreed to move into house with wife family until must return seeing that now everything worth taking have be removed thought there be little chance of attempt to destroy house chapter winter quarter two three day later captain davenant returned to limerick with troop have stopped at house on way learned there of move have be made well walter so nearly have to defend mr conyers against odds again said a walter joined in marketplace where troop be dismounting have come here for day only for be on way south be thought likely that enemy next move may be against cork so of be detached in direction to mind went on after have seen troop quartered in house formerly belonged to protestant be now used a barrack in opinion be wasting precious time ought not to allow enemy to go into winter quarter best season be just coming on can stand wet far better than can ought not to give moment rest must keep army together beat up one garrison after threaten strongest place compel to keep constantly on move before spring completely wear out exhaust whom can not conquer if england found that have whole work to begin over again must think twice before went further petty german prince must not find men so ready to embark in quarrel with have concern when learned that who have done so have laid bone in swamp of ireland without mercenary william must find hard to gather army for english have heart whatever in war if remain inactive winter enable to retain foothold everywhere fresh reinforcement will arrive in spring so bit by bit ireland will be won be disheartening in extreme after seeing enemy retire repulsed utterly disheartened from athlone limerick to allow unmolested to rest gather strength again if must get rid of french there must be hope for have scarce fired shot since war began yet assume superiority over general thwart at turn not only refuse to combine in action prevent doing so since boyne army have lain inactive have done nothing although might have done everything ireland be open to on day when william with force sat down here before limerick why must have marched straight for dublin captured before william heard that have crossed shannon might have cut off supply from waterford might have starved out in camp here have have game in hand have allowed to slip altogether through finger only hope have now be that before spring french will go be too clear that louis have intention whatever of helping in earnest have chosen must time during last six month have landed army here must have decided struggle instead of that have sent five thousand men have in return a many of best soldier officer sent seem to have be furnished with secret instruction not only to hing to prevent from doing anything whom must like to see in command father must not care much walter so that be one man have rather have soldier might take at random from army so that possessed fair share of common sense than chaos now prevails of course man whom must rather have be sarsfield whether be great general not have mean of knowing for have never yet have slightest opportunity of showing think that have made most of what chance have have save that one dash against artillery convoy have done nothing a cavalry be under command must if chose snap finger at pretension of french act independently think might have done far more than have done still be most prominent leader posse confidence of irish of class if be in supreme command there must be sure be complete change in tactic instead of waiting everywhere to be attacked must take offensive even if be unable to meet william force in pitched battle believe that be perfectly capable of doing so must be able to harass exhaust to such point william must be only too glad to grant term might demand to bring war to end after having dined captain davenant went with walter to call upon mr conyers hearing that be about to march with troop to cork mr conyers said oh captain davenant will not take under protection there be afraid of travelling with claire to galway in present disturbed state of country must find easier to take passage to england from cork than from galway certainly must mr conyers there be formal war between england ireland trading vessel still ply between cork bristol agree with that must not be safe for two protestant lady to travel without protection from here to galway will be only too glad for to journey with daughter know can ride of country pony for can ride too if there be occasion one of horse be perfectly quiet have often ridden by side of mr conyers so there will be difficulty on score in case captain davenant said consider matter a arranged will be ready to start tomorrow early certainly captain davenant have preparation to make furniture thanks to walter be saved have be stowed away in cellar of warehouse here be safe unless william return batter whole town to piece silver other valuable friend here will take care of till better time so have only to pack two valise mount servant will find situation here daughter maid bridget two three others have offered to accompany to england have decided to take one directly get to bristol will write to husband who have given address in london dublin so that will doubtless join in very short time party started next morning reached cork without adventure a there be english troop in part of country three day after arrival mr conyers took passage for herself claire in trader about to sail for bristol evening before sailed mr conyers have long talk with captain davenant while two young people have slipped off for last walk together of course captain davenant began have seen a well a have how thing stand between claire walter be very young strange circumstance of time manner in have be thrown together have combined to render position peculiar believe nay be sure that on side affection be deep will be lasting quite agree with mr conyers at rate a far a son be concerned walter have never spoken to on subject suppose father son be le given to confidence of sort than mother daughter walter be deeply earnestly attached to daughter be unquestionable indeed must be singular be otherwise have stood passive in matter simply because saw that took step to keep apart must not have seen at early period of acquaintance in what direction matter be tending frankly mr conyers said gave matter thought during first stay with have regarded claire a child did not at first occur to that there must be danger of falling seriously in love for year to come when eye be opened to true state of thing found little girl have lost heart must have wished otherwise mean a to worldly matter went on hastily seeing that captain davenant be about to speak that weighed absolutely nothing with indeed may be considered to be well matched in respect if war be decided in favour of king william claire will be rich heiress if on other hand cause triumph will regain confiscated estate while will lose ours so that there be consider inequality whatever in position difficulty of course to allude be religion be naturally grave obstacle fear that husband will regard a such even more strongly than do be however extremely attached to claire will feel sure when see that happiness be at stake come round to view of matter there be said with smile catholic catholic just a there be protestant protestant must rather see claire in grave than married to many catholic know walter be bigot indeed captain davenant said came over to country when catholicism be religion of england have maintained religious belief of father own that what may call political protestantism be hateful to between such catholicism a mine such protestantism a yours see such broad distinction a must cause to hate other be just view mr conyers agreed difference between creed be political rather than religious in case consider that when of party be bigoted chance of happiness be greater in case where man be catholic woman protestant than in opposite case think so too captain davenant said at rate think that walter claire must be likely to quarrel over respective opinion think not mr conyers agreed with smile do wish with heart that have be otherwise a be not so for part be determined to make best of circumstance be young be possible that may in time come to think alike one way other be not one of who think that there be one way to heaven must walter day win claire over to way of thinking will not consider that have forfeited chance be quite a likely to be other way captain davenant said walter be good lad brave one with claire pretty winning way question if young lady have not more will of own more mind than walter have hope may agree to go own way think that if continue to live in country will probably do so for here unhappily political difference build up wall between two branch of christianity if must come that must day leave unhappy country settle in england where same ill feeling doe not exist there be saying what may happen well at rate captain davenant be satisfactory that view on subject agree that be willing to make best of what can not consider to be misfortune here come young people have doubt laughed that have be swearing vow of eternal fidelity well be young ourselves once be not too old yet mr conyers to feel enjoyment in happiness of young people next morning mr conyers claire sailed for england military event shortly afterwards took place left walter little time for thought on other subject on st of september two day after departure of mr conyers heavy cannonading be heard from fort at mouth of cork harbour soon afterwards horseman galloped into town with news that english fleet have forced entrance in spite of fire from fort fleet bore five thousand men under command of earl of marlborough english party at court have long be mortified disgusted at manner in english have be ignored by william military command bestowed upon foreigner discontent caused by want of success have attended operation in ireland have greatly strengthened party have now succeeded in getting independent english expedition sent off under command of english general william be much annoyed at for brilliant success attained by marlborough must have increased feeling against foreign favourite have therefore despatched division of general scravenmore to besiege town on land side have placed in command of duke of wirtemberg whose rank a prince a general of higher rank than marlborough must enable to claim supreme command to carry off honour of success might be gained force arrived before town within day of appearance of fleet marlborough have already made good use of time for immediately leading vessel have effected passage troop be landed in boat battery attacked in rear carried rest of fleet then entered on rd th troop be landed on south bank of river commenced march towards city sailor dragging gun wirtemberg immediately sent to marlborough to claim command of whole force marlborough replied that commission be independent one denied authority of of william foreign officer in ireland stated haughtily that troop be british british officer wirtemberg be greatly offended that english general must affect to look down upon dane german french other foreign ragamuffin who composed command insisted strongly upon claim marlborough maintained position wirtemberg be driven at last to propose that must command on alternate day marlborough agreed to proposal position of cork be not strong one although in day before use of artillery be considered well nigh impregnable being built upon island marsh formed by river lea completely surrounded by two branch of river upon three side be surrounded at short distance only by high hill completely commanded hill be defended only by castle fort of great strength garrison be small for irish be taken by surprise by arrival of marlborough expedition have prepared only for siege by wirtemberg foreign division be therefore obliged to abandon shandon castle two adjoining fort defended hill on north of city wirtemberg dane at once took possession of work planting gun there opened fire on northern quarter of city marlborough constructed battery at monastery called red abbey on south point of river where be separated from city only by stream narrow strip of marshy ground gun soon made breach in wall marlborough prepared to storm place for at low tide be possible to wade across marsh river garrison well aware that must not long defend place now offered to capitulate on same term william have granted to garrison of town have captured namely that must be allowed to march out with honour of war with arm baggage to make way unmolested to limerick prince of wirtemberg be strongly in favour of term being granted marlborough peremptorily refused while sharp dispute took place between two officer before conclusion must be arrived at tide rose regiment drawn up ready to cross river must no longer pas firing then recommenced on side notwithstanding effort of besieged to repair injury to breach daily increased in size wirtemberg moved force round from north side to take share in assault at low tide english dane advanced against breach under heavy fire from wall struggled through marsh entered river even at low tide reached to shoulder suffering heavily from fire pushed forward until nearly reached breach here duke of grafton who commanded british column fell dead with many officer men rest maintained order be about to make dash at breach when governor accompanied by lord tyrone raised white flag after short parley be agreed that garrison must become prisoner of war be to be protected in person private property city be to be preserved from injury citizen property be to be respected captain davenant troop have remained idle during siege a there be work for cavalry be quartered near infantry regiment have be raised by macfinn o'driscol from among own tenantry be commanded by o'driscol be relation of mr davenant two commander be often together felt that city must speedily fall unless irish army moved down to relief agreed that if surrendered must make effort to escape with troop for have faith in observance of term of capitulation might be made accordingly a soon a be known that governor have surrendered that gate of town be to be handed over to british o'driscol captain davenant formed up command opening one of gate marched boldly out exact term on garrison have surrendered be not known marlborough be near breach arranging for troop to take possession of gate on side consequently besieging force opposite gate from little column have marched out supposed that in accordance with arrangement be coming out to lay down arm therefore stood aside a column passed being far more intent upon plunder expected to gather in cork than on anything else a few minute later gate be opened troop poured into city further thought be given to little force have marched out five hundred infantry troop of horse be safe from pursuit before news of audacious ruse have practised reached ear of general inside town article of treaty be at once violated troop entered town in crowd incited a in dublin by mob calling protestant proceeded to plunder house assault catholic inhabitant governor m'carty be wounded earl of tyrone clancarty with difficulty made escape from mob many be killed great destruction of property took place before marlborough wirtemberg entered town put stop to disorder inflicted great discredit upon a have made arrangement to ensure safety of inhabitant have solemnly guaranteed be now october marlborough at once set about investment of kinsale on very evening of day entered cork sent off five hundred horse towards town next day marched thither at head of infantry work of kinsale consisted of two fort of considerable strength called old fort charles fort be well supplied with store provision for siege on approach of besieger governor set fire to town retired to fort in answer to summons to surrender replied that must be time enough to talk about month hence marlborough ordered general tettau to cross river in boat with eight hundred picked men to carry old fort by storm assault be made with great determination bravery work be strong stoutly defended british be about to fall back discomfited when fortune came to assistance loose powder ignited fired magazine by more than two hundred men of garrison be killed work seriously injured after disaster governor abandoned fort withdrew with survivor of garrison to charles fort marlborough at once commenced siege of position for fifteen day place resisted effort heavy loss however garrison have suffered by explosion in old fort rendered unable by sally to interfere with work of besieger be carried on with great vigour for marlborough feared that approach of wet season must put stop to operation when therefore governor offered to surrender on term of being permitted to march away with garrison arm baggage honour of war taking with person who wished to accompany together with property to limerick marlborough at once granted term demanded advent of winter now put stop to regular operation war of skirmish continued british in quarter be greatly straitened for forage provision in dublin work of confiscation went on merrily greater part of catholic proprietor of town be thrown into prison various indictment against country gentleman followed by confiscation of property be hurried through court with merest shadow of legal form for defendant being absent unacquainted with what be being done in dublin be only necessary to recite accusation to find accused guilty to pas sentence of confiscation being work of few minute only nothing must be done however to carry sentence into effect for william troop still possessed only ground troop stood upon town occupied outside limit whole country be against earl of marlborough have returned to england immediately after surrender of kinsale general ginckle who have now succeeded to command determined to harass enemy to increase resource at disposal by expedition into southwest of ireland covered by cork limerick have hitherto be free from presence of english troop therefore pushed strong body of cavalry infantry westward from cork kinsale succeeded in making master of castle haven baltimore bantry several other castle on line of coast district be wild mountainous pass might have be easily held against advance peasant have not be organized for resistance serious opposition be encountered colonel o'driscol cousin of macfinn o'driscol captain o'donovan two of principal proprietor of neighbourhood soon arrived upon spot assembled large irregular force consisting chiefly of mounted peasant with soon cooped invader up in castle have taken o'driscol next attempted recovery of own castle haven be strongly defended stood on cliff overhanging sea wild peasant be ill adapted for such work be repulsed by english garrison o'driscol killed force be advancing from north macfinn o'driscol with regiment pressed forward along line of bandon river besieged captured castle haven expelled english garrison from baltimore bantry general tettau have also marched out from cork with several regiment of infantry dragoon with intention of penetrating into kerry enemy light troop harassed night day wasted country defended pas be obliged to return to cork without having accomplished anything time ginckle be urging upon lord justice who be now real ruling party in ireland to issue proclamation offering pardon security for person property to who came in urging that be impossible that must ever subdue country while whole population have everything at stake in opposing be supported by king william who be most anxious to bring struggle to end lord justice protestant party at dublin who be bent upon dividing among property of catholic throughout ireland turned deaf ear to argument of ginckle friend in london have sufficient power to prevent king from insisting upon own wish being carried into effect after taking part in operation in kerry captain davenant troop returned to limerick around city greater part of irish army be still encamped chapter dangerous mission walter captain davenant said to son one day when returned from council in have taken part at quarter of general sarsfield have mission for in dublin be necessary in first place to communicate with of friend there in second to ascertain a far a can plan of enemy during next campaign there be few of here who must not be readily recognized in dublin therefore when there seemed difficulty in selecting someone to undertake duty said that thought must be likely to succeed better than most have not be time in dublin question whether single person there must be likely to recognize will of course be in disguise youth will be in favour say there be danger in such undertaking think risk be greater than have frequently run be sure must readily undertake mission thought must answer for intelligence a well a discretion will undertake certainly father if think capable of said be dull enough here now that wet weather have thoroughly set in will really like adventure when be to set out tomorrow instruction letter be to carry will be drawn up tonight can set off after breakfast will ride with with part of troop until be past point where be likely to fall in with body of enemy cavalry after will of course shift for think have best travel on foot dressed a peasant in way will attract attention pas through town occupied by enemy without questioning think father will take larry with if have objection must be real thing must do most of talking besides sometimes be very useful to have someone to send with message to put on guard when one went in anywhere take by mean walter indeed agree

autumn when french arrive there will be general advance now be ready to answer question be instructed to ask in first place sir how many men do think must be ready to join in rising in dublin must depend upon whether irish army be advancing in direction in case seven eight thousand men must rise unless there be hope of early assistance think that above thousand must be relied on have about number on list a see must hing unassisted there be three four thousand troop here protestant mob who must join must number seven eight thousand at very least therefore attempt to rise in face of such odds unless after crushing defeat of william troop must be out of question a said if army be marching on dublin protestant must be thinking more of taking to ship than fighting catholic in city must then join movement think general hoped that must have mustered stronger force sir so must year ago mr o'brian said constant persecution ill treatment of catholic have caused large number of to leave town many of younger more determined men have made way west joined army fear that number have given be quite a many a can be relied upon general be in hope walter said that diversion might have be caused in spring by rising in dublin must even if unsuccessful compel dutch general to keep large force here might have be done six eight month ago mr o'brian said spirit of people here have be very much broken a well a number diminished can rely upon that if anything like general rising can be got up will do share here with thousand men can rely on feel that open insurrection must be hopeless must fire city at score of point night after night so alarm citizen that must insist on considerable force being kept here for protection must aid friend outside know nothing a to what be being done there have only charge of matter inside city be well aware of sir have to call upon who have thread of movement throughout country in hand only arrived today came to first in order might know how

country be more encouraging than have received from mr o'brian hatred of invader be greater than ever peasantry in part be in state of sullen desperation indeed enemy must nowhere move in small party without certainty of being attacked pressing need be arm great part of peasant who owned gun have already joined army rest possessed weapon beyond roughly made pike scythe fixed on long handle be formidable weapon in sudden attack on small party must not enable peasant to cope with chance of success against considerable body of troop especially if provided with artillery person whom walter saw be in communication with disaffected in part of country agreed in opinion that general rising must be delayed until striking success be obtained by irish army when whole country must rise fall upon enemy wherever met with plan for rising having be discussed arranged after several interview at of most of leader of movement be present walter prepared to start again for camp with news that first

flying stone ran lightly downstairs opened door at back of house found in yard wall be not very high spring enabled to get finger on top be soon sitting there then dropped into road behind sound of fall caught ear of soldier who be stationed at back of house from whence have started fifty yard away there be sharp challenge then a answer be given four five shot be fired there be rush of foot along road a be only in principal thoroughfare that few light be exhibited road must have be in complete darkness have not cloud just at moment blown away from face of moon be half full shot however have be fired hastily walter dashed off at full speed unhurt heard shout from roof of house one two shot be fired chance of being hit be small sound however told soldier crowd in front street that fugitive be escaping at rear there be general rush down street to next turning walter be hundred yard ahead before mob reached turning be rapidly distancing soldier who be pursuing unfortunately however there be many people hurrying from side attracted by shouting firing several of in response to shout of soldier tried to stop a dashed past failing to do so at once joined in pursuit walter saw that must be captured if kept straight on for group of men approaching warned by shout of pursuer prepared to seize therefore turned sharp down narrow lane to left fifty yard be through found on road running by side of liffey without moment hesitation sprang across plunged into river even in moment of spring perceived that tide be running up have be ebbing must have made down tried to gain shore under shelter of shipping moored below be useless to think of swimming against tide pursuer be few yard behind second time rose to surface for air two three shot be fired dived again when next came up took deliberate look round in order to judge of chance be now about third of way across shore have left be already lined with people several be gathering on opposite bank two three shot struck water close to knew that be visible to pursuer taking long breath again went under water be first rate swimmer diver having bathed regularly summer winter in bay below castle have time turned face towards shore have quitted tide knew be sweeping up kept under water a long a possibly must swimming hardest when must keep under longer turned on back permitted to rise slowly to surface moment mouth nostril be above water got rid of pent up air took breath sank again swam on until felt by ground rising rapidly in front of that be close to edge then cautiously came to surface looked round be close under bank from have started two three hundred yard higher up bank rose straight up twelve foot above must hear person talking close to edge there be be pretty nearly over other side see will catch a get out believe have sunk never must keep under time one of bullet must have hit then voice in crowd shouted there be head just in middle of river stone splashed in stream be followed by volley of other stone several musket shot in same direction walter having now got breath sank head quietly below water swam on again keeping close under bank whenever came up for air listened for moment shot be still being fired below knew that attention of upon shore be still directed towards centre of stream that there be small chance of anyone leaning over to gaze down into water close to foot hope rose a minute placed further from pursuer must no longer hear voice above when rose swam on for upwards of mile struggled up bank well beyond wall of town lay down few minute to rest walked mile along bank then entering river again swam across for road be to follow be on south side of made way across country until saw small shed entered finding hay in loft stripped off wet clothes crept deep into hay to warm for water be cold be shivering from head to foot a soon a be light again put on clothes started at run maintained until be in thorough glow in spite of wet clothing did not approach village at have arranged to meet larry until sun be high clothes have dried so far that must not attract attention of anyone who might be passing then went into deserted village took up place in one of ruined cottage from must obtain view of road from dublin hour later saw larry coming along although there be one else in sight someone might be going other way walter therefore remained in hiding place till larry be abreast of when showed head in doorway called by name larry gave cry of joy rushing in threw arm round burst into tear be terrible fright have given exclaimed when must find word have be breaking heart night sure thought be at bottom of river not time larry though be pretty close thing did see sure did larry said be sitting on doorstep watching house when saw sodgers coming along turned up from side street be so close that saw must not get across get door opened in time to give alarm then began to knock at door for bit felt so wake must not move then crowd began to gather then said to myself master will try to shlip out at back of house so went round found thief of world waiting for ye there be sure ye be one to let take ye widout struggle for so moved bit away jist waited time seemed long when on suddint heard sodgers sing out then fire set out to run never doubted be so off went behindt a hard a must tare be long in coming up to at first thought ye must get clean away then heart fell when saw villain attempt to seize ye when thought be over ye turned sharp off made for river be with first of to get there ran accidental against first sodger who got musket to shoulder there be saying where ball went to cursed for clumsy baste must have knocked down be in too great hurry to load again saw bullet strike water close to when came up again saw look round guessed ye be thinking what be best thing to do then saw more of ye did think have be hit for saw go down regular a if be diving in sea for pleasure not sharp a must have done if bullet have hit guessed a be meaning to swim up stream did only thing must to stop from following up by shouting that saw ye throwing big stone into water close to where have seen head before knowing that by time ye must be nigh hundred yard up fool did stop to think took to throwing stone firing a hard a must by time have done knew if ye be alive ye must be nigh quarter of mile up river of did run up kept with sorrah glimpse of ye did get at last everyone made sure that be kilt entirely went way went off to lodging took good care not to go in be well did for hour later troop of sodgers came up of went in be led by black villain who used to come wid message from mr o'brian have doubt be who set sodgers upon anyhow did find much there four of waited till morning inside others going away so that if have got out of river might catch ye in trap waited till have left morning thinking suppose that be use to stay longer then started to see if honour be here sometimes thought must find then again tould that if have be alive must have seen come up agin for knowing strength of stream how fast must swim must tell pretty nigh about where must come up if be keeping straight up river how did manage at master walter turned swam back again to bank larry knew everyone must be watching middle of river must not be looking at water in front of of course stream took up long way only came up once on back took breath went down again second time be right under bank well out of sight though must hear talking above be just when looked round then that saw throwing stone firing into middle of river two hundred yard lower down after have only to keep on swimming under water close to bank be how ye managed be grand thought entirely to swim back to never thought of be most afraid must go for opposite shore there be plenty have gathered there ready to seize did think must have missed if 'd kept on in middle have be puzzled altogether a to what must have become of if ye be really alive have got bread in bundle here bottle of spirit have better have bite sup before go on for be pretty nigh a white a ghost ye be meal seemed to put new life strength into walter after conclusion be ready to step out again with fresh energy thought better at once to leave road tramp across country by so doing avoided party of english troop reached irish army without adventure walter at once reported to general sarsfield related have taken place in dublin have done excellently mr davenant escape from capture be extraordinary one unfortunately betrayal of what be doing arrest of friend be likely to upset plan have arranged hope not sir walter said know that be careful to have written document for be always possible that house of catholic might be searched may be so general said fear that traitor will have managed to overhear of conversation fact of meeting of escape will in tell against sufficiently to ensure being kept in prison at rate for considerable time even if released must be suspected person must be unable to make slightest move general prevision be justified whole of arrested be retained in prison for month such general rising a have be planned be ever carried into effect during winter store ordnance arrived from france for supply of irish army from england for use of british great number of officer from continent also joined army discontent among irish at apathy of france be extreme have embarked in war on strength of promise of king louis none of promise have be fulfilled supply of arm money have be most meagre few thousand troop sent have never taken part in of operation coming have be much more than counterbalanced by troop sent from ireland in exchange for additional cause of discontent be given by fact that william exchanged prisoner taken in ireland for dutch prisoner in hand of louis irish so handed over be incorporated in french army so great be discontent have proclamation of pardon protection be offered whole irish army must have disbanded resistance ceased louis alarmed at finding that be likely william must be freed from trouble at home be at liberty to give whole attention to war on continent sent fresh promise of large speedy aid despatched general saint ruth to take command in ireland in place of lauzun who have returned to france appointment caused fresh discontent among irish cause have already be well nigh ruined by interference incapacity of french general on retirement of lauzun have confidently expected that sarsfield must be appointed commander in chief that henceforth there must be unity of design in operation saint ruth be accompanied by large number of young french officer whose demeanour still further widened breach between french irish saint ruth at once inspected army now concentrated between limerick athlone except that there be great deficiency in horse for cavalry army be greatly improved in discipline appearance since battle of boyne for officer petty officer men have learned duty army have passed winter in comfortable quarter have be well supplied with food difficulty be to find rapparees have carried off many of charger of english cavalry by stratagem be common practice of danish other foreign troop to sell horse to irish at outpost pretend that be stolen still supply be altogether insufficient saint ruth finding that must not get horse from enemy determined to take from friend proclamation be accordingly issued inviting gentry throughout country held by irish to meet at limerick mounted accoutered in best manner report be spread that important communication be to be made to gentleman of country from king james that many mark of honour distinction be to be conferred accordingly there be very numerous attendance of gentry on day fixed saint ruth appeared on ground with large body of cavalry made speech to gentleman complimented on punctual attendance gallant appearance told that be necessary that man must make sacrifice for defence of religion estate requested to hand over horse to cavalry then at once rode off ground leaving cavalry to take possession of horse anger expostulation be useless gentleman have to return on foot sadder men army obtained large valuable addition of horse saint ruth be able to march out at head of twenty thousand foot five thousand well appointed cavalry direction be athlone towards point ginckle be also directing movement having assembled whole force at mullingar withdrawing garrison from almost town in order to raise force in field alarm in dublin be in consequence extreme council lord justice besought ginckle not to leave without protection only replied that have in own power to put end to war by publishing declaration of pardon security for person property a must satisfy irish in james army council even in moment of alarm refused to renounce golden hope of confiscation ginckle first attack be directed against village of ballymore lay between mullingar athlone be defended by thousand cavalry infantry sergeant few men be posted in castle on eminence distance from village first attack be made on castle sergeant little garrison made long gallant resistance savage dutchman be so infuriated at opposition that when at last post be taken ordered gallant sergeant to be at once hung then sent word to garrison of village that if did not surrender must serve a have served sergeant be unmoved by threat made long gallant defence against whole of ginckle army dutch general be unable to overcome resistance till at last offered fair term of surrender position being strong important one ginckle spent day in adding to defensive work irish have erected before moved forward sat down in front of athlone army be well provided with heavy artillery everything necessary for siege be firmly resolved that there must be repetition of disastrous failure of preceding autumn chapter athlone irish have time determined to defend not only that portion of athlone situated on west of river english town on east fortification here be repaired added to town be abundantly supplied with store ammunition be however unable to resist heavy artillery ginckle brought to play against wall building tower crumbled beneath heavy cannonade although irish repelled with great slaughter several assault upon place became at last untenable abandoned that part of town retired by bridge across river to irish town british on entering eastern town found mere mass of ruin with dead body of soldier lying everywhere half covered with wreck of work have died in defending taking of portion of athlone have cost ginckle dearly be little nearer object of effort for be separated from irish town by shannon western arch of bridge be broken down by defender eleven large gun three mortar now came up from dublin erected succession of battery upon ruin of english town opened fire upon castle of athlone although building of great strength soon crumbled into ruin beneath fire of heavy artillery brought to bear upon mill stood in river be connected with bridge be set on fire sixty soldier posted in being unable to escape be burned night day seven great battery played incessantly upon town on th of june thirty waggon loaded with powder hundred cart with cannon ball arrived from dublin enabled besieger to keep up fire without intermission interior of town be reduced to ruin nothing remained erect save city wall in breach a fast a be made be repaired by irish slaughter among so employed be very heavy there be lack of men place of who fell being at once supplied by others willing to give life in defence of town at last there be nothing more that besieger must do town be reduced to ash river broken arch still separated from ruin to remain much longer where be be impossible for country on side be exhausted longer afforded food for man horse country people have fled from cruelty spoliation of ginckle foreign soldiery carrying with effect irish light troop armed peasantry hovered round camp laid country waste intercepted supply communication with dublin ginckle held council of war to consider what be to be done be admitted that must force passage of river without loss of time submit to alternative of retreat utter failure of campaign be finally resolved to attempt passage of bridge by throwing wooden gallery over broken arch forcing way across at cost additional battery be now raised on bank of river heavy fire be poured without intermission upon irish on side of broken arch party have erected breastwork on bridge at respective side of breach from behind day night continued musketry fire be kept up grenadier of english army throwing grenade into enemy work after day breastwork on irish side be set on fire by continued assault of shot grenade wattle of be composed dried by hot weather be soon in blaze under cover of flame smoke english ran forward great beam have prepared in readiness threw across gap in bridge fire from battery on english side be directed against burning breastwork while grenadier hastened to lay plank across beam to complete bridge work be well nigh done when irish sergeant ten men clad in armour leaped through flame of breastwork began to hew with ax at beam plank for moment british be paralysed at daring action then battery musketry fire again opened storm of shot bullet swept across bridge whole of gallant fellow fell dead in moment party similarly armed dashed through flame took place regardless of fire whirled ax nine fell last two gave final stroke to beam bridge fell with crash into river below two survivor recrossed breastwork joined friend within amid wild enthusiasm of defender enthusiasm in even baffled assailant joined for british grenadier gave cheer in token of admiration at gallantry devotion of deed in history there be record of more gallant action than performed by two sergeant twenty men who thus encountered almost certain death to maintain post destruction of temporary bridge filled ginckle officer with consternation manner in design have be baffled showed spirit of defender magnitude of task have undertaken be resolved at council be called to attempt one more effort before abandoning enterprise finished platform be constructed be to be thrown over arch chosen body of bravest troop in army be to throw across try to force passage at same time division be to cross river by ford near bridge to attempt to cross by bridge of pontoon prepared in readiness irish be informed by french deserter of what be going on in english camp early on morning of assault several strong division of irish army be seen marching down from camp two mile away into town here be drawn up in readiness to repulse assault british be time before be ready for attack at ten o'clock whole army stood in close order ready to advance first to move forward be who be to carry bridge irish gun still remained intact opened upon pressed forward along bridge to broken arch with le trouble than have be anticipated threw platform across instead of rushing forward at once grenadier stood behind breastwork hurled grenade at irish grenadier who stood in close order on opposite edge however stood ground hurled grenade with great effect into column one of exploded against english breastwork set on fire at once blazed up strong west wind be blowing drove smoke flame into face of english grenadier who for time strove in vain to extinguish flame notwithstanding heavy fire defender poured into have at last to fall back irish sallying from behind breastwork pulled down burning timber on to bridge be soon in flame other division of english army finding that grenadier on bridge made progress did not attempt to perform part of work finally whole retreated to camp that evening council of war be held matter now looked desperate fact that enterprise have time failed owing to hesitation of troop to push forward to attack of enemy made prospect appear more hopeless nevertheless in spite of opposition of general ginckle mackey council determined that one more attempt must be made that must be carried out at daylight next morning in hope of taking irish by surprise be accordingly given out that army must retreat in morning heavy gun be withdrawn from battery saint ruth who be convinced that athlone must not be taken who have spent greater portion of time in entertaining lady gentry of neighbourhood with ball fete fell into trap contrary to opinion advice of irish general recalled from town regiment have marched in morning replaced with only three battalion of inferior troop irish officer remonstrated warmly saint ruth to show disdain for opinion invited large party of lady gentleman to entertainment in evening in night british army prepared for attack commander of respective division led troop in person garrison of town be asleep in saint ruth camp festivity be over general officer have retired irish sentinel who noted movement in british camp supposed that be mustering to retreat thus three british column drew up inside town wall in readiness to advance without notion of purpose being entertained on opposite side of river one column headed by sixty chosen men in complete armour be to cross bridge throw platform over arch to cross by ford third by pontoon bridge when church bell tolled six three column advanced simultaneously before irish be thoroughly awake leading battalion have forded river platform be in place troop pouring into town few gun be hastily discharged then men of three irish regiment in town fled in haste to avoid capture by column pouring across river by ford pontoon bridge many indeed be captured whilst asleep saint ruth roused from sleep by sound of cannon ordered troop to arm be too late town rather ruin be in possession of british brilliant success have be won by valour determination of irish troop be forfeited by carelessness folly confidence of french general have listened to advice of irish officer attempt like have preceded must have failed in case there be nothing remained to ginckle precipitous retreat to dublin with loss of whole of advantage gained in previous campaign necessity of bringing war to end by concession of right privilege of irish catholic landowner whole course of history be changed by folly of one man ginckle have taken athlone be at vast cost of life be more than ever impressed with magnitude of task of subduing ireland so long a people be driven to desperation by threatened confiscation of land by persecution of religion king william too be more anxious than ever for termination of hostility on very day that news of fall of athlone reached issued proclamation offering protection security of possession continuance in office held under james to who must lay down arm in three week time issue of such proclamation a year before must have satisfied irish put stop to war be now too late promise made have be broken over over again irish have too much reason to fear that when opposition ceased council train of greedy adherent must again obtain ascendency must continue work of spoliation robbery moreover irish army did not feel in way beaten be not fault that second siege of athlone have not terminated a former siege that of limerick have done that ginckle army be not hurrying back defeated disorganized to dublin felt that at battle of boyne have suffered no defeat although in accordance with general plan have fallen back eagerly desired to fight one battle to prove in open field be more than match for mercenary of king council lord justice who be aghast at proclamation threatened to destroy hope of dividing among friend land of catholic of ireland did best to prevent acceptance by spreading rumour that be mere bait that promise must not be fulfilled while saint ruth french officer did best also to set irish against saint ruth who be really good officer be conscious that so far from having gained credit a have expected from command in ireland misfortune have happened be entirely attributed to longed for opportunity of wiping out slur on military reputation therefore urged upon irish general ginckle have indeed gained little that hope of william rested upon army alone that with defeat must demand obtain term liked to lay down besides be able to assure by advice from france that louis be making preparation for assisting on vastly larger scale than have previously done thus from combination of circumstance proclamation elicited response while siege of athlone be being carried on main body of sarsfield cavalry remained for most part in camp near town commander of small body of men like corp of captain davenant be regarded a irregular have liberty of action made long raid to east often spread confusion dismay among enemy by appearing suddenly when irish troop be believed to be within hundred mile went down joined peasant who be keeping up desultory fighting in neighbourhood of cork harassing english whenever moved from one point to sent out party to collect forage provision captain davenant who have more than once respectfully urged upon immense benefit must result be whole of irish cavalry to place upon line of enemy communication finding that irish general be unmoved by argument several time endeavoured to carry out idea a far a must be done with own small force inactivity of irish horse throughout long siege of athlone limerick except only upon occasion of raid upon siege train be almost inexplicable have nothing to fear from enemy cavalry to whom proved immensely superior whenever met during war have in power for month to cut british communication so oblige to detach so large force to keep road open that must have be unable to push on siege must indeed have be in danger of being attacked destroyed by irish infantry to raise siege fall back upon base dublin waterford only possible explanation can be offered be first that sarsfield although dashing commander in action be possessed of military genius second that be prevented from moving by jealousy of french commander in chief who did not wish to see credit of compelling enemy to fall back monopolized by irish cavalry third that sarsfield saw advantage must be obtained by throwing with cavalry in rear of enemy deliberately remained inactive rather than leave french general to act unchecked by presence at headquarters can never be decided to of alternative be due that irish cavalry remained for so long time inactive william after ginckle be permitted unmolested save by few detached body of horse to maintain long line of communication to base unchecked

hill marsh on left be deep glen beyond along whole front vast bog extended in most place impassable for horse foot on border of bog on left stood ruin of little castle of aughrim occupying only spot of firm ground led to camp to pas bog at point be necessary to go close by castle wall where there be broken path only wide enough for two men to pas abreast passage on right of bog be more open be marshy unsafe position be much stronger than irish have held at battle of boyne whereas on occasion have be very inferior in number to assailant be now superior by regiment in number in point of artillery english have here a at boyne overwhelming superiority ginckle moved forward slowly with caution halting on river suck until have be joined by available soldier in ireland on morning of th of july british army halted on edge of bog like great belt encircled irish within morning be foggy mist did not clear off until towards noon irish prepared for battle by having divine service performed

advanced against enemy right where stood house ground of urachree occupied by irish horse strong detachment of danish cavalry headed british column moved forward boldly quickening pace a approached irish on latter charging at full gallop wheeled about rode off at once in disorder ginckle immediately ordered two hundred of cunningham dragoon who be considered best cavalry in army to advance drive back irish horse dragoon advanced at trot seeing that irish quietly awaited coming halted behind hedge awaited arrival of infantry when came up cavalry again moved forward irish horse now fell back on little hill in rear where body of infantry be posted then faced to front charged broke english dragoon who retreated a dane have done in confusion eppinger dragoon be ordered up to support cunningham irish horse have also received reinforcement before arrived after fierce fight two english regiment be routed driven off field ginckle rallied added lord portland horse to number again sent against irish however have fallen back from urachree have taken up new position upon rivulet behind in front of solid ground by alone right wing of irish army must be approached here remained waiting onset of british cavalry perceiving that ground be becoming more more difficult soon came to halt then wheeling about fell back upon infantry seeing successful stand be made by small body of irish horse to advance of left wing that spirit with troop be behaving be greatly inferior to of irish ginckle called council of war opinion be greatly at variance be now nearly four o'clock be at first decided to postpone battle till morning messenger be sent to baggage column in rear to bring up tent other counsel finally prevailed order for tent be countermanded at half past four british infantry be ordered to advance pressed forward in solid mass across ground where cavalry fight have taken place irish horse fell back behind infantry who be posted behind substantial hedge intersected ground beyond rivulet heavy musketry fire be opened upon british infantry a advanced pressed forward in unbroken order till reached hedge be long obstinately contested irish have cut opening through hedge by must retire a fell back from hedge to hedge advancing british be received by fire from hedge on flank a well a from front a british poured regiment after regiment to attack saint ruth moved body of horse foot from left to support of right wing movement have be foreseen by ginckle who now gave order for several battalion of infantry to cross bog attack irish centre at point there be path across bog rather place where mud water be not so deep a at other point where be possible for to be forded ginckle have found peasant who for large sum of money disclosed passage traversed bog at narrowest point hill of kilcomeden here running out shoulder far into four regiment entered morass with order to cross make way to nearest hedge on sloping ground where be to post till cavalry who be to attempt passage by aughrim castle must come round to support first part of passage be unopposed difficulty of passing be great for men be frequently up to waist in mud too soft to afford firm footing solid enough to render extremely difficult for foot to be disengaged from at length a approached firmer ground irish infantry advanced towards edge of bog received with steady fire english although suffering heavily pressed forward without firing shot till ground became solid under foot when irish withdrew a upon right took post behind hedge everywhere intersected slope english seeing irish retire pressed forward fierce contest raged in inclosure irish according to preconceived plan falling gradually back british in ardour forgot order to halt at first hedge continued to press forward until constantly increasing number of enemy recalled to leader danger of position before be height of kilcomeden with strong force drawn up to receive while on flank enemy be crowding down to intercept retreat colonel earl who be senior officer looked anxiously towards right from quarter expected british cavalry to arrive to assistance sound reached from quarter while on left sound of conflict instead of advancing appeared to recede a if british column be being forced back advancing before own regiment called upon soldier to stand firm for retreat must be destruction only hope be to maintain position till assistance arrived when irish saw that enemy have halted must not be tempted to advance further poured down to attack through passage in hedge british might have defended hedge a irish have done soldier saw that must be taken in flank rear observing large body of cavalry ascending hill be seized with panic on first shock of irish infantry four regiment broke fled be hotly pursued slaughtered in great number irish cavalry pouring through opening in hedge have be prepared for at length fugitive reached edge of bog where gathered in confused mass officer in vain attempted to form into order cavalry charged down upon broke scattered drove into morass followed by irish infantry who be better acquainted with ground more accustomed to traversing bog soldier be driven into deepest most difficult portion of morass great slaughter took place british artillery be planted on edge of morass so mingled be two party that be unable to fire great number of english be killed colonel earl herbert with many officer men be taken prisoner remnant of british be driven completely across bog to shelter of own cannon while be passing in centre division of ginckle army consisting of english french infantry have crossed bog by passage more to right also have met with opposition in passing be only when reached hedge on firm ground that irish showed fired retreated division more cautious than of earl must not be tempted to pursue contented with maintaining ground under heavy fire awaiting anxiously arrival of british horse must see however sign of must perceive irish cavalry descending in large mass preparing to charge while infantry be forming for advance so far irish have be successful at point have repulsed attack made by british left have crushed brigade composed of flower of british infantry have assaulted centre be now preparing to destroy division stood unsupported on side of bog at moment tumult be heard on left wing of irish direction from british division expected relief irish aware of importance of pas of aughrim suspended attack to await event there saint ruth have directed operation of battle with a much skill a have prepared for assault have taken up position on point of hill whence have complete view of whole field of battle have moved troop with calmness judgment to meet of attack made upon when saw destruction of english regiment in centre exclaimed in full confidence of victory now will drive english to wall of dublin there be indeed one hope on part of english of retrieving day namely success of attempt to force passage at aughrim two horseman abreast must pas under castle wall saint ruth be aware of passage thought impassable for cavalry might easily have be made so by cutting deep gap across here a at athlone overconfidence proved destruction have however taken precaution to erect battery commanding passage have placed battalion of infantry there general talmash who commanded english cavalry knew that battle be lost unless must succeed at point at head of command led way along pas be not only narrow broken encumbered with ruin of castle wall saint ruth beheld attempt of cavalry with astonishment with remark be brave fellow be pity must be sacrificed sent order for irish horse to move forward prepare to charge moved down hill at head of officer to battery there be doubt a to what result must have be have irish horse charged be greatly superior in number english cavalry who have got across passage be still in confusion be suffering from fire of battery indeed even when in equal number william cavalry have never withstood charge of irish seemed that nothing must avert defeat of body on ginckle last hope rested at moment one of event by providence overrules calculation of man occurred cannonball struck saint ruth a stood in middle of battery killed instantly occurrence paralysed irish army sarsfield be away there be one to give order news that extraordinary calamity have happened spread rapidly men in battery ceased firing cavalry receiving order to charge remained immovable talmash took advantage of pause to get rest of cavalry across passage then with whole force moved towards centre a approached idea that unknown calamity of have heard be that british have defeated own left spread among irish began to fall back british column on edge of bog advanced ginckle pushed several fresh battalion across morass in centre irish infantry fell back disputing inch of ground cavalry be still without order for strangely enough one assumed command on death of saint ruth a night came on retreat of irish infantry became rout cavalry halted on summit of kilcomeden covered retreat extraordinary circumstance of irish army being left without order after death of saint ruth have never be explained command must have devolved upon sarsfield none of account of battle speak of a being present have certainly not be consulted by saint ruth have not be present at council of war before battle for bad feeling have existed between saint ruth since general arrived have broken out into open dispute since fall of athlone be inexplicable that there must have be second in command that one must have come forward to give order after death of general that victorious army must have be left a flock of sheep without shepherd up to moment of death of saint ruth loss of british have be very severe a have more than two thousand men killed wounded while of irish be trifling in subsequent struggle irish fighting man for without order object be slaughtered in vast number loss being estimated by british writer at seven thousand men number point to wholesale slaughter rather than to loss must have be inflicted upon brave army during little over hour of daylight crushing a defeat of irish have be victory be far from inspiring william army with confidence have felt at outset of war here a at athlone be almost miracle have saved english from terrible disaster irish have proved fully match for best soldier william must send against although infantry have suffered terribly in rout rank must be speedily filled up again while cavalry arm in irish have uniformly proved superiority have moved away from field of battle intact unbroken athlone aughrim therefore rendered william general more anxious than ever to bring struggle to end not by force of arm by offering concession to irish imminence of peril have cowed even party of confiscation offered opposition to issue by ginckle of proclamation renewing offer of william ginckle moved forward immediately after battle granted most liberal term to garrison of various small post came upon on arriving before galway permitted that town garrison to surrender on term of pardon for security of property estate freedom of religious worship permission for garrison to march away to limerick with drum beating colour flying british furnishing horse for transport of cannon baggage chapter fortunate recognition after capitulation of galway ginckle moved towards limerick king william who be absent on continent be most anxious for aid of army warring in ireland queen adviser considering that war be now virtually over ordered transport to ireland to take on board ten thousand men ginckle be allowed month delay be by mean sanguine a to position irish army be still a numerous a british be not discouraged by defeat at aughrim where considered rightly that victory have only be snatched from grasp by accident ginckle relied rather upon concession than force irish be divided into two party one of earnestly desired peace if must obtain fair term while other insisted that british must not be trusted to keep term might make sarsfield be at head of war party succeeded for present in preventing arrangement ginckle advanced slowly for have to march through waste desolate country sarsfield with cavalry hovered round intercepted communication be so short of draught horse that be only by forcing gentry of dublin to give up carriage horse for use of army that be enabled to move forward be not until end of august that sat down with siege train in front of limerick prepared for siege for moment party in favour of peace among irish have be silenced by news that twenty large ship of war with great number of transport store ship be being pushed forward at brest other french port to come to assistance ginckle occupied same ground william army have taken up in first siege directed attack chiefly upon english town a before irish communication be open with county of clare seventeen regiment of irish horse be encamped on clare side of river ginckle pushed on work with great vigour duty in trench be so severe that cavalry be compelled to take turn with infantry notwithstanding that siege artillery be much more powerful than william have at disposal little progress be made town be set on fire several time flame be speedily extinguished a inhabitant have left city erected tent on clare side under protection of cavalry little harm be done to while siege be going on number of desultory engagement took place in different part of country between protestant militia have be lately raised band of rapparees with varying success season be getting late ginckle be again becoming straitened for provision for proclamation issued failed to inspire peasantry with confidence now erected battery of thirty five gun against king island after incessant cannonade of day breach be effected in wall between abbey ballsbridge preparation be made for crossing arm of shannon assaulting breach work constructed for crossing river be repeatedly destroyed by irish idea of assault upon breach be at length abandoned so desperate did ginckle now think position that issued order for repair of fortification of kilmallock intending to raise siege establish winter quarter there postponed taking step for few day for to do so must be to bring almost certain disaster upon army french fleet be expected to arrive shortly irish reinforced with men arm supply of kind must probably resume offensive during winter must find cut off from supply assistance determined therefore to make one more effort before retiring have throughout siege be in communication with several irish officer of high rank especially with general clifford who commanded cavalry posted on river opposite to camp officer be a desirous a be of bringing war to end for foresaw that if after arrival of french succeeded in driving english out of country ireland must simply become dependency of france preferred english connection to ginckle determined to try again same feint have succeeded at athlone workman be kept busy repairing work at kilmallock preparing place for reception of army greater portion of baggage regiment of dane be sent forward to town battery ceased firing cannon be dismounted at several point irish be persuaded that siege be about to be abandoned meanwhile ginckle be busy collecting boat preparing bridge across to small island lay not far from clare side of river on dark night boat be brought up bridge constructed led by six hundred grenadier strong force of infantry cavalry artillery crossed to island then waded through willow water beyond to mainland few men posted on island carried news to clifford gave order to four regiment of cavalry two of infantry under command did send notice to camp of infantry cavalry however ran without order to bank kept grenadier in check until british cavalry have crossed compelled to fall back british cavalry then dashed forward to irish cavalry camp took completely by surprise panic stricken at unexpected attack soldier citizen in town camp fled in direction great number rushing to thomond bridge entered city by narrow approach have ginckle at once pushed forward must have captured almost whole of irish official civilian on clare side of river fearing ambuscade halted troop before advancing to irish camp gave time for most of to escape being afraid that garrison must sally out from town attack line on other side of river recrossed shannon with troop carrying with crowd of civilian among number of person of rank official with record public treasure confusion surprise in town be so great that irish general took step to hinder passage back across river to attack portion of divided army knew that treachery must have be at work to have enabled enemy to surprise camp a must not tell how far treachery extended abstained from action captain davenant troop have shared in disaster inflicted by night attack upon cavalry camp be asleep when english cavalry burst upon taken utterly by surprise ignorant a to strength of force by be attacked there be thought of resistance officer men leapt from pile of rush served a bed rushed to horse english trooper be cutting hewing in direction cutting picket rope man sprang on horse rode for life captain davenant have at first shouted to men to keep steady word be lost in din prevailed seeing that nothing be to be done said to walter be over walter must ride for like rest by morning irish cavalry be scattered over country be not for two three day that again assembled in regiment presenting sorry sight greater part having lost saddle accoutrement of kind few troop composed of men who have be fortunate enough to have left horse saddled when night came on be sent back to limerick rest drew off towards ennis encamped there until must procure saddle accoutrement to take field again in captain davenant troop there be six men who have saved saddle a must have be useless to send so small detachment to limerick remained with troop be at walter request placed entirely at disposal in order that with might make scouting expedition in enemy rear have permission to consider entirely on detached service to join body of rapparees might choose walter did not care about doing for have horror of savage act be perpetrated by irregular force on side determined to

two hill mile half beyond village galloped on at full speed arrived however too late to take part in fight peasant have rushed suddenly down hillside armed with scythe pike upon convoy a passed below several of cavalry have be killed rest be riding off when walter with trooper dashed up continued pursuit for mile cutting off few straggler le well mounted than rest then returned to kilcowan where peasant have just arrived in triumph with rescued cart of potato be going to do asked when excitement of welcome accorded by woman to captor have subsided little may expect strong body to be sent out tomorrow to punish for be general own proclamation honour did say that soldier be not to stale anything that must be severely punished if did did guarantee that must be paid for everything must not blame for what have done ought to hang rest of thieving villain when get back to must be too sure about walter said issued good many proclamation before have never kept term of one of if be must leave village man woman child for few day at rate see how dutchman take villager must not be persuaded that dutch general must disapprove of what have done walter finding argument of avail rode off with men to village have left hour before with parting advice that if must not follow counsel must at rate place watcher night on road towards ginckle camp to bring news of approach of body of enemy cavalry villager be too delighted with day work to pay much heed to walter warning after general jollification in honour of victory retired to rest thoughtless of danger be getting dark when walter reached village where have determined to stay for night ordered men to keep saddle on horse to hitch to door of cabin where took up quarter in readiness for instant movement placed one mounted sentry at entrance to village quarter of mile on road towards kilcowan at nine o'clock heard sound of horse galloping up to door ran out be sentry at end of village kilcowan be on fire sir walter looked in direction saw broad glare of light ride out bring in advanced sentry said a quick a possible called other men out bade mount that done sat ready to ride off on return of comrade here come sir one of

then ride for ah what be a spoke there be shout from other end of village followed instantly by trampling of horse have surrounded walter exclaimed shoulder to shoulder lad cut way through be only chance charge placing at head set spur to horse dashed at approaching enemy there be fierce shock horse rider rolled over from impetus of charge then cut right left pistol shot rang out horse fell beneath shot through head pinning leg beneath fall saved life for four five trooper have surrounded in moment must have be cut down for time ran great risk of being trampled upon in confusion followed then of trooper dismounted be dragged from beneath horse found prisoner be placed in centre of troop only captive taken for two of six men have got safe away in darkness confusion other four have fallen english a afterwards learned have immediately arrived at kilcowan inquired where irish cavalry who have taken part in afternoon fight be quartered on hearing that be two mile away officer in command have forced one of peasant to act a guide to take party round by detour so a to enter at other end of village just a party rode in by direct road walter be taken first to kilcowan there found party of twelve fourteen peasant surrounded by cavalry whole village be in flame several of inhabitant have be cut down a cavalry entered rest with exception of in hand of troop have fled in darkness a soon a detachment with walter arrived whole body got into motion reached ginckle camp shortly before midnight a general have retired to sleep be placed in tent four sentry posted round with order to shoot anyone who showed head outside in morning be ordered to come out found outside general with several of officer so ginckle said be fellow who attacked soldier will teach lesson will be remembered over ireland will be broken on wheel sentence be heard unmoved by peasant who have not least idea of what be meant by walter stepped forward be not men who be to blame soldier general said own proclamation issued three day ago guaranteed that private property must be interfered with that everything troop required must be paid for soldier disobeyed order plundered poor people be just a much justified in defending against a householder be who resists burglar dare speak to exclaimed ginckle will share fate man of will be broken on wheel general ginckle walter said warmly hitherto foul excess of troop have brought disgrace upon rather than if brutal order be carried out name will be held infamous will stand next only to cromwell in curse irishman will heap upon memory dutch general be almost convulsed with passion take dog away shouted let sentence be carried out several english officer be standing near looked at one in astonishment disgust two of hurried away to fetch of superior officer directly heard of order have be given proceeded to ginckle tent can be true general hamilton said that have ordered prisoner to be broken on wheel have given order ginckle said angrily will not permit to be questioned pardon general hamilton said firmly must be questioned there be such punishment a breaking on wheel known to english law english comrade protest against sentence being carried out will have so ginckle exclaimed face purple with passion then sir general hamilton said tell that in hour from present time will march out from camp at head of division of british troop will return to dublin what be more will fight way out of camp if opposition be offered will explain conduct to king british parliament enough disgrace have already be brought upon connected with army by doings of foreign troop when come to death by torture of prisoner by order of general be time british officer must refuse to permit such foul disgrace to rest upon name there be chorus of assent from other english officer while ginckle foreign officer gathered round looked for moment a if sword must be drawn ginckle saw that have gone too far felt that not only must quarrel if pushed further compel to raise siege fall back upon dublin must entail upon displeasure of king still more certainly that of english parliament there be occasion for threat said mastering passion tell that punishment be contrary to english law be enough abandon at once prisoner will be hung quartered presume that have objection to offer to general be matter in own competence for own conscience hamilton said men have simply a understand defended property against marauder be a conceive worthy of punishment whatever if choose to sentence to such punishment be sentence not mine thought be policy to heal breach between two party seems be mistaken personally protest against execution of sentence beyond be not called upon to go act of injustice cruelty performed by general upon prisoner must not justify soldier in imperilling success of campaign by resisting order of superior therefore duty to king render unable to act solemnly protest in own name that of english officer under command against sentence consider unjust in extreme so saying general hamilton with english officer left general tent if hoped that protest must have effect of preventing barbarous sentence from being carried into execution be mistaken fact that to carry out first intention must have be absolutely unlawful have caused ginckle to abandon made only more obstinate in carrying second into execution english officer stood talking not far from tent in tone of indignation disgust at brutal sentence then walked towards divisional camp a went saw number of men standing round tree hessian soldier with much brutal laughter be reeving rope over arm of tree just a officer came along six struggling form be drawn up high above head of crowd party paused for moment be about to pas on face showing how deep be horror at scene when one of exclaimed there be irish officer in uniform among prisoner can not be suffered irish have several of ours prisoner in town must rightly retaliate by hanging on battlement general hamilton others pressed forward colonel hanau general said to hessian officer surely can not be going to hang young officer general can never have included with others general order be precise hessian said coldly twelve peasant one officer be to be hung afterwards quartered be monstrous general hamilton exclaimed will go back to general obtain order for arrest of execution will be too late sir hessian said coldly have order before be half way to general camp that prisoner will be swinging from bough order to desist sir till return general hamilton said a happen to be in division general hamilton a have received order from commander in chief decline altogether to take order from walter who have resigned to fate stood watching altercation with renewed feeling of hope died out when colonel spoke two of trooper seized at moment eye fell upon one of english officer colonel l'estrange exclaimed officer started at hearing name called out by prisoner did not recognize be walter davenant remember sir wreck off bray good heaven colonel l'estrange exclaimed pressing forward be lad who saved life general hamilton gentleman young officer saved life at risk of own can not will not stand by see murdered hessian colonel signed to four of men who seized walter dragged towards tree colonel l'estrange drew sword men shouted to english soldier who be mingled with crowd of onlooker have rapidly increased during dispute stand by let brave young officer be murdered score of soldier pushed through crowd ranged by colonel l'estrange dashed forward sword in hand in moment walter be torn from grasp of soldier placed in centre of rescuer who be now joined by general hamilton other officer several men have run off at full speed to british camp to bring up aid hessian colonel called upon men to seize prisoner cut down who interfered to prevent general order being carried out hesitated before resolute aspect of english crowd of foreign soldier ranged with attack be about to commence when number of english soldier be seen running musket in hand from camp hessian colonel saw that to attempt to carry out order now must bring on something like pitched battle therefore waved men back saying to general hamilton have nothing to do now sir to report to general ginckle have be prevented by force from carrying order into effect that will of course do general hamilton said coldly will be perfectly prepared to answer for conduct there be goodwill between english foreign section of ginckle army general hamilton have trouble in preventing soldier from attacking hessian in inducing to retire to camp a soon a arrived there ordered drum to be beaten whole division to get under arm then despatched officer to general ginckle narrating circumstance saying that honour of whole army be concerned in preventing officer fairly taken prisoner in war not while acting a spy from being injured that indeed policy a well a honour forbade course being taken a there be several officer of rank in hand of irish who must naturally retaliate on execution of prisoner of war made formal complaint against colonel hanau for refusing to delay execution until must lay matter before general a for own conduct in matter said be perfectly prepared to defend before military court court must be held in england where purposed to return at once with division majesty have intrusted to command dutch general have long before received letter be informed of what have taken place have also learned that english division have struck tent be drawn up under arm to allow to depart must be to entail certain ruin upon campaign felt that be more than probable that course hamilton officer have taken must be upheld by military court in england that public opinion must condemn execution of officer taken in fair fight therefore wrote letter to general hamilton saying that regretted to find that have be acting under misapprehension for have understood that person claiming to be irish officer be in fact spy that have severely reprimanded colonel hanau for refusal to delay execution until fact have be explained to far from feeling in way aggrieved that general hamilton have interfered to prevent such mistake from taking place felt much obliged to for what have done a execution of irish officer taken in war must in way have be most unfortunate circumstance general hamilton showed letter to colonel of various regiment in division agreed that a general ginckle be evidently desirous that matter must go further must be a well to order tent to be again pitched for troop to resume ordinary duty dear walter colonel l'estrange said be happy indeed that came up when did what must have felt if have afterwards learned that who have saved life have be murdered here for execution must have be neither more le than murder a be that of twelve poor fellow who be taken at kilcowan brutal murder be perfectly justified in defending property idea of quartering a well a hanging just a if be traitor of worst dye be nothing short of monstrous only came out here with regiment month since be heartily sick with what see going on be terrible to see ruined village on road from dublin have seen fighting on continent nothing to equal wholesale brutality with war be conducted here how god can continue to give success to army behaves a one have done be altogether beyond of one thing be resolved whether take limerick not own see small chance of will exchange if possible into regiment serving in flanders if not will resign commission now how be father rode out from dublin to see mother be very glad to find old mr davenant well be glad too to find that owing to influence of mr conyers have not be troubled be fortunately able to bring influence to bear upon council who seem to be bent upon squeezing last drop of blood from irish vein men be falling in must put at head of regiment will hand over to care of officer if march out will of course go with when men be again dismissed colonel l'estrange rejoined walter ginckle have thought better of said fancied must not venture to push matter further for loss of one division can really rely upon must be fatal to hope of success to campaign ginckle be passionate man be not fool must have seen that if matter have be laid before king conduct must not have be approved say that ours be right in military sense be sure that public opinion must have approved of tale have be circulated of doings of army over here since commencement of war have already roused very strong feeling of irritation throughout country colonel l'estrange now took walter to general hamilton tent after formally introducing told story of wreck of rescue by walter from certain death what do mean to do with l'estrange general hamilton asked intention be unless see objection to to pas through line evening will provide with good horse see well away after what have happened ginckle will must say feel obliged for thus rendering service by getting rid of prisoner there be not likely to be question asked remark made afterwards be not without influence at court there be very strong section who be bitterly opposed to dutchman being placed in post in king gift there must be difficulty in getting up hostile feeling against ginckle in relation to affair that must cost command yes general agreed marlborough must be only too glad to take matter up a ginckle must be pretty well aware that want of success here must have already made position precarious think will trouble to ask question about prisoner certainly william will not thank for being mean by unjust arbitrary conduct of causing split between english foreign troop must like to put head into one noose must feel compunction in setting swinging for greater set of rascal be never collected under sun must say that contrast between army irish be very great that although many bloody deed be performed by rapparees there have never be single complaint brought against irish troop anyhow mr davenant think can not do better than fall in with colonel l'estrange plan there will be difficulty in getting out indeed will send troop of cavalry to see well beyond line walter spent rest of day with colonel l'estrange told have taken place since have last met be difficult to believe that be three year ago said when have finished no judge flight of time by incident crowd into most uneventful day pas most unheeded now to seems yesterday stood on deck of ship knew that be sure to go to piece that chance of anyone reaching that rocky coast alive be small indeed when saw what seemed little more than black speck approaching fisher boy made way over wave by way how be doing well hope might have done well if liked present that left in father hand to buy boat when be old enough to start a fisherman on own account must have made man of be hidden somewhere in thatch of father cottage when father first went to war handed over to larry a must not say what might happen before return larry be at first delighted with thought that day must have boat of own boat too larger than on shore when accompanied father larry insisted on going with 'it will be time enough to buy boat when war be over ' said a be very glad to have with father did not object larry have way have be with ever since be enrolled in troop now when think there be chance of fighting take place in rank at other time act a servant tell have not forgotten colonel l'estrange said while have be doing so much have have quiet time of must have got regiment at once have cared for disliked thought of fighting over here be too much like civil war six month ago when thing be going badly with on continent asked to be employed be given regiment be just raising have got into fair order be expecting to be ordered to embark for low country at moment when news came of ginckle heavy loss at athlone aughrim order came for to proceed to bristol take ship there for ireland half thought of throwing up commission for news of scandalous conduct of foreign soldier have stirred english heart with disgust indignation thought that struggle be nearly over william be anxious for peace at price must grant almost term to secure on other hand knew that louis be at last going to make great effort so that be certain that irish must make peace on fair term before winter french must land there must be end of prospect of conquering ireland until matter be settled on continent william must devote whole strength to business alternative do think most likely walter asked latter colonel l'estrange said gravely frankly walter situation look bad there be so far a can see chance whatever of taking limerick in fortnight ten thousand french troop will be landed of course be probable that at last moment irish may conclude that prefer to be under england rather than france for be what come to hope will have sense to choose england if what hear be true can judge from insolent arrogance of french officer when be fraction of force what must be when regarded a master william be ready to grant religious equality security of person estate think irish will be very unwise to refuse at same time have suffered such villainous treatment at hand of william soldier can not blame if decide to throw in lot with france think walter said that if be sure that promise must be kept greater part must be in favour of making peace at once nine out of ten of be of english descent have only be driven to take up arm by cruel oppression have suffered why at present five sixth of soil of ireland be in hand of protestant religion be persecuted for year have be trampled on regarded a fair object of robbery that say be true walter one can regret more than do still do think that must be worse off under france than under england louis must drain island of men to fill army us only a cat paw in struggle against england holland must not hesitate to turn over to england again did at time suit to make peace on such term to offer ireland a exchange for piece of territory coveted beyond frontier know father be very much of opinion walter said that have confidence whatever in king of france considers french interference be responsible for want of success have attended at rate there be scarcely one of who doe not hate french certainly if have to choose between two country must choose england when became dark troop of cavalry mounted with colonel l'estrange walter in midst rode out of camp went for several mile then colonel l'estrange said be now well outside limit where will be likely to meet of scouting party two mile further along road will come to village of mulroon have like others suffered heavily there be two three house still standing when rode through few day since saw old man standing at door of one of so will be likely to get information a to best road to town perhaps guide thank very heartily colonel l'estrange know village for rode through only day before be captured if can get guide can make own way round a soon a be daylight have better go on tonight if can walter party of rascally plunderer might arrive here ginckle may for aught know have sent out party of dragoon at rate must not stop here make way on among hill even if can only get mile away have to sleep by side of horse one can say be safe under roof within twenty mile of ginckle army there be hearty leave taking between colonel l'estrange walter latter then rode straight forward while troop faced about made way back to camp on arriving at village walter a soon a succeeded in convincing inhabitant of cottage in saw light that be irish officer found difficulty in obtaining guide boy of fourteen volunteering at once to conduct to ford ten mile above limerick be nearly twenty mile by byroad by travelled morning be just breaking a arrived there colonel l'estrange have insisted on providing walter with fund be therefore able to reward guide who went way rejoicing while walter crossed river rode for cavalry camp where be received with delight by father friend who have believed to have be killed in skirmish for such be report of trooper who have managed to make escape must not let go on more detached command walter father said say that have be imprudent to blame be second time that have be surprised by enemy a be out of question to expect that can always have good luck to get out of hand when be captured a have on last two occasion will keep by in future for seriously boy absence have caused terrible anxiety when walter account of barbarous sentence passed upon peasant whose only crime be that have defended property against marauder acting in defiance of general order be known in camp most intense indignation prevailed be heightened by fact that cavalry officer taken in open fight must have be sentenced to similar fate so great indeed be fury of officer men have be in condition to take field nothing must have restrained from mounting riding at once to strike blow in revenge for murder mutilation of peasant chapter peace ginckle expedition across shannon surprise of irish cavalry camp successful a have be altered position in way several day passed then after council of war be determined to recross bridge of boat remained undisturbed to clare side try to force way across thomond bridge on nd of september cavalry of army ten regiment of infantry fourteen piece of cannon made passage without molestation marched towards bridge be defended upon clare side by two strong tower a british advanced guard of infantry approached bridge be charged by body of irish horse broken driven back strong body of cavalry rode up to support infantry irish horse be reinforced hot fight continued until at about four o'clock in afternoon whole force of british infantry came up irish retired upon infantry posted in work covered bridge near gate be high ground cut up by gravel pit irish infantry be posted here a well a in fort english a advanced be assailed with very heavy fire from position also from gun on town wall in spite of heavy loss be suffering english pressed on with greatest gallantry success be now almost necessity for if defeated few of must ever have be able to recross river foot by foot fought way pressed on past outwork pushed back irish infantry till latter be gathered round head of bridge irish general have thought that ginckle movement be repetition of previous raid force have be sent over to guard head of bridge be altogether insufficient to withstand determined attack by ginckle force reinforcement be now sent across bridge only added to confusion pressed back by weight power of english attack irish be beginning to retire across bridge when met reinforcement making way over bridge be of great length extremely narrow complete block took place english have pierced way through struggling mass at head of bridge pressed on rear of mass of fugitive literally hewing way through pressure became so great that regiment crossing be carried back head of british column be pushed forward by behind must only advance by slaying in front of throwing body over bridge for mass be wedged so tightly that movement have now become impossible while irish a retreated formed rampart of slain impeded advance of enemy while struggle on bridge be at fiercest french officer who commanded at drawbridge across arch nearest to city fearing that british must press in at rear of irish that might not then be able to raise drawbridge ordered to be done at once thereby cutting off retreat of soldier still on bridge jumped over parapet into river strove to reach city wall by swimming did so great number be drowned incident greatly increased standing feud between irish french former declaring that latter not only never fought be ready at first alarm to sacrifice ally in order to secure own safety success of ginckle second raid have be complete in so far that have inflicted great slaughter upon irish infantry have gained moral victory be nearer capturing town attack across long narrow bridge be not even to be thought of again retired across river irish be disheartened sarsfield though dashing cavalry commander appeared wholly incapable of handling large body of men ginckle have twice given great opportunity on occasion have made slightest effort to utilize on first occasion surprise uncertainty might excuse inaction on part of army in limerick there be such excuse second time force outside town gate be small one be certain that english must not push across bridge a ginckle have taken best part of army across sarsfield must have issued out with whole force on limerick side crushed british force remaining there captured camp store in case ginckle position must have be desperate not movement be made to seize opportunity must have be patent to military commander possessing genius energy until be too late be attempt made to reinforce detachment on other side of bridge be withstanding attack of vastly superior force ginckle relying upon moral effect of blow have just struck renewed negotiation of irish leader have already received bribe others be genuinely anxious that war must cease now that william be ready to grant term must secure end for have be fighting others again be animated by hostility to french fear that if expected reinforcement arrived english be driven out ireland must become mere appanage of france sarsfield be doubt swayed by dislike to being again superseded in command by arrival of french general be too influenced by fear that peace party might prevail that clifford act of treachery might be repeated enemy be admitted into city without term being arranged french officer eager to return home made attempt to stem course of event on evening of day after battle on clare side drum of besieged beat parley general sarsfield waughup went out have conference with ginckle cessation of arm be concluded for night in morning truce be extended for three day to allow cavalry who be now encamped near ennis to be communicated with on th principal nobleman officer from cavalry camp arrived prisoner be exchanged hostage on side be given until term of treaty of peace must be adjusted on th irish submitted proposal to english general be that past offence must be pardoned that catholic of county of cork limerick kerry clare sligo mayo be restored to estate held previous to war freedom of worship to be allowed catholic to be capable of holding employment civil military irish army to be kept on foot who be willing to serve to be received into king service catholic to be at liberty to reside in city town to have right of citizen that act of parliament must be passed to confirm condition term be agreed to be held to be applicable not only to garrison of limerick to whole of ireland ginckle at once sent express to cork to order transport in harbour to sail round to shannon for purpose of taking on board such part of irish army a might wish to be carried to france being one of stipulation of treaty sarsfield most of officer priest used utmost effort to persuade soldier to enter french service in preference to english exhortation be successful only about two thousand irish joined british army four thousand laid down arm returned to home considerable number deserted on march down to cork rest be shipped in transport to france where entered service of country two day after treaty be signed french fleet with ten thousand men great abundance of store arrived at mouth of shannon irish negotiator of treaty have be greatly deservedly blamed inasmuch a while stipulated that proprietor of neighbouring county must retain estate abandoned possessing property throughout rest of ireland to ruin beggary there be excuse for knew that french fleet have sailed must have arrived in few day that english cause be becoming so desperate that ginckle must not have resisted term have laid down cruel wholly unnecessary desertion of friend have thrown slur upon memory of sarsfield other leader who conducted negotiation officer men who entered service of france have bitter reason to repent decision instead of being a expected kept together in regiment be for most part broken up distributed throughout french army louis be deeply enraged at surrender just a expedition have made such effort to send for conquest of ireland be within few hour sail of shore treated whole of irish french who returned from ireland a men who have acted part of traitor a soon a term of capitulation be arranged captain davenant obtained paper of protection for men of troop have formed up on parade have put question whether wished to return home to enter service of france officer intend to return home said of course of be free to do a chooses appears to most foolish thing to leave country forever exile
