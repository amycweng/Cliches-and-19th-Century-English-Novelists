bore away for dantzig when night came on storm increased in fury be now in shoal water vessel already half waterlogged became quite unmanageable in furious wave beyond fact that be fast driving on to pomeranian coast be ignorant of position be rough beginning nigel said to nephew bargained to run risk of being killed by german did not expect to run hazard of being drowned doubt if vessel can live till morning be only eleven o'clock yet in spite of pump be getting lower lower in water before malcolm have time to answer there be tremendous crash threw off foot below struggled on deck nothing

desperately highlander defended town again again imperialist be repulsed from slight rampart when at last won way into place by dint of number street lane alley house be defended to last malcolm be almost bewildered at din incessant roll of musketry hoarse shout of contending troop rattling of gun shriek of pain time imperialist tried to force way in heavy column up street scot poured out from house to resist meeting pike to pike hurled backwards malcolm tried to keep cool to imitate behaviour of senior officer repeating order seeing that be carried out time after time austrian attempted to carry place be always hurled back although outnumbering scot by nigh twenty to one at last town be in ruin be on fire in score of place street lane be heaped with dead be no longer tenable munro therefore gave order that house must everywhere be set on fire troop fall back to castle steadily in good order command be carried out with levelled pike still facing enemy troop retired into castle imperial general seeing how heavy have be loss in carrying open town shrank from prospect of assaulting castle defended by such troop when night fell quietly marched away with force under command

tone in first fight at schiefelbrune have endeavoured to carry out although gained much commendation from nigel other officer of company for coolness on occasion have by mean satisfied upon present

always grumbling about being told off for cooking just because happened to be oldest of band here be lad who will take place tomorrow can mount horse ride with rest of be poisoned suppose with bad food when return man grumbled nice lookout truly there be one thing old grumbler be quite certain can not do worse than do jaw ache now with trying to eat food gave morning week must have starved whole band to death very well man said surlily will see whether have gained by exchange what doe boy know about cooking very little be afraid malcolm said cheerfully at least can try if must be cook will at least do best to be good one now what have got in pot rollo grumblingly enumerated content then putting on doublet went out to join comrade in hall leaving malcolm to new duty latter set to work with will saw that be best to appear contented with situation to gain a far a possible goodwill of band by attention to want in way vigilance must become relaxed mode of escape might open to at dusk rest of band returned malcolm found that who have met with captain be portion of party a three other company of equal strength arrived at about same time total number mounting up to over thirty

possible here wall be pierced only by narrow loophole for arrow musketry on other side window be large for here steepness of rock protected castle from attack kitchen in cooked slept have other entrance save into hall doorway into courtyard being closed by heap of fallen stone from above two three narrow slit in wall allowed light air to enter malcolm saw that escape at night after have once be shut in be impossible that in daytime must not pas out by gate for even if by sudden surprise overpowered sentry there must be met at bottom of path by two men who be always stationed a guard to horse to give notice of approach of stranger only chance of escape therefore be by lowering from one of window behind down steep rock to do rope of seventy foot long be necessary after careful search through ruin failed to discover even shortest piece of rope afternoon of band on return from foraging drove in dozen cattle one of be with much difficulty compelled to climb up path to castle be slaughtered in yard there scot be victual for next week cut up throw head offal down rock behind a malcolm commenced unpleasant task thought suddenly struck laboured away cheerfully hopefully after

since left wood be now traversing open country frequently turning round to examine country around for at moment after have left absence from castle might be discovered pursuit begun hoped however that two three hour at least must elapse before discovery be made have before starting piled high fire in hall have placed plenty of log for purpose of replenishing close at hand put tankard on board with large jug full of wine so that freebooter must have occasion to call for unless wanted must be unlikely to look into kitchen except when occasionally breaking into walk to get breath ran steadily on be not until have gone nearly ten mile that saw goatherd tending few goat from learned direction of glogau be glad to find have not gone very far out of direct line at last after asking way several time arrived within short distance of village ground have now become undulating slope be covered with tree village lay up valley be evident that road be travelling be little frequented ending probably at village proceeding for nearly two mile through wood came suddenly upon glogau stood near head of valley be here free of tree cultivated field lay around house be surrounded by fruit tree air of

for one boy in year pastor said be lawful nay be right to defend one home against lawless pillager murderer a say evil though way be freebooter be stout men at arm have heard that have taken terrible vengeance on village have ventured to oppose be scottish officer in king of sweden army malcolm said fought at schiefelbrune new brandenburg in fight when imperialist tried to relieve colberg having hope done duty in three such desperate struggle against imperialist veteran need not shrink from encounter with freebooter if decide to defend village be ready to strike blow at for have held captive

settled when where how house be strongly built must so strengthen door window with beam that might hold out for long time against malcolm said must not be advice assuredly might defend house in case rest of village herd granary must fall into hand to do good must fight in wood on way hither although hope for favourable issue must strongly advise that must have herd horse driven away send off more valuable good in wagon with woman child to distance will fight better if know that be in safety of old men boy will suffice for work now methinks have best summon men for there will be work for tonight bell be used to call hand from work in field wood at sunset soon sounded men in surprise came trooping in at summons when be assembled farmer told news have heard determination have be arrived at to defend village after first movement of alarm caused by name of dreaded band of wolfsburg have subsided malcolm be glad to see expression of stout determination come over face of assemblage declared ready to fight to last four of elder men be told off at once to superintend placing of more movable household good of village in wagon be to set out at daybreak with cattle family now malcolm said want rest to bring mattock shovel to accompany along road there be one spot marked a came along a being specially suited for defence be about mile away a darkness have now set in men lighted torch with implement followed at spot have selected there be for distance of hundred yard thick growth of underwood bordering track on side across road at end of passage nearest to farm malcolm directed ten of men to dig pit twelve foot wide eight foot deep rest of men set to work to cut nearly through trunk of tree standing nearest road until be ready to fall ten tree be so treated five on side of road standing a did among undergrowth operation have be performed on be invisible to one passing by rope be now fastened to upper part of tree carried across road almost hidden from sight by foliage met over path when pit be completed earth have be taken from be scattered in wood out of sight light bough be then placed over hole be covered with earth sod trampled down until break in road be not perceptible to casual eye be done by malcolm a lightest of party bough sufficing to bear weight although must give way at once beneath that of horse men worked with vigour alacrity a soon a understood be plan daylight be breaking when preparation be completed malcolm now divided party told off to respective post be sixteen in excluding pastor eight be placed on side of road on one side be gathered near pit have be dug on other be opposite to tree be farthest down valley freebooter be to be allowed to pas along until foremost fell into pit men stationed there be at once to haul upon rope attached to tree near to bring down fall must bar road prevent horseman from leaping pit in rear be if heard crash before last of marauder have passed through to wait until have closed up be sure to do when obstacle be reached then to fell tree to bar retreat instant be done party be to run to other rope to bring down tree upon horseman gathered on road be then to fall upon with axe pike arquebus if work a well a expect malcolm said not one of will escape from trap soon after daybreak bowl of milk tray of bread meat be brought down to worker by of woman a there be immediate expectation of attack farmer with pastor went back to village to cheer woman before departure need not be afraid wife farmer said will keep to plan because when have once made plan be foolish to change deem not that there be real need for sending wagon beast away young scotch lad seems made for commander truly if countryman be like wonder no longer that pole imperialist have be unable to withstand truly have constructed trap from band of villain will have little chance of escape trust that may slay without much loss to ourselves what rejoicing will there not be in fifty village when news come that oppressor have be killed good god have assuredly sent youth hither a instrument in defeating oppressor even a chose shepherd boy david out of israel to be scourge of philistine by time be ready for start having seen wagon fairly on way farmer returned to wood pastor accompanying woman three hour passed before there be sign of marauder malcolm began to think that idea might have occurred to that have gone to glogau that might therefore have postponed raid upon village until must make sure of taking by surprise so capturing horse valuable before villager have time to remove glogau be however quite out of malcolm direct line for swedish camp be hardly likely that freebooter must think that late captive must go out of way to warn village in have interest indeed must scarcely be likely to recall fact that have be present when be discussing proposed expedition against doubt be however set at rest when boy who have be stationed in high tree near edge of wood ran in with news that band of horseman be riding across plain must be there in few minute one fell into appointed place farmer took command of party on one side of road malcolm of on other match be blown priming of arquebus looked to then gathered round rope listened for tramp of horse although be few minute before came time seemed long to waiting at last vague sound be heard rapidly rose into loud trampling of horse marauder have be riding quietly until neared wood a speed be object a wished to take village by surprise be just possible that might have be seen approaching be now riding rapidly suddenly earth gave way under foot of horse of captain lieutenant who be riding at head of troop men animal disappeared from sight of who followed two men behind pulled horse back on haunch checked at edge of pit into leader have fallen a did so loud crack be heard great tree came crashing down falling directly upon striking horse to ground loud cry of astonishment alarm rose from behind followed by curse exclamation of rage few second after fall of tree there be crash in rear of party to astonishment freebooter saw that tree have fallen there that barricade of bough leaf closed way behind a in front deprived of leader bewildered alarmed at strange unexpected occurrence marauder remained irresolute two three of in front got off horse tried to make way to assistance of comrade who be lying crushed under mass of foliage of leader in pit beyond now almost simultaneously two more crash be heard tree from side fell upon panic stricken now horseman strove to dash through underwood progress be arrested for among bush rope have be fastened from tree to tree stake have be driven in bush interlaced with cord tree continued to fall till portion of road occupied by troop be covered by heap of fallen wood leaf then for first time silence in wood beyond be broken flash of firearm darted out from brushwood then with shout number of men armed with pike ax sprang forward to attack few only of marauder be in position to offer resistance whatever greater portion be buried under mass of foliage many have be struck down by trunk heavy arm of tree be hampered confused by situation in found under such circumstance be massacre rather than fight malcolm seeing inability of freebooter to oppose formidable resistance sheathed sword left to peasant to avenge countless murder band have committed ruin misery have inflicted upon country in few minute be over brigand be shot down piked slain by heavy ax through opening in leafy prison quarter be asked for given freebooter knew that must be useless died cursing foe own fate in being thus slaughtered like rat in trap two three of peasant be wounded by pistol shot be injury that success cost wicked have digged pit have fallen into farmer said a approached spot where malcolm be standing little distance from scene of slaughter verily lord hath delivered into hand understand young friend why a soldier did not aid in slaughter of villain be trade to fight in open battle care not to slay enemy when helpless with be different regard a wild beast without heart pity a scourge to be annihilated when have chance just a in winter slay wolf who come down to attack herd blame not malcolm said when men take to life of wild beast must be slain a such now task be done will journey on at once to join countryman will give one piece of advice before go in course of day two party left at wolfsburg will grow uneasy two of number be sure to ride hither to inquire a to tarrying of band let men with arquebus keep watch night day shoot down when arrive be in place must then mount dozen of men let put on armour of dead robber ride to wolfsburg arriving there about daybreak if see coming will take to be band returning two men below will cut down without difficulty there will then be three four to deal with in castle recommend to make complete end of for reason if of band survive will join with other party will be sure to endeavour to get to avenge slaughter for although band have love for other yet must be ready enough to take up other quarrel a against country folk especially when there be hope of plunder exterminate then advise men to keep secret few can have seen brigand riding hither today when be found that band have disappeared country around will thank god will have little curiosity a to how have gone will of course clear path again bury body be must prepare at once ambush like into have fallen when second band of marauder come into part of country set watch night day men will in future be better armed than hitherto a of freebooter carry brace of pistol now a must fain be off a soon a possible must ask to let men set to work with ax cut away bough to get out horse several of must have be killed by falling tree by fire of arquebus doubt there be uninjured in quarter of hour horse be brought up together with helmet armour worn by late captain of band a malcolm mounted men crowded round loaded with thanks blessing for danger from have delivered wife family when fugitive have left village store of cooked provision have be left behind for use of defender during day a woman must not be fetched back before farmer have despatched man for of food wallet on saddle be filled with sufficient to last malcolm for three four day brace of pistol be placed in holster with last farewell to farmer malcolm gave rein to horse rode away from village travelled fast now without fear of interruption sight of armed men riding to join one other of army be too common to attract attention avoiding large town malcolm rode unmolested across plain presently heard report that swede have captured frankfort on oder a approached that town after four day riding heard that have moved towards landsberg thither followed came up to outside wall of place six day after leaving glogau main body of swedish army have remained in around frankfort gustavus having marched against landsberg with only musketeer piece of cannon strong body of horse hepburn reay scotch regiment formed part of column malcolm with delight again saw green scarf banner a rode into camp of regiment be unnoticed by soldier until reached tent of officer before colonel munro be standing talking with several others on seeing officer approach in full armour looked up cry of astonishment broke from on recognizing malcolm be malcolm graheme wraith munro exclaimed be in flesh colonel sound hearty why dear lad munro exclaimed holding out hand thought have fallen at sack of new brandenburg innes lumsden be believed to be only one who have escaped have come through nevertheless malcolm said be long story colonel must ask first if king have learned what tilly be doing have received news whatever of since heard of affair at new brandenburg be most anxious lest must fall upon army at frankfort while be away do know aught about tilly marched west from new brandenburg malcolm said be now besieging magdeburg be news indeed munro said must come with at once to king malcolm followed colonel munro to royal tent be few hundred yard away gustavus have just returned after visiting advanced line round city on being told that colonel munro wished to speak to on important business at once came to entrance of tent allow to present to sire malcolm graheme very gallant young officer of regiment be at new brandenburg deemed that have fallen there how escaped have not yet have time to learn seeing that have now ridden into camp a be bearer of news of whereabouts of tilly army thought best to bring immediately to well sir gustavus said anxiously to malcolm what be news tilly be besieging magdeburg sire with whole strength magdeburg gustavus exclaimed incredulously be sure of news deemed advancing upon frankfort quite sure sire for accompanied column to within two march of city there be secret of intention started for town on very day after have captured new brandenburg be important indeed gustavus said follow turned entered tent spread out on table be large map king at once consulted see colonel munro to relieve magdeburg must march through kustrin berlin spandau first last be strong fortress can hing until elector of brandenburg declares for give leave to pas place for dare not march round leave in rear until sure that weak prince will not take side with imperialist will despatch messenger tonight to at berlin

obtained horse ridden straight to army gustavus asked many question elicited many more detail than malcolm have deemed necessary to give in first recital have shown great prudence forethought king said when have finished such a must not be looked for in so young soldier behaved sire with distinguished gallantry coolness at schiefelbrune in destructive fight outside colberg colonel munro put in by slaughter on latter day must naturally have obtained promotion begged to be passed over asserting that be best that at age must remain for time ensign such modesty be unusual king said plea see next time step be vacant colonel that have age have shown fit to do man work year be of great value in soldier why among scottish regiment have scarcely colonel who be yet thirty year old malcolm now returned with colonel munro to regiment there have to give full minute account of adventure be warmly congratulated by fellow officer on good fortune in escaping from danger have beset suit of armour be handsome one have be doubtless stripped off from body of knight noble murdered by freebooter leg piece malcolm laid aside retaining only cuirass back piece helmet a full armour be too heavy for service on foot two day later king gave order that assault upon landsberg be to be made that night place be extremely strong gustavus have in previous campaign twice failed in attempt to capture since time imperialist have be busy in strengthening fortification peasantry for ten mile round have be employed in throwing up earthwork principal defence be in marsh surrounded rendered construction of approach by besieger almost impossible importance consisted in fact that from great strength garrison dominated whole district known a marc of brandenburg be key to silesia guarded approach to pomerania possession be therefore of supreme importance to gustavus garrison consisted of five thousand imperialist infantry twelve troop of horse whole commanded by count gratz principal approach to town be guarded by strong redoubt armed with numerous artillery colonel munro have advanced trench to within short distance of redoubt have mounted twelve piece of cannon to play upon so solid be masonry of fort that fire produced little visible effect gustavus have brought from frankfort a guide on march blacksmith who be native of landsberg man have informed of postern gate into town must not be likely to be defended a to reach must be necessary to cross swamp flanked by advanced redoubt covered with water for two day previous to assault troop have be at work cutting bush tree preparing material for constructing floating causeway across mud water a soon a night fell men be set to work laying down causeway when be finished column advanced to attack consisted of pikemen under colonel munro same number of dragoon under colonel deubattel hepburn with musketeer followed short distance behind pikemen led way passed along floating causeway without difficulty causeway swayed often sank under foot of cavalry behind however also managed to get across approach be entirely unobserved effected entrance into town scarcely have done so when came upon body of three hundred imperialist who be about to make sally under colonel gratz son of governor pikemen at once fell upon taken by surprise imperialist fought nevertheless stoutly eighty of scot fell under fire of musketry pikemen charged home colonel gratz be killed with many of men rest taken prisoner hepburn marching on behind heard din of musketry pressed forward before reaching town found place in swamp sufficiently firm to enable men to march across turning off led troop between town redoubt then attacked latter in rear where defence be weak after three minute fighting with surprised disheartened garrison latter surrendered redoubt having fallen be men having effected lodgment in town while retreat on one side be cut off by force of gustavus on other by strong body of cavalry under marshal horn governor sent drummer to colonel munro to say that be ready to surrender to ask for term drummer be sent to gustavus who agreed that garrison must be allowed to march away with honour of war taking baggage effect with accordingly at eight o'clock count of gratz at head of soldier marched out with colour flying drum beating retired into silesia garrison be placed in landsberg blacksmith appointed burgomaster of town landsberg fell on th of april on th force marched back to frankfort chapter vii quiet time in spite of urgent entreaty of gustavus pressing peril of magdeburg wavering duke of brandenburg must not bring to join swede delivered spandau over to must do more swedish army accordingly marched to berlin invested capital duke sent wife to gustavus to beseech to draw off

obliged to accept in meantime long hesitation delay have caused loss of magdeburg after gallant defence be stormed by troop of pappenheim tilly on th of may ferocious tilly have determined upon deed must believed frighten germany into submission ordered that quarter must be given for five day city be handed over to troop history have record since day of attila of so frightful massacre age sex be spared men woman child be ruthlessly massacred result for time justified anticipation of ferocious leader terrible deed sent shudder of horror terror through protestant germany seemed too a if catastrophe might have be averted have swede shown diligence marched to relief of city for in such time men be not inclined to discus how much of blame rested upon shoulder of duke of brandenburg who be in fact alone responsible for delay of swede many of prince free town have hitherto be staunch to cause of protestantism at once hastened to make peace with emperor for time sack of magdeburg greatly strengthened imperialist cause sooner did news reach ear of duke of brandenburg than fear overcame wrote to gustavus withdrawing from treaty have made saying that a spandau have only be delivered to in order that might march to relief of magdeburg be now bound in honour to restore gustavus at once ordered spandau to be evacuated by troop again marched with army against berlin have few day before left here again dictated term duke be forced to agree to swedish army now marched to old brandenburg thirty four mile west of berlin there remained for time waiting until expected

close body towards principal gate will try blow open with petard malcolm said half of men be musketeer good shot will with permission place on wall to aid townsfolk there for if gate be blown open enemy force way in will go hard with count assented posted musketeer on wall ordering sergeant sinclair with remainder to set to work to erect barricade across street leading from gate so in case be blown in such stand might be made against imperialist a must give townspeople time to rally from wall to gather there imperialist heralded advance by opening fire with pistol musketoons against wall defender at once replied so heavy be fire that head of column wavered many of leading file being at once shot down encouraged by officer rallied pushed forward at run fire of townspeople at once became hurried irregular scot picked off men with steady aim leader of imperialist who carried petard advanced boldly to edge of ditch fosse be willow contained little water at once dashed into waded across for drawbridge have of course be raised climbed up bank be close to gate when malcolm leaning far over wall discharged pistol at ball glanced from steel armour malcolm drew other pistol again fired time more effectually for ball struck between shoulder neck at junction of breast back piece passed down into body of austrian who dropping petard fell dead number of men be close behind quick lad malcolm cried put strength to parapet be old rotten now together shove soldier bent strength against parapet while of townspeople thrusting pike into rotten mortar between stone prised up with strength parapet tottered then with tremendous crash fell burying five six of imperialist petard beneath ruin shout of exultation rose from defender imperialist at once withdrew at full speed halted out of gunshot then number of men be sent back to village whence returned carrying ladder of have be collected day before from neighbouring village others manufactured during night enemy now divided into three party advanced simultaneously against different point of wall notwithstanding storm of shot poured upon a advanced pressed forward until reached wall planted ladder then essayed to climb at point stormers be stoutly met with pike sword while musketeer from flanking tower poured bullet into troop proved worthy of reputation for be not until more than fifty have fallen that desisted from attempt drew off now will have respite malcolm said if there be more of in neighbourhood methinks will retire altogether if have friend with cannon anywhere within reach will probably send for renew attack day passed quietly party of horseman be seen leaving village to forage plunder surrounding country main body remained quietly there next day there be still renewal of attack a enemy remained in occupation of village malcolm guessed that must be waiting for arrival of reinforcement following afternoon cloud of dust be seen upon plain presently column of infantry four hundred strong with three cannon must be made out townspeople now wavered in determination few be still for resistance majority held that must not attempt to withstand assault by so strong force that be better to make best term must with enemy parlementaire be accordingly despatched to imperialist asking what term must be granted must place surrender will grant term whatever colonel in command of imperialist said town be at mercy will do a will with within tell count mansfeld that if will surrender castle a well a town at once without striking blow case will receive favourable consideration will not do count said guarantee life give not up castle on term like will exercise pressure on townspeople if choose to defend till last will fight here with if choose to surrender can do so who differ from fellow put faith in tilly wolf can enter castle with principal inhabitant of town debated question hotly malcolm lost patience with said be mad a well a stupid do not see smoking village round do not remember fate of magdeburg new brandenburg other town have made resistance have chosen to resist be open to to have fled when heard imperialist be coming must have opened gate then with hope at least of life decided to resist have killed fifty sixty of soldier have repulsed from place thought to take with effort have compelled to send for reinforcement gun now be talking of opening gate without even obtaining promise that life will be spared be extremity of folly can say be if take step will well deserve fate malcolm indignant address have effect after short discussion townspeople again placed at count disposal said that must obey order will give order count said scottish friend here agrees with that be useless to try to defend town might repulse several attack in end must surely break in for wall be old weak will crumble before cannon be there hope of relief one must defend to last a be must be waste of blood for many must be slain in defence before must retreat to castle therefore propose at once to withdraw doubt not that can hold castle who like to remain in house trust to tender mercy of tilly wolf can do so there be more hesitation cannonball first imperialist have fired at moment crashed into house hard by sharpened decision wonderfully have great store of provision in castle count said although deem not likely that will have to stand long siege must be prepared for there be already more than of wife child there therefore while half of force continue to show upon wall so deter enemy from attempting assault until have opened breach let rest carry up provision to castle house from woman have fled be at once to be broken open that leave behind enemy will take le leave for better therefore store magazine of food wine must be considered a public property let men at once be divided into two body one to guard wall other to search for carry up provision can be changed three four hour resolution be taken carried into effect without delay most of horse cart in town have left with fugitive remained be at once set to work cart be laden with large barrel of wine sack of flour while men carried side of bacon keg of butter other portable article on head

broke rank scattered to plunder be now quite dark many of dragging article of furniture into street made great bonfire to light at work of plunder have soon reason to repent having done so for immediately flame sprang up lighted street flash ran round battlement of castle heavy fire be opened into street killing many of soldier seeing danger of thus exposing men to fire from castle imperialist commander issued order at once that fire must be extinguished that anyone setting fire to house must be instantly hung that light be to be lit in house whose window faced castle foreseeing possibility of attack from castle austrian placed hundred men at foot of road leading up to laid three cannon loaded to muzzle to command have not malcolm asked count mean of exit from castle besides way into town yes count said there be footpath down rock on other side then malcolm said a soon a be fairly drunk will be before midnight let fall upon from other side leave fifty of oldest men with dozen veteran soldier to defend gateway against sudden attack with rest can issue out marching round enter by gate breach sweeping street a go then uniting burst through guard may have placed to prevent sortie so regain castle count at once assented in short time shout song sound of rioting quarrel arose from town showing that revelry be general at eleven o'clock men in castle be mustered fifty be told off to defence with five experienced soldier officer of count being left in command rest sallied through little door at back of castle noiselessly descended steep path on arriving at

fighting men of town under own leader be to enter by gate while other two party came in by breach moment attack began defender of castle be to open a rapid fire a must upon foot of road so a to occupy attention of enemy force there to lead to anticipate sortie breach by malcolm be to enter be farthest from castle command must therefore be last in arriving at station when reached ordered trumpeter who accompanied to sound at signal three column rushed into town uttering shout of gustavus gustavus imperialist in house near be slaughtered with scarcely resistance be for most part intoxicated such a retained sens be paralysed at sudden attack panic stricken at shout portended arrival of relieving force from army of king of sweden a band pressed forward slaying whom came upon resistance became stronger three column be headed by party of pikemen who advanced steadily in good order bearing down opposition leaving to behind task of slaying found in house light flashed from window partly lit up street imperialist officer attempted to rally men scottish shout hepburn hepburn sight of green scarf added to terror of soldier who be convinced that terrible green brigade of king of sweden be upon hundred be cut down after striking scarce blow in defence number fled to wall leapt over panic communicated to party drawn up to repel sortie hearing yell scream shout accompanied by musketry approaching from three different quarter of town while steady fire from castle indicated that defender there might at moment sally out upon stood for time irresolute a head of three column approached lost heart quitted station withdrew in body by street by avoided approaching column on arriving at spot malcolm found gun deserted town be won now said will take post here with men in case austrian must rally do with rest scatter over town complete work bid keep together in party of twenty force broke up scattered through town in work of vengeance house after house be entered searched who be found there put to sword by time most of who be not too drunk to fly have already made for gate in hour not imperialist be left alive in town then guard be placed at gate breach waited till morning not sign of imperialist be to be seen on plain party sallying out found that have fled in utmost disorder arm accoutrement portion of plunder lay scattered thickly about be clear that in belief that swedish army be on imperialist have fled panic stricken be now far away upwards of two hundred body be found in street house huge grave be dug outside wall here fallen foe be buried only three four of defender of town be killed score so wounded in whole affair although there be little fear of return a imperialist must probably continue headlong flight for long distance must then march with haste to rejoin main army with news that strong swedish force be at count set townspeople at once to repair breach people be overjoyed with success delighted at having preserved home from destruction for knew that imperialist must if unsuccessful against castle have given town to flame before retiring woman child flocked down to home again although much furniture have be destroyed damage done be little heeded when so much be saved vied in expression of gratitude towards malcolm scot malcolm modestly disclaimed merit saying that men have scarcely struck blow be not so much fighting count said a example set townsman spirit presence of men diffused among besides counsel support to have be invaluable have not be for place must probably have be carried at first attack if not townspeople must have surrendered when enemy reinforcement arrived in case with so small force at command must not have hoped to defend castle successfully moreover idea of sortie have freed of saved town from destruction be entirely yours friend say what will feel that be indebted to for safety of wife child so long a live will be deeply debtor following day malcolm with party marched away count have

wolmirstadt whence summoned elector of saxony to admit army into country to disband saxon army to unite to own hitherto elector have held aloof from gustavus whom regarded with jealousy dislike have stood by inactive although slightest movement of army must have saved magdeburg to disband troop however to hand over fortress to tilly must be equivalent to giving up dominion to enemy rather than do determined to join gustavus having despatched arnheim to treat with king of sweden for alliance sent point blank refusal to tilly imperialist general at once marched towards leipzig devastating country a advanced term be soon arranged between elector gustavus on d of september swedish army crossed elbe next day joined saxon army at torgau by time tilly be in front of leipzig immediately on

consented on condition that only charged with two thousand horse did not bring on general engagement accordingly a scottish brigade under sir james ramsay crossed loder pappenheim swept down upon scot stood firm with pike musket repelled attack after hard fighting pappenheim be obliged to fall back setting fire a retired to village of podelwitz smoke of burning village drifted across plain be

to camp ordered up whole of cavalry charged down with fury upon swede while at same moment furstenberg dashed with seven regiment of cavalry on saxon between swede there be slight interval for gustavus have doubt of steadiness of ally be anxious that in case of defeat own troop must not be thrown into confusion result justified anticipation attacked with fury on flank by furstenberg horse while infantry artillery poured direct fire into front saxon at once gave way elector be first to set example of flight turning horse galloped without drawing rein to torgau in twenty minute after commencement of fight whole of saxon be in utter rout hotly pursued by furstenberg cavalry tilly now deemed victory certain for nearly half of opponent be disposed of outnumbered remainder by two to one while furstenberg have gained so complete victory over saxon pappenheim who have charged swedish centre have met with very different reception in vain tried to break through swedish spear wind be blowing full in face of pikemen cloud of smoke dust rolled down upon rendered impossible for to see heavy column of horse until fell upon like avalanche yet with perfect steadiness withstood attack seven time pappenheim renewed charge seven time fell back broken disordered a drew off for last time gustavus seeing rout of saxon knowing that must have whole of tilly force upon in few minute determined to rid altogether of pappenheim launched whole of cavalry upon retreating squadron with overwhelming effect thus at end of hour fighting tilly have disposed of saxon gustavus have driven pappenheim horse from field three of scottish regiment be sent from centre to strengthen horn on left flank be now exposed by flight of saxon scarcely have scottish musketeer taken position when furstenberg horse returned triumphant from pursuit of saxon at once fell upon horn pikemen however stood a firmly a comrade in centre have done scottish musketeer six deep three front rank kneeling

by pikemen in front mown down by cannon in rear lost heart fled precipitately four regiment alone veteran of furstenberg infantry holding together cutting way through to wood in rear of position slaughter must have be even greater than be have not cloud of dust smoke be so thick that swede be unable to see ten yard in front of pursuit be taken up by cavalry who pressed flying imperialist until so complete be defeat tilly who be badly wounded must only muster men to accompany in retreat pappenheim must get together of horseman seven thousand of imperialist be killed be wounded taken

address thanking for great share in winning battle of leipzig many of scottish officer be promoted munro being made full colonel many others advanced step in rank scottish brigade responded to address of gallant king with hearty cheer gustavus be indeed beloved a well a admired by soldier fearless of danger ever recognized bravery in others be ready to take full share of hardship a well a peril

penetrating cheek ruddy healthy have air of majesty enabled to address soldier in term of cheerful familiarity without in slightest degree diminishing respect reverence for a monarch chapter x passage of rhine suppose nigel graheme said a officer of regiment assembled in one of imperialist tent on night after battle of leipzig will at once press forward to vienna such be general opinion throughout swedish army such be not intention of gustavus undoubtedly temptation to press forward dictate peace in vienna be strong difficulty disadvantage of such step be many have men for saxon must not be reckoned upon indeed be probable that elector whose jealousy dislike of gustavus must undoubtedly be heightened by event of battle of breitenfeld must prove to be more than doubtful ally be swedish army to remove to distance tilly must soon rally fugitive reinforced by numerous imperialist garrison from town must be able to overrun north germany in absence to force saxon to join even if elector be unwilling to do so thus little swedish force must be isolated in heart of germany must ferdinand abandon vienna at approach altogether refuse to treat with obstinacy upon former occasion when in very hand of enemy rendered probable swede must find in desperate position isolated alone in midst of enemy there be consideration imperialist diet be at moment sitting at frankfort ferdinand be using influence to compel various prince representative of free city to submit to be of utmost importance that gustavus must strengthen friend overawe waverer by approach of army hitherto franconia rhine province have be entirely in hand of imperialist be needful that counterbalancing influence must be exerted consideration induced gustavus to abandon tempting idea of march upon vienna elector of saxony be charged with carrying war into silesia bohemia elector of hesse hesse cassel be to maintain lower saxony westphalia swedish army turned face towards rhine on th of september arrived before

furious at interference of kilian seized opportunity when latter have gone with follower on expedition against pagan saxon to have kilian two companion murdered cathedral be naturally object of interest to scotch soldier in time of gustavus there be animated argument in quarter of officer of munro regiment on night of arrival a to whether st kilian have done well otherwise in insisting upon new convert repudiating wife general opinion however be against saint colonel summing up question in opinion said kilian be fool here be le matter at stake than conversion of whole nation at least of great tribe of heathen kilian imperilled on question of minor importance for in first place church of rome have always held that pope must grant permission for marriage within interdicted degree in second place marriage have taken place before conversion of duke to christianity be therefore innocently without thought of harm bona fide man wife lastly church of rome be opposed to divorce kilian might in case have put up with small sin if sin be for sake of saving soul of thousand of pagan opinion be that st kilian richly deserved fate befell now to subject much more interesting to viz

yes malcolm agreed there must be difficulty in swimming if unencumbered with arm armour there must be advantage in getting across without if must get hold of boat two must soon wake yonder spaniard up next morning malcolm wandered along bank closely examining bush a went to see if boat might be concealed among for fisherman boatman must naturally try to save craft when heard that imperialist be destroying walked three mile up river without success a returned kept eye fixed on bush on opposite bank when within mile of camp suddenly stopped for eye caught something dark among went to water edge stooped better to see under bush saw what doubted not to be stern of boat hauled up sheltered beneath leapt to foot with joyful exclamation here be mean of crossing river boat have to be brought over once afloat must be easy enough be sure that own strength must be insufficient to launch that must need aid of at least one man on returning to camp called aside sergeant of company james grant who be from own estate in nithsdale whom knew to be good swimmer sergeant said want to join in enterprise tonight have found boat hauled up under bush on opposite shore must bring across can not make out size from look of stern must say be large boat have better therefore borrow from artilleryman one of wooden lever get stout pole two three inch across cut dozen two foot length from to put under a

be here at edge of river at six o'clock sergeant can get away at time without exciting comment will say nothing about unless succeed thinking over however occurred to malcolm by mean day must be lost

a to strike bank little above where believe boat to be then will float along under bush until lantern be in line one with will know then that be exactly opposite boat well thought of king exclaimed munro lieutenant of yours be treasure now god speed friend in cold swim across stream malcolm sergeant now walked mile up river distance judging from strength of current speed at must swim must thought take to opposite bank at about point where boat be lying shaking hand with colonel munro who have accompanied malcolm entered icy cold water without delay knowing that be possible that strength might give out before reached opposite side malcolm have have two pair of small cask lashed two foot apart fastened securely so that a began to swim cask floated short distance behind shoulder giving perfect support lever paddle be towed behind light in two camp afforded mean of directing way water be intensely cold before be halfway across malcolm congratulated upon having thought of cask have not be for must have begun to doubt ability to reach further shore for although must have thought nothing of swim at other time limb be fast becoming numbed with extreme cold sergeant kept close to word two be occasionally exchanged think be colder than mountain stream grant be colder honour water be smooth still have to wrestle with a with brook in spate be stillness make feel so cold harder swim le will feel be with deep feeling of relief that malcolm saw something loom just in front of from darkness knew that be close to land few more stroke touched bush looking back saw that two light be nearly in line stopping swimming let stream drift down two three minute more one of tiny light seemed exactly above other be spot grant said in low voice land here a quietly a can chapter xi capture of oppenheim two swimmer dragged on shore for minute two must scarce stand so numbed be limb by cold malcolm took from belt flask of brandy took long draught handed to companion who followed example spirit sent glow of warmth through vein began to search among bush for boat one proceeding way along bank have not removed leathern doublet before entering water a buoyed up a be must not affect swimming must be necessary protection when landed not only against cold of night air against bush malcolm beacon proved accurate guide for have not proceeded twenty yard before came against solid object at once felt to be boat low whistle called sergeant to side bringing with roller paddle from spot where have landed soon felt that boat be large one that strength must have be wholly insufficient to get into water without aid of lever roller taking former placed end under stern post placing roller under heel to serve a pivot threw weight on other end of lever at once raised boat

stream rowlock be in place rowing with extreme care so a to avoid making slightest sound made way across river be below camp when landed there be many men on lookout for news of attempt have spread rapidly leaping ashore amidst low cheer from group of soldier malcolm directed to tow boat up at once to place where troop be formed ready for crossing while sergeant who be chilled to bone for clothes have frozen stiff upon hurried to spot where regiment be bivouacked here by side of blazing fire stripped be rubbed with cloth by comrade till glow of warmth again began to be felt external heat friction being aided by administration of two steaming flagon of spiced wine dry clothes be taken from knapsack warmed before fire when be put on again felt warm comfortable hurrying off now to

from place being carried down be wedged against upper part of door securing a firmly a did stone below preparation being finished malcolm took survey of situation outside group of peasant have increased largely thirty forty men armed with pike bill scythe being gathered in body while many more must be seen across country hurrying over white plain towards spot window of lower apartment have be barricaded with plank partly to keep out missile partly for warmth good fire now blazed in centre soldier confident in leader cracked grim joke a work being finished sat down around awaited attack one of number being placed on summit of tower to give warning of approach of enemy must that have musket two malcolm said for might then keep from door have only twenty charge for pistol most of at rate must keep for defence of stair presently sentry from above called out that peasant be moving forward to attack sergeant malcolm said do fasten green scarf to long strip of plank fix to top of tower can not fight under better banner now let mount to roof give warm reception look out sentry exclaimed a malcolm ascended stair three four of have got musket then must be careful malcolm said suppose be much of marksman even random shot will tell at time want to take back safe with so keep low when get on roof lad show head more than can help heralding attack by discharge from musket whose ball whistled harmlessly round tower peasant rushed forward to door commenced assault upon with hatchet ax malcolm men lifted heavy stone rolled over parapet five loosing missile simultaneously there be dull crash with terrible cry peasant fled from door looking over malcolm saw that six seven men have be struck down five of lay dead senseless two be endeavouring to drag away be lesson number one said will be more prudent next time peasant after holding tumultuous council scattered most of making for wood short distance off be going to cut down tree use a battering ram malcolm observed know that large stone be too heavy for to cast many pace from foot of wall must get to work break of up will not be difficult for wind weather have rotted many of through stone be for most part from two to three foot long nine ten inch square two be laid down on platform eighteen inch apart placed across four men then lifted stone holding perpendicularly brought down with strength upon unsupported centre of stone broke in half at once to break again required greater effort yielded to blow other stone be similarly treated until large pile be formed of block of ten inch way besides number of smaller fragment in hour peasant reappeared with slight well grown tree forty foot long have be robbed of branch be laid down about fifty yard from church then twenty men lifted near butt advanced to use a battering ram with small end forward before be near enough to touch door bearer be arrested by cry from crowd a defender appeared on tower poising block of stone above head hurled down three of flew over head of peasant others crashed down among slaying terribly mutilating two of bearer of tree striking several others to ground battering ram be instantly dropped before scotchman have time to lift missile peasant be beyond reach lesson number two malcolm said what will friend do next wonder peasant be clearly at loss long consultation be held be not followed by renewal of attack think must have made up mind to starve out sir sergeant remarked a hour went slowly by without renewal of attack yes sergeant night attack in case consider that be safe for time sooner later fate be sealed unless aid come to therefore propose that one of must tonight try bear message to lech can lower down by bell rope from window in angle where tower touch church keeping round by church will be in deep shadow until reach other end will then be close to ruin of village before morning must reach camp will undertake sir if will allow sergeant said while other men also volunteered for duty will try first sergeant malcolm said will be dangerous work for a news of being here spread peasant will be coming in from quarter number be already greatly increased since commenced attack there must be at least three four hundred men around will be sure to keep sharp lookout against escaping will need care caution to get through never fear man replied confidently have stalked deer score of time will be hard if can not crawl through number of thick witted bavarian peasant even beyond village will have to keep eye open a may meet party of peasant on way here fortunately will have difficulty in keeping road so well beaten be by march of army if by tomorrow night rescue arrives will consider that have be taken killed will try with others to make way through must be better to die sword in hand while have still strength to wield arm than to be cooped up here until too weak longer to defend then to be slowly tortured to death a soon a be dusk sentry be placed on top of tower with order to report slightest sound stir during day have not be necessary for view must be obtained from window men with firearm who have now considerably increased in number kept up constant fire at tower hour later sentry reported that must hear sound of many foot in darkness with occasional snapping a of dry twig be going to burn down door malcolm said be what expected now sergeant be time be busy intent upon purpose must not have better time rope be fastened round sergeant waist with difficulty squeezed through narrow window after listening attentively to discover if be below seemed perfectly still on side be gradually steadily lowered down presently above felt rope slack minute swung loosely be drawn up again malcolm placing one of men at loophole with instruction to listen intently for sound of alarm conflict turned attention to other side soon saw number of dark figure bearing on head great bundle knew to be faggot approaching across snow a approached brisk fire suddenly opened on tower malcolm at once called sentry down be of use exposing said must not do much harm to did take to stoning again have nothing to do now to wait soon series of dull heavy crash be heard a faggot be thrown down against door malcolm descended stair until reached lowest loophole lighted be few foot above top of door took one of men with here be flask bullet pouch said do reload pistol a discharge for minute sound of faggot being thrown down continued then footstep be heard retreating be quiet again now be turn again malcolm said be one thing to prepare fire to light fine fellow expect that have forgotten that there be firearm here presently light be seen in distance two men with blazing brand approached advanced confidently until within twenty yard of tower then there be sharp crack of pistol one of fell forward on face other hesitated stood irresolute then summoning up courage sprang forward a did so shot flashed out too fell prostrate brand hissing spluttering in snow few foot from pile of brushwood loud yell of rage disappointment arose on night air showing how large be number of peasant who be watching operation time elapsed before further move be made on part of assailant then twenty point of light be seen approaching donald malcolm said to soldier go up to top of tower with comrade be sure to light pile time if be only fired in one place may possibly dash out light with stone light rapidly approached when bearer came within forty yard stopped be wild group a with unkempt hair beard rough attire stood holding lighted brand above head very tall powerful man stood at head come on said why do hesitate let finish with rushed forward malcolm have pistol lying on sill of loophole covering when peasant have run ten pace fired man fell headlong others stopped second shot took effect among with yell of terror hurled brand towards pile fled most of brand fell short others missed aim from loophole malcolm saw that one have fallen on to outside faggot of pile almost instantly heavy stone fell in snow close by malcolm stood with eye fixed on brand twig against leaned be catching flame began to shoot up higher higher rose shout of triumph from peasant told how keenly be also watching still heavy stone continued to fall flame rose higher faggot be now alight minute fire must communicate with pile then there be crash shower of spark leapt up a faggot struck by one of heavy stone be dashed from place lay blazing twenty foot distant from pile there burnt out for time tower be safe for hour defender watched peasant who have now lighted great fire just out of pistol shot from tower be gathered thickly round light flashing redly from pike head scythe uproar of voice be loud though defender guessed that be discussing next plan of attack must catch meaning from such word a reached for patois of bavarian peasant be unintelligible at last large number seized brand approached a before towards pile others scattered in various direction while men with musket again opened fire at top of tower malcolm took post at loophole awaiting attack men in front of did not advance suddenly light sprang up beneath there be sound of falling stone light grew brighter brighter knew that time pile have be fired a ran upstairs be met by one of soldier from above crept round by back of church sir round at foot of tower have fired pile before saw that be there can not be helped malcolm said be sure to succeed sooner later call others down from roof door at top of stair be now closed crevice be stuffed tightly with strip torn from men clothes so a to prevent smoke from entering when door below gave way to flame broad glare of light now lit up scene shower of spark occasional tongue of flame be visible through window shut down trapdoor in roof malcolm said will check draught through window wood be dry what smoke made way in through window found way out through loophole of upper chamber without seriously incommoding below can take easy now malcolm said a set example by sitting down against wall will be hour before stonework below will be cool enough to permit to attack be lighting circle of fire round church one of soldier said looking out think will be trying to escape now that door be burned be too late trust messenger be mile away by time in hour flame died away deep red glow showed that pile of ember be still giving out intense heat one of men be now placed on top of tower again a measure of precaution be certain that hour must elapse before attack must be made peasant indeed secure of prey evinced hurry to commence attack spent night in shouting singing round fire occasionally yelling threat of fate awaited against defender of tower towards daylight malcolm commenced preparation for defence door be taken off hinge be laid on stone stair be two foot wide door being three inch le rope be fastened round upper end to prevent from sliding down wish have grease to pour over malcolm said dry a be will be next to impossible for anyone to walk up sharp incline four must be able to hold against peasant till doomsday be not until broad daylight that peasant prepared for attack so long a operation have be distant one have seemed easy enough a in confused mass approached open doorway realized that to ascend narrow staircase defended at top by desperate men be enterprise of common danger that work have regarded a finished be in fact scarcely begun greater part then hung back band of men who by blackened garment swarthy face malcolm judged to be charcoal burner armed with heavy ax advanced to front with air of dogged resolution approached door defender gave sign of presence pistol flashed out from window loophole striding through still hot ash leader of woodman passed through doorway advanced up stair ran in short straight flight round tower lighted by narrow loophole resistance be encountered until reached last turning where broader glare of light came from open doorway where two of soldier pike in hand stood ready to repel with shout to follower to come on peasant sprang forward ascended three step then a placed foot upon sharply inclined plane of door have not noticed stumbled forward companion supposing have be pierced with spear pressed on after fell when trod upon door until heap of men cumbered stair be not unharmed for with long pike scottish spearmen ran through through a lay body afforded foothold to who followed must make little way for a one must advance at time a came on be slain by pike finding that two be well able to hold door malcolm with other ran up to top of tower toppled over stone of parapet upon mass gathered around door at once scattered on stair finding unable to get forward for narrow passage be now completely choked with dead made way out again rejoined comrade expect will send musketeer first next time malcolm said a rejoined below leaving soldier on watch now let get door up again bring dead here can form barrier with breast high door be quickly shifted on one side then trooper brought up dead who be eleven in number now replace door malcolm ordered fill iron cap with blood there be plenty flowing from fellow pour over door will be a good a oil be done body be then piled shoulder high across door can fire a much a like now malcolm said will be nearer defy anyone to climb up door now chapter xv timely rescue although unaware how much more formidable task before have become peasant be disheartened by defeat even boldest hesitated at thought of again attacking foe so formidably posted none of who have returned be able to explain what be obstacle have checked advance that must tell be that before have fallen in case even before be touched by spear of defender mystery added to dread assault of so difficult position naturally inspired hour be spent in discussing how next attack must be made many indeed be strongly in favour of remaining quietly around tower starving defender into surrendering others advocated attempt to stifle by heaping green wood damp straw round tower more timid pointed out that many must be killed in carrying out task by firearm of besieged that even be combustible placed in position lighted success of experiment must be by mean certain a besieged might stuff up orifice at worst might obtain sufficient fresh air on top of tower to enable to breathe be forgetting one of peasant exclaimed powder wagon broke down a count tilly retreated from lech did not carry off powder barrel hide partly to prevent falling into hand of accursed swede partly because powder must last for year for hunting wolf wild boar have only to stow inside tower to blow into air idea be seized with shout of acclamation most of peasant who have assisted in carrying off content of wagon be present started instantly to dig up barrel have taken a share of booty shout of satisfaction departure of forty fifty men at full speed in various direction did not pas unnoticed by garrison of tower have got plan of sort malcolm said what be have idea certainly seem confident about look at fellow throwing up cap waving arm see how can be attacked like sign of confidence on part for know now how strong position be seems to that be impregnable except against artillery unable to repress uneasiness malcolm wandered from window to window watching attentively what be going on without keeping a far back a possible from loophole for men with musket kept up dropping fire at opening although aim be poor bullet occasionally passed in flattened against opposite wall there be man returning said in about hour be carrying something on shoulder can not see what be in ten minute man have reached group of peasant standing two three hundred yard from church be greeted with cheer waving of hat good heaven malcolm exclaimed suddenly be barrel of powder must have stripped broken down ammunition wagon be danger indeed men grasped weapon rose to foot at news prepared to take step young officer might command for promptitude ingenuity have inspired with unbounded confidence in must at hazard said after few minute thought prevent from storing barrel below remove barricade of body then carry door down stair must fix again on bottom step bottom stair be foot two inside doorway if place there will hinder rushing up to attack pike a stand above will prevent from placing barrel inside will take place at loophole a before can not prevent crawling round from behind a did to light faggot if pile outside may blow in hole in wall of tower be possible that even then may not fall two will be sufficient to hold stair at rate for present do cameron take place on tower drop stone over on who may try to make way round from behind even if do harm will make careful delay operation hour now be of consequence malcolm instruction be carried out be in readiness before peasant of whom have to go considerable distance have returned with powder lesson of previous evening have evidently not be lost upon peasant for malcolm saw tall man who be acting a leader wave hand who have brought powder started to make detour round church malcolm finding that movement be being made towards front at present must hing from loophole ran up to top of tower took place by soldier who be lying down on roof looking over edge presently first of peasant appeared round corner of main building dashed rapidly across to angle of tower two heavy stone be dropped have passed on long before have reached bottom man after man followed malcolm seeing that must hing to stop again ran down a did so heard scream of agony leading peasant have reached doorway a dashed in to place barrel of powder be run through through by spear of pikemen fell half in half out of doorway barrel rolled distance away behind stopped panic stricken at sudden fall several of dropped barrel fled while others ran round angle of tower again coming in violent contact with following then hurried round behind church malcolm stamped foot with vexation what fool be muttered not to have thought of sortie if have held ourselves in readiness to spring out might have cut down whole of at rate none must have got off with barrel unexpected failure greatly damped spirit of peasant there be much consultation among before fresh move be made a saw that be fully occupied paying heed to tower malcolm said to men be going outside prepare to help up over door again quickly if necessary leaving sword behind took leap from step above inclined plane landed at bottom at once threw down outside with dagger removed hoop of one of barrel scattered content thickly along front of tower none of peasant perceived for there be many body lying round foot of tower even have looked way must not have noticed that one prone figure have be added to number crawling cautiously along malcolm pushed two other barrel before opening a before spread content of one upon ground near side of tower other by hinder face thick black layer on snow must have told tale instantly to soldier malcolm have little fear of peasant in haste paying attention to when task be completed crawled back again to door laid train from foot of slide to powder without will remain here said for present do one of take place in belfry tell cameron to shout down to what be passing behind do run instantly down stair to tell peasant advanced next time accompanied by strong force of armed comrade a before came round from behind intending to stack barrel in angle there a bearer of first two three powder barrel came round corner cameron shouted news soldier below ran down to malcolm who fired pistol into train broad flash of fire rose round tower followed instantaneously by two heavy explosion there be silence for instant then chorus of shriek yell powder barrel borne by two first men have exploded head having be knocked in previously to admit of ignition thirty of peasant be killed terribly mutilated by explosion rest took to heel in terror leaving wounded comrade on ground echo of explosion have scarce died away when shout of terror broke from main body of peasant malcolm saw flying in direction instant afterwards ringing sound of swedish trumpet be heard squadron of horse galloped down full speed peasant attempted resistance fled in direction hotly pursued by swede who broke up into small party followed fugitive cross country cutting down great number of swedish leader at once rode up to foot of tower where malcolm have already sallied out be glad indeed be in time captain graheme have ridden without drawing rein since messenger arrived at four o'clock morning thanks indeed captain burgh malcolm replied coming be most welcome though think have given peasant so hot lesson that must not have attacked again by tightening waistbelts must have held on for three four day see that have punished heavily swedish officer said looking round at body what be explosion heard will see sign behind tower malcolm said a led way there tried to blow up burnt own finger scene behind tower be ghastly thirty peasant lay with clothes completely burned from body greater portion of dead still writhing in agony malcolm uttered exclamation of horror be kindness to put wretch out of misery swede said dismounting passed sword through body of writhing men know be in favour of carrying on war a mercifully a may be continued turning to malcolm for have talked matter over before now god forbid must strike fallen foe poor wretch be beyond help be true mercy to end suffering have have heavy lesson malcolm said there be eleven more dead up in belfry tried to carry by storm dozen at least crushed by stone three men have indeed given good account of yourselves captain burgh exclaimed while be talking be fasting here be bottle of wine cold chicken manchet of bread put in wallet on starting let breakfast for though pretend to have be fasting a have morning ride have given appetite see fellow be hard at work already on viand orderly brought for in havresack first let move away to tree over yonder for verily scent of blood of roasted flesh be enough to take away one appetite little squeamish a war have taught to be captain burgh asked question until malcolm have finished meal have plenty more food said for have brought three led horse well laden be better that eat more at present ti ill overloading fasting stomach men will not be back from pursuit for couple of hour yet for will not draw rein so long a horse can gallop so excited be over tale of horrible cruelty have be perpetrated on men who have fallen into hand of peasant so now can tell in full tale of adventure have time to ask question of sergeant for be called up sent off five minute after arrived with news that with three men be beleaguered here by party of peasant related whole incident have befallen since have be suddenly felled made captive by woman in hut in village swede laughed over part of adventure to think said of dashing captain of green brigade being made captive by couple of old woman there be more than one gallant scot if report be true have fallen captive to german maiden of sort to be taken prisoner hid in straw yard be too good be laughing matter can tell malcolm said though doubtless will serve a standing jest against for long time however be so thankful have got out of scrape that may laugh who will when malcolm finished story captain burgh said have managed marvellously well indeed graheme can well afford to put up with little laughter anent that matter of woman for in truth there be few who must with three men have held post against four five hundred a have done ay fairly defeated before came on scene thought of yours of laying door upon stair be masterly one rarely met defeated device of enemy now if will will mount stronghold of yours with see exactly how stand for will have to tell tale score of time at least when get back to camp can do better after have seen for various feature of place by time have mounted top of tower captain burgh have fully satisfied a to detail of defence trooper began to return horse be far too fatigued with long ride from camp

forward with brigade be advancing to reinforce army under gustavus reached ingolstadt on day when king raised siege accompanied on march to munich malcolm on rejoining be greeted with great pleasure by comrade who have made up mind that have in way fallen victim to peasant noncommissioned officer men of party have be severely reprimanded for leaving village without finding in defence declared that have searched house shed having found sign of of struggle having taken place supposed that must have returned alone excuse be not held to be valid idea of malcolm having left men without order being so preposterous that be held must never have be entertained for moment by will never be anxious about again nigel graheme said when malcolm finished narrative of adventure to officer of regiment a sat round campfire on evening when rejoined be third fourth time have given up for dead happens in future will refuse to believe possibility of harm having come to will be sure that sooner later will walk quietly into camp with fresh batch of adventure to tell of may be doomed to lay bone in german soil will not be good fairy have distinctly taken charge of there be saying what brilliant destiny may await must keep clear of petticoat graheme colonel munro laughed evidently danger lurks for there if be caught napping again delilah will assuredly crop hair of young samson of ours there be not much of delilah in fury who felled with mallet colonel malcolm laughed however will be careful in future will not give chance ah may come in form next time malcolm munro said time be old woman next time may be young one beware boy be far most dangerous innocent though may look laugh ran round circle forewarned forearmed colonel malcolm said sturdily will be on guard against female creature young old in future think that in affair woman have have much to boast about friend have best have left alone be so malcolm colonel said warmly have borne well bravely have got old head on young shoulder of yours be a full of plan stratagem a if have be campaigner for last half century man even in green brigade not hepburn must have held that church tower more ably than did will be good tale to tell king a ride on march tomorrow for love gallant deed more so when there be prudence good strategy a well a bravery have more than once asked if have be getting into new adventure seemed almost surprised when told that be doing duty with company evidently regard a special mission to get into harebrained scrape regard in fact a pedagogue might view pickle of school there be general laugh at malcolm expense know how be be always getting into scrape lad said half ruefully when laugh subsided be sure want to get into colonel really have never gone out of way to do so unless call march to help count of mansfeld going out of way other thing have come to without fault of own quite so graheme colonel said smiling be always excuse of boy who get into scrape question be why do thing always happen to to nobody else if can explain that whole case be made out take seriously malcolm continued seeing that lad looked really crestfallen know be only laughing there be not man here including who doe not envy little for numerous adventure have fallen to lot for courage wisdom have shown in extricating from now please will tell colonel malcolm said more cheerfully why be turning back upon ingolstadt be marching away without taking have be away for ten day know be mystery to why be leaving only enemy between vienna after having beaten so heartily fortnight since without making effort to rout thoroughly maximilian position be very strong one lad covered a be by gun of ingolstadt must be even harder task to dislodge than be to cross lech in teeth be wrong be not only army stand between vienna sooner be old tilly dead than greater than tilly appears to oppose be in field again have be known that have for time be negotiating with emperor who have be imploring to forgive slight be passed upon before to again take field wallenstein knowing that game be in hand that emperor must finally agree to term chose to dictate have while have be negotiating be collecting army when emperor finally agreed to condition that be at conclusion of peace to be assured royal title fief of sovereign state have army ready to hand be now on point of entering bohemia with men what plan may be can not yet say at rate must not do to be delaying here leaving germany open to wallenstein to operate a will be stern day at leipzig mark word will be sterner still when meet wallenstein for great captain a tilly undoubtedly be wallenstein be far greater europe will hold breath when gustavus two greatest captain of age meet in pitched battle at regiment of munro spynie be quartered in magnificent electoral palace where fared sumptuously enjoyed not little comfortable quarter store of old wine in cellar sir john hepburn be appointed military governor of munich in arsenal armour arm clothing sufficient for infantry be found hundred forty piece of cannon be discovered buried beneath floor of palace carriage be ready in arsenal be soon put in order for battle for three week army remained at munich gustavus waiting to see what course wallenstein be taking imperialist general have entered bohemia have driven thence with scarcely effort arnheim saxon formed junction near eger with remnant of army have be beaten on lech then leaving strong garrison in ratisbon have marched on with army of sixty thousand men saw that best plan to force gustavus to loose hold of bavaria be to march on important point lying between north germany therefore selected place gustavus must not abandon so must be obliged to leave bavaria garrisoned only by force insufficient to withstand attack of pappenheim who have collected considerable army for recovery of territory of maximilian such point be nuremberg greatest strongest of free city have be first to open gate to gustavus swedish king must hardly abandon friendly city to assault of imperialist indeed fall must have be followed by general defection from cause of part of germany must have found isolated cut off from north a soon a gustavus perceived that nuremberg be point towards wallenstein be moving hastened at once from munich to assistance of threatened city force at disposal have be weakened by despatch of marshal horn to lower palatinate by garrison left in bavarian city have men disposable to meet with whom wallenstein be advancing did not hesitate however sent off messenger at once to direct corp in swabia under general banner prince william of weimar general ruthven to join if possible before nuremberg marching with haste arrived at nuremberg before wallenstein reached prepared at once for defence of city first called together principal citizen of nuremberg explained to position showed be to fall back with army must be able to effect junction with troop under general must ere long be in position to offer battle to wallenstein upon more equal term be to do so must be forced to abandon city to vengeance of imperialist told that did remain before city must to great extent be dependent upon for food supply a must be beleaguered by wallenstein must be unable to draw food forage from surrounding country must therefore only maintain by aid of cordial goodwill assistance of citizen people of nuremberg be true to side have chosen placed whole of resource at disposal gustavus at once set army to work to form position in must confront overwhelming force of enemy round city at distance of about thirteen hundred yard from dug ditch nowhere le than twelve foot wide eight deep where most exposed to attack eighteen foot wide twelve deep within circuit of ditch erected eight large fort connected with long thick earthen parapet strengthened with bastion on rampart fort three hundred cannon for most part supplied by city of nuremberg be placed in position a camp between rampart town be traversed by river pegnitz numerous bridge be thrown across so that whole force must concentrate on side in case of attack so vigorously did army assisted by citizen labour at work that be completed in fourteen day after gustavus reached nuremberg be on th of june that swedish army arrived there on th wallenstein maximilian of bavaria appeared before with intention of making immediate assault work however although not yet quite completed be so formidable that wallenstein saw at once that success of assault upon must be extremely doubtful in spite of earnest entreaty of maximilian to lead army to assault decided to reduce place by starvation method appeared at once easy certain whole of surrounding country belonged to bishop of bamberg who be devoted to imperialist cause possessed town strong place in circle of country around nuremberg wallenstein have brought with vast store of provision must draw upon surrounding country for further maintenance of army be only necessary then to place in position where swede must not attack with hope of success position lay at distance of three mile from nuremberg where there be wooded hill known a alte veste round wallenstein threw up circle of defence consisting of ditch behind be interlacement of forest tree baggage wagon gabions forming almost insurpassable obstacle to attacking force within circle encamped army formed into eight division about seven thousand strong while two considerable body of troop in diocese of bamberg upper palatinate prepared to oppose force approaching to aid of nuremberg croat horse foot scoured country day night to prevent supply entering city having thus adopted mean for starving out beleaguered army city wallenstein calmly awaited result chapter xvi siege of nuremberg drearily passed day in beleaguered camp varied only by occasional raid by small party to drive in cattle from surrounding country to intercept convoy of provision on way to imperialist camp so active watchful be croat that enterprise seldom succeeded although to enable men to move with celerity gustavus mounted body of infantry on horseback thus be enabled to get over ground quickly if attacked dismounted fought on foot to mounted infantry name of dragoon be given so useful be found that institution be adopted in other army dragoon became recognized portion of military force in time custom of dismounting fighting on foot be gradually abandoned dragoon became regular cavalry in modern time utility of gustavus invention of mounted infantry have be again recognized in small war in england have be engaged body of mounted infantry have be organized ere long mounted infantry will again become recognized arm of service raid in search of provision occupied small portion of army rest passed time in enforced idleness there be nothing to be done save to clean furbish arm armour to stand on rampart gaze on distant height of alte veste to watch solid column of imperial army from time to time wallenstein marched down from stronghold paraded in order of battle a challenge to swede to come out fight to loiter through narrow street of nuremberg to talk to citizen whose trade commerce be now entirely at standstill malcolm with restlessness of youth seldom stayed many hour quiet in camp did not care either for drinking gambling must imitate passive tranquillity of old soldier who be content to sleep away greater part of time therefore spent many hour day in city where speedily made many acquaintance in city of nuremberg time dragged a slowly a did in camp at ordinary time centre of quiet busy trade city be now cut off from world shop be for most part closed artisan stood idle in street townsfolk have nought to do save to gather in group discus time to take occasional excursion beyond gate into camp of ally advance then of young scottish officer be willingly responded to soon became intimate in house of principal citizen while greater part of comrade spent evening in drinking gambling enjoyed hour in conversation music in house of citizen of nuremberg long inaction brought moral consequence troop became demoralized insubordinate from enforced idleness plundering act of violence became so common that gustavus be obliged to issue most stringent ordinance to restore discipline officer many men have to be executed before spirit of insubordination be quelled in order to pas of hour of day malcolm obtained leave from one of great clockmaker of town for nuremberg be at time centre of craft of clockmaking to allow to work in shop to learn mystery of trade most of establishment be closed be acquaintance be one of wealthiest of citizen be able to keep craftsman at work to store good manufactured until better time must return malcolm began work purely to occupy time presently came to take lively interest in be soon able to take to piece put together again cumbrous simple machine constituted clock of period workshop be not in day factory master of craft worked surrounded by craftsman apprentice wheel spring be made upon premise fashioned finished with chisel file there be interest in work far beyond posse in present day when watch be turned out wholesale separate part being prepared by machinery work of artisan consisting solely in finishing putting together laying aside armour gay attire donning workman apron malcolm sat at bench by side of master shaping filing listening to story connected with trade history of nuremberg anticipated advantage from knowledge be gaining regarded simply a pleasant way of getting through portion of day thus for three month army confronted other provision be becoming terribly scarce magazine of city be emptying fast although working night day mill of place did not suffice to grind flour for need of so many mouth population of city be greatly swollen by crowd of protestant fugitive who have fled there for refuge on approach of imperialist magazine of city dwindled fast under demand made upon by addition that of swedish army to normal population fever broke out in city camp water of pegnitz be tainted by carcass of dead horse other animal supply of forage have long since be exhausted baggage troop animal died in vast number still there be sign of change wallenstein must not attack gustavus must not swedish king waited to take advantage of false move on part of imperial commander wallenstein be a great general a afforded opening turning deaf ear to entreaty importunity of maximilian that must end tedious siege by attack upon small enfeebled army around nuremberg time gustavus be in constant communication with general outside messenger making way by speed stratagem through beleaguering croat kept up spirit of men by daily review by cheerful countenance always wore swedish column be gradually closing in towards nuremberg one be led by chancellor oxenstiern to whom have be committed care of middle rhine lower palatinate where have be confronted by spanish troop under don philip de sylva on th july leaving horn with small force to oppose spaniard chancellor set out to join master on way effected junction with force of landgrave of hesse cassel general have be opposed

joined by body of troop under bernhard of weimar force from wurtzburg soon afterwards came up whole of detached corp amounting to men being now collected marched to bruck ten mile north of nuremberg three day later on th of august gustavus rode into camp on st marched at head into nuremberg unhindered by imperialist gustavus probably calculated that imperialist must now move down offer battle wallenstein who have detached men to bring up supply must not place in field number equal to of reinforcement preferred to await attack in position have prepared with such care knew strait to nuremberg defender be reduced impossibility there must be of feeding new arrival country round for vast distance have be long since stripped of provision gustavus have course open to to march away with army leave city to fate to attack imperialist in stronghold on day after arrival st of august gustavus marched out opened cannonade upon imperialist position in order to induce wallenstein to come down give battle wallenstein be not however to be tempted kept whole army busy with spade axe further intrenching position next day king brought gun nearer to enemy camp for twenty four hour kept up heavy fire only result however be that wallenstein fell back few hundred yard on to two ridge on one of be ruined castle called alte veste other be known a altenburg ascent to be steep craggy be covered by thick forest here wallenstein formed in front of position threefold barrier of felled tree woven interlaced with other barrier rising in semicircle one above other before swedish cannon ceased to fire new position of imperialist have be made impregnable unfortunately for gustavus have at moment lost service of best officer in army sir john hepburn whom have always regarded a right hand quarrel have arisen from trifling circumstance gustavus in heat of moment made disparaging allusion to religion of hepburn who be catholic also to officer love of dress finery indignant hepburn at once resigned commission swore never again to draw sword in service of king resolution to adhered although gustavus when anger cooled endeavoured in way to appease angry soldier a persisted in resolution colonel munro be appointed to command of green brigade be probable that quarrel be consummation of long standing grievance hepburn a well a other scottish officer have shared indignation of sir john hamilton when latter resigned in consequence of swedish troop being placed in post of honour at storm of castle of marienburg after scot have done work there have too be much discontent among concerning marquis of hamilton whom considered that gustavus have treated ungenerously still more concerning lieutenant colonel douglas whom gustavus have committed to common prison for slight breach of etiquette punishment at english ambassador sir harry vane remonstrated whole scottish officer considered insult to country there be probably fault on side scottish troop be backbone of swedish army to be principally due almost whole of success gustavus have gained doubtless presumed upon fact although gustavus recognized obligation a be shown by immense number of command governorship bestowed upon scottish officer may well have be angered irritated by insistance with asserted claim service be however most unfortunate circumstance just at critical moment must have lost service of officer whose prudence be equal to daring who be unquestionably one of greatest military leader of age be probable that have hepburn remained by side king must not have undertaken attack upon impregnable position of imperialist deprived of counsellor upon whose advice have hitherto invariably relied gustavus determined to attempt to drive wallenstein from position decision being finally induced by ruse of imperialist commander who desired nothing so much a that swede must dash force against terrible position have prepared for accordingly on th of august directed considerable portion of force to march away from rear of position a if alarmed at superior strength of swede have determined to abandon height have so long occupied to march away gustavus fell into trap prepared at once to assault position two hundred piece of artillery heralded advance be made by whole body of musketeer of army drafted from several brigade divided into battalion strong commanded by colonel be terrible position be advancing to storm of line of intrenchment be surmounted by row of polished helmet while pike arquebus glittered in sunshine be not long that scene be visible for a battalion approached foot of altenburg piece of artillery opened from summit from ridge of alte veste while smoke of arquebus drifted up in cloud from line of intrenchment steadily in good order scotch swedish infantry pressed forward forcing lower ditch strove to climb rocky height in vain did strive over over again reached intrenchment be unable to force way through thickly bound fallen tree while line be torn with storm of iron lead never did scottish soldier of gustavus fight with greater desperation valour score of rolled lifeless down slope fresh men took place strove to hack way through impenetrable screen through imperialist bullet whistled like hail at last when nigh number have fallen rest exhausted broken in disorder fell suddenly back gustavus in person then led on finlanders after struggle a obstinate heroic a of predecessor in turn fell back baffled livonian next made attempt in vain in meantime sharp conflict have taken place between imperial cavalry swedish left wing wallenstein cuirassier hidden by smoke charged right through column of swedish infantry success be counterbalanced by rout of cronenberg invincibles magnificent regiment of horseman by finland trooper troop of duke bernhard of weimar among whom be still scottish regiment of hamilton douglas marched against height commanded alte veste drove back imperialist with great loss five hundred musketeer of green brigade under colonel munro then pushed gallantly forward posted far in advance resisting attempt of imperialist to drive back until lieutenant colonel sinclair who be now in command of munro own regiment brought forward to assistance until next morning body of one thousand men maintained ground have won in spite of effort of imperialist to dislodge colonel munro be severely wounded in left side lieutenant colonel maken capt innis capt traill be killed immense number of other scottish officer be killed wounded news be brought down to gustavus of advantage gained by duke bernhard be unable to take advantage of by moving army round to position a must have exposed to counter attack of enemy while doing so therefore launched fresh column of attack against alte veste be followed by yet until regiment in army have in turn attempted to storm position still without success battle have now raged for ten hour nightfall put end to struggle hepburn have day ridden behind king a simple cavalier have twice carried message through thick of fire when there be others to bear so great have be slaughter round person of king be first time gustavus have be repulsed must hardly yet realize fact a messenger after messenger came in from different division discovered how terrible have be loss most of general superior officer have be killed wounded men lay dead on field there be nigh three time that number of wounded imperialist on side lost killed wounded account of loss on side differ greatly placing imperial loss higher than of swede palpably absurd estimate a imperialist fighting behind shelter must not have suffered anything like so heavily a assailant who be exposed to fire in open hepburn bore order from king for munro troop of duke bernhard to retire from position have won a be entirely cut off from rest of army must at daylight have have whole of imperialist upon service be one of great danger hepburn have to cut way sword in hand through croat who intervened between comrade of green brigade accomplished task in safety before daylight munro men regiment of duke bernhard rejoined army in plain though repulsed gustavus be not defeated took up new position just out of cannon shot of altenburg then offered battle to wallenstein latter however well satisfied with success remained firm in policy of starving out enemy resisted device of king to turn from stronghold for fourteen day gustavus remained in position then must hold out no longer supply be entirely exhausted summer have be unusually hot shrunken water of pegnitz be putrid stinking carcass of dead horse poisoned air fever pestilence raged in camp leaving then kniphausen with eight thousand men to aid citizen of nuremberg to defend city must wallenstein besiege gustavus marched on th of september by way of neustadt to windsheim there halted to watch further movement of enemy five day later wallenstein quitted camp marched to forsheim so far advantage of campaign lay with patience iron resolution have given first check to victorious career of lion of north munro regiment a be still called for be now full colonel although lieutenant colonel sinclair commanded in field have suffered terribly le perhaps than of who have in vain attempted to force way up slope of alte veste many eye grew moist a at daybreak regiment marched into place in rank of brigade saw how terrible have be slaughter among munro soldier have have little of hand to hand fighting in men blood becomes heated thought of danger be lost in fierce desire to kill loss have be caused by storm of cannonball bullet have swept through a panting breathless struggled up steep slope incapable of answering fire of enemy have have triumph indeed a imperial regiment broke fled before advance although proud that at least have succeeded in day when failure be general there be not man regretted that have not come within push of pike of enemy malcolm graheme have passed scatheless through fray good fortune have attended few of brother officer uncle be badly wounded several of friend have fallen of men who have marched from denmark year before scarce third remained in rank although regiment have be strengthened by breaking up of two three of weaker battalion incorporation with other scottish regiment be now le than former strength while gustavus wallenstein have be facing other at nuremberg war have continued without interruption in other part swede ally have gained advantage everywhere except in westphalia lower saxony where pappenheim have more than held own against baudissen who commanded for gustavus although wallenstein have checked king have gained no material advantage have wrested no single town fortress from hand gustavus be still in bavaria nearer to munich than be garrison still holding ulm nordlingen donauworth strongest fortress felt sure however that must be impossible for gustavus to maintain at one spot army have at windsheim that with so many point to defend must soon break up into separate command resolved then to wait until did so then to sweep down upon northern germany so by threatening king line of retreat to force to abandon bavaria south to march to meet at present be in position to risk battle for have already detached men to reinforce holk whom have sent with to threaten dresden bavarian who be with under maximilian have separated from on way to forsheim on arriving at place army numbered men while gustavus have more than gathered at windsheim gustavus on part determined to carry out former project to march against ingolstadt have before failed to capture thence

crossing rhine must succeed in doing must be in position to dictate term to emperor in vienna on th of october reached neuberg on danube halted there awaiting arrival of siege train from donauworth while making most vigorous exertion to press on necessary arrangement for march against vienna received most urgent message to return to saxony not only a be told have wallenstein penetrated into province be employing influence to detach elector from protestant cause there be great fear that weak prince must yield to solicitation of wallenstein to own jealousy of king of sweden sooner in fact have gustavus crossed danube than wallenstein moved towards schweinfurt by so doing drew to place swedish army under command of duke bernhard then suddenly marched eastward at full speed capturing bamberg baireuth culmbach pushed on to colberg town be captured swedish colonel dubatel who be really scotchman by name m'dougal gallant brilliant officer threw with dragoon into castle commanded town defended so resolutely against assault of wallenstein that duke bernhard have time to march to within twenty mile of place wallenstein then raised siege marched east to kronach then north to weida on elster thence pressed on direct to leipzig besieged at once while main body of troop be engaged before city others took possession of surrounding town fortress leipzig held out for only two day after capture wallenstein marched to merseburg where be joined by army under pappenheim thus reinforced be in position to capture whole of saxony elector timid vacillating be fully conscious of danger solicitation of wallenstein to break off from alliance with king of sweden to join imperialist be strongly seconded by marshal von arnheim most trusted councillor who be intimate friend of imperialist general be indeed hard decision gustavus be called upon to make on one hand vienna lay almost within grasp for wallenstein be now too far north to interpose between capital on other hand must elector of saxony join imperialist position after capture of vienna must be perilous in extreme emperor must probably leave capital before arrived there conquest must therefore be barren one gustavus reluctantly determined to abandon plan to march to assistance of saxony chapter xvii death of gustavus determination of gustavus to march to assistance of saxony once taken lost not moment in carrying into effect general banner whom greatly trusted be unfortunately suffering from wound until must recover appointed prince palatine of burkenfeldt to command corp strong determined to leave on danube

away from nuremberg scottish officer in swedish army accompanied hepburn three companion along road for long german mile from neustadt then parted with great grief from gallant cavalier who have led so often to victory malcolm graheme did not remain behind in bavaria with comrade of green brigade gustavus who have taken great fancy to young scotch officer whose spirit of adventure daring be in strong harmony with own character appointed to ride on own personal staff although parted with regret from comrade malcolm be glad to accompany king on northward march for there be probability of very active service in bavaria be certain that desperate battle must be fought when gustavus wallenstein met face to face in open field at erfurt gustavus be joined by duke bernhard of saxe weimar with force raised army to strength of news of approach have again revived courage of elector of saxony who have occupied only town where elbe must be crossed dresden torgau wittenberg with main army of men lying at torgau from gustavus learned that imperial army be divided into three chief corp that of wallenstein strong that of pappenheim of gallas holk united making total of men so great be speed with gustavus have marched to erfurt that wallenstein have received notice of approach believing that for time to come must meet with serious opposition have on very day after swede reached erfurt despatched gallas with men into bohemia division of troop be at same time threatening naumburg whose possession must enable to block only easy road with gustavus must enter country held by gustavus at erfurt learned that naumburg have not yet fallen marching with great rapidity reached neighbourhood of town before imperialist be aware that have quitted erfurt cutting up small detachment of enemy who lay in way entered town at once began to intrench wallenstein first learned from fugitive of beaten detachment that gustavus have arrived at naumburg a own position lay almost centrally between naumburg torgau so long a must prevent swede saxon from uniting felt safe for although together must outnumber be superior in strength to if alone imperialist general believed that gustavus intended to pas winter at naumburg have therefore fear of immediate attack in order to extend area from must draw supply wallenstein despatched pappenheim to secure fortress of halle for although town have be captured fortress held out barred main road to north from halle pappenheim be to proceed to relief of cologne be menaced by enemy having done wallenstein withdrew from line of saale prepared to distribute army in winter quarter in town of district with portion of force occupying little town of lutzen gustavus have idea of taking up quarter for winter at naumburg proposed to elector of saxony that if must march to eilenberg midway to leipzig must make detour to south round wallenstein position join there without waiting to receive answer of elector gustavus leaving garrison in naumburg set out at one o'clock in morning on th of november on march before have proceeded nine mile learned from number of gentleman peasant favourable to cause that pappenheim have started for halle that remainder of imperial army lay dispersed among town village of neighbourhood that wallenstein be at lutzen gustavus called general together informed of news learning that lutzen be five mile distant a turned out mistaken piece of information a be nearly twice a far ordered that men must take food then wheeling to left push on towards lutzen be not until time later that wallenstein learned from imperial scout that gustavus be upon be then nearly five o'clock in evening darkness be at hand considering heavy state of road fact that gustavus must have in last three mile of march to traverse morass crossed by bridge over only two person must pas abreast felt confident that attack must not be made until following morning mounted messenger be sent in direction to bring up troop from village in be posted in meantime troop stationed around lutzen be employed in preparing obstacle to hinder advance of swede on side of road be low swampy country intersected with ditch wallenstein at once set men to work to widen deepen ditch troop a arrived on ground be to occupy night troop laboured at task in meantime gustavus have found distance longer difficulty greater than have anticipated road be so heavy that be with difficulty that artillery ammunition wagon must be dragged along delay caused by passage of morass be very great indeed passage must have be scarcely possible have men of imperial regiment of cuirassier battalion of croat who be posted in village on further side of morass defended instead of doing so fell back to eminence in rear of village remained there quietly until just a sun set whole swedish army got across cuirassier croat be at once attacked put to flight a darkness be now at hand be impossible for gustavus to make further advance army be ordered to bivouac a stood state of road have defeated plan of gustavus instead of taking enemy by surprise a have hoped falling upon scattered disunited delay have occurred have given wallenstein time to bring up force at daybreak gustavus must be confronted by force nearly equal to own occupying position very strongly defended by natural obstacle before day be won pappenheim for whom wallenstein must have sent a soon a heard of swedish advance might be on field in case imperialist must not only have advantage of position also that of number be anxious night gustavus spent greater part of in conversation with general especially kniphausen duke bernhard former strongly urged that army must repass morass march a originally intended to effect junction with saxon pointed out that troop be fatigued with long weary march during day must have to fight without food a have be found impossible to bring up wagon with supply particularly urged point pappenheim must arrive on field before victory must be won gustavus be of opinion that disadvantage of retreat be greater than of action troop hungry weary dispirited must be attacked a retired believed that by beginning action early imperialist must be defeated before pappenheim must return from halle gustavus proposed to move forward at two o'clock in morning fate be upon occasion against great swedish leader just a on previous day expected length of march heavy state of road have prevented from crushing wallenstein scattered army so now thick fog springing up making night so dark that soldier must not see man standing next to prevented possibility of movement instead of marching at two o'clock in morning be nine before sun cleared away fog sufficiently to enable army to advance then after addressing few stirring word to men gustavus ordered advance towards chursitz village in front of king led right wing consisting of six regiment of swede supported by musketeer intermingled with cavalry left composed of cavalry infantry intermixed be commanded by duke bernhard centre consisting of four brigade of infantry supported by scottish regiment under henderson be commanded by nicholas brahe count of weissenburg reserve behind

albert of lauenburg who have joined army day before rode by king short halt be made at chursitz where baggage be left behind army then advanced against imperialist who at once opened fire wallenstein have posted left so a to be covered by canal while right be protected by village of lutzen on rising ground to left of village where there be several windmill planted fourteen small piece of cannon while to support front be composed of musketeer in ditch on side of road planted battery of seven heavy piece of artillery main body of infantry formed into four massive brigade be flanked on side by musketeer intermixed with cavalry count coloredo commanded on left holk on right terzky in centre a swedish army advanced beyond chursitz seven heavy piece of artillery on side of road opened upon doing much execution while own lighter gun must not reply effectively swede pressed forward to come to close quarter left wing led by duke bernhard be first to arrive upon scene of action gallantly led by duke men forced ditch cleared road charged deadly battery killed drove away gunner rushed with fury on imperialist right holk resolute commander tried in vain to stem assault ardour of swede be irresistible scattered one after other three brigade battle seemed already lost when wallenstein took place at head of fourth brigade fell upon swede who be disordered by rapidity ardour of charge while at same moment launched three regiment of cavalry on flank swede fought heroically in vain step by step be driven back battery be recaptured gun in excitement of advance captor have omitted to spike be retaken by imperialist in meantime on right king have also forced road have driven from field croat pole opposed to be on point of wheeling troop to fall on flank of imperialist centre when one of duke bernhard aide de camp dashed up with news that left wing have fallen back broken in disorder leaving to count stalhaus to continue to press enemy gustavus accompanied by staff rode at full gallop to left at head of steinboch regiment of dragoon arrived on spot dashed to front at point where men have not yet be forced back across road riding among roused to fresh exertion by side be franz albert of lauenberg few other follower pace have be so furious that steinboch dragoon have not yet arrived a urged on broken men gustavus be struck in shoulder by musketball reeled in saddle exclaimed be nothing ordered to charge enemy with dragoon malcolm graheme others on staff hesitated king exclaimed ride duke will see to cavalry dashed forward king accompanied only by franz albert duke of lauenberg turned to leave field have scarcely moved few pace when received shot in back calling out to franz albert that be over with mortally wounded king fell to ground franz albert believing battle lost galloped away king page alone remained with dying man minute later three austrian cuirassier rode up demanded name of dying man page leubelfing refused to give firing pistol at stretched mortally wounded beside dying king gustavus then with difficulty said who be trooper leapt from horse stripped rich armour from then a saw steinboch dragoon returning from charge placed pistol close to king head fired then leaping on horse fled great be grief when malcolm happening to ride near body recognized a of king instant later regiment of imperialist cavalry charged down furious fight took place for minute over king body be however at last carried off by swede so disfigured by wound by trampling of horse in fray a to be unrecognizable news of fall of king spread rapidly through rank so far from discouraging swede inspired with desperate determination to avenge death burning with fury advanced against enemy yet preserving most perfect steadiness order in rank in vain did wallenstein officer strive to stem attack of left wing bravery skill availed nothing to arrest furious charge regiment after regiment who strove to bar way be swept aside gun near windmill be captured turned against enemy step by step imperial right wing be forced back centre be assailed in flank by gun from rising ground while stalhaus with right wing of swede attacked on left hopeless of victory imperialist centre be giving way when explosion of one of powder wagon still further shook attacked on flank in front imperialist centre wavered in few minute must have be in full flight swedish victory seemed assured when mighty trampling of horse be heard emerging from smoke pappenheim with eight regiment of imperial cavalry dashed into fray pappenheim have already captured citadel of halle when wallenstein messenger reached to wait until infantry who be engaged in plundering must be collected then to proceed at pace to field of battle must be to arrive too late to be of service pappenheim instantly placed at head of eight regiment of magnificent cavalry galloped at full speed to battlefield eighteen mile distant on way met large number of flying pole croat remnant of austrian left who have be driven from field by gustavus rallied with dashed upon troop of stalhaus who be pursuing forced backward relief afforded to imperialist by opportune arrival be immense leaving pappenheim to deal with swedish right wallenstein rallied own right on centre opposed fresh front to advancing troop of duke bernhard kniphausen inspirited by arrival of reinforcement burning to turn what have just appeared defeat into victory imperialist advanced with such ardour that swede be driven back gun on hill recaptured seemed that in terrible battle victory be at last to declare in favour of imperialist needed only return of pappenheim from pursuit of swedish right to decide day pappenheim be not to come though driven back by first impetuous charge of imperial cavalry swede under stalhaus reinforced by scottish regiment under henderson stubbornly opposed further attack while leading men forward pappenheim fell with two musketballs through body while lying there rumour for first time reached that gustavus have be killed when upon inquiry truth of rumour be confirmed eye of dying man lighted up tell wallenstein said to officer nearest to that be lying here without hope of life die gladly knowing a now know that irreconcilable enemy of faith have fallen on same day imperialist discouraged by fall of general must not withstand ardour with swede scottish infantry attacked cavalry rode from field elsewhere battle be still raging wallenstein right centre have driven count bernhard duke of brahe kniphausen across desperately contested road beyond must not force so stubbornly desperately did fight stalhaus men refreshed invigorated by victory over pappenheim force again came up took part in fight wallenstein have longer hope of victory fought now only to avoid defeat sun have already set if must maintain position for half hour darkness must save army fell back across road again fighting stubbornly in good order extending line to left to prevent stalhaus from turning flank in order terrible struggle continued till side fought with splendid bravery swede eager for victory once again apparently within grasp pressed on with fury while imperialist opposed with most stubborn obstinacy seven time did piccolomini charge with cavalry upon advancing swede seven time be horse shot under remounting time drew off men in good order in readiness to dash forward again at first opportunity other imperialist general fought with equal courage coolness while wallenstein present wherever danger be thickest animated by courage coolness though forced step by step to retire imperialist never lost formation never turned back to foe thus fight went on till darkness gathered thicker thicker combatant must no longer see other desperate battle came to end in darkness wallenstein drew off army fell back to leipzig leaving behind colour gun in thus doing threw away opportunity of turning what retreat acknowledged to be defeat into victory on following morning for scarcely have left field when six regiment of pappenheim infantry arrived from halle have held ground must have renewed battle in morning with best prospect of success for struggle of preceding day have be little more than drawn battle accession of fresh troop must have given decided advantage over weary swede newcomer finding field deserted learning from wounded lying thickly over that wallenstein have retreated at once marched away in swedish camp there be assurance that victory have be gained for have fallen on imperialist fighting a stubbornly a ever loss of king master spirit of war dispirited discouraged duke bernhard kniphausen held in darkness anxious consultation a to whether army must not at once retreat to weissenburg plan be not carried out only because be considered that be impracticable a army must be exposed to destruction must imperialist fall upon while crossing terrible morass in rear morning showed that imperialist have disappeared that mighty struggle have indeed be victory for victory won rather by superior stubbornness with swedish general held ground during night while wallenstein fell back than to splendid courage with troop have fought on preceding day better far must have be for cause swede championed that must have be driven defeated host from field of lutzen than that must have gained barren victory at cost of life of gallant monarch soul of struggle hope of protestantism guiding spirit of coalition against catholicism a represented by ferdinand of austria loss in battle be about equal le than having fallen upon side proportion without precedent in battle of modern time testifying to obstinacy valour with on side struggle be maintained from early morning until night alone terminated be said indeed that man of yellow regiment of swedish guard of blue regiment composed entirely of english scotchman lay dead on field on side many men of high rank be killed on swedish side besides gustavus fell count milo count of brahe general uslar ernest prince of anhalt colonel gersdorf wildessein on imperialist side pappenheim schenk prince abbot of fulda count berthold wallenstein general brenner issolani general of croat six colonel be killed piccolomini received ten wound none of be mortal holk be severely wounded indeed so close desperate be conflict that be said there be scarcely man in imperial army who escaped altogether without wound chapter xviii wounded controversy have never be cleared up have long raged a to death of gustavus of sweden weight of evidence be strongly in favour of who affirm that received fatal wound that in back at hand of franz albert of lauenburg circumstantial evidence be indeed almost overwhelming by birth duke be youngest of four son of franz ii duke of lauenburg on mother side be related to swedish royal family in youth lived for time at court of stockholm owing to impertinent remark in reference to gustavus fell into disfavour with queen have to leave sweden on attaining manhood professed catholic faith entered imperial army obtained command of regiment attached with much devotion to wallenstein gained confidence of general while negotiation between emperor wallenstein be pending franz albert be employed by latter in endeavouring to bring about secret understanding with court of dresden when gustavus be blockaded in nuremberg by wallenstein franz albert left camp of latter presented in of gustavus a convert to reformed religion anxious to serve a volunteer under quarrel disagreement have so far a be known taken place between wallenstein have explanation ever be given for such extraordinary change of side made too at moment when seemed that gustavus be in position almost desperate by profession of religious zeal managed to win king heart oxenstiern when saw entertained profound distrust of even warned king against putting confidence in sudden convert gustavus however naturally frank open in disposition must not believe that treachery be intended continued to treat with kindness after assault made by gustavus upon wallenstein position franz albert quitted camp saying that be desirous of raising troop for service in father territory rejoined however with only personal follower on very day before battle of lutzen be received by gustavus with great cordiality although absence of retainer increased general doubt a to sincerity be by king side when gustavus received first wound be riding close behind when king received second fatal wound in back moment king have fallen rode away from field be asserted that be who brought news of king death to wallenstein very soon after battle exchanged swedish service for saxon eighteen month later re embraced roman catholic faith re entered imperial army stronger case of circumstantial evidence must hardly be put together must certainly seem a if lauenburg have entered swedish service with intention of murdering king that did not carry out purpose during attack on altenburg be perhaps due to fact that gustavus may not have be in such position a to afford opportunity of doing so with safety to be certainly curious that after fight must have absented only rejoined on eve of battle of lutzen only piece of evidence in favour be that of truchsess chamberlain of king who affirmed that saw fatal shot fired at distance of ten pace from king by imperial officer lieutenant general falkenberg who at once turned fled be pursued cut down by luckau master of horse of franz albert general opinion of contemporary writer be certainly to effect that king of sweden be murdered by franz albert absolute fact must ever remain in doubt on morning after battle wallenstein having be joined by pappenheim infantry sent division of croat back to battlefield to take possession of must find that swede have retired on report that still held ground retired at once from leipzig evacuating saxony marched into bohemia leaving swede free to accomplish junction with army of elector thus gaining object for have fought at lutzen after death of king malcolm graheme full of grief rage at loss of monarch who be loved by troop have treated with special kindness joined soldier of duke bernhard took part in charge swept back imperialist captured cannon on hill at very commencement of struggle horse fell dead under fought on foot among swedish infantry when arrival of pappenheim on field enabled imperialist again to assume offensive malcolm having picked up pike from hand of dead soldier fought shoulder to shoulder in rank a swede contesting stubbornly foot of ground be gradually driven back towards road suddenly shot struck reeled backwards few foot strove to steady to level pike then consciousness left fell prostrate again again a fortune of desperate

protestant prince who dismayed at loss of great champion must gladly accept proposal must ensure religious liberty for have fought emperor blinded by unexpected turn of fortune infatuated by spanish counsel now looked to complete triumph to enforce absolute will upon whole of germany instead therefore of listening to wise counsel of wallenstein hastened to augment force spain sent considerable supply negotiated for with ever vacillating elector of saxony levied troop for in italy elector of bavaria increased army duke of lorraine prepared again to take part in struggle now seemed to offer

wallenstein from gustavus just when appeared in grasp be now open to duke bernhard duke be ambitious demand for franconia have not yet be entirely complied with by oxenstiern saw opportunity to obtain own term troop under order be discontented owing to fact that pay be many month in arrear private agent of duke fomented feeling by assuring men general be with must back demand accordingly refused to march further until demand be fully satisfied scotch regiment stood apart from movement though too be equally in arrear with pay munro officer of brigade chafed terribly at untimely mutiny just when way to vienna appeared open to duke bernhard forwarded demand of soldier to oxenstiern sending at same time demand on own account first that territory of franconian bishopric must at once be erected into principality in favour secondly that must be nominated commander in chief of army fighting in germany for protestant cause with title of generalissimo oxenstiern be alarmed by receipt of mutinous demand of troop on danube be disgusted when saw demand virtually supported by general first thought be to dismiss duke bernhard from swedish service saw that if did so disaffection might spread that duke might place at head of malcontent bring ruin upon cause therefore agreed to bestow at once franconian bishopric upon gave pledge sweden must defend in position declined to make generalissimo of army appointed commander in chief of force south of maine duke accepted modification have difficulty in restoring order in rank of army precious month have be wasted before matter be brought to conclusion month of october arrived before duke have completed preparation be in position to move forward while delay have be going on altringer having be joined by army of duke of feria quitted line

open by altringer disobedience to wallenstein order duke bernhard marched upon city without opposition laid siege to maximilian of bavaria be there with force sufficient to defend city have be supported by inhabitant large majority of people be protestant moreover bitterly hated bavarian who have suppressed right a free city maximilian wrote urgently to emperor to wallenstein pledging to

place wallenstein replied to order that must do in power in presence of messenger ordered count of gallas to march with men on ratisbon privately furnished general with absolute order forbidding on account to do anything might bring on action with duke wallenstein motif in so acting be a afterwards assured emperor that be not strong enough to divide army that must best cover vienna by maintaining strong position in bohemia policy be afterwards justified by event ratisbon resisted for short time finding that promised relief did not arrive capitulated on th of november maximilian having left town before surrender duke now pushed on towards vienna captured straubing plattling john of werth who be posted here not being strong enough to dispute passage of isar fell back towards bohemian frontier hoping to meet troop emperor have urged wallenstein to send to aid never came duke bernhard crossed isar unopposed on th came within sight of passau so far wallenstein have not moved have seemed to comply with emperor request to save ratisbon have seemed only have not set man in motion to reinforce john of werth refused in fact to fritter away army have sent gallas with men to join john of werth have united force be a be probable attacked defeated by swede must have be too weak to save empire keeping army strong have key of position in hand have fixed upon passau a point beyond duke bernhard must not be allowed to advance felt must attack city army be lost in front of be inn broad deep river protected by strongly fortified place behind john of werth bitterly hostile country river isar on left must be wallenstein marching across bohemian forest when therefore learned that duke bernhard be hastening on from isar towards passau put army in motion marched southward so a to place in left rear of duke movement duke bernhard heard of just when arrived in sight of passau instantly recognized extreme danger of position perceived with usual quickness of glance that to be caught before passau by wallenstein john of werth must be absolute destruction moment hesitation swedish army must have be lost without hour delay issued necessary order army retraced step with speed to ratisbon not stopping even there marched northward into upper palatinate to defend that conquered country against wallenstein even at cost of battle wallenstein declined to fight battle there have one army be that army destroyed duke bernhard with prestige of victory upon must resume march upon vienna must then be open to therefore having secured safety of capital fell back again into winter quarter in bohemia thus ferdinand again owed safety to wallenstein must have be more grateful since wallenstein have saved in defiance of own order at time fully admitted in letter to wallenstein that general have acted wisely prudently nevertheless be continually listening to spaniard jesuit many envious of wallenstein great position hoping to benefit by disgrace in spite of service great general have rendered be preparing to repeat humiliation have formerly laid upon again to deprive of command wallenstein be not ignorant of intrigue against vast a be possession pride ambition be even greater consciousness of splendid service rendered of great intellectual power belief that army have be raised by be to great extent paid out of private fund have so often led to

have so injured trade that have discharged journeyman for clock be still comparatively rare luxury be only to be seen in house of noble rich citizen knowing that wallenstein be devoted to luxury magnificence always taking with except when making most rapid march long train of baggage furniture malcolm thought possible that might obtain employment in apartment accordingly went boldly to castle where duke have established asking for steward stated that be clockmaker from workshop of celebrated horologist master jan boerhoff must repair clock watch might be out of order then be very man need steward said master duke be curious in such matter ever carry with half dozen clock with other furniture use what care will in packing shaking of wagon be constantly putting out of repair be morning

imperial master there be several clock standing on table on bracket for wallenstein although in most respect of clear commanding intellect be slave to superstition be always accompanied by astrologer who read for course of event from movement of star who indicated lucky unlucky day hour at be not propitious to transact important business hence be that placed so great importance on exact observance of hour by numerous time piece here be of clock steward said indicating of course can not work here be too heavy to be removed besides being too costly to intrust out of charge will have room prepared in castle where can work come again at noon with tool will be in readiness at hour appointed malcolm again presented duke have given personal instruction said that closet close by will be fitted up for in order that if chooses may see at work malcolm be conducted to small room near at hand here one of clock have stopped have be placed on table at once set to work soon discovered that one of wheel have be shaken from place by jolting of wagon that clock must be set going by few minute work a however object be to prolong visit to castle a long a possible set to work took entirely to piece two hour later door opened tall handsome man of commanding presence entered malcolm rose bowed respectfully feeling that be in presence of great general come from nuremberg wallenstein said a be told have learned craft in workshop of master jan boerhoff who be well known a being greatest master of craft malcolm bowed silently be strange wallenstein muttered to that young man destiny must be connected with mine yet astrologer said that who must present at castle nearest to stroke of nine morning must be factor in future a steward tell clock sounded nine a young man addressed then asked malcolm several question a to work upon be engaged then said abruptly dost know day hour on be born malcolm be somewhat surprised at question for have not heard muttered word of wallenstein at once replied that have heard that be born at stroke of midnight on last day in year duke said more left closet proceeded at once to apartment near own bed chamber although have arrived few hour previously

ceiling sign of zodiac have be painted mystical circle have be marked out on floor tall spare old man with long white beard be seated at table rose when wallenstein entered can not think duke said that calculation must for once have be mistaken that there must have be error in hour for see not how destiny of craftsman who seems to be simple lad can in way be connected with mine have made calculation three time grace old man replied be sure there be error be born wallenstein said at midnight on december st work out nativity see what star be in ascendant whether there be affinity between will do so at once astrologer said by tonight will be able to give grace information require tonight duke said will go over calculation together a to great enterprise be important that there must be mistake have for whole year remained inactive because told that time have not yet come now that say propitious moment be approaching must fain be sure that error have be committed seems well troop be devoted to will fight against bid by lavish gift favour have attached general firmly to soon ungrateful emperor will feel how rash foolish have be to insult man to whom alone owes that be not long ago fugitive exile with swede victorious master of capital kingdom have not alone saved did not at own cost raise army stand between victorious gustavus have not alone of general checked triumphant progress of invader yet evades promise procrastinates falter not one step doe take to give sovereignty of bohemia so solemnly promised seems to think that be honour reward enough for to have spent treasure blood in service turn be at hand when hand saved throne will cast from will learn how rash have be to have deceived slighted say that star last night all pointed to favourable conjunction that time for striking great blow be at hand nothing must be better astrologer said jupiter own planet mar be in ascendant saturn be still too near to encourage instant action will shortly remove to house then time will have come so be wallenstein said sooner better now will leave to study will ride out to inspect troop to see that have that need for must be kept in best of humour at present chapter xxii conspiracy next day wallenstein again entered malcolm workroom said abruptly to what deed of bravery have performed malcolm looked astonished in idle moment duke said having interest in nativity seeing that be born between two year asked astrologer to work out calculation tell that be fated that must perform deed of notable bravery while still young seemed horoscope of soldier rather than of craftsman so told sage will have that have made mistake malcolm hesitated for moment blind faith otherwise intelligent capable general placed in science of astrology be well known to world must deny that have accomplished feat duke believing implicitly statement astrologer have made must suspect that be not what seemed therefore replied modestly have done deed worthy relating to excellency once swam across swollen river to direct traveller who must otherwise have perished neighbour be good enough to say that none in part save must have attempted feat ah duke exclaimed in tone of satisfaction a usual star have spoken correctly doubtless a great courage be required to swim river in flood a to charge into rank of enemy so saying wallenstein left room filled with desire to attach to young man whom adviser have assured be in way connected with destiny wallenstein day two later offered malcolm to take into permanent service saying that be frequently plagued by stoppage of clock desired to have craftsman capable of attending to on establishment even told young man that might expect promotion altogether beyond present station malcolm must not refuse so flattering offer be at once installed a member of wallenstein household declining however use of apartment steward offered saying that have sick brother lodging with in town mingling with soldier in evening malcolm learned that there be rumour negotiation for peace be going on with saxony sweden be indeed case wallenstein be negotiating on own behalf not on of emperor so far little have come of negotiation for oxenstiern have strongest doubt of wallenstein sincerity believed that be only trying to gain time delay operation by pretended proposal for peace must not believe that great imperialist general right hand of emperor have real intention of turning against master towards end of january there be excitement in pilsen owing to arrival there of general of imperialist army save only gallas coloredo altringer malcolm be sure that gathering must only have be summoned by wallenstein upon matter of most vital importance determined at hazard to learn what be taking place in order

chamber until saw opportunity for entering unobserved then stole into room secreted behind arras beneath table standing against wall where being in shadow bulge in hanging must not attract attention in few minute heard heavy step with clanking of sword jingling of spur knew that council be beginning to assemble hum of conversation rose louder louder for quarter of hour then heard door of apartment closed knew that council be about to commence buzz of conversation ceased then voice be that of field marshal illo one of three men in wallenstein confidence rose in silence began by laying before army order emperor have sent for dispersal to various part of country by turn gave to found easy to excite indignation of assembly then expatiated with much eloquence upon merit of army general upon ingratitude with emperor have treated after noble effort in behalf court said be governed by spanish influence ministry be in pay of spain wallenstein alone have hitherto opposed tyranny have thus drawn upon deadly enmity of spaniard to remove from command to make away with entirely have asserted be long end of desire until must succeed endeavoured to abridge power in field supreme command be to be placed in hand of king of hungary solely to promote spanish power in germany a prince be merely passive instrument of spain be only with view of weakening army that six thousand troop be ordered to be detached from solely to harass by winter campaign that be now called upon at inhospitable season to undertake recovery of ratisbon jesuit ministry enriched with treasure wrung from province squandered money intended for pay of troop general then abandoned by court be forced to acknowledge inability to keep engagement to army for service for two twenty year have rendered to house

leave be for man present to consider who be to repay sum have expended in emperor service how be ever to reap reward for bravery devotion when chief who alone be cognizant of effort who be sole advocate champion be removed from when speaker concluded loud cry broke from officer that must not permit wallenstein to be taken from then babel of talk arose after much discussion four of officer be appointed a deputation to wait upon duke to assure of devotion of army to beg not to withdraw from four officer intrusted with commission left room repaired to private chamber of general returned in short time saying that duke refused to yield deputation be sent to pray in even stronger term to remain with returned with news that wallenstein have reluctantly yielded to request upon condition that of must give written promise to truly firmly adhere to to separate to allow to be separated from to shed last drop of blood in defence whoever must break covenant so long a wallenstein must employ army in emperor service be to be regarded a perfidious traitor to be treated by rest a common enemy a last word appeared to indicate clearly wallenstein have thought of assuming position hostile to emperor of defying authority save in point of refusing to be separated from army present agreed with acclamation to sign document required then gentleman marshal illo said will have document for signature at once drawn up banquet have be prepared in next room of invite now to partake at conclusion document will be ready malcolm from hiding place heard general movement a officer left apartment looking cautiously out from beneath arras saw that chamber be entirely empty determined however to remain to hear conclusion of conference accordingly remained quiet for upwards of hour during time attendant have entered extinguished light a guest must not return to council chamber now left hiding place made way to door separated from banqueting hall listening intently at keyhole heard clinking of glass sound of voice loudly raised guessed that revelry be at height more more noisy did become for marshal illo be plying guest with wine in order that might sign without examination document have prepared for signature feeling confident that none must hear in state at have now arrived malcolm cautiously opened door inch two be able to hear see passed be hour before marshal illo produced

that important word a long a wallenstein will employ army for emperor service have be inserted in first draft agreed to by wallenstein deputation have be omitted scene of noisy confusion ensued several of officer declared that must not sign document a stood general piccolomini who have only attended meeting in order that might inform emperor to whom be devoted of what took place there have drunk so much wine that forgot part be playing rose to foot with drunken gravity proposed health of emperor louder louder grew din of tongue until count terzky who be alone with illo colonel kinsky in wallenstein confidence arose in thundering voice declared that be perjured villain who must recede from engagement must according to agreement be treated a enemy by rest menace evident danger who might now draw back must run overcame scruple of recalcitrants signed paper done meeting broke up malcolm stealing away from post of observation made way back to lodging slept little that night what have seen convinced that wallenstein be really in earnest in proposition have made to oxenstiern elector of saxony that meditated open rebellion against emperor be of extreme importance that oxenstiern must be made acquainted with fact must be next to impossible to escape from pilsen burdened a be with thekla to cross country intervened between two army be constantly traversed by cavalry party scout of side after much deliberation therefore determined upon bold course of frankly informing wallenstein who be what have heard to beg of to furnish with escort to pas through line in order that might make way with speed to oxenstiern in order to assure of good faith of duke of importance of frankly speedily accepting proposal be possible of course that might fall victim to wallenstein first anger when found out that have be duped plot in be engaged discovered resolved to run risk believing that duke must see advantage to be gained by complying with proposal be necessary however to prepare thekla for worst thekla said in morning end have come to stay here circumstance have occurred will enable to continue journey at once in safety may place in prison thekla gave cry of surprise

of worst trouble terribly that be forced to do anything may possibly deprive of protection duty to country serve compels to take step be one of supreme importance to cause be long before thekla be pacified malcolm be deeply troubled at thought that girl might be left alone unprotected in strange place still there appeared probability that must be able to remain there in safety until opportunity must occur for to make way to nuremberg be with heavy heart caused far more by thought of thekla position than of danger to that took way to castle felt that duty be imperative be at heart convinced that wallenstein must eagerly embrace offer be not until midday that be able to see duke wallenstein have be greatly angered a well a alarmed at resistance scheme have met with on previous evening have believed that favour liberality have so thoroughly attached general to person that must have followed willingly without hesitation even in war against emperor discovery that although willing to support against deprivation from command shrunk alarmed at idea of disloyalty to emperor showed that position be dangerous in extreme found that signature to document have for most part be scrawled so illegibly that writer must be able to repudiate if necessary deceit be evidently intended in morning called together whole of general personally received after pouring out bitterest reproach abuse against court reminded of opposition to proposition set before on previous evening declared that circumstance have induced to retract own promise that must at once resign command general in confusion dismay withdrew to antechamber after short consultation returned to offer apology for conduct on previous evening to offer to sign anew engagement bound to be done now remained only for wallenstein to

through line of army to gain of swede might be slain in so doing important information have acquired lost be of thing important to that swedish chancellor whose nature be cautious suspicious must be thoroughly convinced that be intention to make common cause with to join heart soul in forcing emperor to accept condition united may impose upon information have acquired will assuredly suffice to do will without doubt at once set army in motion to act in concert with yours paced room for minute two in silence star truly said that be brave man that destiny be connected with mine said at length for assuredly none brave man must venture to tell that have spied into council see however that what say be reasonable cogent that news have to tell may well induce oxenstiern to lay aside doubt have so long kept asunder at once to embrace offer what then do propose must ask sir malcolm replied that must at once order squadron of horse to escort companion through debatable land between army that of swede with order for to pas freely on a soon a be beyond outpost in neighbourhood of of swede will be done wallenstein said in hour squadron of horse will be drawn up in courtyard here horse pillion

pilsen at last from whom did steal that splendid charger on whom rode up to door be not own secret colonel can only tell at present that wallenstein gave to roar of incredulous laughter broke from officer round table likely story indeed graheme duke be so fascinated with talent a watchmaker that bestowed charger fit for own riding upon to carry across into line doe not sound likely grant malcolm said be true a will acknowledge when time come that there will be no longer occasion for to keep circumstance secret only repeat wallenstein gave honour of escort conducted to crest of hill

extremely important information have gained be out of question news be of supreme importance alters whole course of event offer hope of early termination of struggle there be doubt that wallenstein be in earnest now for have committed beyond reparation only question be whether can carry army with however be clear that must ride with haste to oxenstiern with tidings not moment must be lost be in palatinate will take four day of hard riding at least to reach in meantime little maid who by way be already nearly woman have best remain here will see that be comfortable well cared for after be a

began read letter wallenstein have sent said after what tell there can be no longer slightest doubt of wallenstein intention ever since death of king have be negotiating privately with must not believe that be in earnest that such monstrous treachery be possible how must suppose that who have be raised from rank of simple gentleman to of duke prince who save fortune obtained with wife owes everything to bounty of emperor must be preparing to turn arm against be true that have done great thing for ferdinand ambition be even greater than military talent other man must have be content with enormous possession splendid dignity have attained in fact render far richer than imperial master to be prince doe not suffice for have be promised kingdom even be insufficient for ambition be clear that aim to dethrone emperor to set up in place however ingratitude doe not concern suffices now at rate be sincere that happy issue out of struggle open before henceforth can trust thoroughly though have will to join have power wallenstein with general army fighting for emperor be mighty personage wallenstein rebel be altogether by what tell seems more than doubtful whether officer will follow although army be attached to might follow must put at head be scattered in cantonment section will obey order general in command may give probably of who signed document pledging fidelity to wallenstein have already sent news to emperor of what be being done be strange situation need great care element be uncertain wallenstein writes to a if be assured of allegiance of whole of army speaks unquestionably of power to overthrow emperor man be clearly blinded by ambition infatuated by fixed belief in star however one thing be certain a much of army a can hold in hand be now ally

princely generosity to general officer popularity among troop have failed to attach to now that have declared against emperor appeared to malcolm that must be able to bring over to swedish cause only corp immediately commanded still defection must not cause vast gap in imperial defence loss of service of greatest of leader must in be heavy blow to imperialist cause have be almost solely supported by commanding talent vast private income terzky arrived on following morning same afternoon wallenstein with whole of troop at pilsen marched towards egra among officer attached to wallenstein person be scotchman named leslie to whom few other confidant have confided design wallenstein have at once introduced malcolm to two rode in company during march to egra malcolm did not find cheerful

too anxious to appear at remained in own apartment rest of officer among wallenstein chief confidant illo terzky kinsky together with captain neumann intimate adviser of terzky be among guest malcolm be also present banquet passed off gaily wallenstein health be drunk in full bumper friend boasted freely that in few day must find at head of a powerful army a have ever before commanded malcolm have

tumult be pressed down again into chair by two soldier while leslie exclaimed keep quiet sir must fain save a fellow countryman a one who be simply here in execution of duty if draw sword to defend traitor must share fate sooner have murder of four officer be accomplished than leslie butler gordon issued into town butler cavalry paraded street officer quieted garrison by telling that wallenstein have be proclaimed traitor outlaw that who be faithful to emperor must obey order regiment most attached to wallenstein have not entered city garrison listened to voice of commander wallenstein knew nothing of what have taken place in castle have just retired to bed when band of butler soldier led by captain devereux irishman burst into apartment duke leaped from bed before must snatch up sword be pierced through through by murderer halberts so fell one of greatest men of age even to present day there be difference of opinion a to extent of guilt none a to treachery with be murdered by most trusted officer wallenstein owed much gratitude to emperor be unquestionable upon other hand have even greater title to gratitude of ferdinand whose crown empire have repeatedly saved wallenstein be bigot view be broad enlightened be therefore viewed with greatest hostility by violent catholic around king by maximilian of bavaria by spaniard by jesuit who be powerful at court have once before brought about dismissal from command after have rendered supreme service intrigue against be again at point of success when wallenstein determined to defy dethrone emperor coldness with be treated at court marked inattention to request consciousness while be winning victory in field enemy be successfully plotting at court angered proud haughty spirit of wallenstein almost to madness may truly be said that be goaded into rebellion verdict of posterity have certainly be favourable to dastardly murder requited lifetime of brilliant service have be held to more than counterbalance fault committed chapter xxiv malcolm escape after fall of wallenstein colonel malcolm be led away prisoner be conducted to dungeon in castle be not until door closed behind that must fairly realize what have taken place so sudden unexpected have be scene in banqueting hall five minute before have be feasting drinking health of wallenstein now be prisoner of imperialist wallenstein adherent have be murdered be too probable that like fate must befall general alliance from so much have be hoped seemed to offer prospect of termination of long bloody struggle be cut short at blow a to own fate seemed dark enough captivity might last for year for imperialist treatment of prisoner be harsh in extreme system of exchange be usual then a now be in abeyance during religious war in germany there be almost personal hatred between combatant a malcolm knew many of compatriot who have fallen into hand of imperialist have be treated with such harshness in prison that have died there indeed be more than suspected of having be deliberately starved to death however malcolm have gone through so many adventure even scene have witnessed own captivity uncertain fate be insufficient to banish sleep from eye reposed a soundly on heap of straw in corner of cell a must have done in carved gilded bed in apartment have be assigned to in castle sun be shining through loophole of dungeon when awoke for hour occupied in polishing carefully magnificently inlaid armour wallenstein have presented with exception of helmet have not laid aside when sat down to banquet for be very light in way hampered movement except when quartered in town far removed from enemy officer seldom laid aside arm still retained sword dagger for captor in haste to finish first act of tragedy to resist rising might take place among soldiery have omitted to take from when hurried away on examination found that with dagger must shove back lock of door be firmly held by bolt without thinking on future occasion blade might be useful to pushed dagger well into lock with sharp jerk snapped off at hilt then concealed steel within long boot cast hilt through loophole presently soldier brought breakfast manchet of bread stoup of wine be visited again at dinner supper before soldier came in first time malcolm concealed sword in straw thinking that soldier must be sure to remove if noticed man who brought breakfast dinner be taciturn made reply to question man brought supper turned out of more communicative disposition what have happened repeated in reply to malcolm question well know much about do know wallenstein be dead for trooper who ride next to helped to kill everyone be content that traitor have be punished a troop have pronounced for emperor thing be quiet have good laugh afternoon colonel sent out one of men dressed up in wallenstein livery to meet duke of saxe lauenburg invite to come on at once join here duke suspected danger rode on ahead of troop with few attendant must have seen face when after passing through gate suddenly found surrounded by men prisoner bernhard of saxe weimar will be here tomorrow a say will catch in same way be rare trap can tell news heightened malcolm uneasiness capture of duke bernhard most brilliant of german general on protestant side must be heavy blow indeed to cause leaving supper untasted malcolm walked up down cell in fever of rage at impotence to prevent so serious disaster at last ate supper then threw upon straw be unable to sleep death of wallenstein have made deep impression upon imperialist general be greatly respected by foe not only be admired for immense military talent carried on war with chivalry humanity contrasted strongly with ferocity of tilly pappenheim piccolomini prisoner who fell into hand be always treated with courtesy although from motif of policy placed little check upon excess of soldiery massacre such a have caused name of tilly pappenheim to be held in abhorrence by protestant of germany be associated with of wallenstein then too princely dignity noble presence of duke have greatly impressed young soldier courtesy with have treated personally have attracted liking a well a respect to think that great general princely noble man who alone have baffled lion of north have be foully murdered by have trusted favoured filled with grief indignation more so since two of principal assassin be scotchman thought on morrow duke bernhard of weimar leader in importance second only to chancellor of sweden must fall unsuspiciously into trap set for goaded almost to madness tossed restlessly on straw through long hour of night towards morning heard faint creaking of bolt then there be sound of lock of door being turned grasped sword sprang to foot heard door close again then man produced lantern from beneath long cloak saw wallenstein steward before old man eye be bloodshot with weeping face betokened anguish death of master have caused have heard news asked ala malcolm replied have heard indeed be determined old man said to thwart project of murderer to have vengeance upon none have thought of be old man too insignificant for notice have passed day in chamber lamenting kindest of lord best of master last evening heard soldier boasting that today must capture duke of saxe weimar determined to foil have be feasting drinking night be now that trooper have fallen into drunken slumber be able to posse of key of dungeon here be helmet will lead to stable where have saddled best fastest of master horse must remain there quietly until deem that gate be open then leap upon horse ride for life few will know will probably pas out of gate unquestioned if not have sword to cut way once beyond town ride to meet duke tell master have be murdered that egra be in hand of imperialist saxe lauenburg be prisoner bid march on place with force take by assault leave not one of assassin of lord living within wall will run risk hope for share in adventure malcolm said matter little to old man replied life be worthless must gladly die in thought have brought retribution on head of murderer of master will not suspect will lock door behind place key again in girdle of drunken guard then return to own chamber quietly malcolm conductor made way through castle out into courtyard then entered stable be horse steward said again uncovering lantern be not splendid animal be master favourite sooner than that murderer must ride must cut throat of noble beast with dagger have better mission in carrying avenger of master blood now farewell rest be in own hand may heaven give good fortune so saying old man set down lantern left malcolm alone latter after examining saddle bridle seeing that buckle be firm in place extinguished light waited patiently for morning in two hour faint light began to show stronger stronger grew until be broad day still there be few sound of life movement in castle presently however noise of footstep voice be heard in courtyard although apprehensive that at moment stable door might open malcolm still delayed start a must be fatal be to set out before opening of gate at last felt sure that must be opened to admit country people coming in with supply for market have donned helmet before leaving cell now quietly opened stable door sprang into saddle rode boldly out several soldier be loitering about courtyard be washing at trough bathing head beneath fountain to get rid of fume of wine have indulged in overnight others be cleaning arm sudden appearance of mounted officer armed from head to foot caused general pause in occupation although none have suspicion that splendidly attired officer be fugitive believing that be one of leslie friend who be setting out on mission paid further heed to a quietly without sign of haste rode through gateway of castle into town inhabitant be already in street country woman with basket be vending produce market be full of people malcolm rode on at foot pace until be within sight of open gate of town when within fifty yard of gate suddenly came upon colonel leslie who have thus early be making tour of wall to see that sentry be upon alert for duke bernhard force be within few mile instantly recognized malcolm ah exclaimed captain graheme treachery treachery shut gate there drawing sword threw in malcolm way malcolm touched horse with spur bounded forward parried blow leslie struck at with sweeping cut full on traitor helmet struck to ground then dashed onward sentry be beginning to shut gate comrade be running out from guardhouse a malcolm galloped up steward have fastened holster on to saddle malcolm before starting have seen to priming of pistol in drawing one shot man who be closing gate before comrade must run up dashed through over drawbridge several bullet whizzed around be soon out of range galloping at full speed in direction in steward have told that duke bernhard be encamped in hour reached swedish line rode at once to tent of duke who be upon point of mounting beside stood man in livery of wallenstein a rode up malcolm drew pistol said to man if move foot will send bullet through head what be exclaimed duke in astonishment who be sir who with such scant courtesy ride into camp malcolm raised vizor be captain graheme of munro regiment said have ridden here to warn excellency of treachery wallenstein have be foully murdered egra be in hand of imperialist duke of saxe lauenburg have be beguiled into trap taken prisoner fellow who be one of butler trooper have be sent here to lead into like snare wallenstein murdered duke exclaimed in tone of horror murdered say impossible be too true sir malcolm replied saw friend illo terzky kinsky assassinated before eye at banquet wallenstein be murdered by favourite leslie gordon irishman butler be seized thrown into dungeon have escaped by miracle to warn of danger be blow indeed duke said mournfully turning to attendant ordered to hang false messenger to nearest tree then begged malcolm to follow into tent give full detail of terrible transaction upset scheme indeed duke said when have concluded what be strength of garrison at egra there be butler dragoon infantry regiment in garrison there when arrived six regiment accompanied on march fear that must now be considered a having gone over to imperialist then force be superior to own duke said for have six thousand men with have artillery heavy enough to make impression upon wall of town much a must like to meet traitor to deal out to punishment deserve can not adventure on siege of egra until have communicated terrible news to swedish chancellor egra be important to a affording entrance into bohemia so long a wallenstein be with now that have be murdered scheme thus suddenly destroyed can not risk destruction of force by assault upon city be longer of use to much a malcolm must have liked to have seen punishment of wallenstein treacherous follower must not feel that duke view be under circumstance correct one tent be speedily struck force fell back with speed towards bavaria after accompanying for march two malcolm left rode to join regiment duke having already sent off messenger to oxenstiern with full account of murder of wallenstein a none must say what event be likely to follow changed position of thing malcolm determined at once to carry out original intention of placing thekla under care of friend at nuremberg in direction be not probable that tide of war must for present flow after staying therefore day two with regiment where relation of event have witnessed caused greatest excitement interest malcolm obtained leave from colonel to escort thekla to nuremberg in order that might pas in perfect safety across intervening country munro gave escort of twelve trooper with journeyed by easy stage to nuremberg where worthy syndic of clockmaker wife gladly received thekla promised to treat a one of own daughter here malcolm took possession of arm valise have sent upon starting for prague to care of jan boerhoff not indeed that needed armour for suit wallenstein have given be admiration envy of comrade munro have laughingly said that since hepburn have left such gallantly attired cavalier have ridden in rank of scottish brigade there be many tear on thekla part a young protector bade adieu for there be saying how long time might elapse before might again see malcolm be sorely tempted to tell that have father consent to wooing a wife thought however better to abstain from speaking for must fall in campaign grief must be greater have come to think of a destined husband for hearty affection for already assured that must make objection to carrying out father wish shortly after rejoining regiment malcolm received communication from swedish chancellor expressing in high term approbation of manner in have carried out instruction with regard to wallenstein especially for great service have rendered cause by warning duke of saxe weimar of trap imperialist have set for death of wallenstein be followed by short pause in war have entirely frustrated plan hope of protestant caused delay in movement of imperialist emperor when heard of wallenstein death heaped favour honour upon three men who have plotted carried out murder then appointed son ferdinand king of hungary to chief command of army with general gallas a principal adviser duke of lorraine marched with army to join imperialist who be also strengthened by arrival of spanish veteran early in may new imperial general entered palatinate marched to lay siege to ratisbon to oppose imperial army numbered men duke bernhard after having drawn together troop scattered in neighbourhood must only put in field with so great disparity of force must not offer battle in way harassed interrupted advance of imperialist while sent pressing message to oxenstiern for men money to marshal horn who commanded in alsace to beg march with haste to assistance unfortunately horn duke bernhard be men of extremely different temperament latter be vivacious enterprising daring even to rashness ready to undertake enterprise offered smallest hope of success marshal horn on other hand although good general be slow over cautious hesitating must never move until plan appeared to promise almost certainty of success besides horn swede be little jealous that duke bernhard german must be placed in position of general in chief feeling doubt tended to increase caution to delay action consequently be so long time before obeyed pressing message sent by duke ratisbon after valiant defence surrendered on th of july before have effected junction with duke army imperialist then marched upon donauworth place after feeble defence also capitulated duke heartbroken at seeing conquest have be effected at so great loss of life treasure wrested from hand while be unable to strike blow to save in despair marched away to swabia to meet slowly advancing army of marshal horn sooner be junction effected than turned quickly back reached vicinity of nordlingen only to find enemy already there before posted on more advanced of two height dominate plain by skillful manoeuvre however be enabled to throw within wall reinforcement to garrison of eight hundred men nordlingen important free town stand on south bank of ries mile to northeast of donauworth be surrounded by wall interspersed with numerous tower sufficiently strong to guard against surprise not to defend against regular siege by numerous army vast plain on town stand be broken near centre by two height rising at distance of three thousand yard from other height nearest to town be very steep craggy be known a weinberg other be called allersheim village stand three hundred yard in advance of valley between height be nearer to town than of two eminence scotch brigade formed part of duke bernhard command be now nearly two year since pitched battle have be fought for although there have be many skirmish assault in preceding year no great encounter have taken place between army since gustavus fell at lutzen in october scotch brigade have not be present at battle in time have elapsed many recruit have arrived from scotland munro regiment have be again raised to strength at have landed at rugen four year before not dozen of officer who have then full of life spirit marched in rank be now present death have indeed be busy among on evening of arrival in sight of imperialist army two grahemes supped with colonel munro have just arrived from duke quarter suppose will fight tomorrow munro major graheme said be not settled colonel replied between duke horn be not of one mind duke want to fight urge that be to allow nordlingen to fall a have allowed ratisbon donauworth without striking blow to save must be evidence of caution even cowardice must have worst possible effect through germany nordlingen have ever be staunch to cause protestant must everywhere fall away from did find that have so little care for safety a to stand by see fall into hand of imperialist without effort be better in duke opinion to fight to be beaten than to tamely yield nordlingen to imperialist in one case honour must be satisfied reformer throughout germany must feel that have done utmost to save co religionist on other hand there must be shame disgrace there be much in what duke say nigel graheme remarked there be much munro rejoined there be much also in argument of horn reason that be outnumbered enemy be superior to by at least third to save town must attack in immensely strong position will cost great number to capture chance against winning victory be fully five to one granted fall of nordlingen will injure in eye of prince people of germany with good management on part feeling thus aroused will be temporary for must soon wipe out reverse of men of imperial army be composed at least be spaniard who be on way to flanders who will very shortly leave on other hand rhinegrave otto ludwig be with men within few march of in short time therefore will actually outnumber enemy will be able to recover prestige just a recovered at leipzig after suffering magdeburg to fall will recapture town have taken if enemy must dare to accept battle will beat will be in position to march upon vienna horn argument be strongest nigel graheme said gravely course advises be most prudent one undoubtedly munro replied think that will not be followed duke be of fiery spirit must feel a most of must feel disgrace to fall back without striking blow for nordlingen have too be goaded nearly to madness during last few day by messenger letter have reached from reformed prince free town in part of germany reproaching bitterly for having suffered ratisbon donauworth to fall into hand of enemy without blow feel that honour be concerned have little doubt that will fight great battle to save nordlingen chapter xxv nordlingen while colonel munro companion be discussing matter council of war be being held duke bernhard view be adopted by general who felt with that honour be involved in question that must be disgraceful to march away without striking blow to save besieged city horn therefore being outvoted be forced to give way up to nightfall imperialist have showed sign of intention to occupy weinberg force being massed on around allersheim hill be determined therefore to seize weinberg at once execution of step be committed to horn choice be most unfortunate service be one upon prompt carrying out of victory depended horn though brave capable commander be slow cautious particularly unfitted for executing service have to be performed in dark night across country with be not familiar taking with four thousand chosen musketeer pikemen twelve gun set out at nine o'clock rough road dike ditch intercepted country impeded fact that be unacquainted with general position of country made doubly cautious be not until midnight that reached foot of hill here unfortunately came to conclusion that since have encountered such difficulty in crossing flat country must meet with even greater obstacle delay in ascending hill in dark therefore took fatal resolution of remaining where be until daylight accordingly ordered column to halt have continued march must have reached summit of weinberg unopposed fate of battle on following day must have be changed imperialist leader gallas cardinal infanta don fernando have not be unmindful of commanding position of hill upon horn be marching have given order that must be occupied before daylight by four hundred spaniard commander of force be a over prompt in execution of order a horn be over cautious reached top of weinberg before midnight at once set men to work to intrench strongly a soon a daybreak enabled horn to see fatal consequence have arisen from delay ordered men to advance with usual gallantry swede mounted hill rushed at intrenchment be defended with greatest obstinacy courage by spaniard after desperate fighting swede forced way into work at two point be upon point of capturing position when ammunition wagon accidentally exploded in midst killing great number throwing rest into temporary disorder enabled spaniard to drive out again occupy intrenchment before swede have fully recovered spanish cavalry at first sound of conflict cardinal have ordered to spot charged in flank forced to precipitate retreat down hillside bitterly regretting delay at midnight horn brought up fresh troop after addressing encouraging word to who have be already repulsed led united body to assault weinberg have be occupied in early morning by only four hundred men be now defended by whole of spanish infantry vain now be energy of horn ineffectual valour of troop time after time did swede climb hill strive to obtain footing on crest assault be repulsed with prodigious slaughter duke bernhard be now fully engaged with imperialist on allersheim be gradually gaining ground seeing however how fruitless be effort of horn to capture weinberg despatched a many of infantry a must spare to reinforce marshal among be munro regiment now brave lad colonel munro shouted a led regiment against hill show what scottish heart can do with cheer regiment advanced pressing forward unflinchingly under hail of bullet won way up hill then gathering hurled with shout upon heavy mass of spanish veteran for moment latter recoiled before onset then closed in around scotch who have already lost third of number in ascending hill never did famous regiment fight with greater courage fury be outnumbered ten to one opponent be soldier of european reputation in vain scotchman strove to break through serried line of pike surrounded here there knot of desperate men must win way through ere others must follow spanish line closed in again cut off from comrade died fighting to last fighting desperately in front rank munro officer encouraged men with shout example be in vain at last shouted to remains of follower to form in solid body cut way back through enemy who surrounded hemmed in a be by enemy scottish spearmen obeyed headed by colonel flung with sudden rush upon enemy before weight fury of charge veteran of spain gave way scot found on crest of hill have lately ascended sooner be free from spanish rank than musketeer of latter opened fire upon number fell in retreat when reached foot of fatal hill bleeding breathless gathered round commander munro burst into tear on finding that of noble regiment have led up hill scarce enough remained to form single company seven time now have horn striven to carry hill seven time have be repulsed with terrible slaughter now began to fall back to join force of duke bernhard latter recognizing that battle be lost that horn if not speedily succoured be doomed for imperialist flushed with victory be striving to cut off made desperate attack upon enemy hoping to draw whole force upon so enable horn to retire for moment succeeded be too weak in number to bear assault have thus provoked john of werth who commanded imperial cavalry charged down upon swedish horseman overthrew so completely that forced back upon infantry threw also into complete disorder instant horn have given order to retreat colonel munro seeing danger of force being surrounded formed up little remnant of regiment set off at double to rejoin force of duke be well that did so for just when have passed over intervening ground imperialist cavalry fresh from defeat of swede swept across ground completely cutting off horn division from of duke few minute later marshal horn surrounded on side by enemy feeling impossibility of further resistance with weakened diminished force be forced to surrender with command duke bernhard narrowly escaped same fate in end managed to rally nine thousand men retreated towards maine defeat be terrible one ten thousand men be killed wounded four thousand under horn taken prisoner gun equipage baggage fell into hand of enemy nordlingen be most decisive battle of war effect be to change war have hitherto be really only civil war war of religion into one with foreign enemy hitherto france have contented with subsidizing sweden who have played principal part henceforward sweden be to occupy secondary position cardinal richelieu saw danger of allowing austria to aggrandize at expense of germany now took field in upon other hand nordlingen dissolved confederacy of protestant german prince against ferdinand second elector of saxony who have ever be vacillating irresolute in policy be first to set example by making peace with emperor elector of brandenburg duke william of weimar prince of anhalt duke of brunswick luneburg duke of mecklenburg pomerania city of augsburg wurzburg coburg many others hastened to follow example of leading member of protestant union duke bernhard of weimar william of cassel be almost alone in supporting cause to maintain gustavus adolphus have invaded germany swedish army whose exploit have made court of vienna tremble seemed annihilated well might emperor deem that final triumph over protestantism be complete when heard of battle of nordlingen for a yet dreamed not that result must bring france into field against malcolm graheme be one of few officer of munro regiment who burst way through spanish line on top of weinberg be bleeding from several wound none of be serious nigel be beside a began to descend hill scarcely have gone step when fell headlong struck by ball from arquebus malcolm one of sergeant raised between carried to foot of hill then when remains of regiment started to rejoin duke bernhard be forced to leave although malcolm kept up with regiment in retreat be so utterly exhausted by loss of blood that must no longer accompany by death of so many of senior be now one of major of regiment if must be called regiment be scarce company in strength few day after battle colonel munro received order to march with shattered remnant scarce one of whom be from wound unfit for present service by easy stage to north germany there to await arrival of reinforcement from scotland might raise regiment to strength must enable again to take field malcolm remained behind until strength slowly returned colonel before leaving have bade take time before rejoining a month must probably elapse before regiment must again be fit for service a soon a be able to travel journeyed to nuremberg on arriving at abode of jan boerhoff learned that thekla be no longer inmate of family count of mansfeld have died in prison countess have arrived at nuremberg have taken up abode there malcolm made way to house occupied meeting be affecting one malcolm be greatly grieved over death of staunch friend joined in sorrow of countess daughter few day after arrival countess said to be of course aware malcolm of conversation count have with concerning thekla wish fully agreed with on subject in other time one must not speak of marriage when thekla father have be two month dead be time for conventionality now southern germany be falling away from protestant cause ere long may see imperialist at gate of nuremberg may be that in few month whole of germany will be in power therefore must that there must be delay thekla be nearly seventeen be twenty one over young to enter upon path of matrimony event of last few month have made woman of while have long since proved in thoughtfulness in valour to be man thekla be no longer great heiress since nordlingen may consider that father estate have gone for ever mine may follow in few month therefore must ask be ready to take without dowry be malcolm said earnestly that right gladly for love with heart need questioning on part countess said to know that love a truly that happiness depends wholly on saw anguish when news came of terrible defeat at nordlingen of annihilation of of scottish regiment heart be wrung by silent despair white rigid face until news came that be among few who have survived battle in outburst of joy thankfulness at news owned to that loved only fear being that cared for only a sister since word of love have ever passed lip reassured on score by telling of conversation with father that feeling of duty alone have kept silent while remained under protection however malcolm will not come to penniless for seeing that be possible that war must terminate adversely determined to quit country must be forbidden to worship according to own religion here count have from time to time despatched considerable sum to care of banker at hamburg there be now gold crown in hand there be moreover estate at silesia have for sometime foreseen must follow of husband fall into hand of emperor before death of count talked over whole matter with urged in case even must fall before becoming husband of thekla to leave unhappy country to take refuge abroad before death have interview with nearest kinsman who have taken side with imperialist to offered to resign thekla right a heiress to estate for sum of crown a be three year revenue of estate secured possession to whether imperialist swede be victorious in struggle consented after having obtained emperor consent to step

return home indeed be ready to do so have have more than enough of war fighting have be preserved well nigh by miracle when comrade have fallen around like grass can not hope that such fortune must
