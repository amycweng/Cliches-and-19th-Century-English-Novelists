london dorothy double chapter ix just before twelve o'clock on following day mr hawtrey carriage drew up at charles levine office in waiting room found danvers who have arrived shortly before 'thank for coming ' mr hawtrey said a shook hand with ' think be rather afraid of levine by of course know that be best adviser one can have in business of sort way have of lifting eyebrow make nervous feel a david copperfield did with man servant of steerforth thought very young indeed doe not make feel young rather that be considering to be old fool suppose mean exactly be impression get from eyebrow of be sure doe not mean that mr hawtrey danvers laughed 'though may be that action be expressive of passing doubt in mind rather of perceiving point be unfavourable to cause be retained to defend hope have come here to say that agree with view in matter 'you will hear presently danvers came to conclusion yesterday position be somewhat changed ' at moment door opened clerk asked to follow a mr levine be now disengaged 'this be client daughter dorothy ' mr hawtrey said a introduced to lawyer be mr singleton old friend neighbour of ours mr levine shook hand with dorothy looking at scrutinisingly a did so looked a frankly at beo thought be guilty mr levine ' ' be sure that father will do justice to say said nothing must in way be construed into such opinion miss hawtrey ' replied courteously 'perhaps not thought so same be learning to be thought reader saw that also think that slight feeling of doubt came into mind a shook hand ' must be careful see said smiling 'however without admitting denying anything may say that be glad that mr hawtrey brought with ' 'and now mr levine ' mr hawtrey said will tell what have come about yesterday have quite made up mind to take advice although daughter assented to only with greatest reluctance fresh complication have occurred will leave mr singleton to tell for ' mr levine took up pen prepared to take note a mr singleton began story with conversation with dorothy at mr dean at point when dorothy called father mr levine interposed for interrupting be very important must understand position exactly before go farther whatever matter may be of be about to tell do understand that be one entirely between miss hawtrey ' 'entirely 'it be one of never intended to have spoken of miss hawtrey felt perfectly confident that under circumstance must have revealed ' 'certainly have known from child nothing must have induced to have mentioned to one miss hawtrey have be certain absolute confidence must not do so 'it be then therefore wholly spontaneous action on part of miss hawtrey in summoning father to side asking to take home with ' 'entirely so be absolutely bewildered at what appeared to determination to make father acquainted with particular of painful scene of will now tell then related particular of interview in chamber 'at time concluded 'no doubt entered mind that person who called upon be miss hawtrey thinking over now having absolute confidence in see may have be mistaken be veiled when entered in year have known miss hawtrey have never seen wear veil veil certainly alters appearance of face for instant when entered did not recognise likeness must be very great for hesitation be only momentary afterwards have handkerchief up to face during greater part of interview during whole time spoke in low voice broken by sob doubt there must be similarity between voice heard in way be so different from usual outspoken tone must be sorry to be called upon to swear whether at other time must resemble voice not ' ' may add mr levine ' mr hawtrey said when have finished 'that have morning received bill from allerton where daughter usually get thing for four silk dress two mantle be ordered on same day at about same hour at jewel be stolen interview with mr singleton took place drove down there after breakfast found that good be taken out placed in cab be waiting at door daughter saying that wished to take at once to dressmaker also called in at gilliat found that there a well a at allerton woman be veiled when gave order mr levine have listened with close attention to mr singleton glancing keenly at time towards dorothy who be sitting with side face to absorbed in repetition of story when mr hawtrey ceased speaking be silent for minute then said 'in first place miss hawtrey have to make apology to be right see so much of bad side of human nature own until saw did not entertain shadow of doubt that driven by pressure have resorted to desperate expedient of raising money whole story appeared to be consistent only with guilt providing that be possessed of extraordinary amount of self possession audacity admit apologise for mistake now that hear same thing have be done in two other case that within hour two of first be to conclusive that father theory be correct one that be personated by clever woman who must bear extraordinary likeness to that young lady of age driven into corner must commit barefaced robbery be matter experience have taught to believe to be very possible that must few minute afterwards proceed to raise money from friend still more to commit petty crime of swindling tradesman of four silk dress rather material of value perhaps of thirty forty pound seems to incredible for once have be entirely at fault ' a to paying money for jewel mr levine ' mr hawtrey said still advise ' ' must think that over be extremely difficult matter on to give opinion will be glad in first place to have mr danvers opinion about perhaps will be good enough to come see after have talked over will not give final opinion until have turned over in mind for day two perhaps may ask to come see again danvers went out to carriage with ' congratulate most heartily miss hawtrey ' said 'there be doubt that will immensely strengthen position have have at rate great effect on mind of levine be not often have to own that first impression be entirely erroneous will come round evening if will be at home ' 'we will be at home danvers mr hawtrey said 'and particularly want to see about matter come to dinner half past seven can come too singleton ' went on a carriage drove off 'you be in thick of now be indeed one of party interested for of course will see that be not loser by intended kindness to dorothy ' 'if hear nonsense of sort ' mr singleton said hotly will get out of carriage at once have nothing more to do with affair dorothy be god daughter if choose to give one thousand ten have perfect right to do so so let hear more about ' mr hawtrey shook old friend warmly by hand always be obstinate fellow said 'and suppose must let have own way dorothy think will get out at top of st james street if ned hampton be not in leave card with line asking to join at dinner have worked most nobly for singleton a told last night ought certainly to be told of new development will make odd number for cousin mary daintree have be going to remark be glad to say suppose ought not yet recovered from shock given by dorothy breaking off engagement be keeping to bed however doe not matter about there being odd number 'of course can ask captain hampton if like father dorothy said coldly 'but at rate for part must rather that did not meddle more in affair 'hulloa hulloa mr singleton exclaimed 'what be in wind now dorothy thought ned hampton be sworn friend next to ned have always stood very high in regard nicer lad than be have not come across only wish be master of old place down there instead of brother who be by mean popular character in county although perhaps be wife fault rather than own what have be quarrelling with about must have thought that for young fellow after being six year from england to give up everything for month spend in service be in strong claim to regard ' have be quarrel between captain hampton ' dorothy said a coldly a before ' say that be not kind of to take pain did about affair acknowledged that have doubted after wish to trouble further in matter 'what nonsense dorothy ' father said warmly must have helped doubting under circumstance why without excuse even be inclined to doubt for moment levine doubted danvers though have not said a much doubt took same view even singleton here when gave a believed that money thought that have got into horrible scrape singleton must not disbelieve evidence of eye be not angry with for why must be so with hampton who also believed evidence of eye be that if may ask mr singleton said have heard nothing about be quite sure that ned hampton must not have doubted dorothy without what believed to be very strong evidence ' 'well singleton will tell though must not tell either levine danvers for be undoubtedly strongest piece of evidence against dorothy went up to islington late in afternoon of day when took place to see if must light upon scoundrel truscott saw truscott in close confabulation in quiet street with woman who came to chamber whom like of course took to be dorothy at time one else knew of jewel robbery naturally struck a of course must have struck one dorothy have got into scrape that have met that man to endeavour to persuade bribe to give up letter at rate to move so escape from search be making for ned went out of town at once came back just about time heard of jewel robbery by time have on thinking over concluded that first idea be altogether erroneous when at wit end told of jewel affair said at once be absolutely impossible that dorothy must have done thing that indeed seemed to confirmation of theory have formed that adventuress having singular likeness to dorothy be personating idea have never occurred to be delighted on finding possible explanation of what seemed to blank absolute mystery consider that dorothy be even more indebted to for suggestion than for pain took in trying to discover truscott ' certainly think be wrong dorothy mr singleton said gravely seeing that girl listened with cold indifference to father explanation 'he did more than did namely believe evidence of eye on evidence of be forced to believe that have got into scrape of sort be under thumb of rascal can not argue about mr singleton only know believed captain hampton must trust implicitly a must have trusted be great disappointment to to find be mistaken defend admit that may be silly wrong on part only say that be disappointed in captain hampton must much rather did not interfere in way in affair mr hawtrey shrugged shoulder mr singleton lifted eyebrow slightly then glanced with furtive smile be well that dorothy did not detect at father who looked somewhat surprised at unexpected demonstration rate dorothy ' latter said must ask to dinner there will be occasion for to interfere farther in matter so far a can see must think that after manner to will not be inclined to do so still be impossible after pain have taken in matter not to acquaint with what have occurred here be at top of st james street ' pulled check string ' suppose will get out here too singleton ' be lunch time will walk round with to ned hampton have better lunch with at traveller will take round there too if find in ' james will be five to dinner dorothy a soon a get back a carriage drove away mr singleton indulged in quiet laugh 'what be singleton must not make out glance gave in carriage own see nothing at laughable in to mind fancy of dorothy be at once utterly unreasonable confoundedly annoying be may say altogether unlike bey dear hawtrey must ask question have ever entered mind that must like ned hampton a son in law ' 'as son in law ' mr hawtrey repeated in astonishment 'what do mean singleton such idea ever occurred to how must there be boy girl friendship of certain kind between before went away at time dorothy be mere child of twelve year old of course idea about future marriage to one else have entered mind when came home other day be on verge of being engaged to halliburn be so engaged week later so again idea must not have occurred to be son of old friend be constantly in out of house a boy have very great regard liking for certainly must not regard a very eligible match for dorothy ' must think hawtrey have have enough of eligible marriage mr singleton said sarcastically 'and must think dorothy have too next time hope heart will have something to say in matter see why ned hampton must not be eligible be younger son 't be true have believe only about four hundred year in addition to pay dorothy have know twenty thousand pound from mother settlement land brings in about two hundred more will day have what can leave besides a have told must be something like fifteen thousand more so with money must come day to not very far short of two thousand year a told have put down in will for five thousand must have put down for more have thought wanted a seemed likely that must make good match did not think must be of use to leave more have put down for like sum certainly if two be to come together must considerably increase have child of own relation a far a know of be well to do people therefore be perfectly free to do what like with money estate being so think may dismiss from mind idea that dorothy be likely to come to poverty if marries ned hampton 'well old friend certainly alters case however a see there be probability of young people taking view of case ned hampton have always be like elder brother if like favourite cousin of dorothy since came home have never seen slightest change in manner towards a to have just heard what have said ' ' know nothing of idea on subject hawtrey a dorothy be be so far a know engaged to earl of halliburn ned might think must scarcely embark in flirtation with a to dorothy a say showed pretty clearly state of mind just now ' 'yes have evidently taken strong prejudice against singleton be pity too for like exceedingly know one to whom personally must more willingly entrust dorothy happiness ' ' know mr singleton remarked meditatively 'why father must be so much more blind about daughter than other people be suppose that if dorothy have be quite indifferent a to ned hampton opinion of must have be so exceedingly sore at having doubted say love even suppose that have remotest idea of such thing only say that evidently attache very great weight to good opinion be proportionately grieved at what considers want of confidence in behe make light of having broken off engagement to halliburn know must feel great deal more than pretend to do girl in position in society must break off such match without feeling sore about however convinced might be that be best thing to do in temper defection a considers of faithful ally must naturally be keenly felt of course there be nothing to do to let matter rest only please attempt to argue point with let have own way without comment be far more likely to come round in time if left alone than if constantly put upon defence bless here be at waterloo place have forgotten altogether business in hand be to call at ned hampton lodging well be about half way along jermyn street so that may a well turn up here now to continue conversation for minute two must say have best put out of mind for present leave matter to right there be more urgent thing to think of for be afraid hawtrey there be good deal of trouble ahead for for course may decide to take about gilliat matter who know love dorothy may be absolutely certain of innocence in matter must remember that unless can produce woman will be uphill work indeed to get world to see matter in same light if come to trial fact come out on other hand if compromise be morally certain thing will go on will be absolutely driven to fight one of claim claim pay will make harder to resist next so that way there be trouble be afraid great trouble ahead only way out of can see be to find man woman who may for aught know at present moment be on other side of atlantic there doe not seem to be shadow of clue can follow up wild goose chase be joke to ' ' agree with entirely singleton of course in affair like money be nothing will employ best detective can get levine will be able to tell of good men if find ned hampton in will tell whole story at once will save explanation evening ' 'you mean will tell while be at lunch hawtrey for be past two o'clock now at age one can not afford to neglect inner man in way ' met captain hampton way along street be just coming for ned ' mr hawtrey said beingleton want to come lunch with want to have talk with ' ' have only just finished lunch be perfectly ready for talk mr hawtrey ' 'where be going now ' ' think be principally going to smoke cigar have be in morning on day like one get restless after time 'then will take turn for twenty minute ned there be nothing more unpleasant than looking on at people eating unless be eating with people looking on besides must not begin talk now what do say hawtrey will join say at foot of duke of york step turn in to st james park sit down if can find bench free of nursemaid a daresay will a wo come out till later at rate want to be overheard can never make sure of in club smoking room ' will suit very well mr singleton hurry over lunch will see somewhere about when be coming down step have just time to stroll down mall back by birdcage walk ' will say in hour from time leave ' 'this be proof mr hawtrey that suspicion that truscott be at bottom of be well founded ' captain hampton said when have heard story must have be somebody who be accurately acquainted with affair one who knew that mr singleton be intimate friend so intimate that daughter must be likely to go to be in trouble that must be likely to assist 'it be certainly link in chain mr hawtrey agreed ' must give thousand pound if must lay hand on fellow mr singleton exclaimed fiercely 'but if must find singleton must not touch ned may be morally certain that be at bottom of have not remotest shadow of evidence on magistrate must grant warrant for arrest if found must snap finger in face ' forget mr hawtrey ' said ned 'if find be pretty sure of being able to find woman say be certain to find because know nothing of relation to other perhaps be only united to carry out piece of swindling truscott be shrewd enough to see that must be better for to part perhaps kept together until went over to hamburg sold diamond then might go over to paris to america may have gone to other two widely separated place in world if have kept together be still in england must say be most likely to be at present in quiet respectable lodging at large watering place where pas a father daughter quite agree with in what say that fact of two fresh robbery altogether alters case that can never calculate upon being free of annoyance still must say that be safe for little time ought to be satisfied with what have got will naturally wait to see whether there be stir made what come of before repeating same game have seen levine again 'yes be there hour half ago be glad to say last occurrence have completely changed opinion of case left going into matter with danvers who be coming to dine with evening will tell what think a to fighting gilliat ' doe halliburn think of ' captain hampton asked suddenly 'after everything will depend must think upon opinion 'on that point fortunately have not got to consult ned dorothy have definitely broken off engagement a soon a heard from gilliat of robbery declared that be positively impossible that matter must go on quite agreed with decision ' captain hampton made remark for minute two mr hawtrey presently went on ' want to come round to dinner too ned there will only be singleton danvers will be sort of family council mr hawtrey captain hampton replied after pause think must rather not come have be unfortunate enough to offend miss hawtrey deeply already think that presence at council must be in way agreeable to that being so need hardly say that must not be pleasant to ' 'tut tut lad be nonsense for moment be inclined to doubt fellow story seemed so terribly straight forward be completely taken aback singleton let be led to believe that have got into terrible scrape how must disbelieve eye more than must will soon get over little touchiness rather doubt mr think natural that must feel very much hurt just at present taking part in affair must feel sure be very distasteful to when say to dorothy have quite got over indignation want to come have chat with will be delighted to come in meantime must rather give opinion whatever a to matter will nevertheless work quietly in own way do best to discover clue a to movement of man have great advantage of knowing by sight detective must do be certain be not likely to make mistake a to woman please mention to dorothy that be taking further part in affair levine will must think advise to put matter into hand of detective will be glad to know from time to time what opinion be whether have gained clue a to whereabouts must suggest that must get from allerton two three small piece of of silk be taken must there be anything at peculiar in colour pattern might be aid to detective 'you be right there ned ' mr singleton said 'an adventuress of kind having got hold of handsome silk must not be able to forego pleasure of having made up showing off in do mean to pay allerton hawtrey ' gave cheque at once told that be one of several robbery have be committed by woman personating daughter that must be so unpleasant to go into matter so difficult to find thief must rather pay money at once in addition to pattern of dress will get to have sketch made of mantle will probably have others like if not be sure to know exact particular of there may be slight peculiarity about fashion of thing must help detective think must do even better than ' captain hampton said got dozen of daughter daguerreotype must assist detective much more than anything else in making inquiry must only have to show to waiter in hotel where woman stopped must hardly fail to be recognised at once for must certainly attract attention wherever went dorothy gave one few day after came back a must be very sorry to have knocked about must be glad if must let have 'that be excellent idea ned will order couple of dozen of photo afternoon from watson who took last have done well be sorry wo come dine with though know that be better for to leave to herself for short time admit that have not quite got over yet expect that will come round before long way be going ' ' think will sit where be for bit mr hawtrey be very pleasant here in shade want to think over that have be saying must try see what have best do next got up however hour later with impatient exclamation 'what be use of wasting time here be three week looking for fellow before slippen found few hour after taking matter in hand will take advice anyhow be more likely to have idea a to what fellow like must do under circumstance than must have ' have be doing nothing more about case captain hampton ' detective said when caller be shown in by boy who reminded strongly of jacob wrote to mr hawtrey that man have altogether disappeared must have racecourse watched that if turned up at of must let know be three week ago certainly have not shown up at racecourse men have ascertained beyond much doubt that none of usual pal have seen heard anything of from day left quarter at islington be glad have come a be going to write to mr hawtrey to ask if considered worth while keeping up search certainly seems to that if man like who have be constant attendant at race for last twenty year make living out of doe go near for three week must be because have gone away be very ill have taken to new life altogether 'that be just opinion have formed mr slippen wanted to ask opinion about have very strong idea that there be woman acting in concert with between have victimised friend of mr hawtrey out of considerable sum of money may take then for granted that have mean sufficient to live on for little time to take wherever may want to go fancy that must have left london man like must hardly keep away from racecourse altogether therefore agree with that nothing severe illness absence can be cause of staying away from racecourse from own intimate for three week 'that be just how reasoned captain hampton now that tell that have got hold of money have not least doubt that have sloped ' 'well from experience in such matter mr slippen where do think that man like must be likely to go 'there be saying at might go down to quiet place in country lor ' bless man like must never stand three week of be very likely that if be in fund have got clever woman with may have got up be staying at swell hotel at one of seaside place at harrogate buxton be carrying on little swindle there then again after job say have managed may think best to make scarce altogether may be at foreign watering place clever sharp can always make living at sort of place especially with woman to help suppose be young pretty ' captain hampton nodded 'bound to be ' detective went on 'well sharp fellow with girl like if be shrewd clever can just turn over money at place of kind be full of young fool most of whom have got money in pocket well then again may have gone across water somewhere more likely state than anywhere else be big place for hiding in when fellow have done bit of clever sharping here know that be wanted somehow always make for state just a naturally a duck take to water 'have agent who must be of use at place 'no will acknowledge frankly have not captain hampton must be use taking mr hawtrey money for job of sort be too big for if there be one place to must track must send out man there well enough must not work either continent state if have got proof of bad piece of swindling against man best plan will be to go to scotland yard get to put man at service foreign police must not move finger if be to write to must be willing enough to move if scotland yard have thing in hand ' hawtrey have put in charles levine hand in matter will have to act a suggests be taking matter up on own account have spent good deal of time over like to be beaten if must have undertaken must have be at within mean must have arranged with a be will come to again for advice assistance if require think have better send in account to mr hawtrey for work done so far with letter asking for instruction may like to have racecourse watched for bit longer if see mention talk with by way found that boy have on door step few day ago told have left a seemed sharp little fellow have taken on to run errand sort of thing ' 'he be not bad boy a sort of boy go be young scamp took into head to be cheeky have to kick out be glad to hear have not gone on street again will have to look pretty sharp after may find useful if a say be going to try to unearth fellow have be in search of ' chapter x will be only four at dinner dorothy ' mr hawtrey said when returned ' must not get hampton to come 'engaged suppose ' dorothy said indifferently 'no dear simply said that a have have misfortune to displease think be very word thought must be better to stay away must not say that did not agree with so matter dropped of course be sorry for have always liked lad naturally interest have shown in in trouble pain have taken about have quite renewed old feeling have turned to for advice talked matter over with almost a if have be son of course will miss good deal now can not be helped ' be sure want to stay away from house father ' dorothy said in aggrieved tone know whether want not dorothy naturally have be effect suppose that man who have be on so friendly footing with for last twenty year be going to put up with being called captain hampton addressed a if be stranger treated with sort of freezing politeness by girl whom almost from day when arrived in england have be giving up time to assist think be perfectly right to keep away from house think man of spirit must do same 'did say that resented father ' 'well did seemed to think that while be reasonable that father must have have doubt that old friend singleton must have readily accepted evidence of sens have believed that have got into sort of bad scrape that must feel hurt because did so singleton said that be preposterous however stuck to own opinion just a do to yours however there be end of matter be heartily sorry think one make so many real friend a have of late shown to be that one can afford to throw even one away especially just at time like well be of use talking about more danvers report of consultation between charles levine left matter pretty nearly a be before be greatly desirable for purpose of preventing further personation that jeweller claim must be contested upon other hand be equally certain that must be extremely unpleasant thing for mr miss hawtrey chance of obtaining verdict be very slight a have merely hypothesis to oppose to direct evidence of jeweller assistant be case that principal must decide for in case be willing to meet inevitable unpleasantness of trial must be incumbent on to use possible effort to obtain evidence in confirmation of hypothesis scotland yard must be communicated with detective set to work reward say of l might be offered in paper for information must lead to arrest of female who have be personating miss hawtrey in name obtaining good under false pretence description of woman appearance being given even if evidence be forthcoming from advertisement must serve a preparation for trial defence to claim must not come a surprise moreover appearance of advertisement must deter woman from attempting for time to repeat operation mr levine also recommended that letter must be sent to shop where dealt to warn that be possible that person very closely resembling miss hawtrey might attempt to obtain good that everything ordered must be sent to house not delivered personally must be desirable if possible that must be told that in future miss hawtrey when giving order must give visiting card that of mr hawtrey that person purporting to be being unable when asked to give card must be detained given in charge of police at least be line recommended must be adopted of course matter must be further considered gone into later on if mr hawtrey decided to contest claim considers one of most difficult case have ever be engaged in ' said danvers say frankly doe not think have remotest chance of getting verdict unless before trial come on can lay hand on woman suggests that together must see gilliat who of course have personal feeling in matter must naturally be most averse to taking anything like hostile action against inform of exact position of case desire that must not send in account to for three four month must give at least six month before trial must come on in time if ever ought to be able to lay hand on woman must still have option of paying if before case come on can obtain evidence lastly say unpleasant a be to contemplate possibility of such thing must not be forgotten that in event of trial coming on verdict being adverse one be quite upon card that if public opinion be strongly aroused on subject treasury may feel compelled to order prosecution of miss hawtrey for perjury if not for obtaining good under false pretence possibly for theft ' 'must be possible to trace jewel in way mr hawtrey asked after long pause possible if be pawned sold to jeweller in country be hardly likely to be case very few jeweller must purchase such good without making enquiry a to vendor same may be said of class of pawnbroker who must be in position to advance so large sum be much more probable that tiara be broken up hour after be stolen setting put in melting pot diamond taken over to hamburg a have not be advertised there must be little trouble in disposing of to diamond merchant there enquiry can be made in direction only must obtain from gilliat technical description of size number weight of gem 'do understand that opinion completely agrees with of charles levine danvers 'precisely be two course mr hawtrey be matter entirely for miss hawtrey to decide upon easiest most pleasant may say cheapest for cost will follow verdict must be to pay money other course must involve immense trouble annoyance payment of detective public scandal be afraid adverse verdict from public a well a from jury must say hawtrey ' mr singleton put in 'you have better take sort of middle course tell gilliat that thing be swindle that if can not obtain proof that be so within six month will pay in meantime move heaven earth to discover people if succeed well good if pay money seems to that anything must be better than going into court being beaten ' think that be very sound advice danvers said eagerly 'gain time fight if can fight with chance of success if not pay in way will save legal expense for can arrange with gilliat to take step until give decided answer six month hence will avoid terrible scandal trial must entail detective will of course cost money see how be to be helped think must be best plan ' mr hawtrey said hope agree with dorothy own that prospect of trial terrifies must do anything to avoid ' a like father seems to must rather fight than be robbed a everyone seems to think that must be certainly beaten be willing to agree to anything wish ' 'then will consider matter settled danvers mr hawtrey said in tone of relief 'and decision have taken tremendous load off mind will kindly see levine tell put entirely in hand a to employment of detective got sample after left singleton of silk hussy took be bound to say that be handsome do credit to taste be to have sketch of mantle to morrow will ask levine danvers whether advises must still put in advertisement spoke of write to tradesman can mention that will go abroad next week on return go down into lincolnshire so perhaps must be well not to stop people for of course if be to repeat trick when be in position to prove that be hundred of mile away at time must be pretty conclusive defence if fought gilliat claim ' 'it must be so conclusive defence sir that gilliat must never bring case into court moment saw that there really be impostor going about a miss hawtrey must see that have be victimised that only course be to apologise to miss hawtrey for having doubted word to withdraw claim yes there be doubt must be wisest plan to hing whatever in way of advertising warning tradespeople ' week later authority at scotland yard have notified french belgian german police that man woman whose description be accurately given likeness of latter sent must be probably passing off under assumed name must show be to be arrested a swindler small sample of four piece of silk drawing of mantle be also enclosed to aid in identification of female prisoner who must probably have clothes with similar letter be also sent off to police authority in large town watering place in united kingdom mr hawtrey called twice in jermyn street found that captain hampton be away wrote however full account of have be decided upon

come down to den smoke cigar ned there be several matter want to chat with about ' 'why want to get off in hurry went on when be seated in library saw halliburn on day after affair be broken off

woman must be content with rank wealth be sure must not ' 'no think be mistake altogether mr dean dorothy said thoughtfully ' did not become engaged to for mean for rank wealth say did not count for something honestly did think liked there be real reason for being broken off except found that have made mistake must not say so of course to anyone old friend like will never say anything about let people think what like know that will never repeat ' 'certainly not dorothy if say in word think everyone must see at least there be regret on part at match being broken off wonder wo last long week something fresh will be talked of by next year whole affair will have died away people have wonderfully short memory in society do know rather take credit to myself a prophetess for on evening of

before went into army sometimes boy change so when become men that be quite pleasure to meet one who have grown up exactly a might have expected must do saw good deal of believe ' 'yes at beginning of season did not see so much of afterwards think be so little changed a do ' mr dean gave quick keen glance at dorothy who be looking little dreamily at mountain at head of lake said carelessly 'well of course knew better than did be so often over at father be child then daresay that endowed a most young girl do boy older than with sort of impossible quality 'no know that be that ' dorothy said seems to to be changed good deal in many respect be almost like elder brother of mine then 'yes dear then see when came back found that have stepped into much closer place than even elder brother must hardly have assumed former relationship brother sisterhood be very nice when young lady be twelve boy eighteen nineteen be little difficult to maintain when boy be man of six twenty girl eighteen be

suppose that must be so seems to that have be expecting too much from for part think have changed very little ' did not expect anything of mr dean one way other have often thought of while be away because be very kind to in old day used to write to when first went out wrote to of course dropped when came home just at first seemed to that be exactly what expected though found in respect that be changed however know why be talking about captain hampton have gone to america believe be likely enough may not see again before go back to india ' then changed tone 'it be rather sore subject to mr dean be last of illusion of childhood gone quite agree with that be very foolish of to think that must drop quite into old relation especially a thing stood at least expected something be disappointed have be very kind have taken immense deal of trouble to assist father to get to bottom of of thing have be troubling have not least ground for complaint on contrary have reason to be grateful to a say have same be disappointed in of illusion must rather not talk about what change be to be on quiet lake among great silent hill after six month in london there one always seemed to be in bustle fever here one feel a if nothing happened must matter ' 'the london season be pleasant enough mr dean said 'and though be very charming delightful for change very restful fancy before long must get tired of

whether brings in twenty specimen from radius of hundred yard from house same number collected during fifty mile ramble personally must not at mind making head quarter for six week so on lake providing one did not go up too high one want to be within quarter of hour walk of village where one can hire boat to land where one like make excursion among hill must not want to do snow climbing there be plenty of problem one must be glad to go into if one must investigate without that be really treat to after lincolnshire to get into country where can go into geological problem without having to begin by digging ' ' may frankly say that know nothing about ' mr hawtrey replied 'the only problem connected with digging have be interested in be how to get heaviest crop possible out of ground well here be at head of lake will be two hour before steamer go back propose lunch in first place then will have time for walk to althorp where can examine market place where william tell shot at apple be to say if a now seems doubtful william tell ever have existence at wo have doubted mr hawtrey mr dean exclaimed 'it must be destruction of of one cherished hero of childhood glanced with

must have good thing of life have replied 'there be good thing for captain armstrong if do look for not like child set mind on what ca get ' think must rather see marry than most people miss hawtrey perhaps because be altogether unlike ' have made answer at time have thought afterwards of what have said yes two men be very unlike there be doubt something in what captain armstrong have said thought that if loved man must bear better to see marry woman altogether unlike in respect than one who resembled closely though perhaps must hardly explain to herself why must be so be merry party on board steamer going down lake new comer took room at same hotel a hawtreys what do mean to do armstrong fitzwarren asked a strolled out to smoke cigar by lake after rest of party have gone to bed 'you know what mean told other day about affair with miss hawtrey ' must not have said anything about ' other returned have have idea that engagement with halliburn must come to nothing have be talking over business of hers expressed opinion pretty strongly a to halliburn behaviour to in public said that wondered stood then getting heated be as enough to say have be in position must have behaved in different sort of way generally expressed contempt for then asked why have put in position told be fault of mine for have tried failed when made uncomplimentary remark a to taste nearly have row ask what be going to do of course if have not heard that news when got to milan must have gone afternoon directly arrived here to take place in first diligence started matter where now will stay try luck again be quite evident by manner that never really cared for fellow that breaking off of engagement be great relief to never saw in higher spirit be sure there be nothing forced about be sure must not have accepted unless thought liked be not sort of girl to marry for position alone though dare say if have not be for other business must have married must have believed life that be very fine fellow well see came very badly out of showed to in true light a selfish cold hearted miserable little prig see directly eye be opened threw over so seems to that there be chance ' 'one must not have met again under more favourable circumstance one get ten time opportunity travelling about together that one doe in london season however think chance be worth very little said honestly that liked very much before must see really pained to refuse think be halliburn who stood in way although be attentive at time ' must have thought must have be in favour if acknowledged that liked very much be cut up at refusing why must not like better when see more of ' 'because fitzwarren be not right sort of liking be if may so express chum be afraid will never get beyond on side see woman want something ideal

mixed up with party have always be dead against that want to see thing want to see want to stay in town to potter about picture gallery church while want to go right away up hill 'that be not worst of

getting out of there be engaged to perhaps last girl that must have calmly patiently thought matter out have gone in for captain armstrong laughed be very well for to laugh in first place have be what be called general flirt for year must not be suspected of serious intention unless went very far indeed in second place must afford to marry girl without penny if have inclination to do so be different thing altogether with fellow like who have choice between remaining single marrying wife with money there be luxury absolutely can not afford among may reckon travelling about in party in be

pleasantly contentedly down vale of life ' captain armstrong burst into loud laugh will never do fitzwarren never there be vein of romance in composition will be too much for be always young men who fancy be prudent who end by falling victim to nice girl without penny may take precaution like walk a circumspectly a will when time come will succumb without struggle however let lead into net of fowler keep away from snare a long a can when fate come upon will be captured doubt whether will make a much a struggle will see armstrong at present serve a terrible example well suppose may a well turn in ' there be great consultation after breakfast next morning mr hawtrey have already marked out own line of travel have arranged for carriage by must travel by easy stage through brienz

looking girl a ever saw ' captain hampton uttered exclamation of satisfaction here then be first absolute proof that theory be correct that there really existed double of dorothy evidence of clerk

while be here did not seem to have much interest in city think have be pretty lucky captain hampton ' detective said when went out 'wonderfully lucky be more thankful than can express evidence of man alone must go long way towards clearing friend for must at rate prove just after robbery be committed at exact time at thief must reach here from england woman precisely like arrived here with man answering to description of one believed to be accomplice ' must be great thing certainly at rate if be captain hampton must get affidavit made by muller one two of waiter to effect that man of whom

other place where there be many german will certainly do so send across to england at once arranging with detective to call for at metropolitan at seven o'clock that evening captain hampton returned to hotel have be splendid morning work even if further search be unsuccessful enough have be done to establish at least strong case in favour of contention that person who called upon jeweller mr

really nothing to go upon know what man intention be if intended to go in for swindling must think must have done better on continent than here there be not many very large town where must a stranger expect to make much money must be easier to trace here than in europe where distance be so much shorter that one can get out of country in few hour if intends a must think most likely only to stop over here for short time so a to be out of way then go back begin same thing over again might take lodging here anywhere else 'he may know one who have come over here have gone in for farming may be

what be considered fair play be preserved one think of interfering man who be killed be buried one who killed go way unconcernedly so though good many of story hear be lie there may be more truth in of than must think 'they have be pumping lot of have ' jacob said 'and trying to find out what be doing out here have stuffed up nicely have told a have be out in india have killed thousand upon thousand of lion tiger elephant be use of telling lie jacob ' captain hampton asked angrily 'well sir suppose a believe because believe story be thought just a well a must think be great fighter must

a opinion be always in accord with hers be little more than form among intimate frequently bewailed husband disinclination to take leading part in anything 'it be great disadvantage to girl for compels to put much more forward than like be always bad for mother to have to do so get name of being managing woman there be nothing men be more shy of yet in spite of mr fortescue disclaimer there be people who believed that if mr fortescue have have chance there must have be occasion for wife to take matter so entirely in hand a did within hour of meeting captain armstrong mr fitzwarren have discussed matter with husband ' know what to think of men coming here just a have arrived must mean one thing other mr fortescue remarked that doubt did 'captain armstrong be of course excellent match

satisfactory that assured that mr fitzwarren have design upon of daughter always made one of party on excursion divided attention equally between three girl there be nothing in manner must excite smallest suspicion even in mind that viewed one with greater degree of preference than other captain armstrong appeared equally general in attention even dorothy who have felt at first certain uneasiness when joined thought more of matter happened to be there when be be natural that must attach to party soon ceased to feel at shy with to think of in other light than a pleasant companion in ramble for first week mr fortescue always formed one of party a walk extended went higher higher up hill side be glad a soon a felt that suspicion of mr fitzwarren attention be unfounded to let go under father escort mr singleton be only person who complained wonder how long two men be going to stay here ' said to mr hawtrey one day ' have not heard say anything about will be sorry when go for be pleasant make very much more agreeable for girl to have to go about with of course when take carriage ride together be sure young people enjoy walking much more be capital climber can tell pretty nearly tire out sometimes ' care how soon go hawtrey know what hope be about dorothy feel pretty confident that armstrong have altogether different view on matter have nothing to say against

walk that be more with than with others imagine that be only fancy on part ' suppose must be wasting time in rambling about here with three girl unless have sort of object be one of three have not least doubt that be dorothy ' fancy so for quite between ourselves singleton can tell that refused month since ' 'umph mr singleton grunted 'that must have be just before became engaged to halliburn

can ' other said irritably 'if be to go away must come after if mean to ask question will ask worst of be that be such good fellow so unobjectionable in way be hard that while other be spending time in looking out for evidence will completely clear dorothy from abominable charge man must be cutting in making running here ' ' think dorothy suspect anything of sort singleton suppose doe girl ca be thrown with pleasant man day after day like without getting to like be sure doe not know be too frank natural with still when time come asks question again will come upon how much doe like contrast

be attraction kept with party have said word when mother have frequently expressed surprise at prolonged stay at martigny have cautiously endeavoured to learn opinion on subject ada silence be due partly to feeling of loyalty towards dorothy partly because shrewdly conjectured that own stay there be not unconnected with idea in mother mind that something might come of that did mr fortescue
