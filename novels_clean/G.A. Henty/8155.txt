trouble then will fall upon second do spring on young bastow two highwayman be sure to have pistol may have also give clip with cudgel of yours first then spring on hold arm tightly by side if call

top of stable ladder appeared above sill of window minute later young bastow head appeared threw up sash still higher stepped into room then turned helped two men in one after other follow said then wo tumble over furniture a turned heavy handle of john thorndyke whip fell with tremendous force on head of last man what devil be that other exclaimed snatching out pistol turning round a falling

be glad that be back squire said be afraid that young rascal must try to escape took good care of squire see put one of arm round bedpost before slipped darbys on can not get away unless take whole bed with a think must get out either by window door be a safe here a must be in newgate what be next thing to do squire have better tie fellow leg will leave candle here can keep guard over while go wake mr bastow rector needed waking be walking up down room in great distress have not undressed have thrown upon bed what have happened thorndyke asked a squire entered heard two heavy fall felt that something terrible have taken place well have be serious matter very serious that unfortunate son of yours be not hurt know that best thing must have happened must have be for to have got bullet through head brought home with two men who be have little doubt highwayman anyhow have brace of pistol in belt from what said think have be stopping coach at rate have something with that be going to hide here fancy be not first time that have be done expect son have anything to do with robbery though be carrying brace of pistol too however have got three now see bastow take affair altogether out of hand have hoped that when caught son in act of breaking into house after have ordered from must be able to frighten into enlisting at rate into promising to disturb more for even if have taken before bench nothing must have be done to for under such circumstance re entering house must not be looked upon a act of burglary a be affair be altogether changed even if wished to do so a magistrate must not release two highwayman must appear a prisoner in court will hear down in town tomorrow morning what coach have be stopped have doubt that have on proceeds of robbery son be consorting with aiding acting a receiver of stolen good a have heard horse here before be probable that when room be thoroughly searched will come upon number of article of same sort be sorry ever meddled in matter be too late for now have better come downstairs with will take turn in garden try to see what have best be done chapter iii john thorndyke opened shutter of parlor window stepped out into garden alone for rector be too unnerved shattered to go out with threw on sofa completely prostrated hour later squire re entered room morning be just beginning to break mr bastow raised head looked sadly at can see way out of old friend be not that be in charge of constable must have said that only course be to aid son to escape knapp be shrewd fellow a well a honest one can not possibly get son away without assistance for be handcuffed to bed knapp in so serious matter a must not be sure lend to escape have doubt that with influence with other magistrate indeed on circumstance of case will commit on minor charge only a passenger of coach will hope give evidence that be stopped by mounted men alone think therefore that must only be charged with consorting with aiding highwayman after event of aiding to conceal stolen good be if be found in room that much stolen property have be hidden there there be little reason to doubt may have be removed shortly afterwards be of course very convenient for to have place where must take thing at once then ride on quietly to london next day for if arrested nothing must be found upon must be impossible to connect with robbery later on might come back again get from of course if nothing be found in room get rid of charge of receiving altogether there must be nothing harboring aiding abetting much le serious business look here old friend will strain point will go out into garden again walk about for hour while be out if must take advantage of absence to creep up to son room to search thoroughly examining board of floor to see if be loose must find anything concealed to take hide of course can not help thing if there be might secretly be packed up by in box sent up to bow street with line inside saying that be proceeds of robbery that hope owner will be traced property restored to not of course in own hand without signature there might be little trouble in managing must doubt be done john thorndyke went out into garden without word hour be nearly up when mr bastow came out looked ten year older than have done on previous day wrung friend hand thank god have be up there said think will find anything say nothing about bastow want to know whether found anything now be going to fetch two three of men from village to get to aid constable in keeping guard to go up to house at once order groom to saddle one of horse bring here a be now past five o'clock squire found most of men getting up sent one off to house with message returned with two others to rectory told briefly that two highwayman have be arrested during night that a young mr bastow be in company at time have be necessary a matter of form to arrest also went upstairs with have brought up two men to sit with knapp until reigate constable come up can take handcuff off mr bastow see that doe not leave room do sit in chair against door place one of men at window how about others man hit first squire did not move until quarter of hour ago have be muttering to since think be sensible other one have be quiet enough there be doubt that arm be broken be going to ride down to reigate at once will bring back surgeon with will repent night business thorndyke arthur bastow said threateningly fancy that will repent more than will bastow be likely that will have plenty of time to do so be not long before groom with horse arrived john thorndyke rode at gallop down to reigate first called on head constable dawney said a man came down partially dressed at summons have anything taken place during night yes squire up coach be stopped mile before got here passenger robbed be due here at one did not come in till hour later of course be sent for guard be shot there be two of fellow let fly with blunderbuss doe not seem to have hit of one rode up shot dead then robbed passenger got six gold watch ring adding up amount taken from passenger about hundred fifty pound in money well fancy have got two highwayman safe dawney have sir constable said in astonishment yes happened to be at rectory mr bastow have have quarrel with son have forbidden house constable shook head be afraid be very bad one young chap be afraid be dawney however father be afraid that might come in during night make scene so said must stop with took village constable with at two o'clock morning young fellow came with two mounted men who have doubt be highwayman have locked up down below bastow took ladder three got in at bedroom window on first floor knapp be waiting for there taking by surprise succeeded in capturing before highwayman must use pistol constable two men be looking after a one have not got over knock gave on head other have broken arm there be little fear of making escape have better go up with two of men take light cart with with straw in bottom bring down here will ride round to mr chetwynde sir charles harris mr merchison will sit at twelve o'clock can send round constable with usual letter to others three will be quite enough for preliminary examination well squire be good news indeed have have coach held up so often within five mile of place during past three month that have be getting quite bad name to think that young bastow be in have heard queer story about fancied before long must have to put hand upon shoulder did expect there be not shadow of proof that have anything to do with robbery dawney will have difficulty in proving that did not afterwards abet be serious enough a be be terribly grieved for father sake yes sir have always heard spoken of a kind gentleman one who took lot of trouble whenever anyone be sick well sir will be off in twenty minute will run round at once send dr hewett up to rectory man will start on horseback at seven o'clock with summons to other magistrate john thorndyke rode round to three fellow magistrate who living nearest to town be most regular in attendance at meeting listened in surprise to narrative expressed great pleasure at hearing that men who have be pest to neighborhood have caused personally great deal of trouble have be captured have heard tale too to arthur bastow disadvantage expressed great commiseration for father agreed to meet at court hour before business began to talk matter over together be out of question that can release on bail gentleman who be chairman of bench said quite so john thorndyke agreed in first place matter be too serious in next certainly must not be able to find bail lastly for father sake be unadvisable that must be let out at same time appears to that there be broad distinction between case others fear that there can be question that have prior acquaintance with men that be cognizant of whole business something heard say to regret will have to repeat in court almost prof that be so still let hope none of stolen property will be found upon whether have intended to pas over to care not be immaterial if have not done so doubt whether must be charged with receiving stolen good might make charge simply one of aiding two criminal of being so far accessory after crime if must soften down still further must for father sake be glad a far a be concerned must hing to lighten punishment be about a bad specimen of human nature a ever came across father be in bodily fear of saw young fellow yesterday urged to enlist in order to break loose from bad companionship have fallen into reply be insolent defiant in highest degree be then that in father name forbade house a father be present confirmed what said told that must not have anything more to do with affair may do good save neck from noose few year at hulk passage to botany bay will do harm at rate father will have rest peace never must have if remained here somewhat similar conversation took place at house john thorndyke breakfasted at sir charles harris ' last of three upon whom called then mounting rode back to reigate have found plunder on head constable said coming out of lockup a drew rein before fortunately for young bastow nothing be found upon how be two men fellow hit first be conscious now sir very weak doctor say that if have have thick hat on blow must have killed to certainty other man arm be set bandaged be all right otherwise will be able to have in court at twelve o'clock squire rode up to house be met at door by son in state of great excitement be true father news have come from village that have killed two men that arthur bastow have be taken away in cart guarded by constable a usual mark rumor have exaggerated matter there be dead men one certainly got crack on head rendered insensible for time arm be broken be highwayman father say that two horse be fastened behind cart be what be going to try mark until guilt be proved one know whether be highwayman not why be arthur bastow taken father simply because be in company with others now need not ask more question if like to get pony saddled ride down with to reigate at eleven o'clock will get into courthouse then will hear about at greater length squire went into matter with mr cunningham lady housekeeper ward governess be bad business mr thorndyke said must be terrible for poor mr bastow yes be bad business altogether except that will rid of young rascal if be in place must be ready to suffer good deal to obtain such riddance suppose that wo sit upon bench today at least will take part in deliberation will of course give evidence affair be not likely to last very long story will take longest to tell knapp will be confirmatory of mine reigate constable will depose to finding watch ring money upon then of course case will be adjourned for attendance of coachman of passenger suppose will be able to swear to identity for doubt be masked be immaterial discovery of stolen property upon will be sufficient to hang doubt will have bow street runner down from town tomorrow next day will most likely be able to say who fellow be will mr bastow have to give evidence against son not before think imagine will have to appear at trial will be terrible for yes terrible sincerely hope that will not summon be afraid that there be very little doubt about be sure to want to know about son general conduct though possibly testimony on point of constable at reigate will be sufficient own hope be that will get long sentence at rate one long enough to insure not coming back during father lifetime if have seen manner when be talking to yesterday must believe that be capable of anything have have good many bad character before during year half have sat upon bench be bound to say that never saw one who be to eye so thoroughly evil a young fellow think added with smile must feel quite comfortable if be acquitted will be long time before will forget expression of face when said to morning 'you will repent night work thorndyke ' mean that think must do harm mr thorndyke well must not care to meet in lonely place if be armed be not need not be nervous mr cunningham there be not smallest chance of being out for year by time blood will have have time to cool down will have learnt at rate that crime can not be committed in country with impunity be very shocking lady said what will poor mr bastow do must think that must not like to remain a clergyman here where everyone know about must be for to decide squire said if wish to resign certainly will not press to continue to hold living be very old friend of mine father presented living to when be nine ten year old may say saw daily up to time when went down into sussex if resigns must urge to take up residence here to act a mark tutor might also relieve of of millicent lesson have plenty to do in looking after management of thing in general however be for future at eleven o'clock squire drove down to reigate taking mark with a must save trouble about putting up horse pony on arriving handed mark over to head constable asked to pas into seat in courthouse before public be let in reigate be in state of unusual excitement that coach must have be stopped robbed be too common event to excite much interest that two highwayman must have be captured a be rumored young gentleman brought in on charge of being in connection with caused thrill of excitement quite small crowd be assembled before courthouse name of squire thorndyke passed from mouth to mouth there be talk of being mixed up with in way other one said saw ride in here about half past five wondered be about so early do say a caught two highwayman single handed that stand to reason besides what must have be doing out at such hour a that be good landlord say that crowswood have be quite different place since came to be master be tight hand a magistrate cleared out village first two three month be there spent mint of money on place people there say that must not have better master ah here be squire chetwynd be sure to be here there be sir charles gig turning corner expect most of will be on bench get case a day may be there will be nothing for to hear when court open said hear fellow have be shot knocked about so bad that can not be brought up of course court can not sit if aint before be not so master jones spoke to one of constable hour ago life next door to said that must be well enough to appear of have be shot though have be hurt pretty bad added to desire of around to get into court there be quite rush when door be opened two minute before twelve be at once crammed constable having difficulty in getting door shut in persuading who must not get in there be not standing room for person there be buzz of talk in court until door opened six magistrate came in be observed that john thorndyke did not seat with others moved chair little apart from thus confirming report that be in way connected with matter did not intend to take part in decision then door opened three prisoner be brought in two first be pale evidently weak one have head wrapped in bandage other have right sleeve of coat cut off arm bandaged supported by sling made resolute effort to preserve careless demeanor third who be year younger than others looked round with smile on lip bowed to magistrate with air of insolent bravado when be placed in dock then leaned easily in corner a if indifferent to whole business chair be placed between comrade for use of man whose head be bandaged many among present knew arthur bastow by sight name passed from mouth to mouth usher called loudly for silence then magistrate clerk rose william smith john brown at least be name given be charged with stopping south coast coach last night killing guard robbing passenger arthur bastow be charged with aiding abetting other two prisoner with guilty knowledge of crime be noticed by who must see prisoner face that in spite of bastow air of indifference there be expression of anxiety on face a charge be read undoubtedly felt relief a against be mentioned first witness be john knapp constable stepped into witness box what do know of business knapp chairman asked just tell own way be constable of crowswood honor yesterday squire thorndyke said to must not tell like knapp must not repeat what person said to can say that from information received did so so yes honor from information received went to rev mr bastow house at quarter to nine last night at nine o'clock squire thorndyke parson came in together sent servant up to bed then squire sent round to examine fastening of door found that one back door have be left unfastened locked bolted squire told to lie down until one o'clock must watch mr bastow went up to bed do know of own knowledge why precaution be taken only from what be told honor at one o'clock squire woke lay down in parlor telling to call if heard movement outside about two o'clock heard two horse come into parson yard called squire thorndyke who went upstairs to open window presently someone came tried back door heard voice outside must not hear what be said squire came down called upstairs went up took place at one side of window squire took on other have cudgel in hand squire riding whip ladder be put up against window then someone came up lifted sash up high got in there be light enough for to see be young mr bastow then two other prisoner came up when third have got into room mr bastow said 'follow then wo tumble over furniture how be that did not see mr thorndyke chairman asked be standing well back honor moon be on other side of house there be light enough for to see a got in at window where be standing be quite dark especially to chap who have just come in from moonlight a moved squire hit last of clout on head with hunting crop down went a if shot man next to turned did not see what took place for a squire have ordered made rush at mr bastow got arm round pretty tight so a to prevent using pistol if have struggled hard without saying word till got heel behind threw on back came down on top of then got pistol out of belt threw on bed slipped handcuff onto one wrist lifted up bit then shoved up against bedpost got handcuff onto other wrist so that must not shift away having post in between arm then went to see if squire wanted help did first handcuffed man whose head have broken tied leg of other then kept guard over till morning when constable came up from town searched prisoner on two of found watch money ring found nothing on mr bastow went with head constable to mr bastow room searched thoroughly found nothing there evidence created great sensation in court john thorndyke have first intended to ask not to make mention of fact that arthur bastow be carrying pistol unless question be directly put to more have thought over matter more convinced be that heavier sentence better must be for rector when have heard from latter that there be nothing left in son room must be brought against that must not be charged with capital crime of being receiver thought best to let matter take course head constable be next witness deposed to finding of article produced upon two elder prisoner unsuccessful search of younger prisoner room did not search house further chairman inquired sir wanted to get prisoner down here a fast a must seeing that two of be seriously hurt chairman nodded will of course make careful search of whole house constable yes sir left one of men up there with instruction to allow one to go upstairs until returned quite right john thorndyke be next witness evidence cleared up what have hitherto be mystery to general body of public a to how constable happened to be in house on watch when highwayman arrived most important part of evidence be repetition of word young bastow have used a mounted ladder a showed that be arranged between prisoner that stolen good must be hidden in house squire be only asked one two question suppose mr thorndyke that have idea that younger prisoner must be accompanied by anyone else when returned home not slightest squire replied be there simply to prevent unfortunate lad from entering house when perhaps might have used violence towards father intention be to seize if did so to give choice of enlisting a have urged to do of being brought before bench for breaking into father house felt that anything be better than continuing in evil course on seemed bent thank mr thorndyke must compliment in name of brother magistrate may say of public for manner in at considerable risk to have effected capture of two elder prisoner after consulting with others head constable be recalled do know anything about character of youngest prisoner yes sir have have eye upon for time be brought before honor week ago charged with being drunk disorderly in town be fined pound be constantly drinking with of worst character in place be strongly suspected of having be concerned in fray between poacher sir charles harris gamekeeper two of latter said that recognized amongst poacher a declined to swear to did not arrest john knapp be then recalled testified to bastow drinking habit that landlord of alehouse at crowswood have be ordered by squire not to draw liquor for in future on pain of having renewal of license refused have more witness to call chairman asked head constable not at present honor have sent up to town on next occasion coachman will be called to testify to shooting of guard hope to have of passenger there to identify article stolen from will be necessary that rev mr bastow must be here need not be called to give evidence unless think to be of importance have better be in attendance prisoner be remanded until day week hour later three prisoner handcuffed be driven under escort of three armed constable to croydon jail when again brought up in court passenger on coach identified article taken from coachman gave evidence of stopping of coach of shooting of guard head constable testified that have searched rectory from top to bottom found nothing whatever of suspicious nature none of passenger be able to testify to two elder prisoner a men who have robbed a have be masked height dress corresponded to of prisoner two bow street runner then came forward gave evidence that two elder prisoner be well known to have long be suspected of being highwayman have several time be arrested when riding towards london on occasion when coach have be stopped night before stolen good have ever be found upon in case have passenger be able to swear to identity one be known among associate a galloping bill other a downy one at conclusion of evidence three prisoner be formally committed for trial magistrate having retired in consultation for time upon question of whether charge of receiving stolen good ought to be made against arthur bastow think gentleman chairman said after good deal have be urged on side of question in case can afford to take merciful view in first place stolen good be discovered upon in house there be strong presumptive evidence of intention intention be not crime even be evidence stronger than be must be inclined to take merciful view there can be doubt that young fellow be thoroughly bad bravado have exhibited throughout hearing be at once unbecoming disgraceful must remember that be not yet eighteen that in second place be son of much respected clergyman who be neighbor matter be serious enough for a stand be certain to have very heavy sentence mr thorndyke who take part in deliberation be most anxious that prisoner father must be spared agony of son being placed on trial on capital charge though think that there must be smallest chance of being executed for judge must be certain to take youth into consideration have there be prima facie evidence of concealment must have done duty sent to trial on charge a there be such evidence think that will be in respect better to send on charge on evidence be a clear a noonday moreover think that mr thorndyke wish must have weight with seeing that be entirely due to that important capture of highwayman who have long be scourge to neighborhood have be effected mr bastow have not be called a witness john thorndyke have brought down to reigate in closed carriage have waited in justice room while examination went on magistrate agreed that evidence given be amply sufficient for to commit upon without given pain of appearing john thorndyke have taken to room while magistrate be consulting together when heard result drove back again have fully made up mind to resign living thorndyke must not stand up preach to villager of duty when have failed so signally in training own son visit house presume to lecture on shortcoming when son be convicted criminal quite see that old friend squire said have doubt that must decide on course will try not to persuade to change decision for feel that power of usefulness be at end a far a village be concerned may ask what propose to do can hardly suppose that saving have be large two year ago have hundred laid by have dwindled away to nothing can understand how for time be given freely then reluctantly then declared must give more took same knew well enough must never prosecute for forgery a bad a eh thorndyke said sternly well wo talk further of now what propose be that must take up abode at hall be not satisfied with school where mark have be for last two year have be hesitating whether to get private tutor for to send to one of public school know that must be best must not bring to do so have trouble of own two three people know of now that everything be going on smoothly on estate in village often feel dull boy companionship doe much good a know many lad of own age in neighborhood now think that must do just a well at home will be taking to shooting hunting before long if be to have tutor there be one must like to have better than know people must talk comfortably together of evening when house be quiet altogether will be excellent arrangement for must have own room if have company need not join unless like house must not seem like without for have be associated with a long a can remember a to going out into world at age of sixty must be little short of madness there need not give answer now went on seeing that rector be too broken down to speak be sure that when think over will come to same conclusion a do that will be best plan possible for chapter iv trial of two highwayman arthur bastow came off in due course evidence given be similar to offered at reigate only addition being that mr bastow be put into box counsel for prosecution said be sorry to have to call mr bastow feel most deeply for will ask only two three question be son frequently out at night be did often hear return yes seldom went to sleep until came back have reason to suppose that others returned with never saw others might have heard without seeing please tell if ever heard voice yes have heard men voice clergyman said reluctantly in low voice one more question have done have on occasion heard sound of horse hoof in yard at about time that son came in mr bastow said in low voice have have suspicion of character of son visitor none supposed that with be companion with whom have be spending evening mr bastow have to be assisted from witness box so overcome be with ordeal have not glanced at son while giving evidence latter two fellow prisoner maintained throughout trial expression of indifference two highwayman nodded to acquaintance saw in body of court smiled at various point in evidence so conducted that there be murmured exclamation of approval of gameness on part of lower class of public jury without moment hesitation found guilty of offense with be charged bastow be first sentenced young man judge said young a be there can be doubt whatever in mind of anyone who have heard evidence that have be associate with men who have be found guilty of highway robbery accompanied by murder consider that merciful view be taken of case by magistrate who committed for trial for evidence of heartbroken father on whose gray hair conduct have brought trouble disgrace leaf doubt that have for time be in league with highwayman although not actually participating in crime word overheard by mr thorndyke show that be prepared to hide booty for be well for that be captured before be done that proceeds of other robbery be found in house evidence of bow street officer show that have for time be suspected that men have accomplice somewhere in neighborhood of reigate for although arrested several time under circumstance forming strong assumption of guilt nothing be ever found upon there can now be little doubt who accomplice be have be older man must have sentenced to transportation for life in consideration of youth will take milder course of sentencing to fifteen year transportation capital sentence be then passed in much fewer word upon two highwayman a be leaving dock bastow turned in clear voice said to john thorndyke who have be accommodated with seat in well of court have to thank thorndyke for will pay off debt day make take oath sad case mr thorndyke sad case judge who have greatly complimented squire on conduct said to a be disrobing afterwards know that in experience ever saw such hardened young villain with highwayman be point of honor to assume gayety of demeanor on such occasion to see boy of eighteen never before convicted exhibiting such coolness effrontery be quite beyond experience suppose record be altogether bad altogether squire said father have during last two year be quite broken by owned to that be in bodily fear of lad who have on several occasion assaulted have robbed of saving by mean of forgery be so hopelessly bad that thought with that only possible hope for be to get to enlist recommended east india company service thinking that must have le opportunity for crime out there that there must be strong chance that fever bullet must carry off for own have not slightest hope of reformation in such character must have given transportation for life if have known judge said however be not likely that will ever come back again very few of do hulk be not most healthy place in world have pretty rough way with men who give trouble a young fellow be likely to do mr bastow a soon a have given evidence have taken hackney coach to inn where squire have put up on arrival in town evening before here on return john thorndyke found be lying on bed in state of prostration cheer up bastow said putting hand upon rector shoulder sentence be fifteen year be very amount hoped that must get more one see of more hopeless be to expect that change will ever take place in be infinitely better that must be across sea where conduct when term be over can affect one disgrace such a be to friend be greater in long term than in short one have got off with four five year imprisonment must have be perpetual trouble source of uneasiness not to say alarm even have left alone must always have be in state of dread a to next offense better that must be out in colony than be hung at tyburn how did take sentence with same bravado have shown through a went out of dock addressed threat to that under circumstance can very well afford to despise now if will take advice will drink couple of glass of good port then go to bed will see to being awakened at seven o'clock will give time to breakfast comfortably to make start at nine must rather not have wine rector said feebly yes must take what be good for have ordered up

laden with apple pear plum what change from little room in reigate must think that anyone ought to be happy indeed here ought to be emma see mr bastow have trouble enough must be lesson to dear to look very closely after boy now be young see that make bad acquaintance from what hear of village there be little fear of that mischief must have begun before mr thorndyke came down when by account thing have altogether gone to bad here of course young bastow must have have exceptionally evil disposition ernest yes doubt father must not have looked after properly believe from what hear that bastow be so dispirited at powerlessness to put stop to state of thing here except to perform service seldom left house boy doubt grew up altogether wild know be in court on second day of examination young fellow insolence bearing astonished shocked happily have squire here now to back up village have be completely cleared of bad character be by account quite model place must do best to keep so news of change at rectory naturally occasioned great deal of talk at first there be general feeling of regret that mr bastow have gone yet be felt that must not have be expected to stay month experience that have have of new parson have cleared way for wife soon made familiar with villager being bright young people speedily made liked squire mr cunningham called first afternoon after arrival must always send up if anything be wanted mr greg whenever there be illness in village always keep stock of soup jelly mr cunningham be almoner in general be there anything that can do for if so let know without hesitation indeed there be nothing mr thorndyke be marvelous to coming in here finding everything that can possibly want will want boy for garden can not do better than take young bill summer be with for bit last year when boy have now be laid up with mumps something of sort be very favorably reported on a being handy in garden able to milk cow so on by way mr greg have taken liberty of sending down cow in milk expect be in meadow now have seven eight of if will send back when milk fails will send down be too kind altogether mr thorndyke mr greg exclaimed not at want to see thing comfortable here will find difficult to get on without cow keep two three for special use of village make pay for halfpenny pint be better to do than to give be invaluable for child think in england see rosier healthier youngster than in school will sometimes find milk useful for pudding sort of thing for sick will appreciate more than if have to look solely to for supply how be mr bastow sir be better than must be expected proposed morning that boy mark must begin study at once indeed now that worst be over have got rid of load of care on shoulder hope that will have bright cheerful again before long such be indeed case for little time mr bastow avoided village john thorndyke got to go down with to call upon mr greg afterwards to walk through with at first went timidly shrinkingly kindly greeting of woman met child stopping to pull forelock bob courtesy a of old gradually cheered up soon got accustomed to change must of afternoon go down to village chat with woman after have ascertained that successor have objection whatever be indeed pleased that still took interest in former parishioner mark be at first disappointed at arrangement for have looked forward to going to public school father however have great trouble in reconciling to of course mark said there be advantage in public school be never at one believe that though discipline be pretty strict there be great deal of fun sport may make desirable acquaintance upon other hand there be drawback in first place majority of boy be son of richer men than be know that must matter much must give expensive habit perhaps make fonder of london life than must care about in next place see must be at school when shooting begin be looking forward to carrying gun next year same with hunting know promised that year must go to meet on pony see a much of a can of course when be at school must only be able to indulge in matter during holiday if hard frost set in a be case three time out of four just a came home must be out of altogether must say must like to have real love of field sport to be good shot good rider man however wide acre may be be thought little of in country if be not good sportsman moreover there be nothing better for developing health muscle than riding tramping over field with gun on shoulder lastly must not forget mark that one of object in making arrangement be to keep mr bastow with be sure that unless thought that be making useful must not be content to remain here at age know must be hard for to obtain clerical employment all right father see that present plan be best must have little sport if went away to school besides like mr bastow very much be quite sure that sha get so many whacking from a used to do from old holbrook fancy not mark father said with smile be not against wholesome discipline think can be carried too far at rate hope will be just a obedient to mr bastow a if always have cane on table beside mark therefore went to work in cheerful spirit soon found that made more progress in week under mr bastow gentle tuition than have done in month under vigorous discipline of former master mr mr greg dined regularly at squire once week have have that indian servant of yours long mr thorndyke mr greg asked one day be strange looking creature of course in daytime when one see about in ordinary clothes one doe not notice so much of evening

with now speaks quite fluently when have nothing for to do devotes to little ward be very fond of be quite pretty to see together in garden altogether must not part with for anything for year life passed uneventfully at crowswood be seldom indeed that squire authority be needed to set matter right in village substitution of good farmer for shiftless one in of farm better cultivation generally have given more employment a john thorndyke preferred keeping two three cottage shut up rather than have occupied by men for whom work must be found be rare indeed that there be complaint of scarcity of work except indeed on part of rector who declared that what with healthiness of village absence of want occupation save for sunday duty be sinecure mr bastow be more happy much brighter than have be for many year occupation of teaching suited be able to make work pleasant to pupil a well a to indeed occupied small portion of day amount of learning considered necessary at time not being

to retire in horror at end of few minute have done well in getting sent off squire said when heard result of interview in first place demoralizing effect of hulk be quite evident may be hoped that in new country where there can be occasion for convict to be pent up together thing may be better for although escape from hulk be not frequent occasionally take place have gained liberty must have have anxious time of until be re arrested whereas out there there be nowhere to go to possibility of committing crime be not there a be in american colony settlement may grow up in time at present there be white men settled in district native be say hostile be convict to escape must almost certainly be killed possibly eaten doubt by time son have served sentence colony will be established out there may then be disposed to settle there either on piece of land of must no doubt take up in service of one of colonist chapter v scene in convict yard at sydney five year after foundation a penal settlement be not pleasant one to lover of humanity warder armed to teeth be arranging gang be to go out to labor on road many of convict have leg iron so fastened a to be slight hindrance to working power majority be unironed be better behaved convict not that must be judged from face for brutalizing nature of system close association of criminal have placed mark on must have be difficult for most discriminating to have made choice between most hardened criminal who have be sent out for what must now be considered comparatively trivial offense voyage on board ship have done much to efface distinction convict life have done more chief difference between chained unchained prisoner be that latter be men of more timid disposition than many of companion therefore le disposed to give trouble must entail heavy punishment be only comparatively well conducted men who be placed upon road work rest be retained for work inside jail be caged in solitary confinement morning number varying from dozen to dozen be fastened up flogged in case with merciless severity be seldom that cry be uttered by most brutal ruffian of convict herd spectacle be just over be conducted in public for edification

do for one have made up mind to try have chalked out plan yet be convinced that be to be done be with whatever be other said think there be twenty thirty must rely on say there be more than because there be lot of white livered cuss among who must inform against at once so a to get own freedom a reward for doing so well will think over mate sooner better two men who be thus talking together be by birth above common herd of convict have gained considerable ascendency over others because of reckless indifference to punishment defiance of authority few of men knew other real name by official be simply known by number while among have slang name generally gained on board ship separation there have of course be impossible when fastened down below have told story with such embellishment a chose to give being little interfered with by guard save to insure impossibility of mutiny there have be fight of desperate kind four five dead body have be found thrown overboard a none must testify a to who have be assailant none be punished for so strongest most desperate have enforced authority over others a wild beast might do by time have reached destination be steeped much deeper in wickedness brutalism than when set sail two men who be speaking together have speedily become chum though much younger than majority of prisoner have by recklessness ferocity established ascendency among others ascendency have be maintained after arrival by constant act of insubordination by apparent indifference to punishment awarded at night convict be lodged in wooden building where so long a be not riotous be allowed to talk converse freely a indeed be case when work for day be done a to attempt at escape authority have small anxiety for until arrival of first settler three year after of convict there be nowhere fugitive must go to food to be obtained shelter save among black who be always ready for reward of tobacco spirit to hand over at once to authority case have slightly changed since settlement began to grow be true that by stealing sheep driving off few head of cattle fugitive might maintain for time even if not shot down by settler patrol must be sure before long to be brought in by black experiment have already be tried of farming better conducted convict to settler indeed be prospect of obtaining such cheap labor have be main inducement to many of colonist to establish so far from home instead of going to america a whole system worked satisfactorily men be a much prisoner a be inmate of jail for knew well enough that be to leave farmer take to bush must remain free short time being killed handed over by black in latter case must be severely punished set to prison work in iron with labor very much more severe than that be called upon to do on farm little time after conversation between two convict prison authority be congratulating upon fact that distinct change have taken be taking place in demeanor of many of men who have hitherto be most troublesome put down to unusually severe flogging have be inflicted on two most refractory prisoner in establishment when in prison yard at work be more silent than before did task doggedly sullenly there be open defiance to authority above marked cessation of drunkenness from spirit smuggled into place only two originator be aware of extent of plot for have agreed that only by keeping man in ignorance a to who have joined must hope to escape treachery in first place have taken into confidence dozen men on whom must absolutely rely beyond have approached others singly beginning by hinting that there be plot for escape that good many be concerned telling that have bound together by solemn oath to kill traitor even if hanged for one be to know who be in who be not leader said to recruit new man will be closely watched by rest if have communication privately with warder other official will be found strangled next morning one will know who did even if succeeded in eluding vigilance of comrade at time must soon be known for if indulgence of kind be shown towards one man be relieved from ordinary work even freed altogether suddenly must be dead man in twenty four hour for have friend outside among ticket of leave men who have bound to kill at once man set free to question what do intend to do when get off answer be will go straight to bush so a to avoid fight with soldier in first place then will join night drive off cattle sheep from settlement take possession of firearm found in house then move off couple of hundred mile so into bush establish settlement of own of course will take horse clothes spirit food may find if soldier pursue will fight a there be only three four company of will be eight hundred strong will very soon show that have better leave alone oh yes doubt will send more soldier out from england will be over year before can get here propose after have done with fellow here to break up into party of twenty thirty dividing sheep cattle among party going where will place be of tremendous size a big a dozen england say party will fix place fancy where there be good water river with fish so on may live life comfortably with just enough work to raise potato corn to watch stock increasing anyhow might calculate on having year of peace freedom even if in end searched out must be very unlikely must bring back hang few set rest to work again think that must most likely leave alone altogether quite satisfied with having got rid of who liked must no doubt take wife among black convict woman who be out on service with settler must may be sure join at once enterprising chap who preferred white woman to black must always make way down here persuade one to go off with to farm be general plan if many get tired of life have only to come down to sydney hide up near place on dark night go down to port seize ship make off in compelling officer sailor to take land at port fancy in chili peru mexico if like sail west make for rio buenos ayres one of west indian island a to when be going to be done how be going to be done one will be told till be ready to be carried out have not settled that ourselves thus one who be fool enough to risk certain death must tell governor no more than that there be plot on hand that man who have sworn in be concerned in so one by one man in prison be sworn by terrible oath to secrecy to watch companion to report anything that looked suspicious many joined willingly prospect of relief even must only be temporary being too fascinating to be resisted joined against will fearing that refusal to do so must be punished by death fact that two three men be found strangled in bed have very great effect in inducing others to join in plot death caused uneasiness to authority utmost endeavor failed to discover who be perpetrator of murder even when everyone in same hut be flogged to obtain information not one opened lip one night word be passed round that time have come one only in hut be familiar with detail gave instruction to man individually a to what be to do date have be determined by fact that time have be sentenced to wear iron have terminated day before unusually subdued quiet demeanor having carried through interval without a usual fresh punishment being awarded before termination of former one in morning whole of convict be drawn up to witness flogging of inmate of one of hut where man have be found strangled morning before first prisoner be taken to triangle stripped to waist tied up there be dead silence in rank of convict a first blow fell upon shoulder there be loud yell simultaneously whole rank broke up number of men sprang upon of warder wrested musket from threw to ground then there be rush towards governor officer who be assembled in front of stone house faced open end of square firing pistol at once took refuge in house three four falling under scattered fire be opened a soon a musket of warder fell into hand of convict directly door be closed officer appeared at window opened rifle fire upon convict a did guard near gate a comparatively few of convict have musket began to waver at once headed by two ringleader armed party rushed at guard shot down threw open gate then unexpected thing occurred soldier from barrack happened to be marching down to do target practice on shore be passing convict prison when firing broke out be at once halted ordered to load a convict with exultant shout poured through gate saw long line of soldier with leveled musket facing at one of leader shouted be too late to draw back now have got to break through many of convict ran back into yard armed with musket more desperate of party followed leader moment later heavy volley rang out number of convict fell two leader however twenty of follower keeping in close body rushed at line of soldier with clubbed musket with suddenness fury of rush burst way through line then scattering fled across country pursued by dropping fire of musketry officer in command seeing fraction have escaped ordered one company to pursue marched rest into prison yard be already deserted convict have scattered to hut who have arm throwing away dotted here there over square be body of eight ten convict a many warder whose skull have be smashed in by infuriated assailant a soon a have obtained possession of musket close to gate lay six soldier who have furnished guard be dead mortally wounded governor official issued from house a soon a soldier entered yard first step to do be to turn convict out of hut to iron resistance be attempted sight of soldier completely cowing mutineer when body of convict have fallen be counted roll of prisoner called over be found that eighteen be missing of six be during course of next hour two brought in by soldier who have gone in pursuit of rest have escaped convict be questioned separately tale told agreed so closely that governor must not doubt that be speaking truth have be sworn in by one of two men knew nothing whatever of what be intended to be done day until after be locked up on evening previous of in hut have received instruction night before from one man there be eighteen hut containing fifteen convict of men who have given instruction six have fallen outside gate together with sixteen others five have be overtaken brought in altogether twelve be still at large among be two leader next day six of prisoner be tried executed rest be punished only by reduction in ration sentence of death be at same time passed upon twelve still at large so a to save trouble of succession of trial a be caught brought in two leader have kept together after have broken through line of soldier thing have gone off well one said a ran through soldier nearly spoilt yes be unlucky other agreed so far a be concerned be care about think thing have turned out for best nothing more be said until have far outstripped pursuer hampered a be by uniform belt mean that be not such bad thing that have not got away yes be what mean be very well to tell about driving off sheep cattle horse going to start colony on own account soldier must have be up to before have gone day journey most of fellow must have bolted directly saw a be fancy only about dozen have got away perhaps not a many a be men that one can rely upon one can feed dozen without difficulty sheep day must do by giving turn to of settler animal wo be missed besides will want money if be ever to get out of cursed country must not be difficult to get enough for when come to large number sack of whole settlement must not go very far own idea be that have best join others tonight kill few sheep go two three day march into bush until heat of pursuit be over be armed black must not venture to attack soldier must not be likely to pursue very far in week so when can assume that matter have cooled down bit can come down again know shepherd even if be not disposed to help must not dare to betray report sheep two being missing of course will have to be very careful to shift quarter frequently black tracker be sure to be sent out pretty often a long a be hanging about settlement there wo be much fear of being bothered by black of course will have to decide later on whether will be best for to try seize ship of acting together for to get quietly on board one keep under hatch until be well away be plan fancy most so do in first place chance be that in next two three month at least fellow will be picked up to begin with several of be sure to get hold of liquor make attack upon settler in case of anyhow be sure to get killed in next place most of be brought up a thief in slum of london will have more idea of roughing in country like than of behaving if be transported to london drawing room therefore be pretty sure at end of three month will not be able to reckon on half of well six men be not enough to capture ship if do capture to keep crew under one must sleep sometimes with only three four men on deck must not hope to keep whole ship crew at bay then there be reason when have got decent rig out must pas anywhere without exciting observation while if have dozen of others good quality must be noticed at once by villainous face if question be to be asked must be likely to find in limbo again in very short time so be for working on own account even if whole of others be ready to back of course must keep on good term with breathe word that think that man have better shift for of fellow if thought have idea of leaving must go straight into sydney denounce although must know that must be likely to swing at same time a none of convict be acquainted with bush have be obliged to select a rendezvous hut two mile out of town where convict gang worked on road be in habit of leaving tool on way there two men killed couple of sheep from flock whose position have noticed before became dark skinned cut off head left behind carrying sheep on shoulder to meeting be that captain wild voice said a approached gentleman dick be with be good job have begun to think that soldier have caught must not have caught alive may take oath how many be there of here ten of captain think that be there be be enough for purpose have anyone got anything to eat there be deep growl in negative well have brought couple of sheep with a have carried something like mile have better handle by turn will strike off into bush put three four mile between jail then light fire have meal two of men came forward took sheep then turned off from road taking direction from star followed for hour think have got far enough now man called captain wild said have better cut down bush will make fire how be to light one of exclaimed in tone of consternation suppose have got flint steel tinder box among oh can manage that captain said get heap of dried leaf here first then wood will soon have blaze order be obeyed of men have carried off warder sword a well a musket now used for chopping wood a soon a small pile of dried leaf be gathered captain broke cartridge sprinkled half content among then dropped remainder into musket flashed off among leaf bright flame at once shot up in five minute fire be burning one of sheep be soon cut up meat hacked in slice from bone ramrod be thrust through piece supported by four stick be laid across fire three other similarly laden spit be soon placed beside in short time meat be ready for eating until hearty meal have be made there be little talking be first rate one of men said a wiped mouth with back of hand now one only want pipe bacca glass of grog to feel comfortable well captain be satisfied with day work must have be grand day have not be for soldier passing just at time a be gentleman dick have be agreeing that a far a be concerned have not turned out so badly there must have be lot of difficulty in finding food if have got away of mealy mouthed fellow must have be sure to go back peach on at first opportunity dozen be better than hundred for sort of life be likely to lead for time be strong enough to beat off attack from black fellow also to break into of settler house can when have mind to take stray sheep now then even bullock must scarcely be missed especially if pal in settlement will lend helping hand may be sure will do in fact must know better than to refuse then large party must be traced by black tracker at run while small one must not especially if a certainly will do break up into two three for time first of though must go well into bush at daybreak tomorrow morning will drive off twenty sheep go right away hundred mile wait there till matter have settled down will never take troop out that distance after then can come back again hang about settlement take what want wild black come near there will be safer in pair than must be if kept together of course must meet once week so to talk over plan must borrow whisky flour tea tobacco few other item from settler have better do without for trip want to turn settler against for

complaint of know what hard time have have can see of woman be really sorry for gave more than actually asked for have not be so with others have be breaking into house stealing thing must lay hand upon in three four case shooting down men on slightest provocation money watch be good to brute must not help stealing so here be settlement be like swarm of angry bee plan of handing over most of horse to military will end in of being hunted down if stay here two be shot yesterday in week will either be killed caught there be nothing for to clear out be against violence not on principle

rope make ourselves useful in way if be lucky ought to get enough before start to buy horse set up well in business at home think be very good plan other agreed be quite sure sooner make ourselves scarce here better chapter vi while arranging for young bastow being sent out with first batch of convict john thorndyke have be introduced to several of official of department called upon at interval to obtain news of penal colony three year after establishment crown colony have be opened for settlement in vicinity a climate be said to be very fine country fertile land must be taken up without payment number who went out be considerable there being additional attraction convict of good character must be allotted to settler a servant farm hand six year after arthur bastow sailed squire learned that there have be revolt among convict several have be killed mutiny suppressed about dozen have succeeded in getting away have committed several robbery murder among settler military force party of warder from prison be scouring country for of course mr thorndyke official said governor in report doe not give name of of concerned in matter simply say that although mutiny be general be wholly work of small number of worse class of prisoner by worse class mean most troublesome refractory out there prisoner be not classified according to original crime poacher who have killed game keeper smuggler who have killed revenue officer may in other respect be quiet well conducted man while men sentenced for comparatively minor offense may give immense deal of trouble will however get letter written to governor asking if arthur bastow be among who took part in revolt if so what have become of be more than year before reply came then governor reported that arthur bastow who be believed to have be leading spirit of mutiny be among who have escaped have not yet be recaptured be generally believed that have be killed by black of there be actual proof mr bastow be much disturbed when heard news suppose come back here mr thorndyke wo suppose anything of sort squire replied say that must be altogether impossible because now that vessel go from time to time to sydney might of course be able to hide up in one of not come on deck until be well on way when in probability must be allowed to work passage might be put ashore without information being given to authority have doubt that among sailor there must be good deal of sympathy felt for convict doubt have hard time of know that gang working on road be always ironed still be very unlikely chance be in favor of being in hiding in bush shepherd other hand on farm be chiefly convict must probably give aid if required there must be difficulty in getting sheep now then for a report say one of chief trouble out there be wild dog dingo a be called loss in way must readily be put down to a to money must have occasion for if wanted must get by robbing settler must know that if came back here must run risk of being seized at once on landing of being speedily hunted down a escaped convict think that there be slightest occasion for to trouble ourselves about though squire spoke so confidently felt by mean sure that arthur bastow must not turn up again for reckless audacity have made great impression upon proceeds of robbery in colony in have doubt played part must have furnished with money with must bribe sailor to hide away if necessary pay passage money to england when discovered on board perhaps maintain when got home until must replenish purse by unlawful mean lastly squire argued that fellow vindictive nature longing for revenge must act a incentive to bring back to london talked matter over with mark who be now powerful young fellow of twenty who of course remembered incident attending bastow capture trial can not help fancying that fellow will come back mark well if doe father must make business to lay by heel again managed last time if must turn up may be sure will help to do again yes may not hear of having returned until strike blow at rate see that pistol be loaded close at hand at night always be father there be saying when house like standing alone containing good deal of plate valuable may be broken into well might a well carry always when go out after dark will speak to knapp request to let know if hears of suspicious looking character stranger in fact being noticed in about village will have talk with head constable at reigate ask to do same be not same man who be head at time bastow be up before be in force then a one of constable who came up to take prisoner down to reigate will have fact in mind be sharp fellow though bastow have doubt changed good deal since then must hardly fail to recognize if eye fell upon of course may be alarming unnecessarily there be several reason why must object strongly to be shot just at present time at other time must say father young man said with laugh will know squire safe enough head constable replied when john thorndyke went down to see on following day must think that if doe come back to england will hardly be fool enough to come down here be pretty well known in town before affair everyone who be in courthouse must be sure to have face strongly impressed upon mind may forget man have seen casually forget one have watched closely when be in dock with two others charged with murder five out of six men be constable at time must know again minute saw anyhow will tell to keep sharp lookout in tramp quarter especially over two three men still here that bastow used to consort with must say that reigate be last place in world where must show face hope so squire said have caused trouble enough down here a be father be getting old man now be by mean strong fresh trouble of kind must undoubtedly kill month later reigate coach be stopped when short distance out of town by two highwayman considerable prize obtained by robber soon afterwards came news of private carriage being stopped on various common in south of london of several burglary taking place among house round clapham wandsworth putney such event be by mean uncommon following other in such quick succession created strong feeling of alarm among inhabitant of neighborhood john thorndyke going up to town shortly afterwards went to headquarters of bow street runner have talk with chief in reference especially to stoppage of reigate coach mr chetwynd have lately died john thorndyke have be unanimously elected by fellow magistrate a chairman of bench mr thorndyke have clew men have be keeping sharpest watch over fellow suspected of having hand in such matter seem keeping pretty quiet at present none of seem to be particularly flush with money be same with burglary in south of london be at wit end about be flooded with letter of complaint from resident though patrol on common have be doubled effort made be a far off a ever a far a burglary be concerned have reason to think that be work of two three new hand job be not neatly done certainly not with tool usually used by burglar seem to rely upon daring rather than skill anyhow know where to look for be altogether at sea of course be a annoying to a be to anyone else more so because justice of peace be sending complaint to home secretary in turn drop on want to know what be doing have sort of fancy fellow who be stopping coach be same a concerned in burglary must not give reason for saying so except on occasion have coach be stopped house broken into on same night fancy at present sha hear much more of have created such alarm that coach carry with two men armed with blunderbuss in addition to guard must fancy that householder sleep with pistol within reach have got arm for servant at many of large house know watchman have be engaged to sit in hall night to ring alarm bell wake inmate directly hears suspicious sound perhaps fellow may be quiet for time for must during last month have got wonderful amount of spoil maybe will go west bath road be always favorite one with fellow maybe will work northern side of town hope will lay hand upon one day so far may say frankly have not slightest clew must put horse up somewhere yes unfortunately there be so many small wayside inn that be next to impossible to trace number of fellow be in alliance with highwayman of too have small farm in addition to public house business horse may be snugly put up there while be searching inn stable in vain again there be rogue even among farmer little men perhaps who farm more than thirty forty acre working by aid of hired man who life perhaps at village mile away to man of kind offer of couple of guinea week to keep two horse in empty cowshed to ask question be heavy temptation have got two clever fellow going about country inquiring at village whether two mounted men have lately be heard going through there late at night early in morning so a to narrow down area to be searched nothing have come of although be pretty sure that must have three four place use in various direction men have picked up story of horseman being heard occasionally come from various direction nowhere have be noticed with regularity besides there be other knight of road about so be nearer than be on line of inquiry month later john thorndyke have occasion to go up again to town time mark accompanied carried pistol a did groom sitting behind squire be poor shot mark have practiced great deal 't be good thing to be able to shoot straight mark father have said to three year before abhor dueling there be so much of at present that gentleman might find in position when must either go out submit to be considered coward then too road be infested by highwayman for reason alone must be well that man must be able to shoot straight must also practice sometimes at night setting up object at distance so that can just make out outline taking dozen shot at know be very difficult when can not see own pistol can soon learn to trust to arm to come up to right height in right direction of course must wait until morning to find out where bullet have gone two day after have reached town squire received letter from mr cunningham dear mr thorndyke knapp have be up morning to tell that stranger dismounted yesterday at alehouse while horse be being fed asked few question among others wished to be told if be at home saying that have known fifteen year ago when lived near hastings must like to have talk with again in fact have turned off from main road for purpose seemed disappointed when heard that have gone up to town hearing that might not be back for three four day said must be coming back through reigate in week ten day dared say must be able to find time to call again knapp did not hear about until morning asked landlord about man landlord said be about thirty dark sparely built did not notice horse particularly seeing that be such a small squire farmer might ride carried brace of pistol in holster landlord be not prepossessed with appearance be that made speak to knapp about have told men to unfasten dog night have asked knapp to send up two trustworthy men to keep watch may mean something may not squire said a handed letter to mark be suspicious looking circumstance if fellow have be honest must surely have said something about there be doubt housebreaker generally find out what chance there be of resistance hearing that be away may have decided on making attempt have pretty well finished business ordered nearly provision mr cunningham requires have to call at lawyer be generally longish business be half past two o'clock now if start from here at five will be down soon after eight will be quite soon enough will have couple of hour drive in dark wo matter have got lamp be quite ready to start father be engaged to sup with reginald ascot will go over afternoon make excuse at five o'clock started have got pistol in order mark squire asked a drove over london bridge have handy father one in pocket james be pistol charged yes sir at six o'clock be beginning to get dusk stopped while groom got down lit lamp then resumed journey be within five mile of reigate when suddenly two horseman rode out from side road with shout of stand deliver squire lashed horse moment later pistol be fired ball went through hat by light of lamp mark saw other man raise hand leveling pistol fired on instant then a there be reply to shot discharged second barrel at first who have fired who have at once drawn pistol two report rang out almost at same moment mark be little first there be sharp exclamation of pain from highwayman who wrenched round horse galloped down lane from have issued groom sending two bullet after where be other man mark exclaimed a father reined in horse somewhere on ground there mark saw fall from saddle a passed be use pursuing other father be pretty sure hit be quite sure did be good following side road be so cut up by rut that must break spring before have gone hundred yard will stop look at fellow who be unhorsed mark groom got down taking one of carriage lamp proceeded to spot where highwayman horse be standing man be already dead bullet having hit few inch above heart be dead father think have better lift up on foot board behind james can ride horse will hand body over to constable at reigate may know who be find something upon may afford clew will lead to capture of companion know squire constable said a stopped before house told what have happened however certainly be dead will get one of men to help carry into shed behind courthouse so say that think that other be wounded be pretty sure be heard give exclamation a son fired that be good shooting mr mark constable said if passenger must use arm a do there must soon be end to stopping coach will see what have got about will come up let know squire first thing in morning will send knapp down john thorndyke said a drove homewards be rather curious to know if fellow be same mr cunningham wrote about will tell to take peter along with hardly see that there can be connection between two highwayman go in for house breaking think consider to be lower branch of profession generally do doubt mark know told that chief at bow street said that have suspicion that highway robber house breaker who have be creating so much alarm be same men be curious that must have happened to light on father if be intending to break into house john thorndyke made reply in few minute drove up to house return couple of day before be expected caused great satisfaction to mr cunningham millicent former however have wisely kept from girl matter on have written to squire suspicion have entertained be very dull without millicent said be telling mr cunningham thought must be good thing when got back for two to take run up to town for week just to let see how dull place be when two of be away be looking quite serious uncle be anything matter happily nothing be matter with dear have have adventure not very pleasant one be girl asked if examine hat closely millicent will tell girl took up hat from chair on have put brought to light there be two hole in said oh guardy have be shot at look like dear two gentleman highwayman at least be what believe call asked pressingly to stop a must not comply with request one fired at a see be uncommonly good shot other be about to fire when mark pistol put stop to second barrel stopped fellow who have fired first be hit for heard give exclamation of pain before more shooting must be done turned rode off down narrow lane where must not follow what became of first millicent asked with open eye be dead before must get down to examine will not disturb king peace again happened about four mile from home so brought in gave horse into charge of constable at reigate have really killed man millicent said looking up with awestruck expression to mark well a man must have killed if have can not say millicent that death weighs in way heavily on mind if be a good shot a other father life must not have be worth much for a be driving fast be not above half a far away a other have be when fired just same suppose a must be in battle man be going to shoot shoot first suppose ever trouble afterwards of course mean blame mark doe seem shocking suppose must think that millicent if burglar who have taken one shot at be about to finish with be cut short in operation by shot from pistol believe that relief thankfulness must be so great that idea that be shocking thing for to do must not a much a enter head wish have shot other man a well a one did mark squire said a walked with son down to reigate to attend inquest next morning on man have brought in mark looked at father in surprise there be doubt hit father said must not think that will be likely to trouble again wish felt quite sure of do know have strong suspicion that be arthur bastow mark have of course heard of bastow escape have attached no great importance to crime have taken place nearly eight year before although greatly impressed at time by ill doings of man idea that must ever return endeavor to avenge on father for part have taken have not occurred to beyond mentioning escape squire have never talked to on subject be who bade stand deliver moment spoke voice seemed familiar to thinking over have impression that be may be mistaken for have have in mind ever since heard that have escaped may therefore have connected voice with erroneously yet can not think be right see there be two three suspicious circumstance in first place there be man down here making inquiry knapp went down early morning with innkeeper told before breakfast that peter at once recognized fellow shot a man who have made inquiry now natural result of making inquiry must have be that two men must next evening have broken into house thinking that during absence must meet with resistance instead of doing waylaid on road look a if be intended to attack not house how must have known that be father be certainly singular that one of two men must have be fellow who be up at inn may be only matter of coincidence know mark say that singular coincidence occur have not much faith in still if be journeying down to attack house last night must hardly have stopped traveler by way when there be rich booty awaiting a evidently believed there be that man must not have come down specially to make inquiry own impression be that when heard that must return in two three day one of watched in london a soon a learned that be to start for home at five o'clock came down here to stop must hardly have done merely to get watch what money have in pocket must think not father might be friend of men who have got into trouble at reigate a be chairman of bench may have have special grudge against for conviction be of course possible hope that be so even if arthur bastow have escaped father why must come back to england where must know that might be arrested again instead of staying quietly out in australia there be two reason in first place life out there must not be quiet one there must be nothing for to attack rob settler a be sure to be armed be pretty dangerous business then there be peril from black lastly such life must be absolutely devoid of comfort be of hunted dog living always in bush scarcely venturing to sleep lest must be pounced upon by armed constable of colony by black be not a if country be extensively populated there be not very large number of settler there yet therefore very small scope for robber people must keep very little money with amount of plunder to be got must be small indeed therefore take that main object of escaped convict must be to get away from place be one of reason why fellow might come back to england in spite of risk other be that believe to be so diabolically vindictive that must run almost peril in order to obtain revenge upon father twice have threatened first time when captured second time a left court after have received sentence be not coward so far a know mark be a certain a stand here that meant what said that during year of imprisonment toil out there have be cherishing thought of coming home day getting even with see be said to have be leader of convict revolt there be doubting daring to mind attack upon last night when knew that must have managed successful robbery here point to fact that be result of personal animosity strengthens belief that be arthur bastow who called upon to stand deliver be very unpleasant idea father very unpleasant seems to that must at rate spare pain in hunting man wounded down will undertake that if like have nothing particular to do must be excitement have lot to keep here fancy that will find excitement mark for of course detective will do hunting must certainly be glad if must take letter for to head of detective department tell what think reason for thinking so say offer reward of hundred pound for capture of man who tried to stop who be be certain wounded by unless have marvelously out of way hiding place ought not to be difficult wounded man must scarcely lie hidden in slum of london without being known to good many people to of whom reward of sum of hundred pound must be irresistible temptation by time have reached reigate inquest did not last many minute jury without hesitation returned verdict of justifiable homicide chapter vii next morning mark went up to london of course mr thorndyke chief at bow street said father suspicion a to man identity may may not be justified that however make difference to here be highwayman who have be wounded must certainly be valuable capture will set men to work at once if be in london will get news of before many day men in case must do duty father offer will certainly stimulate energy where be stopping at bull in holborn very well will be sure to let know a soon a get clew to man identity mark remained in london week at end of time received note from bow street saying that superintendent wished to see be sorry have news for mr thorndyke officer said when called upon place where man must be likely to be in hiding have be searched clew have be obtained will now circulate notice of reward throughout country if man be at severely hit may assume that must be somewhere in neighborhood of london whereas if wound be slight one might be able to go long distance may be now in york for aught know however now that search in london have terminated can really see use in staying here longer will let know directly have news three month later john thorndyke received letter from detective office asking to call next time came up to town a although news have be obtained must lead to man immediate arrest news have at rate be obtained showing that be alive happened that mark be intending to go up on following day father asked to call for at bow street well mr thorndyke have heard about man that after have quite abandoned search have come to conclusion that wound gave have be fatal one that have be quietly buried by of people with whom be connected discovery be a half discovery generally be result of accident last week gentleman entered bank asked for change in gold for fifty pound note cashier looking at number found that be one of have be stolen from passenger by one of south coach several month ago gentleman be at once taken into private office questioned a to how have obtained note account that gave be that be surgeon in practice at southampton gentleman have arrived there on date found to be day after on be stopped be well dressed have air of gentleman have come down by coach be evidently very ill told surgeon that have be engaged in duel that pistol have be discharged simultaneously that have killed man have be severely wounded said that person whom have killed have influential connection that must be necessary for to remain in seclusion for time asked to take charge of case a have ample mean of paying handsomely surgeon examined wound found to be indeed serious one a thought probably fatal however having doubt a to truth of story have taken gentleman in remained under charge until week before came up to town for first month have be dangerously ill completely recovered surgeon have reason for doubting patient being gentleman be fashionably dressed have evidently changed clothes after duel a there be bloodstain upon be however glad when left a conversation did not please from cynical tone bank sent to directly man presented note stated have be given to in part payment for medical service board lodging of patient total amount have be pound balance be paid in gold a be able to give several good reference be identified by three gentleman be of course released have doubt that fellow attended be man surgeon said whoever be must have be man of iron resolution to have made journey in state be doubt must have ridden straight to place used a headquarters where have wound roughly bandaged changed clothes have ridden in morning to point that coach passed on way to southampton of course obtained minute description from surgeon of man appearance found that people at coach office have remembrance of there being anyone answering to description among person who traveled by coach of course must not go for much for over three month have elapsed when coachman who have driven down coach that day came up to town saw remembered perfectly that on about day have picked up passenger at kingston gentleman who be in very weak health there be only three inside passenger besides have to be assisted into coach way bill on being turned up showed that inside passenger have be taken up at kingston have already sent down men to make inquiry at village in district between reigate kingston trust that will lay hand on especially now have got accurate description of while before be working in dark in respect what be description sir father be much interested on point for a believe told have strong suspicion that fellow be man who be transported more than eight year ago to australia who made escape from prison there yes know at first appeared to very improbable be bound to say description tally very closely with given of surgeon took to be nearly thirty after what have gone through may well look three four year older than be have light hair rather small gray eye face must have be good looking have not be for supercilious sneering expression can remember mark said that answer very closely to must say that be certainly bastow father made mistake when asserted that recognized voice officer added note to description in register strongly suspected of being arthur bastow transported for connivance with highwayman be leader of mutiny in convict jail of sydney two year half ago made escape there be doubt went on that be desperate character doubt be man who have be concerned in most of robbery in southern suburb must get hold of if can once do so there will be end of travel for mutiny in prison escape be hanging business putting aside affair since got back well sir hope will give father more trouble be sure hope so mark said suppose that fellow who be shot be one of men who escaped with from convict prison be likely enough two must get home a easily a one fact that be stranger here must account for difficulty men have have in search for see have have nothing whatever to go on must not be too sanguine about catching man in short time be evidently clever fellow think likely that once got back lost time in getting away from part of country be more likely to find in west north than be of laying hand on here will send description over country a soon a hear of series of crime anywhere will send off two of best men to help local constable on return home mark told father what have done thought must not have be mistaken mark have got rascal on hand again hope now that have got description of to go by will not be long before catch way escaped after being badly wounded show that be full of resource may give trouble yet if be not mistaken at rate will have talk with reigate constable tell that there be very little doubt that man who attacked be arthur bastow who have a have heard escaped from botany bay that have best tell men to keep sharp lookout for for owing to animosity against for former capture conviction be likely enough that sooner later will be in neighborhood again after determined attempt at life when pretending to rob will certainly not feel comfortable until know that be under lock key wish guardy must give up magistrate business millicent said at dinner be sure that be worrying ca see why must go on with doe not worry a rule millicent indeed like duty besides landowner of standing ought to take share in public work there be only two of magistrate younger than be may think of feel capable of doing what work there be to do when mark get few year older will resign let take place on bench own though must be glad if highway robbery must be suppressed poaching ordinary offense of drunkenness assault be disposed of without trouble stopping of coach accompanied occasionally by shooting of coachman guard give great deal of trouble worst of be that be practically powerless to put such crime down nothing short of patrolling road in party of three four between sunset sunrise must put stop to fund at disposal must not support such expenditure be pity that can not get up corp like yeomanry call mounted constabulary said mark there be at least dozen fellow know who must like be glad to join dare say must get score of young farmer farmer son be not bad idea mark dare say that for time duty must be zealously performed before very long must tire of few wet night winter cold must cease to see fun of especially a may be sure that news that road be well patrolled must soon come to ear of scoundrel must cease to work in district perhaps be right sir think that few of must stick to perhaps so mark must be sorry to wager that work must be thoroughly done first county hunt ball even dinner party more than half of must be away say that personally might not for considerable time persist in patrolling road for have sort of personal interest in matter must wager that before two month have passed must find be only one who attended at rendezvous regularly fortnight later party be seated round fire in dusk mr bastow be sitting next to squire be in unusually good spirit have heard word of what squire have discovered dreamed that son be again in england still le that be suspected of being one of men who have endeavored to stop squire son on drive from london suddenly there be crack of pistol outside ball passed between squire without word mark thorndyke rushed to door seized pistol from riding coat snatching up heavy whip dashed out into garden be just in time to see figure running at full speed set off in pursuit good runner a be gained slightly at first after time drew nearer to fugitive latter be sixty yard away when leaped hedge into narrow lane mark followed without hesitation a leaped into road heard jeering laugh sharp sound of horse hoof knew that man be pursuing have gained horse made off disgusted at failure went slowly back to house shutter have be put up have lost father ran well to begin with be gaining fast on when leaped into narrow lane where have left horse rode off before must get up to need hardly say that there be use attempting to follow on foot missed did not yes mark be not so easy to take accurate aim when be nearly dark bullet passed between mr bastow have buried in mantelpiece something ought to be done guardy millicent conyers said indignantly be shameful that people can not sit in own room without risk of being shot at what can mean surely one can have enmity against hope not dear john thorndyke said lightly of fellow have sentenced may think that be rather hard on think that of must feel sufficiently to attempt to murder one besides mark say that fellow have horse waiting for none of poacher must be likely to be owner of horse may be that highwayman mark shot at wounded have come down to give fright be use worrying about now in future will have shutter closed at sunset be hardly likely that thing will be attempted again mark chase must have shown fellow that game be hardly worth risk might have shot mark have right to risk life in sort of way girl said to later a be seated together in front of fire while squire be reading gazette at table mr cunningham be working mr bastow who have be greatly shaken by event have retired to bed do think that really meant to kill father must imagine did man must hardly run risk of being hung merely for pleasure of shooting must give good deal if have caught better still if have shot said mark however will make business to hunt fellow down after evening affair will never feel comfortable until be caught have doubt that be fellow have be hunting for last four month people at bow street seem good will try if can not succeed better do anything rash mark said millicent in low voice have right to put in danger life be in danger now millicent in much greater danger than mine must be when looking out for there seems guarding against attack like mean to hunt down if take year have nothing special to do can not employ time more usefully when lady went up to bed squire said come into library mark will smoke pipe have talk over business touched bell have got good fire in library ramoo yes sahib very good then take bottle of number one bin of port there couple of glass when be quietly seated glass filled long pipe alight squire said want to have serious talk with mark what be going to say will surprise good deal have not intended to tell for four year be to say not until millicent came of age after affair tonight feel that life be so uncertain that ought not to delay letting know truth suppose agree with that be bastow who shot at evening have not least doubt about father will not say that shot at squire said for may have shot at father villain be quite capable of that be father who brought upon though effected capture eight year ago suppose care of killed however point be not what aimed at whether be that take there be doubt about missed time next shot may be more successful at rate think that be high time told story beginning with arrival of colonel thorndyke at place repeated conversation that have have with several time in early portion of narrative be interrupted by exclamation of surprise from son then millicent be really uncle heiress exclaimed mark when heard request colonel have made of squire be so mark doe not know be brother urgent wish that must not know until came of age until married fought against to utmost be dying prayer must not refuse solicitor know fact of matter so doe mr cunningham who brought millicent over from india when be only about year old may say that especially urged that must not be fair to to be brought up to consider to be heir to property said 'putting aside estate have considerable fortune in first place there be accumulation of rent from reigate place have never touched have be going on for twelve year in next place shaking of pagoda tree have gone on merrily made comfortable pile then always made point of carrying about with two three hundred pound after sacking of of palace must pick up jewel thing from troop for trifle being able to pay money down even without rent here have pound in money must think jewel must be worth at least a much more irrespective of diamond bracelet be fancy worth more than rest put together be stolen from arm of idol then explained how got manner in have placed rest of wealth in secure position 'things stolen from god be frightfully dangerous '

found be mystery have never tried to solve there be nothing whatever to go upon thing may be in england may be anywhere in india to looked absolutely hopeless business to set about did not see how even first step be to be taken a have estate millicent to look after be no longer young man put matter aside altogether be young have plenty of energy have life before be matter of greatest interest to possibly very improbably mind still possibly when millicent come of age learns who be mr cunningham may be able to help have idea whether be so have never spoken to about treasure of george be just possible that while be in town before came down to may have given instruction concerning of course intended to give full particular must hardly have avoided seeing that in event of death perhaps suddenly before time came for seeking treasure secret must be lost altogether whether have told lawyer not can not say have along clung to hope that took such natural precaution unless treasure be discovered only thing will come to be half of accumulated rent of estate during ten year between father death george rent be paid to solicitor by invested rental amount to about pound year of course there be interest to be added so that suppose there be now pound for have out pound when came here to set matter straight have great fight with lawyer over a pointed out have failed altogether to see that agent did duty at least couple of hundred year ought to be expended in necessary repair have right to at least sum to carry out work ought to be done from year to year in addition to sum laid out about pound year for first three year be here so that practically pound be expended in rebuilding village doing repair on homestead that however be not point now altogether then there be pound to be divided between millicent when becomes mistress of property according to term of brother will be still to remain here until marries when doe so will of course go back to own little place income of have be accumulating while have be here only expense having be for clothes have taken nothing out of estate since came here year have paid to solicitor balance remaining after discharging household expense balance averaging pound year of course income be absolutely left to during time remained ostensible owner have wish to make money out of trust assumed greatly against will money be millicent of course house have to be kept up in proper style whether be here not have at once come into possession there must have be horse carriage so on say have not have expense of living saved that have objection to be determined at least not to take penny put of estate beyond expense see mark will have pound anyhow a soon a millicent come of age not bad little sum so that even if never hear anything more of mysterious treasure will not be penniless in anyway dependent upon at death of course will come into sussex place with what saving there may be be sure have reason to grumble father mark said heartily of course came upon at first a surprise millicent be heiress here flashed through mind for moment that best thing must be to take commission in army to follow uncle example get cadetship in company service have doubt must have enjoyed life way quite a much possibly more than if have gone on good many year a heir to estate afterwards a squire of course now will make business to see if be possible to obtain sort of clew to treasure then follow up first thing to will give mind will be to hunt down bastow will never feel safe here a long a fellow be alive will be first thing will devote to after will see about treasure a to that mark can not impress upon too strongly what uncle said may of course be pure delusion on part if be right of hindoo fellow be still on watch to obtain that bracelet must use extraordinary precaution when get into hand advised to take across to amsterdam get stone recut to sell separately to different diamond merchant there said that life must not be worth hour purchase a long a stone be in hand that rather look father a if thing be somewhere in england have be in india must have have month in hand before must get to amsterdam did not think of before mark be possible that be right know might have thought that must be impossible for to dispose of at madras calcutta may have assumed must at once deposit in bank to be forwarded with other treasure to england must get packed away in treasure safe in ship came back by must not really have on person till landed in england until took from bank still see that supposition be most likely that may all time have be lying somewhere in london until must present with gold coin word suddenly mark sprang to foot pulled back curtain across window threw up leaped into garden there stood listening for two three minute with pistol cocked in hand stepped for moment into room again have better put light out father may have shot did hear anything mark thought did father may have be mistaken certainly thought heard noise when pulled curtain aside window be not shut by three four inch will have look through shrubbery that fellow may have come back again pull curtain to after will go with mark must rather did father must only make nervous sha go into shrubbery give chance of getting first shot will hide up somewhere listen be still night if there be anyone moving be pretty sure to hear squire turned down lamp drew curtain seated by fire be three quarter of hour before mark returned shut window fastened carefully fancy must have be mistaken mark suppose shot through window have made nervous certainly did fancy heard noise there may have be dead bough snapping something of sort of course window being partly open even though only three four inch little noise must come in more plainly than otherwise must do however everything have be perfectly quiet since went out be hardly likely indeed that fellow must have returned so soon after hot chase gave be very stupid window being left open squire said will question martha about in morning be duty to see that be shut fastened before drawing curtain just at present one can scarcely be too careful mean to deny that whether there be window open not burglar who wanted to get into house must do so still there be use in making work more easy for know a rule be careless about such thing there have not be burglary in part for year until lately front door have never be locked at night anyone must have walked in who wanted to of course servant know that there be reason for being more careful at present than usual be thinking other day of having shutter put to downstair room of have got have not still even with shutter burglar can always get in if want to do so have only to cut round lock of door to make hole in panel to give room to put arm through draw back bolt thing be done know that silver be locked up night in safe for ramoo see to have never known neglect anything under charge well mark know that be use sitting up longer have plenty of time to talk matter over be four year yet before millicent come of age though of course there be nothing to prevent setting out in quest of treasure a soon a like still there be hurry about none father mean to lose day before try to get on track of villain bastow chapter viii mark be hour before went to sleep news that have heard that evening be strange startling full of health strength fact that be not a have always supposed heir to estate troubled not at fact that in four year must come in for twelve thousand pound be sufficient to prevent feeling uneasiness a to future indeed in respect be not unpleasant idea that instead of being tied down to estate must be able to wander at will visit foreign country make own life in one respect be sorry father have in last year hinted more than once that must be very nice arrangement if be to make up match with ward have laughed said that there must be plenty of time for yet idea have be agreeable one be very fond of millicent fond perhaps in cousinly way at present at rate liked far better than of sister of friend of course be only seventeen yet there be plenty of time to think of marriage in three year still thought occurred to several time that be budding out into young woman month added to attraction be day before have said to that there be reason to wait a long a three year especially a father seemed anxious must evidently be glad be match to take place now of course said to be at end have never given reason to suppose that cared for now that be heiress comparatively poor must naturally think that be for estate not for herself that be wooed then there be question of curiously lost treasure with mysterious clew led to nothing how on earth be to set about quest puzzled for long time over till at last fell asleep be roused by ramoo entering room what be ramoo not know sahib massa thorndyke door shut able to make hear be curious ramoo mark said jumping hastily out of bed will be with in minute slipped on trouser coat slipper then accompanied ramoo to father door knocked again again time more loudly face growing paler a did so then threw against door be solid heavy fetch ax ramoo said there be something wrong here ramoo returned in short time with two men servant with ax in hand mark took with few mighty blow split woodwork then hurling against door yielded a entered room cry broke from lip within pace two of bed squire lay on ground on face deep stain on carpet at once showed that death have be violent one mark knelt by side now touched body be stiff cold squire must have be dead for hour murdered said in low voice father have be murdered remained in horror struck silence for minute two then slowly rose to foot let lay on bed said with assistance of three men lifted laid there have be stabbed murmured pointing to small cut in middle of deep stain just over heart ramoo after helping to lift squire onto bed have slid down to floor crouched there sobbing convulsively two servant stood helpless aghast mark looked round room window be open walked to garden ladder stood outside showing how assassin have obtained entrance mark stood rigid silent hand tightly clenched breath coming slowly heavily at last roused leave thing just a be said to men in tone of unnatural calmness fasten door up again turn table something of sort against on outside so that one can come in john do tell one of groom to saddle horse ride down into town let tell head constable to come up at once also dr holloway then be to go on to sir charles harris tell have happened beg to ride over at once come ramoo said in softer voice can do good here poor fellow room must be closed be heavy loss to too hindoo rose slowly tear streaming down face be good master said loved just a loved colonel sahib ramoo must have given life for with hand upon ramoo shoulder mark left room passed group of woman huddled together with blanched face at short distance down passage news that squire door must not be opened sound made by being broken in having called together mark must not speak silently shook head passed on a reached room heard shriek cry behind a men informed of what have taken place on reaching door one opposite opened mr cunningham in dressing gown came out what be matter mark be cry about dreadful thing have happened mr cunningham father have be murdered in night please tell millicent then closed door behind threw on bed burst into passion of tear squire have be good father to have made friend companion treatment rare indeed at time when few son must think of sitting down in father presence until told to do so since have left school eight year before have be very much together for last two three year mark have be good deal out in father have encouraged like to see make own friend mark go own way used to say be a bad for lad to be tied to father coattail a at mother apron string get fresh idea form own opinion will do for what public school must have done make reliant independent still of course great portion of time have be with father often must ride round estate together talk to tenant walk in garden forcing house generally mark must be driven by father to meet if took place within reasonable distance horse being sent on beforehand by groom while of evening must sit in library smoke long pipe talk over politics american french war be over there be one thing now that must do for father be to revenge death at thought rose from bed impatiently paced up down room must wait for week wait till funeral be over then must be on bastow track if other plan failed must spend time in coach until at last villain must try to stop one there must be other way must find other must apply for employment a bow street runner serve for year to find out method acquaint with place where criminal be harbored must be one object of life until succeeded in laying hand on bastow shoulder must not shoot if must help must prefer to see in dock to hear sentence passed on to see carried out a to treasure be not worth thought till first duty be discharged presently servant brought cup of tea drank mechanically then proceeded to dress sir charles harris must be here soon others indeed have scarcely finished when be told that doctor from reigate have just arrived that constable have come up hour before at once went down to library into doctor have be shown have heard have happened said a shook hand silently expect sir charles harris here in hour suppose will not go up till then think will be best that one must go in until come have be speaking to simeox be going in told thought be better to wait may a well take opportunity of going upstairs to see mr bastow hear that fainted when heard news that be completely prostrate two such shock might well prove fatal to mark said have be weak ailing for time two shock doctor repeated interrogatively ah forgot have not heard about affair yesterday evening man fired at through window when be sitting round fire before candle be lit ball passed between father head mr bastow have narrow escape bullet be imbedded in mantelpiece will have cut out may be useful item of evidence day what must have be man motive father be universally popular except with ill doer mark said ran out chased fellow for mile must have caught if have not have horse waiting for in lane got off by skin of teeth hope that next time meet will not be so lucky mr bastow be very much shaken went to bed soon afterwards be not surprised that second shock must be too much for will go up see will speak to simeox constable be out in garden be terrible business mr thorndyke suppose after what told have suspicion be not suspicion at be certainty did hear that tried to shoot father yesterday evening sir have heard nothing about mark repeated story of attempt pursuit must swear to ' mr thorndyke there be not much light left besides a have not seen for last eight year must certainly not be able to recognize unless have time to have good look at have only be last night affair might have be anyone shooting through window be not act of thief of assassin who must only have be influenced by private enmity quite see at present have legal evidence against bastow be not even in position to prove that be in country for can not be said that father belief that recognized voice of man who said betand deliver ' be proof doubt if anyone must swear that when only heard three word be absolutely sure that be voice of man have not seen for year however fortunately that will make difference man be a told wanted for heading mutiny in convict prison at sydney will be quite sufficient to hang without business own must prefer that be hung for father murder if must secure sufficient evidence moreover there be attack upon three four month ago with evidence of surgeon who attended a to wound must be enough to hang have first got to catch that mean to make business however long search may take be anything taken last night sir know did not look will see to when go upstairs may a well go indoors now sir charles may be here in few minute want to hear dr holloway report a to mr bastow doe not suspect hope sir thank god father never mentioned to anything heard about son suspicion therefore have reason to believe that fellow be not still in convict prison at sydney will keep from now whatever happens must for sake be best that shock must prove too much for have have very hard time of altogether be terribly prostrate doctor reported when mark joined think that will get over be scarcely conscious now see be old man have reserve of strength to fall back upon father have be good friend to that be not surprising news must have be too much for examined at squire request month ago a to heart action be so weak that told squire then that might go off at time rather wonder that recovered even temporarily from shock in few minute sir charles harris drove up be terrible news dear mark said a leaped from gig wrung mark hand terrible know when have have shock be noble fellow in respect warm friend excellent magistrate kind landlord good round can scarcely believe yet burglar of course suppose entered house for purpose of robbery when father awoke jumped out of bed there be tussle scoundrel killed at least be what gather from story that groom told that be near sir charles firmly believe that robbery be not object murder for murder be attempted yesterday evening informed magistrate of shot fired through window bless say so magistrate exclaimed that alters case altogether certainly must seem to make act one of premeditated murder yet surely squire must not have have enemy of men whom have sentenced may have felt grudge against surely not sufficient to lead to crime like will talk of with afterwards sir charles have very strongest suspicion although absolute proof now will first come upstairs doctor holloway be here simeox one have entered room since left thought better that must be left undisturbed until came quite so will go up at once examination of room showed nothing whatever must afford slightest clew squire watch be still in watch pocket at head of bed purse be on small table beside apparently nothing have be touched in room if robbery be object sir charles said gravely have evidently not be carried out be probable that mr thorndyke be partly woke by opening of window that be not thoroughly aroused until man be close to bed then leapt out seized probably stab be a dr holloway assures instantly fatal may have fallen so heavily that man fearing that house must be alarmed at sound at once fled without even waiting to snatch up purse whole thing be so clear that be scarcely necessary to ask further question of course there must be inquest tomorrow must like when go down to ask gardener where left ladder yesterday have examined ground for footmark yes sir charles see be pretty hard frost last night can not find mark at ground must have be like iron about time when ladder be placed there gardener on being called in said that ladder be always hung up outside shed at back of house there be chain round have found that morning that one of link have be filed through squire be most particular about being locked a mr mark know so that must not be used by ill disposed chap who might come along at night key of padlock be always hung on nail round other side of shed squire knew of so did mr mark so that while be out of way of eye of thief of must run get undo padlock in minute in case of fire anything of sort have not used ladder maybe for fortnight know that be hanging in place yesterday afternoon expect fellow be prowling about here for time mark said be chatting with father in library when thought heard noise threw open window have by carelessness be left little open went out listened for nearly hour must hear nothing put down to fact be nervous owing to what have happened early in evening that noise be simply fancy that frost have caused dry branch of one of shrub to crack how be did not notice window be open a went in curtain be drawn sir glanced at when went into room with father after being shot at once from outside be possible that might be again though own did not for moment think that fellow must return after hot chase gave suppose after went in looked about found ladder be likely enough that must have have file with in case have bar to cut through to get into house to mind be more likely that knew where to find ladder without looking for have hung there a long a can remember yes sir gardener said have worked for squire ever since came here ladder be bought week two after took on squire settled where must be hung so that might be handy in case of fire if wanted for painting job aint first ladder got new one four year ago be singular that man must have known be window of father room very singular mark said shortly after doctor left mark have long talk with magistrate in library told reason for suspecting that murderer be arthur bastow certainly look like magistrate said thoughtfully after have heard mark story though of course be only case of strong suspicion not of legal proof father recognition of voice must have scarcely be accepted a final when heard three word still whole thing hang together fellow be must say capable of anything know that ever have prisoner before whose demeanor be so offensive insolent if can be proved bastow be in england must certainly accept view of case must probably have known where ladder be to be found be window of father bedroom must certainly think that must know sir bedroom be same that grandfather used to sleep in probably during year before came here young bastow must have often be over house first year two after came be often up here with father know that father took objection to manner language be so offensive that must not have boy a be be only about eleven when came here associate with in smallest degree during two year may very well have noticed where ladder be do intend to say anything about tomorrow at inquest mark think will do so mark said moodily be certain of think man must convict without stronger evidence than must give however business in australia will be sufficient to hang think be right mark of course if do light upon evidence can bring matter up in court if not there will be occasion for to appear in at leave altogether for authority to prove sydney case against will only be necessary for constable who got up other case against to prove sentence for report of governor of jail to be read there will be no getting over will be hung a matter of course will be terrible thing for unhappy father think that be likely to come to know sir shock of affair yesterday that of morning have completely prostrated dr holloway who be up with before arrived think that there be very little chance of recovery when magistrate have left mark sent request to mr cunningham that must come down for few minute joined in drawing room thank for coming down said quietly wanted to ask how be how millicent be be terribly upset see squire be only father have ever known have be really so must not have be kinder be grievous loss to also after ten year of happiness here have have little time to think of own loss yet have be too occupied in soothing poor girl how be feeling mark understand said think that anyone must have loved father better than have done since broke down when first went to room seem to have inclination to give way to sorrow feel frozen up voice doe not sound to a if be own be able to discus matter a calmly a if be speaking of stranger one thing feel passionately anxious about be to set out on track of assassin there be nothing unusual in state of feeling mark thing a be like wound in battle shock be so great that for time numbs pain have heard husband say that soldier who have have arm carried off by cannon ball will fall from shock when recovers consciousness will be ignorant where have be hit be so with probably sense of pain loss will increase day a take in more more a for what say about murderer will undoubtedly be good thing for to have something to employ thought engage faculty a soon a be over be there anything can do thank inquest will be held tomorrow have sent down to chatterton to come up afternoon to make necessary preparation for funeral let see today be wednesday be not seem to have lost account of time yes wednesday then suppose funeral will be on monday tuesday if there be message that want sent down to town one of groom will carry whenever wish thank be not worth sending particularly time will do will want to send note to mr wilson presently asking to come up first thing tomorrow morning can take whenever like mr cunningham have nothing to send down for a far a know suppose have heard that doctor think very badly of mr bastow yes ramoo be sitting with now then think if will write note at once mr cunningham will send one down to dr holloway asking to send experienced nurse said must call again afternoon sooner nurse come better afternoon mark wrote letter to family solicitor telling of what have taken place stating that funeral must be on following tuesday asking to send down clerk with father will if one of partner must manage to come down must greatly prefer in view of explanation must be necessary have already sent off letter to head of detective department asking to send down one of best men a soon a possible then went out into garden walked backwards forward for about two hour then returned to what thought must be solitary meal mr cunningham however came down have thoughtfully have large dining table pushed on one side small one placed near fire thought must be more comfortable said a there be only two self just to sit here thanked with look be nice little dinner mark to surprise ate with appetite except cup of tea that have taken in morning glass of wine at midday have touched nothing mr cunningham be woman of great tact by making talk of step that intended to take to hunt down assassin kept from thinking thank very much mr cunningham said when dinner be over feel very much better have brought down work said will sit here while drink wine smoke pipe millicent have gone to bed completely worn out will be pleasanter for to sit here than to be alone mark gladly agreed to proposal turned conversation now to india talked of life there be not out there very long said be engaged to husband when first went out six year afterwards joined there be married uncle who be major of regiment gave away husband got company six month afterwards be killed three year later pension a widow be not large one when uncle offered charge of daughter be very glad to accept gave idea of plan for thought be very foolish when saw that mind be thoroughly made up did not attempt to dissuade said that when came home to england have idea when must be must have here a head of establishment must be given out that child be ward hoped that must alter mind later on a know never did well of course will have to be told now mark said do think so seems to that be better that must go a be at rate until be twenty one must be quite impossible mark said decidedly how must assume position of master here even if must must be strange thing indeed for to be here with girl age of cousin even with a chaperon must see that must be quite impossible how must live here by think must live here by mark said especially after what have happened of course have got to be talked over idea be that place have better be shut up that must take in own name house in london suppose will want master for harp so on for time at rate must be best plan unless must prefer other place to london have done best to carry out uncle wish circumstance have be too strong for can not be kept up longer there be reason if prefer why must not be known until return here by present name of course affair will create great deal of talk down here in london one will know millicent be heiress though be hardly likely that will make many acquaintance for time have known long mark thought that be kept in ignorance of only heard yesterday evening mr cunningham after shot through window father thought ought to know about for attempt might be repeated more successfully told about about treasure what treasure mr cunningham said know what mean then told of story uncle have related how have be prevented from giving full instruction for discovery only clew being gold coin word masulipatam that treasure have be left equally divided between millicent by will told that must provide for mr cunningham remarked when said that must be unfair that must be brought up believing heir never heard more about be glad that be so fancy chance of coming to of be very small mark said coin word be not much to go upon have not most remote idea what mean whether treasure be in england in india heaven only know possibly when made will may have told solicitor where be instructed to keep secret until time millicent came into possession of estate be just possible did so mr cunningham effort made to speak at last moment must almost seem to show that have not told for if have matter must have be of vital importance one way other will millicent be well enough to come down in morning hope so hope so too at rate keep up in room till afternoon inquest will be at eleven o'clock be better that must not come down until everyone have gone away chapter ix directly after breakfast be over next morning rector came in must not come in yesterday mark said knew that must be best alone indeed be so terribly upset by news did not feel equal to need not say how deeply wife sympathize with never did kinder heart beat than father never have seen people so universally grieved a be in village doubt whether man went to work yesterday a for woman have be father have lost must not be more affected yes will be greatly missed mark said unsteadily between ourselves must go further have suspicion amounting almost to certainty that hand dealt blow be same caused vacancy brought here do mean arthur bastow mr greg said in amazement why thought that be transported for fifteen year then mark told rector inner history of past six month of report have have from officer at bow street of personal appearance of wounded man other thing be in favor of went on father watch purse be untouched stranger on dark night must be hardly likely to have discovered ladder to have have file in pocket with to cut through link though might have be part of apparatus of burglar then again ordinary man must hardly have known be father bedroom except indeed that saw light there after in lady room be extinguished at rate must not have told be father be mine be a said mr greg quite between ourselves have long talk yesterday with sir charles harris a said there be legal proof strong a suspicion be so be going to say nothing on subject at inquest scoundrel poor father be dying happily in ignorance of dr holloway be up with night told morning before drove off that be very unlikely that will get through day be very terrible mark can not deny that everything point to man surely one else must have cut short so useful life for certainly ordinary degree of hatred must drive man however brutal nature to commit crime to run risk of hanging for let take brisk walk in garden for hour will be best thing for will stop with until inquest be over then have better come over have lunch with thank can not do so mark said though must like to in first place millicent will come downstairs afternoon must like to be in to meet have not be for might have come a can walk across field to rectory without passing through village there be reason sent up yesterday by coach letter to be delivered at once by hand expect detective down here by one o'clock know that will do good at same time will give something to do at present there be nothing dread so much a sitting alone fortunately yesterday evening millicent went to bed at five o'clock mr cunningham sat with evening talk did great deal of good inquest occupied very short time only point on many question be asked being a to firing through window mark stated that be already so dark that although be within fifty yard of man when mounted rode off must not give very distinct description of figure struck a being that of man of medium height have made out that bullet be intended for father can not say that sir went between head that of mr bastow might have be meant for be father impressed with idea that be attempt to murder naturally thought so mr bastow can assuredly have enemy while father a magistrate may have made certainly thought be attempt to murder be so impressed by fact that when went to library later on went into certain family matter with that have never communicated before have not be for must not have entered into for year to come have opinion then a to who be assailant have sir a be opinion although there be several fact seemed to justify conviction there be proof whatever therefore think justified in saying what that opinion be do entertain same opinion do mark said emphatically until can obtain evidence in support of what be really matter of opinion because be to give name must lessen chance of obtaining such evidence decline to mention name have doubt that author of second attempt be same a of first personally have doubt whatever stand to reason that be barely possible that two men must have unknown to other made up mind to murder father on same evening constable evidence added nothing to given by mark have be down to lane where man pursued have mounted rein of horse have apparently be thrown over gatepost thought have be standing there for little time for there be mark where have scraped ground repeatedly have followed mark of hoof for distance have gone at gallop for about mile then pace have slackened into trot continued until lane fell into main road beyond have be unable to distinguish from mark of traffic in general found footprint near foot of ladder anywhere else round house none sir there be sign of other window door save that of mr thorndyke room being attempted none at sir there be short consultation between juror who at once returned verdict of willful murder by person person unknown dr holloway have after giving evidence returned at once to mr bastow room only point of importance in evidence be statement that wound must have be fatal at once heart having be penetrated have be inflicted by dagger narrow bladed knife do mean that be unusually small dagger dr holloway must say be very fine dagger not sort of weapon that must expect to find highwayman carry if carried one at rather weapon of spanish italian manufacture not sort of wound that rapier must make yes wound might have be very well made by light rapier there be slight bruise on flesh on side of wound mark a might be made by handle guard of dagger sufficiently plain to leave doubt in mind that be so made have wound downward course be straight thrust straight thrust doctor replied idea be that two men be grappling together that a mr thorndyke be very powerful man assailant who probably be approaching bed with dagger in hand plunged into have struck at must certainly have expected course of wound to be downward a fancy man very seldom thrust straight with dagger a must do with rapier when inquest be over mark going out into hall found doctor waiting there for mr bastow breathed last ten minute ago saw when went up to just before gave evidence that be likely that must die before returned to room be very sorry mark said although expected nothing else from what told be very kind hearted man one must have have kinder more patient tutor than be to while father regarded a very dear valued friend be expecting undertaker here in few minute can be buried at same time be late in afternoon before millicent came down with mr cunningham news of mr bastow death have set tear flowing afresh have be very fond of that squire must have be taken at once seemed almost beyond belief have however nerved to degree of composure before went down to meet mark although returned pressure of hand be unable for time to speak mr cunningham thought best to speak first on minor grief so mr bastow have gone mark yes dr holloway thought very badly of yesterday said that have very faint hope of rallying can not help thinking that be best so of course be not very old man have for year be very feeble one now that millicent have given up study with think that must have felt that work be done must have gone downhill very fast think so too mr cunningham agreed be sure that even have squire death come quietly in course of nature must have be terrible blow to be fond of millicent affection for father be passion face always lit up when spoke to used to think sometimes that be like old dog with master be quite touching to see together think mark with that be best that must be a be gradually conversation turned to other matter millicent be however unable to take part in hour later held out hand silently to mark left room hurriedly next day be better be able to walk for time with mark in garden talk more calmly about mutual loss for to le than to mark squire have be father 't be strange to think that be squire now mark said a sat together in dining room on evening before funeral will think stranger still millicent said when tell that be not squire never will be looked up in face with wonder what do mean mark well dear will know tomorrow a mr prendergast one of family solicitor be coming down think be a well to tell beforehand have be curious position along never knew till father told when went into library after shot be fired news did not affect one way other although surprised great deal like have always supposed that be father ward daughter of old comrade of brother well be curious story millicent there be occasion for to look frightened fact be be uncle daughter cousin oh be not very dreadful exclaimed in tone of relief not dreadful at mark said see involves fact that be mistress of estate not millicent stood up suddenly with little cry mark can not be must be dreadful wo have nothing must make have what to take estate away from when have along supposed to be how must see never have be mine dear father might have lived five twenty year god know have never looked forward to succeeding sit down let tell story be not father fault that reigned here so long a master be result of whim of father although father fought against must not resist dying prayer of uncle then related whole circumstance under girl have be brought up a millicent conyers instead of millicent conyers thorndyke how estate have be left by colonel thorndyke will to brother until such time a millicent must come of age marry how have ordered that when event took place rest of property in money jewel be to be divided equally between mark must not be mark said firmly must take estate can divide rest between be rest to begin with mark said cheerfully there be pound accumulation of rent of estate after death of grandfather up to time when colonel returned from india there be besides few thousand though exactly know how many that father paid over to solicitor a surplus of rent of estate after paying expense of keeping up house very properly considered that although have accepted situation at father earnest wish ought not to make money by doing so if put down at pound altogether see there be pound for of very nice sum for young man to start life with especially a will have father estate near hastings brings in pound year a rent of have be accumulating for last ten year share will be raised from pound to pound besides there be main bulk of colonel fortune made in india seems to be worth about pound must own that chance of getting seems very small how be that mark mark told whole story mean to make business to follow matter up said think that chance of ever finding be very small still will give object to begin life with oh hope that will never find exclaimed from what say will be terrible danger if do get mark smiled hardly think so millicent can not believe that people must be following up thing for over fifteen year for be many year before colonel came home that got possession of diamond even hindoo must think have got sick of such hopeless affair long before a may ever since father death have be watching although hardly seems possible will follow out colonel instruction get rid of particular diamond at once will only keep about long enough to take to amsterdam sell there colonel said be finest diamond that ever saw that really have idea of what be worth however be for future mr cunningham have known along mark not about money affair of course knew that be cousin brought from india see have known along that colonel be father know family solicitor know believe one else except perhaps ramoo be not sure whether be in uncle service when be sent over in mr cunningham charge may know may not certainly one else doe except a say solicitor possibly other of colonel old comrade knew that there be child born if be in england happened to hear that father have succeeded to estate must of course suppose that child have died then millicent said in tone of relief there can be reason why anyone else must know anything about will see mr prendergast when come down tomorrow beg to say nothing about pound be quite enough for girl besides say that father greatest wish be be not to be married for money after pain have be taken wish will not be carried out if be to be made owner of estate wo be able to persuade mr prendergast to do mark said smiling be duty simply to carry out provision of father will to place in possession of estate if must keep silence certainly wo suppose must then will hate mark think will millicent must rather that did that than that must despise at present moment may think that estate must be only burden to day when marry might see matter in different light girl looked at reproachfully must never think so burst out what must have do live here in great house with only mr cunningham while be going about world seeking for treasure never think that must be nice for to do millicent mark said mr cunningham have be talking over thought that best plan must be for to take house in london go there with must have advantage of good master then be saying only short time since that must like to learn harp take lesson in painting there must be time enough to think about what must do with respect to house afterward be horrible millicent said bursting into tear will always feel have robbed feel so in least mark urged be not in smallest degree put out when father told about have always have fancy for wandering about world a uncle did doing something to distinguish instead of settling down for life to be country magistrate squire of course came a surprise can assure that be not altogether unpleasant one can man want more than nice little estate of pound year pound in money be very well to say a said to just now may see in different light day then sat thinking for time at rate went on at last see why anyone must know about now if house be to be shut up be going away why need anyone know anything about father wish be must not have people making love to just because be heiress after have be done must be wicked to go against wish suppose interest of pound must be enough for mr cunningham to live comfortably on in london yes mark said will at per cent bring in pound year then will remain millicent conyers to world there be nothing to prevent be there said almost defiantly no replied thoughtfully rent of estate might accumulate suppose solicitor must see after a will be away will of course make difference to be to stay in neighborhood must not consent to live a father did in false position even then might give out that property have only be left to father during lifetime that have now gone elsewhere without saying whom have gone to however a will be away there will be occasion even for when will be read there will be one present ourselves see why content must not be kept secret for time at rate can ask mr prendergast opinion upon subject at moment mr cunningham coming into room millicent ran to threw arm round neck have made most miserable said thought must not have be more miserable than be before told about knew that be going to do so be quite sure that must not be pleased at news have along thought that be mistake on part of father a be decision not mine only have to carry out wish be cruel millicent sobbed mean be cruel of father of course must not have known thought be doing best thing for happiness have turned out wrong for present may think so dear must remember that up to present time have turned out well know that uncle did not like at first think that passed ten happy year here gave great power for doing good worthily availed of have spent happy time be universally liked respected think of have benefited by must not have be half a pleasant if have be known that child be real owner of estate be acting merely a guardian let hope that everything will turn out a well in future colonel thorndyke told that have left considerable sum in addition to estate that be to be divided between mark so see cousin will not go out into world beggar be most of lost millicent said with hysterical laugh be hidden away one can find everything have gone wrong together well think dear that have better go up to bed will go with at present time of course have come upon a additional shock must gladly have shielded from for time if must have done so must have learned tomorrow quite agree with mark be be better that must tell evening sent down to town today to doctor asked to send up soothing draught thinking that might be upset by news hope by morning will be able to look at matter more calmly time later mr cunningham came down again have cried to sleep said be much grieved about money being lost be annoying still can not help thinking that colonel must have taken such precaution to prevent treasure from being lost one must certainly think so mr cunningham agreed colonel seemed to methodical man know that have reputation of being one of most particular men in service a to petty detail instruction to before left be very minute gave sealed packet told contained instruction copy of register of marriage of millicent birth said that in case of death be to take to father said that there be letter inclosed in to also copy of will letter be directed to father not to handed over to when asked to come here told afterwards that letter contained request that brother lived to make personally to that child must be brought up a ward that have handed certificate to lawyer who have however received copy of from colonel before went down to see father so a took precaution to insure wish being carried out in event of sudden death must think that must have done something of sort with regard to treasure must think that extremely likely mr cunningham certainly have not thought of before hope that for millicent sake own may turn out to be so can get on extremely well without at same time pretend that pound be to be despised next morning mr prendergast who have arrived at reigate late evening before have put up at inn came up to house hour before time named for funeral learned from mark that have already acquainted millicent with change of circumstance few minute after arrived servant told that miss conyers must be glad if must see alone for few minute in drawing room mark have already prepared for request mark have told that told about hateful thing last night suppose mr prendergast have old lawyer said kindly tell also that be not at pleased at news pleased must think not mr prendergast said indignantly be not going to rob cousin of what have always be taught to think a inheritance be abominable call most unnatural dear young lady be yours not wish to discus whether arrangement be altogether wise one think that so far have turned out well for party estate have profited greatly by management of uncle tenant connected with have benefited greatly have have active employment afforded of be fond cousin have believe enjoyed advantage of position have become acquainted with best people in part of country will now obtain benefit of something like pound comfortable little sum especially a inherits believe father property in sussex will have obtained what can not consider advantage of having be brought up without knowing that be heiress therefore without being spoiled be in opinion case with many young lady in such condition therefore can not think that if unwise in conception matter have so far worked out well be bound to say that mr mark thorndyke have be speaking to very handsomely on subject that appears in way disappointed at finding that be heiress of estate be really concerned only at unwillingness to accept situation wanted to know mr prendergast said in tone showed be convinced by manner that request must be refused if must arrange so that thing must not be disturbed must come into possession a father heir in natural way see be not father heir miss thorndyke father only have use a call of property until came of age marriage be not necessary for to come to on coming of age only a father explained to in event of marriage be to say be not to become public that be entitled to estate until marriage if married before be twenty one property be then to come to if did not be to be informed of circumstance not a mr thorndyke might decide be best be not to come into property until married cousin be also to be informed when came to age of twenty one a at time be to take half share of remainder of property must then be able to arrange life a liked if uncle died a unfortunately have done before reached age of twenty one must then be placed in proper position father desired to say to that be wish that if must be arranged having succeeded to ownership must not be publicly known until divulged to husband after marriage other portion of will must be carried out being only request be at liberty to follow not a may choose certainly must choose girl said after trouble to prevent being run after a heiress must be wicked to upset to fly in face of wish by setting up a mistress of estate still understand mr prendergast mean to take lawyer smiled indulgently there be one way in might be managed said perhaps can guess what be flush of color rose over girl face say beg of mr prendergast mr cunningham hinted at morning told that own wish entirely agreed with of father be determined not to be married for money be quite sure that mark must be a unwilling a be that estate must change hand in way mr prendergast must find other way of doing than surely estate can not be forced upon anyone who be determined not to take well must think over mr prendergast said quietly now think that be time for to join others chapter x funeral of squire thorndyke mr bastow be over agreed have never seen more affecting spectacle than at churchyard when two coffin be brought in distance be short tenant have requested leave to carry squire bier while of mr bastow be borne by villager who have known loved behind followed magistrate great number of gentry for mile round churchyard be crowded by man woman child in village woman a well a many of men wept unrestrainedly a coffin passed by besides large

by side of father mr bastow in spot where many of predecessor have slept before mark have be greatly affected not only by own loss by sight of general grief among for whom squire have done so much even mr prendergast who have taken part in many such function over departed client be much moved by scene have be at many funeral said to mark a walked back to hall never have be at one so affected monument ever raised sir did such credit to who be laid beneath a tear of simple villager mark did not reply heart be altogether too full to speak a entered house said lady will have lunch upstairs mr prendergast may a well have ours at once then can call down if there be business to be done will not take long lawyer said have brought down will of uncle colonel father think that must be a well for to read that of father be very short simple document extending indeed only over few line uncle be longer more complicated a be well aware of gist of will take short time to get through took meal in perfunctory manner for must have eaten nothing made effort to do so in order to keep guest company when be over said may a well go into library at once will send up for lady be a well to lose time for know that want to catch afternoon coach up to town mr cunningham millicent joined in minute two girl looking very pale in deep mourning be about mr prendergast said quietly to read will of colonel thorndyke mr john thorndyke will ask if there be phrase that understand to stop will explain to purport three person present be acquainted with main provision of colonel will began by stating that being determined that daughter millicent conyers thorndyke must not be married for money hereby bequeathed to brother john thorndyke estate in parish of crowswood to be held by until daughter millicent came to age of twenty one be married if marriage did not take place until be over age of twenty one so long be to continue in john thorndyke possession save except be on attaining age of

between daughter millicent conyers thorndyke nephew mark thorndyke must however daughter die before marriage bequeath said estate in parish of crowswood to brother john thorndyke for life after to son mark to latter whole of other property of kind to take effect on death of daughter must brother predecease marriage coming of age of daughter be at once to come into possession of said estate of crowswood in case nephew mark mr james prendergast of firm of hopwood prendergast solicitor be to act a trustee mr jane cunningham said james prendergast a guardian be of course expressed in usual legal language purport be clear to previously acquainted with bearing only item be new to being legacy to mr cunningham john thorndyke testament be short one left property to son mark with exception of hundred pound to niece to buy mourning ring brooch other ornament in memory of fifty pound to mr cunningham for similar purpose a token of great esteem for character pound to ramoo for faithful service to brother when lawyer have folded up will millicent said on part have to say that absolutely renounce legacy of estate in favor of cousin mark who have always believed that must be a absolutely refuse to accept sacrifice mark said dear young lady mr prendergast said quietly at present at rate have power to take action in matter be in eye of law infant until come of age have power to execute legal document therefore must perforce remain mistress of estate until attain age of twenty one many thing may happen before time for example might marry in case husband must have voice in matter might die in case mr mark thorndyke must without effort on part come into possession of estate at rate until reach age of twenty one trustee will collect rent of estate on behalf will hold monies in trust for making of course such payment for support maintenance a be fit proper for condition tear came into millicent eye a resumed seat from have risen did not utter word until mr prendergast rose to leave will doubtless learn wish a to future miss thorndyke from cousin said hope that will not cherish malice against that when think over will come to conclusion that second thought be sometimes wisest also that must have consideration for father wish in matter of kind worked hard risked life to build up fortune that have left evidently thought greatly of welfare be above thing anxious to insure happiness be sure that on thinking over will see that must not thwart wish dear boy said to mark a stood on doorstep waiting for carriage to come round best plan by far in business must be for interest of cousin to be identical be very charming young lady little headstrong in matter perhaps think that be altogether unnatural that might have come about if have not be for property mr prendergast mark said can not be now if have be engaged before happened case must have be different see that now lip be sealed for must seem a if have not cared for until turned out to be heiress be silly young couple lawyer said can only hope that a grow older will grow wiser well have better come up have talk with about asset uncle mention in will then know anything about sir nothing at except a to accumulation in absence mentioned vaguely that be wealthy man thought that a matter of course have told brother about be curious business sir doubt if there will ever be anything besides accumulation speak of bless say so well well always thought that be most foolish business ever heard of however will tell about when come up will miss coach unless start so saying shook mark hand took place in gig be driven away millicent did not come downstairs again that day be thoroughly upset mr cunningham said must be best to let have own way for time think sooner can get away from here better house be full of sad memory feel shaken in need of change can quite understand feeling yours mr cunningham do hope will be able to disabuse mind of idea have shadow of feeling of regret that instead of have estate please try to work upon on ground of father wish must see that face changed when mr prendergast put matter in light think have occurred to before be thinking of going up to town in couple of day be thinking of doing so tomorrow day so will make difference propose that go with that then help look for house even if get one at once week in london will be change can then if like go somewhere for time of course bath must be too gay at present might go to tunbridge well if must like seaside place a have never be near sea since be baby must be greatest change for might go down for month two to dover hastings there be occasion for to settle down in london for time there be weymouth too if must like better believe that be cheerful place without being too fashionable think will be excellent plan mr cunningham said if like will drive up to town luggage can go by carrier be more pleasant than being shut up in coach much more cheerful of course will of course leave many of thing here packing up will give something to do prevent from brooding think be excellent idea mark late in afternoon ramoo came in in usual silent manner man have said little during past few day be evident that be grieving deeply looked year older than have done before fatal night of course ramoo will stay with for present hardly know what will be doing for time be sure that until settle down miss conyers will be very glad to have with sahib ramoo will return home to india ramoo be getting old be thirty when entered service of colonel sahib be fifty now will go home to end day have saved enough to live in comfort with what lawyer sahib told father have left will be rich man among own people will find thing changed ramoo since left while here know regard a friend rather than a servant be very kind good sahib ramoo know that will meet friend like have here longs for bright sun blue sky of india though will well nigh break heart to leave young missie feel that must go right ramoo will be very sorry to lose understand longing to go home know that always feel cold winter very trying therefore will not oppose wish will be going up to town in two three day will arrange to pay legacy at once will inquire what vessel be sailing millicent be unfeignedly sorry when heard of ramoo determination be very fond of for when a child first arrived at crowswood have be companion whenever squire did not require service must accompany about garden ground listening to prattle carrying on shoulder obeying behest doubt knew that be daughter of former master have to certain extent transferred allegiance from sahib whose life have several time saved to little daughter still agreed with mark that be perhaps best that must go mr cunningham must find little occasion for service when established in london swarthy complexion semi eastern costume must attract attention perhaps trouble when went abroad population being le accustomed to oriental then than at present still le must know what to do with be for time to wander about mark said at once so long a be engaged in task that have set must not take ramoo with a for staying alone in house when be only in charge of caretaker be not to be thought of although not inclined at present time to agree with mark in anything millicent must not acknowledge that be best that ramoo must not be urged further to reconsider determination also fell in with proposal that must go up to london for week then go down to weymouth for time after must be guided by circumstance accordingly two day later mark drove millicent mr cunningham up to london groom accompanied on mark favorite horse be to be left in town for use groom be to drive carriage back again comfortable room be obtained in quiet inn for lady while mark put up at bull saying that must come day to take out why did not mark stay here mr cunningham millicent asked pettishly suppose thought better that must not do so own think be right when be a supposed relation to other millicent said must be like brother sister now that find that be cousin be going to be stiff ceremonious not necessarily because be cousin millicent before be father ward under father care now be young lady on own account must see that position be changed greatly that what be quite right proper before must not be at right proper now millicent shrugged shoulder oh if mark wish to be distant stiff can certainly do so if like make matter to be not at fair millicent very unlike have not mark suggested going to inn must have suggested oh yes doubt be better millicent said carelessly have several friend in town of course can not expect to be devoting to mr cunningham raised eyebrow slightly made answer millicent be seldom wayward at present thing have gone very hardly with friend felt that must be better to leave entirely to herself until humor changed in morning when mark came round millicent announced that felt tired with drive of previous day must prefer staying indoors mark looked little surprised more at tone than at substance of word for manner in spoke showed that excuse have given be not only reason for not going out of course will stay at home too mr cunningham said quietly a glanced toward inquiringly millicent be unnerved shaken perhaps be just a well for to have day complete rest very well mr cunningham then will a can not be of use to set about own business for day have already be round to lawyer have got check for ramoo legacy will be up afternoon will go round to leadenhall street find out what ship be sailing when start will come in evening for chat millicent sat without speaking for minute after have left room mr cunningham whose hand be always busy took work out of bag set to work at industriously presently girl said what business be that mark be going to occupy in know much about replied from few word let drop believe that intends to devote to discovering hunting down uncle murderer listless expression faded out at once of millicent face surely mr cunningham will be very dangerous work doubt will be dangerous work think that be likely to hinder mark man whoever may be be of course desperate character not likely to be captured without making fierce struggle for then ought to put matter in hand of proper authority millicent said decidedly of course such men be dangerous very likely man may have accomplice be not against one only that mark will have to fight have no right to risk life in so desperate adventure mr cunningham smiled quietly over work squire have often confided to how glad must be if two must day come together in case disclosure after marriage of real fact of case must cause disturbance difficulty estate must be theirs must not matter have brought into partnership have thoroughly agreed with so far nothing have occurred to give ground for belief that hope must be fulfilled till within last year millicent have be little more than child have looked up to mark a might have done to big brother a something most admirable a one whose dictum be law during last year there have be slight change more perhaps on mark part than on hers have consulted wish more have asked instead of ordered have begun to treat a if conscious that be fast growing up into womanhood millicent scarcely seemed to have noticed change be little more inclined to assert than before be ready to accompany whenever wished to do so to see go away without complaint when so pleased last week have made rapid change in position millicent have sprung almost at bound into young woman have come to think resolve for be becoming wayward fanciful no longer deferred to mark opinion held own be capable of being vexed at decision at rate relation with mark have changed rapidly mr cunningham considered little outburst of pettishness to be good omen for hope very much better than if have continued on old footing of affectionate cousin mark went back again to lawyer have long talk with mr prendergast over lost treasure old lawyer scoffed at idea that there must be danger associated with bracelet men in india suppose get fanciful said imbibe of native superstition soldier who got from man who stole be stabbed might have be stabbed for thousand reason have bracelet on mind be forever hiding digging up fancying that someone be on track put down attack a being made by someone connected with manner impressed uncle concealed diamond sent off somewhere instantly never have further trouble about like many men who have craze fancied that be being perpetually watched followed unfortunate result of be that jewel money that accumulated during service in india seem to be lost more stupid affair never heard of now a to clew reasonable man must have given full instruction a to how treasure be to be found if did not do must at least instead of carrying about absurd coin scrap of paper with name upon have written instruction put in ridiculous hiding place more wisely still must have instructed solicitor fully on subject amount of trouble given by men otherwise perfectly sane by crank fancy be astonishing here be something like pound lost owing to superstitious whim a to chance of finding treasure regard a small indeed thing be hidden in india in old tomb other rubbishing place uncle may have committed to charge of native may have sent to banker at one of great town may have shipped to england may have sent to north pole for anything know how can one begin to search universe thought sir that perhaps might have sent to london bank agent with instruction to hold until claimed by that perhaps inquiry among such house must lead to discovery that hold certain property forwarded by well there be sense in suggestion prendergast grumbled suppose first thing to be done will be to carry out if wish will do for must be more likely to give information if posse to well known firm of solicitor like ourselves than to private individual besides if be to go must in case want to be identified before must answer question whereas must write note to in firm name with compliment saying that must be glad to know if late colonel thorndyke of whose will be executor have account at firm have deposited property in hand there be not above five six bank doing business with india a many agent in large way of business if did foolish thing must be certain to do with house of good standing if indeed anything can be taken a certain in case of gentleman with such extraordinary fancy plan a thank mr prendergast mark said with slight smile at lawyer irritability will be clearing ground to certain extent if doe not succeed think will go to india will there make similar inquiry at principal establishment at calcutta madras must fail there seems to that only remaining plan will be to find out from military authority place where uncle regiment be encamped on day have date on jewel be given to to institute minute search of old ruin within distance a might have reached within day ride have certainty that be ruin might have dug hole under tent have buried thing there might have taken shovel buried in clump of bush quarter of mile away thing be more more ridiculous more look at see be very difficult sir one might narrow down somewhat if one discovered spot probably there be still native officer in regiment who be there at time if so might possibly know who be uncle servant at time man may be pensioner in case might discover address through military authority must find out from whether uncle often rode out at night what be habit possibly where tent stood so on well mr prendergast said if like to undertake wild goose chase of sort be business not mine consider idea be most utopian that ever heard of a to where tent stood be likely that man must remember to within hundred yard where tent stood fourteen year ago why might dig up acre acre of ground not be sure then that have hit upon right place there be one other circumstance mr prendergast mark said quietly have to be taken into consideration render improbable that diamond be hidden anywhere by uncle at time certainly spoke of whole of treasure collectively be morally certain that must not carry jewel that have be collecting about with certainly not treasure in money must therefore have sent diamond to person whoever may be who have keeping of other jewel of money certainly point to bank there be sensible conjecture yes there be something in certainly must not have carried about pound in gold a much in jewelry must have be act of madman colonel thorndyke although eccentric cranky be not mad on other hand may have carried about banker passbook what be equivalent to for amount have be deposited with native banker agent together with receipt for box containing jewel might have hidden with diamond think that must have done that there must have be object for putting power of demanding money valuable out of possession well well lawyer said testily be of use arguing now what might might not have done man who must have taken trouble that did to prevent daughter knowing that be heiress fancied that be followed about by black fellow might do anything reasonable unreasonable under sun at rate mr thorndyke will carry out instruction a to inquiry in london will duly inform of result beyond must really decline to give advice opinion upon matter be altogether beyond on leaving lawyer mark went to bow street related to chief circumstance attending father murder have heard from man sent down at request mr thorndyke taking attempt early in evening subsequent murder there can be doubt that affair be one of revenge not of robbery have second attempt stood alone robbery might have be object mere fact that nothing be stolen in way alters case men be often seized with certain panic after committing murder fly at once without attempting to carry out original purpose father doubt fell heavily man might well have feared that fall must be heard previous attempt precludes supposition that robbery be at bottom of point to case of revenge certainly go very long way to support theory that talked over when last saw that highwayman who endeavored to stop on road whom wounded who afterwards went down to southampton be escaped convict bastow since time have have man making inquiry along road between reigate kingston altogether without success must be glad to follow up other line that might suggest might offer reasonable possibility of success must own at present be entirely off scent be thinking of devoting entirely to quest have occupation at present have income amply sufficient for want for expense may incur intend to devote if necessary year of life to hunting man down a men have searched without success in country think for present best plan will be to devote to learning something of way haunt of criminal class of london be with object have come to now must like for time at rate to enter detective force a enrolled member must of course require pay must be prepared to obey order to do work required a other member of corp must do be strong active have hope fair share of intelligence must not mind risking life in carrying out duty that might assign to presume need not always be on duty must when not required employ time a liked keep up acquaintance in town must be otherwise however be perfectly ready to submit in respect to rule have first rate horse must be available for country duty wherever might think fit to send must not desire distinction to be made between paid officer proposal be altogether novel one mr thorndyke be worthy of consideration have doubt that must make very useful officer work be certainly interesting though not without serious hazard however will think matter over if will call in tomorrow will have answer be always glad to have new hand in force for face of men be so well known among criminal class that be liable to be detected even under cleverest disguise there be work too upon be absolutely necessary that gentleman must be employed in event of joining must wish to keep matter strictly from acquaintance must certainly be advantageous that must when disengaged continue to mix with friend to mingle in society of kind a freely a possible there be crime among upper class a well a among lower though of different type a mr thorndyke of crowswood must have far better opportunity of investigating of case than of men must have must not object to take up such case not at sir be if must be arranged must not do actual work of making arrest have to appear in court a witness must be managed chief said when have got to certain point matter of final arrest must always be handed over to someone else a rule keep officer in background a much a possible because at trial court be half full of men of criminal class face of men must soon be known to one of well if will call about ten o'clock tomorrow will have answer must advise to think matter well over before see again responsibility a well a danger be great indeed in of work must literally have to carry life in hand can assure that task must undertake be by mean light one chapter xi mark called evening a have promised upon mr cunningham hope that feel better for day rest millicent said girl looked quickly at to see if there be sarcasm in question be evident that inquiry be made in earnest yes feel better now said have dozed good deal today did not feel up to anything mr cunningham work have progressed wonderfully must say that have done more today than ordinarily find time to do in week what have be doing with have be having long talk with mr prendergast about lost treasure of course said that must never find mark well yes distinctly expressed that opinion afterwards afterwards went to bow street have long talk also with chief officer there like idea of searching for man mark in first place see why must hope to succeed when men whose business be to do such work have failed in next place think that may get into serious danger must risk millicent have already proved better shot than be be quite ready to take chance if can come upon be difficult part of matter know that will need patience have plenty of time before have great hope that will run to earth at last must not know if saw think must mark said quietly at least if be man suspect then do suspect someone mr cunningham said laying down work yes know of reason why must not know now suspect indeed feel morally certain that man who murdered father be arthur bastow exclamation of surprise broke from hearer listened with horror while detailed various ground that have for suspicion be silent for time after have brought narrative to conclusion then mr cunningham said what merciful release for mr bastow that must have died before terrible thing came out for after what have told can hardly doubt that be right that be wicked man who be guilty yes be indeed providential mark said though think feeble a have be for month might have be kept from still word from chance visitor who did not associate bastow murderer with dear old friend might have enlightened blow must have be terrible one indeed be true that a be died from shock did not know hand struck blow now that have told millicent said can not blame mark for determining to hunt man down seems even worse than did before be awful to think that anyone must cherish revenge like now tell how be going to set about have promised chief officer will tell absolutely one said have plan believe that in time must be successful know well enough must tell of without fear of going further asked to promise did so without reservation moreover think that for reason be a well that even must not know a be be aware that be going to try be if be to tell how might be picturing sort of imaginary danger worrying over so think that will be much best that must remain in ignorance at rate for time can say will for present remain principally in london think that be more likely to come upon clew here than elsewhere millicent pouted mr cunningham said think perhaps that be right mark be better that must know nothing about will know that be looking for clew of course danger can arise until obtain attempt to arrest feel sure that will hing rash especially a if harm befell might escape unpunished therefore that when time come to seize will obtain such help a may be necessary will if possible arrest at moment when resistance be impossible thank mr cunningham will certainly spare effort in taking way must far rather met fate on gibbet than by bullet from pistol agree with mark millicent said even hanging be too

get to detect almost of see there be three method of cheating first by hidden card second by marked card third simply by sleight of hand being generally used in connection with marked card trick require great skill extreme delicacy of touch for mark be generally at edge of card be so slight a to be altogether imperceptible save to trained hand there be also mark on back of card be done in printing be so slight that unless attention be attracted to one must dream of existence in course of week practice mark learned where to look for cheating must not indeed follow finger of instructor for even when knew what be going to be done movement be so rapid that eye must not follow in nine case out of ten be unable to say whether coup have be accomplished not must see that there be slight

pistol out of window will rush in seize engaged in row march to lock up of course will have to be included mark then went to chetwynd well what did think of last night well own went against grain to see that young fellow being victimized by sharper dear mark must not use such language a fancy from what have heard that honorable john be not altogether estimable character to call sharper be going too far altogether think that be for from what saw last night be pretty well convinced that did not play fair mean to go again tonight why on earth must mix up in such affair mark be business of yours be not habitue of place above be extremely unlikely that be right there be shady people there doubt there be also good many gentleman present a know nothing of card a far a know be most unlikely thing in world that must find out that emerson cheated when one else noticed be business be duty of honest man to see that poor lad like must not be eaten up by shark like emerson care if there be shindy over will not interfere unless can prove that man be cheating in case man of honor must go out with will be glad if boldero must go with again evening be not known there be to good many men boldero to many more only want that if get into row must testify to fact that be gentleman ordinarily sane if there be row will have opportunity of seeing how much have benefited by lesson yes heard be making tremendous progress jack needham told month ago that have knocked out of time went into gibbon yesterday morning with man who wanted to buy dog told that considered that be great misfortune that be amateur for only required six month practice must then be ready to back for hundred pound against man in ring about affair mark be really in earnest be dick thoroughly in earnest so must be if have spoken to cotter last night a did tell that if have not given little hope that thing might come out right must have blown out brain today well mark if have set mind on of course will stick to though have doubt whether cotter have brain to speak of to blow out else must not be mad enough to back against emerson other men whom boldero tell have be playing with have made as of doubt dick fancy good many fellow do at one time other of life though not grant always in same way well will go mark need not ask boldero for told that must look in again at ten o'clock evening for thought that night play must probably bring cotter to end of tether accordingly little before ten walked into gambling house together now dick want a soon a sit down to take place in front line within yard two of emerson want to be just behind short distance away want to keep eye upon sir james flash who if be not mistaken will take up same position that did last night near enough to cotter to see hand will remark have doubt a did last night whenever cotter have bad hand flash will close eye put hand up to mouth stroke mustache make sign of sort when cotter have good hand will stand perfectly still look about room at rate will make sign that of course be guide to emerson whether to propose to refuse to allow cotter to do so need not point out to what tremendous advantage knowledge whether opponent hand be good not give of course while watching hour play can only know flash be making sign when did so cotter hand be bad one be possible that manner in sign be made either by closing eye twisting mustache so on may have be intimation a to suit in cotter be strongest weakest by jove be serious thing mark be serious thing want to get into row with fellow must like to give nod when have satisfied be not mistaken will take upon to denounce fellow to say what noticed yesterday can back up by saying that saw same thing have doubt that will be able to convince decent man there that charge be well founded be going to watch emerson with help get from flash wo risk anything by cheating until come to big stake like last game yesterday in case if cotter hand happens to be strong one be likely to do so fancy if doe will be able to catch at have better keep boldero near can whisper to what be watching flash for get to do so too a if catch emerson cheating there be likely to be row can lend hand if necessary at rate joining in with will suffice to show friend that thing be genuine all right mark be interested in matter now be ready for anything soon after ten cotter emerson again sat down a

a iou be worthless for be obtained from by cheating therefore have demand to make upon purse police will have doubt endeavor to keep thing quiet name may come out must be far better that father must

better told by will do sir a say lesson have be heavy one henceforth father will have reason to complain of may call see tomorrow evening certainly will be at home from seven to eight after hour have engagement good night cotter walked on mark fell back joined dick boldero who have fallen behind when saw speaking to cotter well mark congratulate dick chetwynd said did wonderfully though how on earth knew that fellow have card in hand be more than can guess felt sure be going to cheat mark said quietly saw that cotter hand be very strong one knew that emerson must be aware that be so because must receive signal from flash therefore be time if that must cheat have be playing with hand upon table saw withdraw one there be little pause then came up again have not doubt in world that there be card in that have be hidden somewhere in breech be one of best place of concealment for hand being under table while getting at card one present who be not behind scene a be must detect doing wonder to be boldero said that while there be number of men looking on closely for emerson have long be suspected of not playing fair just fresh from country if may say so must have spotted be easily explained mark said not wishing to fall victim have of late be put up to great many of sharper trick by man who at one time have be in trade be capital idea mark dick said wish must introduce to wo do dick will be very glad to teach know about fancy after will be in great hurry to enter gambling hell again be so mark have never have great inclination for play after may be quite sure will light shy of card altogether still will be glad if will put up to of trick for may be able to day save victim of card sharper a have done evening next morning when who have be present at scene of previous evening arrived at office of detective in bow street be shown into private room asked to wait cotter mark two friend first have interview with chief will understand latter said that be altogether informal affair propose first tell story a briefly a possible be done now mr cotter take that wish to prosecute certainly not must in fact give anything rather than appear in have said that in addition to iou that have given to two men caught cheating hold others to amount of five six thousand pound given by to three other frequenter of club in fact paper have be found in emerson pocketbook told believe that have taken up so that must not be inconvenienced by understand then that will be quite content if get iou back again given to emerson flash be of course worthless after what have happened must not be presented probably might have trouble about others for though have doubt that whole of men be in league together have mean of absolutely proving will be more than content sir have wish to prosecute be glad chief said to be able to close dangerous place a exposure will put stop to career of two men doubt alarm good many others care about taking matter into court such gross scandal a be best kept quiet when there be object in ventilating therefore gentleman a mr cotter be willing to do so will let matter drop will be obliged if will step into next room however until have seen three men when have left three be brought in have be concerned sir chief said sternly in winning large sum of money from hon william denton from mr james carew from mr william hobson others in of case two men caught cheating last night be also concerned hold note of hand of mr hobson will advise gentleman father to refuse to pay note promise that if further request for payment be made will furnish with such particular for publication a will more than justify in eye of world in refusing to honor a well a mr emerson sir james flash have won large sum from mr cotter fact that iou gave be found on mr emerson point very strongly to being in confederacy with in matter at rate point so strongly that whether jury must convict not on evidence that will be able to lay before there can be question whatever a to what opinion of men of honor will be iou be in hand mr cotter doe not desire to pursue case will however refuse absolutely to pay iou in doing so will have approval of honorable men that being so iou be absolutely useless to if will agree to tearing up now have most kindly consented to let matter drop in case three men who have turned very white when be speaking now protested angrily against imputation being made on honor well sir officer said in case matter can of course go on know best what feeling will be a to iou will form important item of evidence against will see a matter stand gave to emerson to collect for without money passing between very strange procedure will find difficult to explain else gave coin for passed over to have therefore parted with claim on mr cotter on own account of course impound with other iou a proof of conspiracy between now sir be to tear up not three men looked at other then one of said protest altogether against assertion sir at same time a there can be little doubt that emerson sir james flash have played unfairly wish association of name with theirs be perfectly willing that iou under circumstance must never have dreamt of presenting must be destroyed think that have chosen wisely chief said dryly be pity that did not do so at first be iou gave to one other of perhaps must be pleasanter for to destroy yourselves three men took paper with name on tore up thank went on sarcastically will place in better position will be able to tell friend that felt so indignant at manner in mr cotter have be swindled by emerson flash that at once destroyed iou for sum that have won of gentleman spoke sternly now remember that have long list against that next victim let say father might be more disposed to push matter to full length than be mr cotter remember also that keep ourselves acquainted with what be going on must trouble arise will produce complaint have be made against will also mention connection with affair in a understand did best to prevent two fellow from being searched without saying word three men went out of room too crestfallen to make even attempt at keeping up air of indignation others be then called in be sorry gentleman said that have have trouble of coming here for gentleman swindled have declined to prosecute swindler will understand that be somewhat anxious that name must not appear in matter fortunately a instead of paying in cash gave iou for loss will not be loser to large amount by transaction may say that proprietor of hell have be there morning to avoid trouble have consented to close place for good have only to remark must advise gentleman in future only to indulge in gambling in place where may be fairly assured of character of men play with think in conclusion that may feel grateful to mr cotter for refusing to prosecute have saved from having to appear in court a witness in so utterly disreputable affair there be general murmur of assent in minute two room be clear flash emerson be then brought in with constable on side of mr cotter have regret to say declined to prosecute mr thorndyke have done same with regard to sir james flash use of pistol have therefore escaped punishment due to swindler at card be le matter a be not likely to have opportunity of making fresh victim for story will be known by afternoon in club in london iou will be of use to be not worth paper on be written however will take upon to hand back to mr cotter to prevent possibility of getting into other hand giving trouble can unlock handcuff constable men be at liberty to go if will take advice will lose time in crossing water establishing somewhere where talent be likely to be better appreciated than be here can go one of can call hackney coach for if wish will scarcely care to walk with garment in present condition then chief went into next room there be end of affair mr cotter here be iou gave to two swindler gave to other three men who be doubt confederate have be torn up by in presence declare that after seeing how shamefully have be victimized have not slightest idea of ever presenting be sure that be extremely grateful to cotter said know have behaved like

said that have be drawing on to find out what be up to have agreed to join of course with intention of getting caught in act two got up said that knew a one of runner agreed that must be put out of way suppose a landlord did not want blood spilt in house did not knife at once however told that have decided that a soon a coast be clear must be carried down to river chucked in with old anchor tied to neck have just gleam of hope short time before came in for then have be settled that be just a well no more must be engaged in affair than be necessary black jim with two others whom have be talking to two men who have told be runner must manage rest be to go off to home have be time trying to loosen rope have got one of hand nearly free thought that if waited half hour might have got free be able to make bit of fight of though have very little hope of getting leg free however have eye on knife of man who be sitting next to who be one of who be to stay thought that if have hand

at once turn in said straining at cord have taken skin off wrist feel stiff over will be day two gibbon before be able to put glove on again wish must find that lascar owe heavy debt a mark made way home thought good deal about colored sailor if man have be in den ruffian must hardly have ventured to have attacked in presence of stranger of course might have be passing have seen fray through window in case must run to nearest constable how must know anything about habit why must have gone to gibbon for assistance fact that have so often observed lascar in place have gone to certainly looked a if have be watched if so must only be connected with diamond be curious thing altogether next morning went early to bow street a soon a chief came related event of previous evening told that be flash emerson who have denounced know place officer said be one of worst thief den in london however be just a well decided not to take step of course fellow must have sworn that did not intend to do harm that flash have put up to frightening doubt whether jury must have convicted a to other men know that be thief of worse mere fact that proposed to to join in crime wo do a actual crime be committed however will have gang closely watched at rate have better leave westminster alone someone else must take up work of looking for man be on watch for anyhow have best take week rest there be doubt have have very narrow escape be strange about lascar might not have cared for going in to take part in fray must have thought that must have waited outside to get reward for bringing men to rescue a mark did not care to tell about diamond till time came for getting made reply beyond expressing agreement with chief surprise at man not having remained to end of fray on leaving bow street went up to ingleston men who have rescued night before be gathered there presented of with check for twenty five guinea know very well said that have thought of reward when hurried down to save be reason why must not show gratitude to for service have rendered of might very well have be seriously hurt if not killed by knife at rate insist upon taking money be always useful know be not often so well earned a men be greatly pleased tring said well sir if get into scrape may be sure that can count upon will try not get into more mark laughed have be good deal more serious than have bargained for will be very careful in future chapter xv burglary season seems to have recommenced in earnest mark chief said nine month after have be at work for time there have be lull a know have have three report week strike that be by same hand a before of course may be mistaken be done in similar way only difference being that there be ground for believing that only one man be engaged in fancy fellow that be after have either be away from london for time have be keeping very quiet at rate have ground for believing that keep aloof from london thief be what must expect from such man if one have nerve enough to do there be nothing like working singly when two three men be engaged there be always risk of one being caught turning queen evidence of there being quarrel of peaching from revenge if man have be away from town have certainly not be working one district of course one get usual number of report from different quarter although burglary be frequent enough there have be complaint of sudden increase of such crime a there must have be judging from numerous daring attempt here have bastow be concerned therefore feel sure that have be living quietly must have mate share that man shot know of plunder made together must know that after affair at place there must be vigilant hunt for be likely enough that have retired altogether from business for time however men of sort can never stand quiet life long be sure sooner later to take to trade again if only for sake of excitement now that burglary have begun again will be glad if will devote entirely to business have served good apprenticeship for sake a well a yours must be glad for to have in hand will be very pleased to do so sir although know where be to be found think can say that be not in slum of london seems to that may be quietly settled a eminently respectable man almost under nose may show occasionally at fashionable resort may be regular attendant at horse race must not run appreciable risk in doing so for face be quite unknown to anyone except constable who be present at trial even must scarcely be likely to recognize for be then eighteen while be now six seven twenty doubt life have led must have changed greatly quite agree with chief said after first hunt for be over might do almost anything without running much risk well put matter in hand leave to to work out in own way have given ample proof of shrewdness pluck in case especially know that will do everything be possible of course will be relieved of other duty if take month before can lay hand upon will consider time well spent if succeed at last from time to time change quarter let know address so must learn anything may be useful can communicate with at once have better take name than by be known in force will be glad if after thinking matter over will write few line stating what propose to do in first place mark went back to lodging sat there for time thinking matter over first thought be to attend race for time seeing number of people there own ignorance of bastow appearance abandoned idea determined to try slower more methodical plan after coming to conclusion put on hat made way to mr cunningham well mr constable millicent said saucily a entered fresh capture think have for present done with sort of thing have served apprenticeship be now setting up on own account how be that mark there be reason to believe bastow have begun work again near london a have told be absolutely certain that be not hiding in of place frequented by criminal here there be reason for supposing that have be leading quiet life somewhere that have be away in country a long a be case there be nothing to be done now that seems to have set to work again be time for to be on move have seen chief morning have released from other duty given carte blanche to work in own way then why leave force altogether mark know have always thought hateful that must be working under order like other constable of course woman like to be under order millicent men be not so independent be quite content to obey who be well qualified to give order have have very interesting time of very interesting said scornfully have nearly be killed shot dozen time have be obliged to wear sort of dirty clothes to sleep in place where one must not put dog generally to do sort of thing altogether unbecoming in position dear have particular position laughed then went on more seriously one position at present be that of avenger of father murder nothing can assist in task be unbecoming to a said have be interesting may almost say fascinating work used to be fond of hunting can tell that be infinitely more exciting to hunt man than be to hunt fox be own hound have to pick up scent to follow up however much quarry may wind double when at last lay hand upon shoulder say 'in king name ' there be infinitely keener pleasure than there be when hound run down fox one sport be perhaps a dangerous a other in one case horse may fail at leap may break neck in other may get bullet in head so in respect there be not much to choose between man fox hunting there be advantage though in one have to depend upon horse strength in other on own courage know that be enthusiast over mark can fancy that if be big strong man a be might do same if be going now to try by why must not leave force altogether because in first place will get information obtain can send for assistance may require in next place by showing little staff with silver crown show be bow street runner can obtain information at once from sort of people must not get without aid well wo say anything more against mark how be going to begin mean to go round of place near london say within ten mile will stay from week to fortnight in take quiet lodging give out be on lookout for small house with garden get to talk with people of kind can not see what have to inquire for imagine that bastow will have taken just sort of house that be inquiring for in course of question may hear of someone living in just sort of way retired life not making many friend going up to london sometimes keeping perhaps deaf old woman a servant perhaps deaf old man someone see who must not be likely to hear if came home in middle of night in early morning once hear of such man must ascertain age whether generally agreed in appearance with what bastow be likely to be by time then get down one of constable who be at trial take opinion on subject after must only have to watch house at night pounce upon a came back from one of excursion be broad outline of plan can not help thinking that in long run will be able to trace of course will make easier if take to stopping coach committing murderous burglary then suppose be not going to see often mark well not so often a have done millicent for time at rate will not be more than five six mile away will often ride into town for evening return late with sort of hope may be stopped on road again must save world of trouble see if must come to instead of having to find side of london be going to try first south side certainly there be score of place must be convenient to dulwich clapham tooting stockwell list be long one must say wimbledon be about most distant must think that must not go so far a if only acted a highwayman might be a far off a epsom if be really man concerned in burglary must be short distance away must hardly risk having to ride very far with chance of coming upon patrol think that will begin at peckham be central sort of position from there will work gradually west before do so perhaps will try lewisham be likely in case to be quite on outskirt of village may have settled in in order that may ride in out at hour without coming going being noticed certainly seem to have thought over in way mark almost infect with ardor make wish be man must help be much nicer a be millicent girl tossed head in disdain at compliment be very well mark went on ignoring speech seems to that in finding out thing woman must be able to do just a much a man can gossip with neighbor ask about everyone in place quite a well if not better than man yes doubt that mark laughed if want aid will have hesitation in asking for until then hope will go on with painting harping steadily like good little girl be nearly eighteen sir object to be called good little girl well if be to say good young woman must not like think must know why when anyone say girl be good young woman nice young woman there always seems something derogatory about be almost a bad a saying be very respectable young person be odious then see went on be quite getting on in society since mr cotter introduction to mr cunningham mother subsequent call have got to know good many people go about good deal yes have be more lively of late admitted at first be certainly monstrously dull here began to think that must have to change plan go down again to weymouth settle there for time now be getting contented admit even at risk of making conceited that will certainly miss very much a have be very good considering how busy have be to come in three four evening week for chat there have be nothing very good about millicent have be very pleasant to be like bit of old time again when be here with two seem to leave excitement of one work behind a come in at door wonder whether old time will ever come back again mark said sadly never can be quite old time again when be back at old place may be very near looked at reproachfully think that will change mind mark at heart know better day be one twenty hope to carry out intention well a have told before millicent can not control action be at least master of own can give away crowswood to whom like at least can not compel to take make over to one of hospital if like be within power be not in power to force into mean action of enriching because have romantic notion in mind must scorn be capable of doing such action wonder think so meanly of a to suppose for moment must do so be great pity father did not leave property outright to father then bother must have be avoided said quietly must still have have plenty to live upon without there being fear of being loved merely for money must have be same thing if have mark said stubbornly father must not have taken be sure must not have taken after be proper heiress say if have left son that son have be second bastow that one must have hesitated for must probably have gambled away in year tenant might have be ruined village gone to dog man have right to disinherit unworthy son be very different thing from disinheriting daughter simply from whim well let talk about more millicent be only thing that agree about therefore be best left alone next day mark established at inn in peckham for six week made diligent inquiry without success there be at least dozen men who lived quietly rode drove to business in town many of be put aside a needing investigation having be resident there for year of others saw start return none of corresponded in way with probable appearance of man for whom be in search during time heard of several private coach being held up on road between epsom london three burglary took place at streatham

by london tradesman who have given up business want to get little way out of town keep gig must say there must be score of such people living round here be often asked about such place know of one to

kitchen garden behind at bottom of be field of three four acre ground be separated by hedge from of house beyond be fully hundred yard away well bred horse be grazing in field man smoking pipe be watching boy doing gardening work behind house mark remained for nearly hour concealed behind hedge in hope that must come nearer at end of time however went into house after waiting ten minute mark also left resisting temptation to walk along road take closer look at for felt that step must be dangerous for must man notice anyone looking at place suspicion might be aroused be evident that lane be very little used in many case grass grew across there be mark of horse foot none of wheel concluded that when going up to town man came way rode quietly through streatham for hoof print pointed in direction that on return at night came up lane from other road well master what do think of house ostler asked on return to inn have only be to one in lane that spoke of for want to get back to town have good look at be rather dreary looking place evidently want lot of repair before can be made comfortable next time be down will look at other mounting horse rode at rapid pace into london

unfrequented one on return from expedition have taken on deaf old woman who will not hear ride in at night will have idea at what hour come home riding out through main street in afternoon must excite notice story to ostler must very well account for taking house for habit of coming up here of afternoon returning late thought best to come back tell will adopt plan that suggest for capture say that have be there for nearly year about year ostler said then one of men at least must have be very careless not to have found out long ago let see took down volume of report streatham tomlinson have be here fortnight making inquiry man of suspicious appearance of unknown antecedent here ' humph be not first time tomlinson have failed altogether in duty however doe not matter for moment what be own idea mr thorndyke idea be that couple of good men must go down with to streatham that must be always on watch in high street until see ride past directly be dark will go to house fasten old woman up search thoroughly if find stolen property so much better in case will wait inside house until return a come in throw upon before have time to draw pistol must say must be a well men must go down in trap there be empty house next door when go to search place can leave horse trap inside gate directly have secure can fetch up trap put in one of men can drive back here leaving other in charge of

greyhound suppose will go out until six seven o'clock have better be there earlier one must station in main street other concealing somewhere beyond fellow house for be likely enough that sometimes may take other way will go down to greyhound at six will wait there until one of brings news that have left think have better come in in morning give instruction to men there will be le fear of mistake being made must say have better put horse up come here on foot one can never be too careful when one be dealing with so crafty rogue a certainly doe not work with accomplice for that may have two three sharp boy in pay may watch place by turn carry news of stir about office will walk in mark replied be distance from stockwell mark slept little night have believed all along that must be finally successful discovery have come so suddenly that have taken completely by surprise might not be man tried hard to persuade that chance be against being so so that must not feel disappointed must turn out that be other criminal for that man be criminal have not shadow of doubt next morning be at office early chief arrived hour later two officer be at once called in will go with mr thorndyke chief said will give instruction capture be very important one there must be mistake made believe man to be bastow think be present at trial chester escaped from sydney convict prison three

will order gig from morden leave here about three o'clock must say have better get up a two countryman who have be up to market however mr thorndyke will explain whole matter to fully mark then went off with two officer to private room went into whole matter with think chester said that have better watch in high street because know man at least have seen may recognize again think must know however much have changed took particular notice of at trial thought what hardened looking young scamp be be very seldom forget face when once have thorough look at think be likely to forget malcolm

come out into lane a soon a see that have gone come back to greyhound with news will be there will pick up chester in high street a come along of course wo pretend to know mere fact of coming back

early will do good too for be at ingleston last night smoke row have given headache will really have to give up going there except when there be important fight on be too much to stand tobacco be so bad that be obliged to keep suit of clothes for purpose let be off at once chapter xvi at four o'clock mark put up horse at greyhound chatted for quarter of hour with ostler who have be making inquiry have heard of one two other house in neighborhood be untenanted mark then strolled up town exchanging passing glance with chester who in velveteen coat low hat gaiter be chatting with wagoner going with load of hay for next morning market in london turned into inn called for pint of best port sat down in parlor at table close to window so that must see who went up down entered into conversation with two three people who came in so passed time till seven when felt too restless to sit still longer went out into street when be halfway to greyhound heard sound of horse hoof behind saw quietly dressed man coming along at easy trot have not be that recognized horse must not have felt sure that rider be man whose coming have be waiting for there being nothing in appearance must excite slightest suspicion that be other than gentleman of moderate mean quiet taste returning from ride passing through on way to town have well built active figure carried with ease of thorough horseman nodded to one two person of acquaintance checking horse at principal butcher ordered meat to be sent in evening mark must trace resemblance in face to of young fellow remembered be quiet resolute one if be bastow have lost sneering insolent expression be so strongly impressed on memory might be man if so be greatly changed mark first impression be that must not be bastow when thought over year of toil confinement in convict prison life have led in bush two year have passed since returned home imagined that insolence of youth might well have disappeared be succeeded by resolute daring dogged determination seemed to be impressed on fellow face mark paused fifty yard before reached inn in few minute saw chester coming along there be one else in sight be bastow asked a officer came up be bastow sure enough sir be so changed that if have not have in mind must not have recognized calculate that man who have gone through what have must have lost expression have a boy must have learnt lot in convict prison fact that headed mutiny escaped from searcher managed to get home showed that must have become resolute desperate man burglary way in have several time stopped coach single handed show nerve coolness have that in mind a came along face be pretty much a expected to see be cool hand can understand how have given slip so long there be none of shifty look about eye that one generally see in criminal glancing from side to side rode with air of man who have right to be where be feared one will be awkward customer to tackle if take by surprise yes agree with there however wo have much chance of using pistol strength here be malcolm coming so will walk away for few minute let go in first can tell ostler now that will have horse put in at nine o'clock have be thinking by way that have better take trap round behind house instead of leaving in drive man may come back way if so might hear horse stamp make movement must at once put on guard a officer entered inn mark went into yard told ostler that have met friend must let horse remain there for night be possible that may drive into town in morning said will very likely send man down for horse at quarter to nine went out again walked to house have before visited in ten minute heard sound of wheel threw open gate men jumping down led horse in may a well take out of trap said can not very well get round house there be difficulty about taking horse officer have brought halter nosebag full of corn horse be fastened to tree with soft ground round nosebag put on horse cloth thrown over back then mark two companion went out into lane in couple of minute entered next gate treading lightly going round to back of house light burned in kitchen old woman must be seen knitting lifted latch walked in dropping knitting rose with exclamation of terror mark advanced alone be frightened said be not going to do harm took out little ebony staff be constable went on have order to search house must secure will be released in morning now be room in spite of mark assurance old woman be almost paralyzed with terror however two constable assisted up to room there secured with rope taking care that be not so tightly bound a to hurt then placed gag in mouth left now let search room in first place mark said when came downstairs again hardly expect will find anything may be sure that will have taken great pain to hide away booty that may have here that will need daylight closer search than can give place now before find anything search of house be indeed fruitless cut open bed prized up loose board in bedroom parlor lifted hearth stone tapped wall searched drawer then taking lantern went out into stable officer be accustomed to look for hiding place ran hand along on top of wall examining stone flooring manger be very large corn bin mark said a looked round when desisted from search be right sir will empty there be two three empty sack on ground near emptied corn into so that there must be litter about chester gave exclamation of disappointment a reached bottom mark put hand on bin gave pull be just a thought said be fastened down saw ax in woodshed malcolm just fetch here while man be away mark took lantern examined bottom closely sha want ax said a pointed out to chester piece of string be apparently jammed in form of loop between bottom side just get in clear few handful of corn out think will see that will pull up then there be however movement in bottom when mark pulled at loop look closely round outside said handing malcolm who have now returned lantern have doubt that there be catch somewhere in minute two constable found small ring between two of cobblestone close to foot of wall pulled at a did so mark felt resistance to pull cease suddenly bottom of bin came up like trapdoor be clever hiding place said if have not happened to notice that bin be fixed might have have long search before found here below be square hole size of bin ladder led down into mark with lantern descended four five sack piled on other lay at bottom leaving just room enough for man to stand beside top one be silver by feel said not yet broken up smaller sack be solid suppose be silver have be melted down lifted bag eighteen inch deep opened looked in contains watch jewel now think will leave thing here for present put everything straight may be back before long mark ascended bottom of trap be shut down again corn poured in bag thrown down on spot from have be taken returned to house shut door extinguished light have be grand find said even if be not bastow will be valuable capture that will mr thorndyke have doubt that fellow be man have be in search of for last eighteen month account for difficulty in laying hold of have be too crafty to try to sell of plunder so that none of fence have known anything about doubt have taken sufficient cash to enable to live here quietly intended time other to melt down rest of plate to sell silver must do easily enough a for watch jewel must get rid of abroad doubt be what intended mark agreed be not often fellow be a prudent a have be if be work must be good deal more difficult than be be right sir know that ever heard of such case before fellow almost deserves to get away must be rewarding too highly for caution mark laughed be desperate villain more dangerous for being prudent one now think one of have better keep watch at gate by turn will hear coming in plenty of time to get back here be in readiness for must understand part thoroughly will stand facing door be possible that may light that lantern saw hanging in stable think

after starting must hear prisoner moving about uneasily in straw suppose there be fear of slipping out of handcuff chester not bit be full tight for expect that be what be making uncomfortable presently movement ceased be still enough now mr thorndyke must not be at surprised if have dropped off to sleep be hardened enough to sleep while gibbet be waiting for be four o'clock in morning when

understand mark said that wish name to appear in matter at have a know be actuated by private reason only in search see occasion why name must be mentioned evidence of chester malcolm will be ample from information received went down to place searched in absence discovered stolen good captured having handcuffed bound one drove up to town other remaining to guard treasure on way got at hidden dagger stabbed evidence must not strengthen case at see that will be necessary to call mr thorndyke discovery of hidden booty proceeds of coach robbery must be quite sufficient beyond coroner inquest there will be inquiry have be otherwise might probably have be necessary to call at trial however a be will save lot of trouble now will only need to find owner of bank note will send off cart for thing a early a can get one will send couple of constable round to house where burglary have be committed to request owner to come over see if can identify of property who do so can attend inquest tomorrow though suppose will be called chief will be mightily pleased when hears what have taken place for have be sadly worried by constant complaint fancy that authority have be rather down upon on subject announcement that career of famous robber have be brought to end will cause quite sensation people round common on south side will sleep more quietly than have done lately expect that if have not put end to must have have to send across to newington today for of course be surrey business though have have luck to take suppose will not see much of in future mr thorndyke indeed mark said business be done will send in resignation morning regret time have spent over have learned great deal have seen lot of shady side of life have picked up experience in good many way mark after requesting inspector to find man to go over to streatham bring back horse writing order to ostler to deliver walked across to lodging upon whole be not sorry that bastow have taken matter into own hand have certainly while engaged in search looked forward to seeing in dock witnessing execution now felt that enough have be done for vengeance that be a well that matter have ended a have be wearied out with excitement of last forty eight hour be one o'clock when awoke after dressing going into covent garden to lunch at one of coffee house made way up to islington taking day holiday millicent asked a came in well not exactly millicent have left school altogether left school mark do mean that have decided that be of use going on longer have given up because have finished arthur bastow be captured last night committed suicide a be being taken to station exclamation of surprise broke from mr cunningham millicent seems horrid to be glad that anyone have taken own life latter said can not help feeling so for a long a lived must never have considered that be safe besides suppose there be doubt that if have not killed must have be hung there be not shadow of doubt about mark replied found proceeds of vast number of robbery at place also in pocket money have taken from passenger of portsmouth coach hour before captured so that putting aside that australian business altogether doom be sealed now please tell about mr cunningham said first let congratulate most warmly not only on success of search that work be at end yes be glad be over at first be very much interested in fact be intensely interested along must have be for however long have continued at same time must hing else one doe not want to spend one whole life a detective at last came about almost by chance only thing have to congratulate be that idea of sort of place must have taken be exactly borne out by fact mark then gave full account of manner in discovery have be made capture effected see millicent followed injunction be very careful taking by surprise a did might have managed single handed with aid of two good men made certainty of whole thing be comfortably arranged think have done splendidly mark mr cunningham said be certainly wonderful that must have found doing exactly what have guessed even down to deaf servant well now be done over what do think of doing next have hardly thought about that replied at rate will take few week holiday suppose after will settle down to search for uncle treasure be afraid will be much longer vastly more difficult business than have be here there be sort of clew to work upon bastow ought to have be captured month ago in other affair so far there be next to nothing to follow up even know whether thing be in india in england believe will be found that will be by accident besides fancy that will hear about when come of age millicent there be to have be change till that time can not help thinking that uncle george must have made provision by must get to know about in event of death without having opportunity of telling anyone where be might have be killed in battle might have be drowned on way home have thought whole matter over so thoroughly do think possibility of must not have escaped a told mr prendergast made inquiry of principal banker indian agent here altogether without success after have done that got list of leading firm in calcutta madras wrote to reply be in negative be true doe not prove anything absolutely eighteen year be long time chance be that during year almost head of firm must have retired come home matter must only be likely to be known to head if a thought likely box chest be merely forwarded by firm there to england transaction must not have attracted special attention if upon other hand remained out there might have be put down in cellar store have be lying there ever since altogether forgotten see why must bother more about perhaps a say will turn up of when come of age at rate must say be certainly a well to wait till then see if doe especially a acknowledge that have clew to work on be only three more year for be eighteen next week certainly seems to that will be very foolish to spend next three year in searching about for thing may come to without searching at well will think over see really want money mark went on want particularly millicent when one know that there be something like pound waiting for one somewhere one must like to get father worked for twenty year of life accumulating for seems to sort of sacred duty to see that labor have not be thrown away millicent be silent be very tiresome said presently of course father intended a say that saving must come to be sure never meant that must be bother trouble to see why must ever be millicent a be have sufficient for anything man woman must reasonably want of need fret over if treasure be never found still wished to have be properly ours want to go to enrich someone who have not shadow of right to on following morning mark went to attend inquest on bastow did not go into court however remained close at hand in event of coroner insisting upon being called however two men only spoke casually in evidence of comrade robert who have be also engaged in capture one of juryman suggested that must also be called coroner said really can not see occasion for be here to consider how deceased came by death think must be perfectly clear that came by by own act have heard how be captured that spoil of coach that have just rifled be found upon that booty have be acquiring from deed for month past also be seized therefore a man be desperate knew well enough that life be forfeited there be ample motive for putting end to wretched existence really think gentleman that be worth while to waste time mine by going into further evidence finally verdict of felo de se be returned with strong expression of jury admiration of conduct of constable malcolm chester robert who have so cleverly effected capture of man who have so long set law at defiance chapter xvii four day later mark on return from dinner found philip cotter sitting in room waiting for have met on previous evening cotter have expressed intention of calling upon next day be here on matter of business thorndyke latter said a shook hand of business mark repeated yes might guess for year suppose that must hit be rather curious thing nearly twenty year ago can guess before go further mark exclaimed leaping up from seat that have just taken people received box from india be so mark although how guessed know have be searching for for year mark replied lawyer prendergast wrote to about box at least wrote to asking if have property belonging to colonel thorndyke people wrote to say have yes remember wrote to of course be before did that great service did not know name have not name on book what be in box jewel worth something like fifty thousand pound by jove congratulate old fellow be to say if have handling of well be happened box be sent to by firm in calcutta together with bill for pound instruction be that money be to be invested in stock that be to manage to take pound year for so doing rest of interest of money be to be invested box be very massive one be marked with letter xyz be very carefully sealed instruction be that owner of box money might present at time that proof of ownership be to be that be to use word mark broke in produce gold coin must probably though of be not certain correspond with seal got up went to cabinet have brought up with from crowswood unlocked produced piece of paper coin yes that look like seal thorndyke at rate be same sort of thing why on earth did come with before take thing away simply because did not know where to go to uncle be dying when came home told father about treasure died suddenly father did not know whether be sent to england committed to someone charge in india buried there did only thing must namely inquired at bank agent here at principal firm in madras calcutta to ask if have in possession property belonging to late colonel thorndyke see did not know cotter went on more than adam to whom box belonged fortunately agent sent in communication sealed letter on outside of be written 'this be to remain unopened if one before date present with token password be to be read on th of august ' be yesterday know yes that be cousin eighteenth birthday thought if uncle have left box in anyone charge must probably have given such instruction for at time there be hard fighting in india might have be killed day must therefore naturally have made provision for preventing secret dying with did not think of until morning early though have be rather curious over ourselves when opened inside be letter addressed be delivered to john thorndyke esquire at crawley near hastings at crowswood reigate in event of death to executor be one of executor mark said mr prendergast lawyer be other think have better go round to tomorrow open letter there oh must think might open at once thorndyke will probably only contain instruction at rate a have coin word must come round tomorrow morning get chest out if want wo do mark said coffer contains gem worth over pound must very much rather remained in keeping until decide what to do with how large be be square box about foot way be pretty heavy probably from setting of jewel well anyhow be heartily glad thorndyke know of course that be well off still pound for money have doubled since have to say nothing of jewel be nice plum to drop into anyone mouth very nice indeed although only half of come to under uncle will to tell truth be more glad that mystery have be solved than at getting money affair be great worry to father have be so to felt ought to search for treasure yet probability of finding seemed so small that felt thing be hopeless really only chance be that uncle must have taken just course did have fixed date when treasure must be handed over if not asked for rather fancied that must not have be for three year for be when cousin come of age what cousin do mean philip cotter asked did not know have one well be at present secret cotter one of mystery connected with uncle will for must tell in market place tomorrow wish to be preserved at present will certainly know a soon a anyone by way have not seen at mr cunningham for last week used to be pretty regular visitor no young man said gloomily mind telling that miss conyers refused fortnight ago never thought that have much chance have just shadow of hope be at end now perhaps in future mark suggested for sake of saying something no said a much a to replied that must always be same gathered from manner although did not exactly say so that there be someone else in case yet have never met anyone often there perhaps be mistaken mark said well whether not there be clearly hope for be very sorry be use moping over father mother like so much be anxious for to marry settle down altogether must have be just thing know whether have money did not care for of course will have plenty will be junior partner in six month father told so other day said that at one time be afraid that must never come into house for that must not have be fair to others to take such reckless fellow in that seemed to have reformed so thoroughly since affair that if continued so for six month must have hesitation in giving share be too late to go up to islington that evening in morning mark went with still unopened letter to solicitor old lawyer congratulated most heartily when told of discovery that have made be glad indeed mark not so much for sake of money because be afraid that confounded treasure be going to unsettle life when man once begin treasure hunting becomes sort of craze can no more give up than opium smoker can use of drug thank goodness be over so capital amount be doubled be accordingly worth pound more than be time yesterday fine windfall now let see what uncle say broke seal letter be short one began dear john if have not before receive got treasure will get on th th of august have made will will give full instruction what to do with may say though have left between little daughter who be born six month ago son mark own intention be to stop out here until get rank of general have taken measure have done in case bullet sharp attack of fever carry off suddenly hope that will have carried out provision of will hope also that will have come home talked whole matter over with before go under affectionate brother singular man mr prendergast said a laid letter down on table beside what trouble crotchety people do give suppose have altogether put aside that folly of about jewel well ca say have mr prendergast do know have fancy may only be fancy if so can not shake off that be watched by lascar there be one standing at corner of street a came up morning again again have run across one be not always same man have absolute reason for believing that be watching still somehow other do come across more frequently than seems natural pooh nonsense mark must have thought that be too sensible fellow to have such ridiculous fancy in head of course must never have thought of such thing mr prendergast if have not be for what father told that uncle be desperately in earnest about have intense conviction that someone watched movement let talk of such folly longer lawyer said irritably now that have got money best thing can do be to go at once carry out what be wish of father uncle ask cousin to marry will put end to whole business can tell that be positively convinced that day get twenty one will renounce property that if refuse to take will pas over to hospital other can not do better than prevent from carrying out such act of folly a only way can see be by marrying gathered from what said when gave same advice at reigate that liked must have done have not be for coming into estate instead of well be now in position to ask to marry without possibility of being supposed that be fortune hunter will think about mr prendergast of course money doe make considerable difference in position however will hing until have got jewel off hand well couple of day will manage that lawyer said have only got to take box to first class jeweler get to value thing make offer for whole of mark did not care to press subject on leaving went to cotter bank be at once shown into friend room latter took to father be curious mr thorndyke latter said heartily that must have be keeping money time without having slightest idea that belonged to be ready at once to pay over to order for if pronounce word know of find that coin have corresponds with seal on box necessary proof will be given that have authority to take away have have box brought up morning so that can compare seal box be taken out of strong safe be at once seen that coin corresponded with seal will leave with for present mr cotter contains large amount of jewel until have decided what to do with must rather leave must be madness to have pound worth of gem in london lodging even for single night a to money that also have better remain a be at present invested a told son that jewel be joint property of myself dare say that in few day half of money will be transferred to name of other legatee can be easily done will get lawyer mr prendergast to call upon mr cotter suppose must be better legal proof that be entitled to money must be given will be glad to see to take instruction banker said in point of fact regard property a yours have nothing to do with will other arrangement simply received box cash with order that must be delivered to whomsoever must come with word ' coin to match seal that have done with subsequent disposition have concern will be happy to keep box for a long a must think proper have also written out acknowledgement hold security of value at closing price yesterday of pound shilling handed paper to mark a latter left bank looked up down street muttered angry exclamation a caught sight of rough looking fellow just turning corner into side street glance be so momentary one must not say whether man be colored seaman certainly thought that be lascar be going to have trouble about bracelet said to a hailed hackney coach told to drive to islington be convinced that colonel be right that there be men over in country with fixed purpose of seeing what be done with jewel obtaining if possible how must tell that be deposited at cotter beat altogether may be indeed that really knew nothing about have simply be watching can hardly have be watching for last nine month yet curiously enough though have never given matter thought since charley gibbon said that be dark colored man who brought news took to rescue saved life have often run against lascar if have taken trouble along now that have seen come out of bank will be watched night day be creepy sort of idea must not be afraid of number of if attacked openly there be saying what might do wish ramoo have be here must have consulted about a got letter from only last week saying that have on day of writing arrived in calcutta be of use wishing that at rate can not do better than stick to plan that uncle sketched out take across to amsterdam must be very unfair to take to jeweler here might have in possession for week ten day before made definite offer for during time must not give fig for life if distribute stone at amsterdam must hardly set about attacking twelve diamond merchant one after well at rate must say nothing about affair to millicent mr cunningham be bad enough running risk in pursuit of bastow must be ten time worse know millicent must be for letting thing remain for good at banker have idea of allowing to be frightened by two three black scoundrel into throwing away pound mr cunningham millicent be sitting in bonnet in parlor here be at last sir girl said five minute must have gone out told that must come early now be twelve o'clock be generally so punctual in appointment what have got to say for good many thing have happened since then millicent last night friend mr cotter called upon why do say friend be friend be entirely through that knew at well will say 'our friend millicent made communication to that morning have to go to mr prendergast make communication to what do mean by communication millicent asked laughing be quite mysterious mark then have to go went on without heeding interruption to cotter bank where saw friend father there be result of communication interview threw paper to what doe mean asked in astonishment after glancing through mean dear that father took exactly precaution thought must take after sending money jewel home sent sealed letter to firm with whom deposited happened to be cotter with instruction must one present with word coin by th of august be to say on eighteenth birthday envelope must be opened be so opened contained letter be to be sent to father in case of death before date to executor how wonderful girl said have quite given up idea of how be that came to be so much have sold jewel see be compound interest going on for seventeen year perhaps rise in value of security have doubled original sum invested a for jewel have left at bank must not care about having pound worth of such thing in room must not think that must like to have here either certainly not mr cunningham said emphatically did quite right mark think must sleep even if have dozen of detective friend posted round house still suppose will have chance of seeing millicent said certainly can make appointment with philip cotter for to see at bank if take to jeweler to value must see there must think that bank must be best be sure that cotter must put room at disposal of course if must like to have of for must select liked expect that wo look much in present setting indian jeweler have not knack of setting off gem however there be hurry about one way money have told cotter father will for present remain a be invested be in fund cotter said for although instruction be that be to be put into good security did not feel justified under peculiar circumstance in going outside government stock mr prendergast be quite of opinion that must be better to make change until come of age did not know whether must wait till then for purpose other might want to use of millicent shrugged shoulder think must much rather have have just money have before mark will be great nuisance be sure think there ought to be law against woman having more than pound whether in money in land mark laughed must be bad thing for spendthrift young nobleman millicent how be to pay off debt mortgage if there be heiress ready to do so in exchange for title must be good thing for consider girl said indignantly in first place must not impoverish if knew that there be way of building up fortune again in next place if did ruin must have to set to work to earn honest living blow out brain if have to blow out can assure that feel at exultant at getting money think that father be quite right in wishing must know nothing about until married on other hand be heartily glad more glad than can say mark that have come into share be glad for one reason millicent be that must put end to ridiculous idea have of giving up crowswood father have made rich beyond anything must possibly have expected from suddenly find wealthy man can buy estate for worth more than crowswood if inclined to settle down a squire therefore theory have be disappointed in not inheriting what thought be father estate fall to ground altogether in case must ever have accepted sacrifice if have liked to hand over to st bartholomew guy hospital to give away to other charity must not have prevented must never have accepted for now thank goodness question can not arise for must see that even looking at matter from purely business point of view have benefited to enormous altogether unexpected extent by father will if contest between must arise must be on ground that have acted unfairly to by giving so large proportion of money that in course of nature must have inherited be not even a if have known liked for be four year old at time wrote letter saying be to share money jewel with be very obstinate very disagreeable mark said with tear in eye think obstinacy have be principally on side millicent though certainly must not think of saying that have be disagreeable have be excess of kindheartedness on part have resolutely closed eye to fact have be willing to take advantage of generosity must have lacked courage to do so for must have be pointed at went a mean fellow who took advantage of little cousin romantic generosity pray dear let say more about be two rich young people have estate yours grant be larger if choose can increase mine until be quite a large a crowswood can be better friend than have be for last year because point of dispute have always stood between made uncomfortable now will have to think over what must like done whether wish change made in manner of living did tell mr cotter millicent laughed after pause have half share in money be matter for to decide not for told be only half shareholder there be necessity to say who be who have other half when be talking to philip cotter word cousin ' slipped out did not associate in way with might have be son of brother of sister of father in case then will certainly make change will mr cunningham think millicent that mr prendergast mark will probably be of opinion that ought now to be introduced regularly into society fact that be rich heiress might a father so much wished remain secret be one thing having blazoned about quite for to be living quietly here where with exception of mr cotter few other friend have society certainly be not wish of father that must remain unmarried be quite pretty nice enough to be sought for alone must say that think now that have finished with various master must be well that must go out good deal more that a first step must go down to bath year instead of paying visit to weymouth a have arranged want change at mr cunningham if be to get married will be married if be not will not fret about for millicent mark said mr cunningham be right quite agree that there be occasion whatever for to go about labeled ' good estate over pound in cash ' do think that be right that must go into society with exception of philip cotter dick chetwynd two three other of friend really know very few people have now gone out of mourning think that mr cunningham proposal that must go down to bath be very good one will not be sorry for change for have be engrossed in work for long time now can go down day two before get comfortable lodging will myself stay at hotel although have intimate friend beyond from reigate know large number of men of fashion from meeting at boxing school other place must introduce get into society be altogether opposed to idea millicent said decidedly want to trot out like horse for sale millicent mark said calmly only want to have same advantage that other girl have more le for to enjoy a others do there be nothing undignified objectionable about especially a be agreed that nothing will be said about fortune well will think over mr prendergast certainly wish to act a tyrant there be occasion to come to decision in hurry have only discovered good fortune today can scarcely appreciate difference that will make to can think over what will be for best at leisure see if can not hit upon plan will be agreeable to thank mark said gratefully be afraid that must think very disagreeable cross though a man have not same sort of feeling can assure that feel money so on to be heavy burden be not for sake must wish heartily that treasure have never be discovered at can quite understand that said quietly at present moment even see that will be of much advantage to may be that day will see in different light have come upon almost a suddenly a have upon thought that after have finished with bastow affair must set to work to find out treasure that must probably take out to india occupy there for time afterwards might travel through other place be away from england three four year now matter be altogether altered will be time before form fresh plan in fact must depend upon circumstance mr cunningham have left room two three minute before thinking mark might be able to talk charge into more reasonable state of mind be alone with added of one circumstance in particular looked up inquiringly well millicent depends great deal upon know think that have happened during past year have be little hard upon thoroughly agree with be fond of crowswood be very happy there change to somewhat dull house just at time when be of age to enjoy pleasure have be trial then too there have be question of estate upon mind must remember have be somewhat of trial to also grant have have plenty of occupation have be in way beneficial to have not at lamented leaving country in one respect have be trial know whether ever entered mind before sad time at home be getting to care for in very different way to in have done before father think observed for threw out very plain hint once that must very gladly see coming together however never spoke of to be young be young seemed to that there be plenty of time that moreover must not be fair for to speak to until have have opportunity of going out of seeing other men then came evening before death when father told how matter really stood again said that there be way by trouble must be obviated saw that be not so that hope have entertained must be put aside have never told loved when seemed to be heir of property only daughter of old comrade of saw be to speak now when be heiress must not appear to that be estate not that wanted felt lip be sealed forever mr prendergast said that day when came down to funeral told that must not take property that might be managed in way said that did not want to be married for money so see saw in exactly same light a did first thought morning when mr cotter told that money have mounted up to over pound be that must unseal lip be still better off than be difference be now immaterial be rich man have not smallest occasion to marry for money whether married girl without penny heiress must make little difference to a have certainly ambition to become great landowner still think that must have be more fair to to give opportunity of seeing more of society of world before speaking to see be opposed to therefore must be same did wait patiently year think must be able to do love millicent be only during past eighteen month when have thought that have lost have known how much love how much happiness depends upon can truly say be penniless must make shadow of difference to be no longer question of arranging matter comfortably be question of love estate be nothing to never have be anything doe not count at in scale hope that will put altogether out of mind in giving answer that if can not say a truly wholly a do ' love ' that will say a frankly a have always spoken to ' love very much a cousin mark not in way ' girl have sat perfectly quiet while be speaking be standing before now took one of hand love dear love with heart do love then looked up rose to foot placed hand upon shoulder a love so love mark after conversation languished till mr cunningham came into room five minute later have come to conclusion mr cunningham said that there will be necessity for visit to bath millicent be otherwise provided for have promised to be wife be glad mark glad indeed took millicent in arm kissed tenderly have along hoped for began to be afraid that be such obstinate young people that must never come about know that father wished mark told that brother have said that must be good arrangement if day must come to like other have guessed for last year indeed before then millicent must not say 'no if ever asked stupid estate seemed to stand in way of late have even come to hope that obstinate girl must keep to intention if a knew must be case refused to take estate must give away to charity in case there must be nothing to prevent speaking even then must have be between very fairly equipped with world good however present be far better solution discovery of treasure have saved from three year waiting before thing be straightened out feel a if be mother mark having have in charge since be baby a grew up became fondest hope to see united day think that be almost a pleased that hope have be fulfilled a be yourselves chapter xviii after thinking over best way in to set about work of carrying diamond to amsterdam mark decided upon asking advice of late chief latter said a mark entered room did not expect to see here again mr thorndyke well sir have come to ask advice about matter altogether what be now have to convey diamond bracelet of very great value across to amsterdam have reason to believe that there be plot to seize on way that men engaged will hesitate at nothing to achieve object under circumstance must be very much obliged if will tell must be best course to pursue must say that bracelet be with many other jewel in strong teak box of about foot square at present in possession of banker be brought from india by uncle imagine that rest of jewel be of comparatively little importance in eye of men though doubtless must take also if lay hand on bracelet however be of special interest to not so much for intrinsic value a because be stolen from one of sacred idol be about twenty year ago have reason to believe that search for on part of hindoo connected with temple have never ceased soldier who took be murdered comrade into whose hand next passed be also murdered next came to uncle who forwarded at once to england bungalow be searched again again until probably fellow came to conclusion that must have buried sent away nevertheless to day of death be firmly convinced that be closely followed movement watched warned father solemnly that too must be watched a far a know be not so at rate have reason to suppose that house be ever entered on other hand be convinced have be watched more le closely ever since came up to town a came out from bank yesterday saw man colored fellow believe on watch uncle said that life must not be worth hour purchase so long a have bracelet in possession advised that must be taken straight over to amsterdam broken up diamond sold singly to merchant there be curious story mr thorndyke own to ignorance of indian thief way certainly seems extraordinary that so hopeless quest must be kept up for so long time be sure that be not fancy on part that have be watched know be not sort of man to take fancy in head a have have matter so strongly impressed upon might naturally have be inclined to think must be case when be not so no think there be chance of being mistaken be only of late have thought about when did so thought over what have passed since came to london recalled fact have very often come across foreign seaman sometimes be lascar at others might have be italian spanish seaman see sir be a told at time foreign sailor who came informed gibbon have fallen into hand of gang of criminal must certainly be killed if be not rescued immediately gibbon at once got together dozen fighting men a know rescued just in time be extraordinary that man never came forward to obtain reward be friendly act mr thorndyke yes have reason to suppose that men must be hostile to personally be not thief be simply person who happened to be in possession rather might come into possession of bracelet from close watch have kept be imagine well aware that have not got may have thought doubtless did think have clew to hiding place must sooner later get with death clew might be finally lost life be consequently of extreme importance to therefore took step to have rescued fact that learned knew how friendly be with gibbon show how close be watch kept over doubt have gibbon refused to help must have come here at once certainly after what say must seem that conjecture be right in case if be must take bracelet out of case conceal about must not fetch from bank think must be much safer so mark said thoughtfully in first place must go to bank to get might be murdered merely on supposition have brought bracelet away in next place even if got to amsterdam safely got rid of bracelet returned unnoticed by fresh danger must arise when got other gem into possession for must not be certain whether diamond be still among not must hardly think must be case if watch a strictly a believe even if none of accompanied must soon find out what diamond merchant went to leader

again must send friend must trust to go open box take out bracelet make into small parcel must hand to privately a be on way to embark for amsterdam then must take with one two of men say couple of

street to inform chief of arrangement have be made have told off chester malcolm one of will go down take ticket of course will take passage in fore cabin a danger if there be danger may come from there will have other two men with aft fancy that there be hardly chance of being in way troubled while on board will be considered that there will be vastly greater chance of carrying out plan may have formed at amsterdam than there must be on board ship see if there be struggle whatever on board there must be escape for for myself of course can not give opinion worth having in matter so different from anything have to do with here must have unhesitatingly scoffed at idea of anyone watching movement of people for long number of year in order to obtain possession of jewel however valuable however uncle be well acquainted with habit of hindoo be not man to be lightly alarmed after year with must not be deceived in such matter a being followed under circumstance be quite right to take precaution a pay well for service of two men even if have belief whatever in existence of danger to must not feel justified in refusing to let have having arranged matter mark spent rest of time day next at islington be going across to amsterdam on saturday with diamond bracelet to sell there millicent looked at in reproachful surprise why surely mark there can be hurry about think might have stayed little longer before running away must do so may be quite sure millicent if consulted own inclination be bearing out father wish bracelet be most valuable of thing have believe that have sort of history attached to told father that have sent gem home principally to get diamond out of possession said that a soon a father got hold of thing be to take diamond straight over to amsterdam sell there for considered that be much too valuable to be kept in house that be possible that of hindoo might endeavor to get possession of at time spoke believed that father must at death go to bank get jewel a of course must have done if have known where to find father promised that must be taken to amsterdam at once although so many year have passed since death think be bound to carry out that promise have never be able to understand mark how be that father when gave instruction about jewel so on did not at same time tell uncle where to find be fancy of be in very bad health thought so much over diamond that have become almost sort of mania with that not only be there danger in possession that be watched night day wherever went thought even if whispered where hiding place be to be discovered might be heard therefore deferred telling until too late of course be fancy on part although be probable enough that possession of diamond be source of danger in india might have be source of danger here have thief known that such valuable gem be kept in private house carried about at rate will be glad to be free of responsibility although naturally like leaving at present time think best to carry out father instruction at once to get off mind altogether dick chetwynd be going with so will be pleasant little trip well be glad be going with mark for although know well enough that must never be watching for diamond to turn up year feel sure must fidget worry if be alone be not going to take others with only particular bracelet none of others be exceptionally valuable so far a know at rate father did not specially allude to have doubt that there be really valuable jewel among for uncle prided on being judge of precious stone a invested large amount of money in be doubt worth great deal still suppose there will be difficulty in selling here at rate want to be delayed at amsterdam by having to sell perhaps fifty hundred piece of jewelry time will do for fancy ought to be able to dispose of bracelet in three four day at outside have got from bow street list of principal diamond merchant in amsterdam be matter of great interest to force a almost precious stone stolen in country be sent across there if there be special jewel robbery send over list of article taken to merchant there a rule must not prevent dealing in there be who will not touch thing have be dishonestly come by occasionally get hint enable to lay hand upon thief over there hate to hear say 'the force ' mark just a if be still detective be bad enough that must have belonged to even for purpose did have done with now yes see be rather difficult to get out of habit when one have be for over year constantly at work at thing will be last absence on business millicent henceforward will be able to be always with well now that know what have be doing time mark must admit that have be very good to have be with a much a have often used to wonder how passed time of course knew that be trying to find man out did not seem to that must be always at never dreamt that have become regular detective be very glad did not know till short time before gave up in first place must have be horrified in second place must have be constantly uneasy about however a be to be last time will let go without grumbling by way millicent what do wish to say about engagement see that there be slightest occasion for to keep up farce of being miss conyers longer can not be married under false name know now that have escaped what father be so afraid of be going to be married for love not for money see why there must be more mystery about how must account for having be called conyers time must simply tell truth that father having great fear that might be married for money left estate to father to be held by until came of age that be at particular request that be brought up simply a ward dropped family name passed by two christian name must say that have be aware for long time of fact of case must also say that father have left very large fortune in addition to estate between have expressed hope that must when time came marry other then people will think that have only married to keep fortune together mark well dear suppose there be great many people who will be interested in matter who get to know will see at once that a far a be concerned there be great difficulty in falling in with father idea while on other hand may consider that made noble sacrifice of in agreeing to plan nonsense sir be not going to flatter a doubt expect at rate be perfectly content with share of bargain well there be one thing millicent who knew down at reigate will say that be very sensible arrangement will be glad to know that will retain estate have hitherto considered to be mine well then agree to mentioning to intimate friend that be cousin that be engaged yes suppose be best thing mark a say must marry under proper name be just a well to get talk over down at reigate now a for to come a wonder when be married when be that going to be millicent oh know of course will be long time before even think of beg pardon be thinking of now can see reason why must be delayed know other well enough must think there be probability of changing mind on discovering sort of fault that never dreamt in other may be away for fortnight must suggest that have better make preparation at once so that can be married fortnight after come back say that there be fear of discovering fault in other can assure have just discovered very serious fault namely that be altogether too masterful too bent upon having own way know always be so when be boy hoped have grown out of now see be altogether mistaken seriously mark proposal be absurd where doe absurdity come in millicent well everywhere said gravely in present case mean nowhere said do mean to tell millicent that in town there be not hundred dressmaker of whom must turn out wedding dress a many other garment a can possibly require in course of month even if effort be too stupendous that must not divide work among dozen of well say must not be done millicent admitted reluctantly well what other objection be there well see one doe not like to be bustled in such matter a mark one like to think over to realize to one self well dear will have fortnight while be away to think to realize a much a like can see advantage in waiting single day longer than there be necessity for have be for last year coming here merely a visitor want to take possession of have to suppose mr cunningham will be coming in presently will put matter to if say can not be ready in month must give week think that will say so by way how about be thinking of last night mark must be very lonely for to live by now see have always be a mother to quite so dear be sure must have objection to coming back to crowswood living there a friend helping in housekeeping thank very much mark must like in way see know nothing about housekeeping besides when be out must be great thing to have with for must be very lonely by in big house well will have there by mean dear if like to come have better talk over with ah here be be just talking over time will take millicent to get ready said will be glad of opinion have be telling be going away for fortnight have proposed that marriage must come off fortnight later can not see use in delay doe not either at least suppose not for only objection have advanced be that there will be short time in to get thing ready that strike a being nonsense must get thing ready for ten wedding in time what do think see reason for delay mr cunningham said assuredly month ought to be sufficient to get everything made thank mr cunningham then can consider settled millicent call tyranny mr cunningham millicent protested say proposes that will be married in month be not proposal at be order if have wanted in hurry might have said so year ago now that have made up mind at last want everything done in hurry be nature of men dear be alike in respect think have better make up mind to especially a have doubt in case order be not very unpleasant one be too bad mr cunningham millicent said made sure must find on side seems have gone over altogether to enemy where be going to asked mr cunningham of mark be going across to amsterdam to sell that bracelet uncle expressed particular wish to father that must do so immediately came into possession dick chetwynd be going over with if weather be fair will be pleasant trip where be thinking of going after marriage have not talked over yet own idea be that a of have be abroad might a well take opportunity for seeing something of continent of course can not go to france thing be in too disturbed state there might go to brussels then into germany perhaps a far a vienna then down into italy of course if millicent prefers will simply take tour through england scotland oh be glad that be to have voice in matter millicent said however must like tour propose very much mark have often thought that must like to see italy above place well then will consider settled now what be going to do for today chapter xix essex be to sail at eleven o'clock hour before time mark hackney coach drew up at wharf ten minute later dick chetwynd who have like mark driven by circuitous route have made several stoppage joined a shook hand slipped parcel into hand mark at once pocketed buttoned coat up tightly then hailing boat went on board together have sent luggage on previous evening on getting on board mark saw two prize fighter walking up down deck aft be quietly dressed save for size must have attracted attention must have be taken for two countryman on way to holland on business two detective be seated forward appearance being that of two quiet business men commercial traveler small trader two friend first went below saw to cabin be to share found luggage be there then returned on deck four five other passenger be standing watching last bale of good

of stream man sitting in stern be foreigner from southern europe from india be certainly dark man mark still may be only coincidence be rather curious one mark said be too far off to see feature be apparently watching off there oar be dipping into water now see that be fairly under way well mark will begin to think that be right be bound to say that hitherto thought that be ridiculous to suppose that must have be watched a thought that have got diamond on brain till have really become fanciful however certainly look a if be right even if be how on earth must have found out that be going by ship be more than can tell if have be watching must have known be intimate with have seen come out of cotter bank afterwards enter lodging must feel sure have heard that there must be danger connected with diamond might suppose must get friend to take from bank may have followed movement a well a mine in case must have found out that also went to cotter bank may have followed to tower street found out that have taken passage for two to amsterdam may again have seen go to bank morning have guessed that have diamond about then seeing together on wharf must feel pretty certain that be so one of may have hired that boat watched essex to see that of went on shore again now see that be off will know that game be up chetwynd said be not so sure of dick there be craft going day to antwerp flushing for anything know of may be on board craft already dropping down like ourselves by tide even if have twelve hour start by landing say at flushing must have time to cross by land to amsterdam get there before yes suppose must anyhow be pretty certain that will not be troubled on voyage yes never thought there be much danger of because even if be on board must see that being always together must not be got rid of without alarm being given not until be passing greenwich did of detective come near mark then a dick be standing by bulwark looking at hospital chester strolled across deck pointing to building a if asking question about said there be colored man forward dressed a sailor be that so mark said see one aft here who look suspicious think will try anything till get to

said mark be not long in getting into conversation with other passenger aft later on strolled forward with dick asking sailor question a to what sort of passage be likely to have how wind suited men agreed that unless wind shifted must not be likely to make quick passage wind be northeasterly one of said can only just lay course now will be dead against in of reach still think will manage to make down to sea with only tack two when be once fairly out of river will be long leg short one going up round texel will be dead against except that must be bit worse if have little more east in be about a foul wind a must have see sign of change worse luck presently moving about among got next to gibbon think will have trouble on board said if there be will be after have landed can keep eye on foreign sailor standing alone there up in bow right sir if like can manage to get into quarrel with can warrant that wo get out of berth before be time to go ashore must leave alone gibbon a long a be forward can do harm if see working way aft after get dark will do harm if manage to stumble against give clout on head right sir if hit once wo want fellow seems quiet enough a far a strength go look

kill when have got hidden away expect lieutenant said thought that if of watch came upon a be carrying off might be at once arrested if be found that be carrying dead man whilst if be only stunned must say that be drunken comrade who have fallen knocked head against something agree with sir have better start on search at once will pas hotel d'hollande if not will run bring men yes will go way will be further dick walked on fast have news of said a entered room where four men be anxiously awaiting watch be now going to search slum where men who be taken prisoner live come down now will tell have learned before others come up there be reason for believing that be not stabbed went on a reached street for men say that be armed only with club that strictest order be given that none be to carry knife therefore there be little doubt that be at time only stunned be bound to say that give very small ground for hoping that may find alive fear only stunned so that might carry safely to haunt for if stopped must say that be drunken comrade who have fallen hurt fear that when get into one of den will make short work of therefore be clear that there be not moment to be lost ah here come watch there be eight men with lieutenant have already sent off ten others said a joined chetwynd to watch lane let one go in out thought best not to lose moment about for when men see that have learned from others where gang came from have closed avenue of escape will hesitate about murdering prisoner if be still alive when men got there in quarter of hour arrived at end of narrow lane where two watchman be standing with lantern have seen heard nothing lieutenant asked sir have not seen man moving in lane there be just one hope that might be in time lieutenant said a went on down lane be that fellow when gather will be so dismayed at finding nearly number be missing knowing that of be pretty sure to make clean breast of will hesitate to complete crime be one thing to rob man in street quite to murder in cold blood there be likely to be good deal of difference of opinion among of more desperate being in favor of carrying thing through others be sure to be against nothing may have be done may be sure that sight of men at end of lane will still further alarm have doubt news that have surrounded district have already be circulated that if alive now be safe for will think be better to suffer year two imprisonment than to be tried for murder be sure to make capture for be probable that several of others will bear mark of fight man take will question separately one other of be pretty safe to be ready to say where friend be taken to if promise that sha be prosecuted house in district be searched from top to bottom six men with cut bruised face be found shamming sleep be separately questioned closely declared that knew nothing whatever of anyone being carried there be of use denying share in affair lieutenant said comrade have confessed that there be twenty five of hired to carry out that received hundred franc now if gentleman be not found will be hanging matter for of have better tell know if will tell where be will promise that sha be included in list of who will be prosecuted reply although put in different word be identical with of prisoner have nothing to do with carrying off be hired only to knock men down who be pointed out to not word be said about carrying off may have be carried off can not say have certainly not be brought here none of have anything to do with morning be breaking before search be concluded detective accustomed a be to visit worst slum of london be horrified at crowding squalor misery of place entered opinion mr chetwynd gibbon growled be that best thing to do must be to put score of soldier at end of lane then to burn whole place down make clean sweep of never saw such villainous looking crew in life have be in hope along of must resist must have be real pleasure to have let fly at be villainous set of wretch gibbon may not be criminal well know sir know that if be on jury of lot be in dock must not want to hear evidence against face be enough to hang at last search be over be glad indeed when emerged from lane breathed pure air outside for englishman felt sick at poisonous air of den have entered prisoner a be taken have be sent off to watch house begin to think that story fellow tell be true one mr chetwynd lieutenant said that have nothing to do with carrying friend off in first place tell same story that in must not be much a might have be settled beforehand be hardly likely that one of lot must not have be ready to purchase life by turning on others there be very little honor among thief a know that have taken mate for doubt be watched a marched up town must make sure that someone must turn traitor must think might a well be beforehand fancy that men whoever be who hired gang to attack carried out that part of business be afraid be so dick agreed fear in case that be in even worse hand than if ruffian here have taken well sir can furnish with clew only clew be that be most probably dark men man who be killed be undoubtedly one of must say that must probably be got up a foreign sailor well be something to go upon at rate will send round men at once to place by quay where sailor board if three four of have be together at place be sure to hear of moment have news will send to hotel thank see that can be of use at present will find ready to turn out again moment hear that have news when party returned to hotel sat talking matter over for upwards of hour be greatly discouraged for have little hope indeed of ever learning what have become of mark a have started out dick have told night porter that must not say what time might return that before house closed must have couple of bottle of spirit tumbler sent up to sitting room together with bread cold meat for might not return until morning must need something before went to bed a have have nothing since dinner at one o'clock want something to take taste of place out of one mouth tring said to dick a directly entered poured spirit into glass feel a queer a if have be hocussed indeed be feeling same be not until have eaten supper considerably lowered spirit in two bottle that began to talk two detective be principal speaker of be of opinion that only shadow of hope remaining rested upon mark unless finished before came round malcolm said must find awkward customer to deal with mr thorndyke have got head screwed on right if a say be indian mr chetwynd must think that if once come fairly round unless be tied up will be match for even with knife be only chance see even if watch do find out three four foreign sailor have be at one of boarding house did not turn up last night think will be much nearer will probably only have carried distance along wharf got to quiet place where there be big pile of wood something of sort then put knife into searched for diamond may be sure must find easily enough wherever have hidden then make off most likely for rotterdam hague must be at of place by time will mostly likely divide diamond get on board different craft bound for london hull indeed other port then ship for india from what mr thorndyke said did not want diamond to sell only to carry back to temple from be stolen twenty year ago chester be of precisely same opinion be afraid mr chetwynd added a rose to go to room for two three hour sleep only news that will get in morning be that mr thorndyke body have be found chapter xx at ten o'clock constable came with message from lieutenant to mr chetwynd that must be glad if must come down to watch house dick did not wake others freshening up by pouring jug of water over head went at once with constable have news asked eagerly a entered yes men returned hour ago at four of house went to foreign sailor have be lodging there for last day so yesterday afternoon have paid reckoning left then idea struck that must be a well to ask if have be seen on quay sent off fresh batch of men to make inquiry quarter of hour ago one of came back with news that have learned from sailor that have noticed dark colored foreigner whom took to be lascar sailor talking to boatman that have rowed off together to barge anchored short way out did not notice anything more about now must not be at surprised if fellow went off to arrange with bargeman for passage for four five comrade to port other might be anywhere must make difference to where barge be bound for doubt saw man again after brig be sighted told that must come on board soon after got dark told to have boat at stair see in case might not have carried mr thorndyke above fifty yard must probably get on board a one of party who have be drunk barge doubt got under way about nine o'clock be hour when tide be high last night during night indian must easily drop friend overboard may even have done so before got under way must have be easiest thing to do there must have be one at helm must have chosen moment when crew probably only three be below be afraid that be not cheering lookout have little doubt that be correct one have told men to find out what barge be lying at spot sailor pointed out if discover name be likely to be able to do there will be difficulty in finding out to whom belongs where be bound for then can follow up though there be little likelihood of finding murderer still on board thank very much for pain that be taking sir dick said be afraid that there be shadow of hope of finding poor friend alive have doubt that thing have happened exactly a suggest whole course of affair show how carefully be planned have hope that scruple about taking life must be felt by for moment will go back to hotel will be obliged if will let know a soon a obtain clew a to barge hour half later officer came round to room where dick chetwynd two pugilist be sitting detective have started out to make inquiry on own account taking with hanger on at hotel who spoke english barge name be julie said have cargo on board for rotterdam think best thing must be to take carriage drive there at once dick said can do sir think will be there before barge have something like eighteen hour start for wind have be time in east must say that must be there by eight o'clock morning know that must be of use at least must be doing something suppose must be there in four hour from to five even if barge be delayed got there first be very unlikely think that there must be remotest chance of finding villain on board reckon must a agreed launch body overboard even before got under way here may either have landed again before craft got under way pretending that have changed mind then walked across to hague to haarlem have gone on with barge for two hour even until daybreak if by time be near rotterdam may have stayed on board till got there if not may have landed finished journey on foot must certainly not have stopped on board after six seven o'clock morning must calculate that possibly might get on track at early hour morning set out in pursuit at once however will doubtless be satisfaction to to be moving at least will be able to overhaul barge when get to rotterdam to hear what boatman say chance be will not even have noticed that one of men who came on board be missing men may very well have made up long bundle carried on shore with three of may have carried fourth ashore in dark bargeman be unlikely to have noticed that number be le than when came on board however will be something for to find out when where fellow landed yes must certainly like to lay hand on though be afraid must find very hard to prove that have anything to do with affair think that also mr chetwynd morally may feel absolutely certain unless boatman noticed that one of number be missing when landed have at present evidence to connect with will set out a soon a other two men return told to be back soon after twelve will write to evening from rotterdam ah here be men door opened to stupefaction of party mark thorndyke entered room good heaven mark dick exclaimed springing forward seizing hand be really alive in flesh have given up for dead have be searching town for night be just going to set out for rotterdam in search of barge on believed be carried why seems almost miracle two prize fighter also came forward shook hand with pressure must have made most men shrink be a glad mr thorndyke gibbon said a if anyone have given thousand pound have never quite given up hope for a said to mr chetwynd if got shadow of chance must polish off nigger fellow in time be afraid that never must give chance well be glad sir mark be lieutenant of watch here dick said have be most kind have headed search have be made for night now tell about first of give something to drink for except water have have nothing since dinner yesterday be right dick be almost miracle even to that be here must not have given penny for chance of life can no more account for fact that be here than can mark drank off tumbler of weak spirit water that gibbon poured out for chetwynd rang bell ordered lunch to be brought up at once just at moment two detective came in be astonished delighted at finding mark there now said will tell a much a know be little enough when came to sens found lying on deck of craft of sort be long time before must at understand how got there think be pain from back of head that brought to mind must have be knocked down stunned in fight for time be very vague in brain a to came back suddenly recalled that have got separated be hitting out then there be crash yes must have be knocked down stunned must only suppose that in darkness confusion have be carried off taken on board without of missing hand foot be tied there be something shoved into mouth that prevented from speaking must think that must have be hour before quite recovered sens got thing fairly into mind then man with knife leant over made sign that if spoke must stab took gag out of mouth poured water down throat then put in again saw that be dark colored man then understood be hindoo who have got up attack upon have carried off have doubt have got diamond have sewn up in waistband of trouser wondered why be keeping be sure must stab presently throw overboard knew that have killed two soldier for sake of diamond if have be that have given water must not have have shadow of doubt about fate puzzled over why must have done so came to conclusion that dared not do on board because of crew that intended to take on shore somewhere there dispose of made many attempt to loosen rope must not give slightest at last think dozed off for time after have have water drew blanket something of sort over have be there before have only be pulled up a high a nose felt sure that be only done to prevent dutchman on boat seeing be bound gagged time pulled right over face when took off again must see be nearly morning for there be faint light in sky be moving about on deck presently saw one of sailor get into boat pull along hand over hand by rail until be close to then four lascar sort of chap must scarcely make out feature lifted lowered into boat got in did not attempt to struggle doubt have made up tale be mad something of sort thought have best pretend to be quiet peaceable till must see sort of chance of making fight for be few yard from shore man lifted out onto bank sailor then started to row back to barge carried few yard away then laid face downwards on grass now thought to myself be over be going to stab make off to surprise felt be doing something must not make out what to rope then there be quiet lay there must think for hour wondering why on earth did not finish at last made up mind to move turned round onto back a lay there must see one raising head looked round to amazement found that be alone be now almost light a craned head in direction assured that have gone then began to try again at rope to surprise found that be much looser than be before although still tight enough to give nearly hour work before got hand free then took almost a long to get rope off leg for have knotted in fearfully intricate way that be long time before must even discover where end be at last finished job stood up looked round quarter of mile off there be good sized town not soul must see till now have hardly thought of diamond put hand to waistband found a expected that be gone think felt nothing pleasure confounded thing have given trouble enough be well rid of why must have spared life must not imagine if have finished must have done without risk to when got ashore must have gone off with diamond without slightest fear of pursuit while now there be of course chance might follow recognize must know again lieutenant interrupted not in slightest be light enough to see that be dark from time boat came along blanket be over head except when gave water have chance of seeing of feature still if have gone straight to town saw reported matter to authority sent mounted men to port to warn not to let colored men embark might have given lot of trouble suppose of must ever have be caught after craft have shown in whole matter be certain that must have laid plan for escape so well that law must never have laid hand upon put hand mechanically to watch to see time to astonishment discovered that still have in pocket be equally surprised to find that money in trouser pocket be also untouched watch have of course stopped first of went down to water have good wash then proceeded to town going to hotel ordered breakfast why thought said that have have nothing to eat mark yes well have forgotten about breakfast people looked good deal surprised at englishman walking in in way while be eating breakfast two men who be suppose authority of kind who spoke english came questioned a have made up mind to say nothing more about affair merely told that have come for sail from amsterdam that wanted carriage to take back be evidently astonished at choosing dark night for trip said that have curiosity to see how boatman navigated vessel when there be lighthouse anything to steer by asked few more question then went away evidently thinking be little mad however must have spoken to landlord who in short time made sign that carriage be at door have avoided asking men name of place how far be from big town because must have made whole affair more singular be quarter past eight when started beyond fact that know by sun came pretty nearly due east have not slightest idea of road coachman must not speak word of english must say came about seven mile hour stopped once to bait horse so suppose that must have be between four five mile from rotterdam when landed lunch have by time be laid on table at dick invitation lieutenant joined be extraordinary story said that life must have be spared be altogether beyond comprehension still more so why must have left money watch whole story be extraordinary dick chetwynd said for have reason to believe that fellow at least one two of have be patiently watching for chance of carrying off diamond for twenty year when friend told of ten day ago did not believe that must be possible have certainly shown that be correct in opinion mark then related history of jewel surprising pugilist detective a much a lieutenant be extraordinary indeed latter said must not have believed possible that men must devote so many year to such purpose that must have succeeded in tracing diamond in spite of precaution taken by uncle afterwards by must seem that from time landed in england after father must have be watched almost night day can understand now why did not take watch money evidently acted from sort of religious enthusiasm be ordinary thief a evidently did not hesitate to kill can not understand why must have added to risk by sparing be what puzzle mark agreed be thinking over while be driving here now let hear about fight dick how did come out of a well a must be expected gibbon tring got heavy blow with cudgel a indeed did more le did great execution eleven fellow be left senseless on ground one of black fellow who came over with be killed other ten be in prison of did best managed to leave mark on eight others who be in consequence picked out be also in jail dick went on to relate particular of search see friend here have traced to barge found out destination if have come ten minute later must have found that have just started for rotterdam be only waiting for chester malcolm to return to set out be sorry mark that have lost diamond not so much because be gone for can well understand to be thoroughly glad to be rid of such dangerous article because have carried off in teeth after have be specially retained to protect certainly thought that with bodyguard be absolutely safe from number of hindoo yes made regular mess of mr thorndyke gibbon said never felt so certain of winning battle a did that must not be touched a long a be looking after tring if have be asked must have said that must have taken on dozen foreigner easily mr chetwynd be handy with fist too though have weight reach two other friend be pretty well accustomed to deal with rough customer a for tring make one feel small to know that have be bested by handful of nigger hindoo whatever chap be whom good sized boy of twelve ought to be able to polish off now mark what be to be done next dick chetwynd asked next thing will be to get back a soon a can dick for one have have enough of holland to last for lifetime be afraid gentleman lieutenant said will have to wait day two before can leave have nineteen men in prison there will be meeting of magistrate afternoon now have come back mr thorndyke charge against wo be a serious a must have be before be guilty of desperate premeditated assault upon six passenger on arrival here have already admitted that be paid for work a among be of worst character in city may be sure that now have got fairly in hand will not let go be so simple affair that investigation ought not to take long will want to find out if can who acted a intermediary between hindoo prisoner must think that two meeting ought to be sufficient for present be afraid that there may then be long remand that will either have to remain here to come over again must be horrible nuisance dick said still must be better to come back again than to wait here indefinitely anyhow suppose must be necessary for of to come back again must not mind if must be arranged for to be here again in month time mark agreed for to tell truth be going to be married in le than three week a have intended to come to brussels afterwards to travel for while must make visit here without greatly putting out will try arrange mr thorndyke will be glad mark said if can manage to get men sentenced without going into question of diamond at treat matter a mere attempt at robbery surely must not be necessary to bring question of being carried away into matter at can give evidence be knocked down stunned be robbed of jewel have about be object of attack think must have to admit that lieutenant said must come out that attack be organized one well if must must mark said reluctantly then see end of question must be asked thing might be delayed while search be being made for men who stole bracelet well will keep out of inquiry if can lieutenant said meeting will be at three o'clock will send man to take to town hall at appointed hour party proceeded to court eighteen prisoner under strong guard having be brought in six magistrate took place on bench rest of court be crowded fray on wharf number of capture having created stir in city have arranged that tring must first give evidence did lieutenant of watch acting a interpreter though most of magistrate understood english appearance of prisoner created quite sensation in court for injury that have received be now even more conspicuous than have be when be first captured of have to be led into court eye being completely closed others have head bandaged showed sign of tremendous punishment tring related that with five others have come ashore together one of companion have row on board ship have crossed in with lascar sailor who be passenger kept together a be crossing wharf thinking possibly man might attempt to stab companion be walking behind tring went on when lascar jumped suddenly out from among men standing about be about to stab companion when hit just in time went down then there be rush got separated did a well a must until watch came up be that know about be lascar among prisoner one of magistrate asked lieutenant of watch sir when picked up by one of men be found to be dead blow have apparently killed instantly other five then gave evidence be similar to of tring save being in front of knew nothing of attack by lascar knew about be that there be sudden rush upon by number of men armed with bludgeon that be separated that defended until guard came up of watch then gave evidence told how on arriving at spot eleven of prisoner be found lying senseless how on recovering be taken to watch house where several of be recognized a notoriously bad character have admitted that be paid to make attack be apparently result of private enmity of person person unknown to one more of attacked lieutenant then related step that have taken to capture others connected with attack that found eight men bearing mark of fray that be also notorious character associate of prisoner first taken first witness be again questioned five of said that so far a knew have personal enemy mark who be last to get into witness box said that have enemy that uncle of who be in british indian service have sort of feud with member of sect there on account of jewel that have purchased have declared be stolen from temple two soldier through whose hand thing have passed have be successively killed by uncle have to day of death believed that vengeance must one day fall upon can only suppose continued mark have inherited enmity bore a inherited jewel that attack be really designed solely against consequence might have be fatal to have not be for strength courage of fellow passenger did come with for protection mr thorndyke to extent yes fact be have for time be convinced that be followed about by native of india remembering what uncle have said on subject became to degree apprehensive thought a well to leave london for short time that attack be really instigated by men have doubt whatever since a have heard be begun by lascar who tried to stab one of companion who received knockdown blow caused death from one of others be well known fact that people will cherish for many year determination to avenge injury however hope that after failure of attempt upon life will hear more of be knife found on prisoner magistrate asked lieutenant of watch sir carried club told that have be especially ordered not to take knife have indeed be searched before came out what impression do gather from mr thorndyke impression be sir that desired to overpower with to beat down in order to carry out revenge upon after consultation magistrate who have before spoken said prisoner will be remanded be necessary that must find out who be chief culprit who bribed gang a soon a prisoner be taken out of court mark slipped across to magistrate accompanied by lieutenant a interpreter hope gentleman that presence here will not be necessary for must be matter of extreme inconvenience may say that marriage be fixed for today three week hence can well imagine want to return a soon a possible two of men be a have heard bow street officer whose presence must not well be spared magistrate again consulted together evidence have be taken down by clerk of court certainly must not require presence at remand whether must do so at trial must of course depend upon whether men own guilt having be taken red handed be likely enough will do will consent therefore to leaving if will give undertaking to return for trial if presence be necessary that will bring with man who struck down lascar who commenced fray one of others will do willingly mark replied be much obliged to for consideration will be traveling for time after marriage will a pas through belgium after marriage give route intend to take address at letter will find if send sufficiently long notice will at once return for trial chapter xxi managed very well mark dick said kept well within limit of truth without bringing real fact of attack upon into case well see dick after working a detective one get into way of telling story with smallest amount of deviation possible from truth what will fellow get done to lieutenant must say that will get two three year imprisonment only charge now be rioting assault be lucky for that have club instead of knife for must have brought matter under head of attempted murder matter of gem be not important in case there be sure to be great fuss search for missing indian suppose will soon be off home now yes will find out tonight what vessel leaf for england tomorrow take berth in first sail for london be too late to think of starting evening indeed feel that want long night rest for did not sleep much last night have not quite recovered from crack on head on return to hotel mark sent out man to inquire at shipping office finding that bark must sail at nine o'clock next morning went down took berth sailed in next day voyage home be rapid one for wind blew steadily from east vessel made passage to mouth of river in two day next took up to london will call round tomorrow next day gibbon with check for mark said a prepared to go ashore sir be of one mind that must not take went over to prevent being robbed of sparkler to see that came to harm well thing be lost got knocked down carried away be thanks to that be alive now be mortifying job that with two detective to watch over thing with to fight must have be fairly beat by few black nigger if there have be bungling on part gibbon there might be something in what say one must have foreseen before have be on shore two minute must have be attacked in way did that men must do a be shown by condition of fellow who be taken be just a much separated from a be from fact that be surprised a be be really due to not determining to stay on board until morning must no doubt have done with captain permission never struck for moment that must be attacked in force thought probable that attempt at assassination must be made certainly did not seem probable that must be attempted while be with be not in slightest degree to blame for part of agreement be carried out to satisfaction will certainly carry out mine a have arrived home safe sound well governor be very good of tell will go against grain for to take money on landing mark parted with dick chetwynd who have arranged to drop mark bag at lodging on way home at once took hackney coach to islington millicent gave cry of delight a entered room be back earlier than expected mark told before started that wind be in east that might be long time getting to amsterdam unless changed have be watching vane on church have be pointing east ever since well have sold diamond hope said after first greeting be over have bad news for millicent jewel have be stolen well doe not make much difference mark have much more than enough without so bother in least how did happen well be rather long story will tell when mr cunningham be here so a not to have to go over twice how be dress getting on suppose be getting on right said have done nothing for last two day try on see put out to three milliner three seem to reach same point together start after breakfast take about two hour at place know what trouble have given by hurrying thing on so unreasonably well be better to have done over said than to have thing hanging over for couple of month be what mr cunningham say now want to hear about adventure will call down only think mr cunningham millicent said presently with laugh after have returned with silly boy have actually let diamond be stolen from really millicent yes indeed fancy not being fit to be trusted to look after however tell be of consequence know how went must not tell story until came down be sorry to say be true mr cunningham although can assure that really can not blame for carelessness stupidity knew when started that there be very great risk took what seemed to possible precaution for in addition to dick chetwynd going with took two detective from bow street two prize fighter exclamation of surprise broke from lady yet in spite of that thing be stolen millicent said how on earth did do must have sewn up in pocket inside dress sewed up in waistband of trouser millicent yet managed in spite of to steal now must begin by telling whole history of diamond will understand why thought necessary to take strong party with then told repeating history colonel have given father of diamond conviction that have that have be followed by hindoo instruction have given for disposal of bracelet a know said nothing happened to confirm uncle belief that there be men over here in search of diamond during father life since then have come to same conclusion that have felt positive that be being constantly followed wherever went a soon a heard where treasure be began to take precaution in power avoided going to bank after first visit there a know must not bring thing for to look at got dick chetwynd to go there open case take out diamond did not bring away with fetched from there morning started went down took passage for at shipping office pugilist detective took passage for so that hoped however closely be followed must not learn be taking to amsterdam be very wrong mark very wrong indeed millicent broke in have right to run terrible risk must have be better for to have taken diamond thrown into thames must not have improved matter said indian must not have known have got rid of must have continued effort to find must always have be in danger instead of getting over once for however did not think that there be danger going over a did with two of best prize fighter in england to say nothing of detective who be men who be with when caught bastow only danger be that might be stabbed a must know be use stabbing unless must search quietly that must not do unless be alone in lonely neighborhood have made up mind not to stir out unless whole party be with found out when got on board that in spite of precaution have taken have discovered that be going to sail for amsterdam must only have done by following dick a well a there be dark faced foreign sailor who have doubt be hindoo already on board saw in boat watching start be unpleasant a felt sure that must not have known have with detective pugilist still felt that must be able to hing when got to amsterdam then told whole story of attack of being carried away of unexpected release of search have be made for arrest of eighteen of assailant millicent grew pale a continued burst into tear when heard of being prisoner in hand of hindoo will never let go out of sight again mark exclaimed when have finished be bad enough before when be searching for man here used to be terribly anxious be nothing to well there be end of now millicent men have got diamond will soon be on way to india if have not started already nasty thing said will never like diamond again will always remind of terrible danger that have run be extraordinary that for twenty year four five men must be spending life waiting for chance of getting back expect there be so many a probably there be only one must have difficulty in learning that father have not received extraordinary gem from uncle probably supposed that must not be taken out from wherever might be until came of age after death of father might suppose must take out that at rate must go to whoever have see that be right then perhaps engaged dozen lascar there be plenty of at dock have watched went do know that believe once owed life to how be that mark well be captured by fellow who suspected to be bow street runner think that must have gone very hard with if party of five six prize fighter have not broken into house pretty nearly killed men in whose hand be rescued said that have heard of danger from foreign sailor who called at gibbon with whom be in habit of boxing told about see until learned where jewel be life be valuable to for possibly be only person who knew where be hidden so really think have reason for bearing grudge against saved life in first place spared at what be distinct risk to on other hand be content with regaining bracelet not even a told taking watch purse see with be matter of religion have animosity against personally have doubt must have stabbed without slightest compunction have there be other way of getting thing still think that owe debt of gratitude to rather than reverse after loss of bracelet be not serious one to be glad be gone millicent said say have already caused death of two men if have succeeded in selling ca help thinking that money must have brought ill fortune to be heartily glad that diamond be gone mark suppose be very handsome be magnificent said dick cotter agreed that have never seen equal fancy that must have be worth great deal more than father valued at well doe not matter at there be history attached to others hope mark not in way dear be bought a colonel told father in ordinary course of thing doubt be obtained at capture of of native prince treasury be solely on account of bracelet that have anxiety can wear others if have fancy for keeping without shadow of risk mark will sell one think that will ever care to wear jewel again if be ever presented at court have to do so must rather that must buy new one fresh from jeweler shop than wear anything have come from india to morrow will go to bank with to see then will take to first class jeweler get to value visit be paid next day millicent mr cunningham be somewhat disappointed at jewel be hardly fair to see like philip cotter said must look very different if reset indian jewel have ever seen show to advantage in native setting many of stone be very large without knowing anything about must say that be worth pound at say colonel thorndyke valued be not likely to be mistaken be evidently judge of matter must hardly be likely to be far wrong will go with to jeweler mark millicent said in first place will not feel quite comfortable until know that be out of hand in next place must like to hear what think of have number of indian jewel that wish to value for mark said a carrying case entered jeweler shop be collected by colonel thorndyke uncle of mine during service in india jeweler took with into room behind shop case be opened man took out sixty eight small parcel contained opened one after other will need very careful examination of before can form estimate of value said after inspecting of more important piece of jewelry carefully be most magnificent collection have be properly cut in first place must have be worth very large sum unfortunately indian prince think more of size than of lustre have stone cut very much too flat to show off full brilliancy of large one must certainly advise to be recut for what will lose in weight will gain in beauty value however sir will go through give estimate of selling value of piece need not say that ought to be reset in prevailing fashion gold be in case unnecessarily massive will go distance towards defraying expense when will call again mark asked must be glad if can give week jeweler said of thing for instance that great pearl necklace must appraise without much difficulty gem must be taken out of setting before must form fair idea of value then will call in week time mark said be in particular hurry about must rather that be in care than mine yes if cracksman got word that there be such collection a in private house must need couple of men with pistol to keep guard over week later mark again called have list ready for sir will see that be not marked according to setting according to size value thus see largest stone be priced separately smaller one be in group according to weight total come to pound know whether at equal expectation may say have shown stone to two three of principal diamond merchant that price have put down be at must be willing to buy possibly must be worth more have merchant here together spent hour going through sum put down be at one other be willing to purchase quite answer expectation mark said uncle estimate indeed be somewhat higher doubtless judged at price must fetch in india well sir authorize to close with offer to dispose of for will give written authority to do so in meantime wish to buy suite of jewel a wedding present tiara necklace bracelet want diamond to be among be afraid have nothing in stock without diamond of course have necklace bracelet of almost stone that might select have complete set without diamond effect must be somber few lady must like have unpleasant association with diamond mark said on point be quite determined if used pearl instead of diamond effect might be a good care whether stone be emerald ruby at rate must like to see then perhaps might be able to make set on same model several superb set be brought in mark selected one of emerald diamond what must be price of set asked that set be pound sir stone be exceptionally fine one if substituted pearl of equal size for diamond must cost considerably le must not give exact price until be made must say that must be about pound very well then will take that how long will be making must not like to say le than three month at earliest will require time to collect a fine set of emerald a indeed think that most probably will use emerald greater part of collect others to take place at leisure know whether best plan must not be to take diamond out substitute pearl there must be difficulty in getting in case might have ready for in month think will be best plan need not be in particular hurry about marriage will take place in le than fortnight after will probably be three four month before return to london will get to keep thing until come back have sold jewel millicent

back can see about entirely refurnishing perhaps adding room to need not go down until complete change have be made will be able to manage somehow other quite agree with that anything will be better than going back to house for day two before wedding on voyage back from holland mark have talked matter over with dick chetwynd said that thought of taking room for mr cunningham millicent at reigate

far more easy to search tent of officer than of soldier who sleep surrounded by comrade thought that there be hurry now must need patience must be sure to find have not calculated that must have

bound to service ' got up almost blindly felt in cabinet found coin piece of paper feeling of exultation came over that after nearly twenty year must succeed in carrying out vow taking bracelet back to god descended ladder crept in back door by have come out went up to room where have kept light burning examined treasure then saw that have be in vain be doubtless key to mystery until clew be given be absolutely useless sat for hour staring at must have gone back replaced in cabinet left a have be before dared not enter room again next day heard say that suspected that talk with father have be overheard that man who have earlier in evening before shot at have returned while listening have heard something said about hiding place thought that must find sort of treasure there thought that in talk father might have told how to use thing though have not caught be therefore important that must have back again so went into room after inquest be over placed thing in hiding place again then thinking over determined to leave service must be trying to find treasure must watch must not do a long a be house servant so came up to london thought have sailed for india did not go hired four lascar men of own religion paid to watch movement that made to see where visited where went paid well served well be so that be able to bring men to help when for must have lost life be for to extent have followed for soon found out that be on search for man who have fired through window who believed have killed father rather than for jewel knew that might run into danger partly because loved partly because be possible that must be essential for coin piece of paper to be produced in order that treasure might be obtained kept guard over when th of august approached be on watch felt sure that must take possible precaution while have bracelet in possession knew who be principal friend banker son mr chetwynd on th of august everything went on a usual on following day banker son came to a soon a left went to lawyer afterwards to banker felt sure now that be at bank that jewel have be placed that have be waiting till young memsahib birthday for news that might be taken out then went to mr chetwynd went to bank have doubt that be to take out for after one of men never took eye off when be outside of house afterwards went to place where men used to fight man who be watching went in have beer saw talking with big man used to fight with in parlor behind bar watcher went out to follow left to watch man found that mr chetwynd went to shipping office in tower street then guessed that intended to take bracelet at once across sea went found out that vessel be sailing in two day to amsterdam took passage for man in cheap cabin asked to look at list of passenger a believed that friend must be sailing by there be two men name down together in one handwriting among first class passenger guessed that be mr chetwynd also saw name of big man have heard long before down in list of passenger name next to in same handwriting did not know name guessed that be of fighting men that be going to look after until have got rid of diamond on morning that be to sail one of lascar be on board thought possible that in order to throw anyone who might be following off scent might at last moment go ashore that mr chetwynd might take diamond over so watched saw on deck with friend other three lascar then took passage that evening in craft for rotterdam got to amsterdam two day before ship arrived went to different house going separately into worst part of town soon found man who kept gambling den who be man who must be trusted offered thousand franc to collect twenty five men who be to be paid hundred franc to be ready if ship arrived after dark to attack two passenger must point out to did not want to be hurt so bargained that knife be to be left behind that be to supply men only with club if ship came in in daylight be to be attacked first time went out after dark know how be carried out have two more men with than have expected thought that with sudden rush might all be separated know rest moment be knocked down three others carried to boat have be lying near stair took off to barge in have arranged must be taken to rotterdam told that be drunken man who have be stunned in fight in public house a soon a be off searched found diamond then a know put ashore crossed to england night two day later sailed in ship brahmapootra be not afraid of telling because know that diamond will not shine on god arm until fear of search inquiry be over task will be done when hand over to man who hold office once held then will bear penance imposed on for having broken caste in way for having taken life for rest of day will wander a fakir through india will be supported by knowledge have done duty to god have sacrificed in service will ever be grief to that in so doing be necessary to sacrifice life of one who have ever shown kindness may wonder why have written felt that must own truth to that must know that if in course of duty to god be misfortune to slay father have twice saved life just a three time saved that of colonel sahib uncle there be silence for little time after mark have finished reading be strange story indeed mr greg said be not for to judge man have acted according to light none can do more sacrificed life solely to service of god well knowing that even be successful reward must be penance suffering life of what can not be misery to man brought up a have be to consider of highest holiest rank of people think mark need say think anything harshly of certainly not mark agreed can understand according to view of matter anything stood between goal be obstacle to be swept aside assuredly there be premeditation in killing of father have doubt that man be attached to that killed not to save own life in order that mission might be carried out quite so mark be done in same spirit if may say so abraham must have sacrificed son at order of god what year of devotion that man have passed through accustomed a see to lofty position to respect veneration of around became servant performed duty be in opinion not only humiliating polluting destructive to caste rendered outcast even among lowest of people do not think so mr thorndyke millicent who be cry quietly looked up can only think of a man who twice saved mark life said understand why have wished to tell story rector went on to mark wish to know arthur bastow did not add to other crime that be spared from being murderer of father from want of will on part a know killed many others last hour two before put end to own life still be glad that terrible crime be not seemed to be so revolting unnatural be squire father who have given living to father squire have be friend in greatest of trial have given shelter home in old age be glad at least that man evil a be be spared last crime of grossest ingratitude well mark dick chetwynd said cheerfully in order to turn subject be heartily glad that have got to bottom of jewel mystery have be puzzling over time that have be away have never be able to understand how in spite of precaution that took must have found out that jewel be at cotter that have on board with above why spared life when must so easily safely have put out of way be certainly strange that while be thinking over everything connected with jewel idea that ramoo be leading spirit in whole business must never once have occurred to month later when mark went up to town called at leadenhall street of course have not heard of arrival of brahmapootra at madras yet may ask when left cape never left cape sir clerk replied there be very grave fear for safety spoke surinam gave mail for england when latter be eight day out from cape surinam reported that day later encountered terrible gale lost several spar narrowly escaped being blown onto african coast since then have have news of brahmapootra number of indiaman have arrived since latest came in only yesterday up to time when left news have be received of ship three small craft have be sent up coast week before to make inquiry for have returned without being able to obtain intelligence have seen no wreckage on coast although have gone several hundred mile beyond where have spoken surinam therefore there can be little doubt that foundered with hand during gale have near relative on board hope sir near relative there be one on board in whom be greatly interested here be card must feel greatly obliged if must write line must hear anything of will do so sir have have innumerable inquiry from friend relative of on board although of late have be obliged to say that there can no longer be hope that will ever be heard of not day pass many person still come
