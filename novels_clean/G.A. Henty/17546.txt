have everything after when one have so much to be proud of one need not grumble because everything be not just a one must like yes have much to be proud of francis hammond agreed be marvellous that people of scattered islet must be master of sea that alliance must be coveted by power in europe that must be greatest trading community in world if be not english must like to be venetian speaker be standing at edge of water in front of palace of st mark in piazza behind throng of people be walking to fro gossiping over latest news from constantinople last rumour a to doings of hated rival of venice genoa purport of letter have a everyone knew be brought by bishop of treviso from pope to seignory moon be shining brightly overhead glittering in water of lagoon be broken into innumerable little wavelet by continual crossing recrossing of gondola dotting surface there be constant arrival departure of boat from step fifty yard to right of spot where speaker be standing where have stationed about halfway between landing step canal running down by side of ducal palace there be few people about francis hammond be lad between fifteen sixteen year old father be merchant of london be man of great enterprise energy have four year before determined to leave junior partner in charge of business in london to come out for time to venice so a to buy eastern stuff in dealt at headquarters of trade instead of paying such price a agent of venetian trader might demand in london have succeeded beyond expectation in venice there be constantly bargain to be purchased from ship returning laden with spoil of captured genoese merchantman taken in sack of eastern seaport price too asked by trader with town of syria black sea be fraction of charged when good arrived in london be true that occasionally of cargo be lost on homeward voyage captured by genoese moorish pirate even allowing for profit of trade be excellent english merchant occupied good position in venice promptness of payment integrity of dealing made generally respected fact that be engaged in trade be drawback to social position in city in of others trade be considered honourable where member of even most aristocratic family be with scarcely exception engaged in commerce there be many foreign merchant settled in venice for from first republic have encouraged stranger to take up residence there have granted several privilege advantage between venice england there have always be good feeling although jealous of foreigner england have granted venetian liberty to trade in london southampton other town a far back a year relation have always be cordial a there be ground for jealousy rivalry between two people whereas interference of france germany austria hungary in affair of italy have frequently caused uneasiness to venice have on several occasion embroiled with one other of three last named power france have a yet taken very minor part in continual war be waged between rival city of italy during crusade there have be close alliance between venice troop of two nation fighting together at siege of constantinople causing temporary overthrow of greek empire of east rise of venice have be rapid owed advancement to combination of circumstance in first place insular position rendered almost impervious to attack have therefore occasion to keep on foot army be able to throw strength on to sea where genoa be only formidable rival in second place mercantile spirit extensive trade with east brought in steady influx of wealth gold enabled to purchase ally to maintain lengthy struggle without faltering to emerge unscathed from war exhausted resource crippled power of rival third source of success lay in spirit of population like rome in early day be never cast down by revers misfortune only nerved to further exertion after defeat rose stronger than before cause more than all contributed to give to venice ascendancy among city of italy be form of government democratic at first a among community have gradually assumed character of close oligarchy although nominally ruled by council containing large number of member destiny be actually in hand of doge elected for life council of ten chosen from great body of council thus have from first be free from faction be bane of genoa florence of great family have from time to time come more prominently to front than others none have attained predominant political power beyond few street tumult of slight importance venice have not suffered from popular tumult uprising played so prominent part in history of rival thus undisturbed by discord at home venice have be able to give attention care to interest abroad affair conducted a be by wisest citizen with single eye to benefit of state have be distinguished by rare sagacity object have be single uniform to protect own interest to prevent one city on mainland attaining such preponderance a must render dangerous neighbour hence be always ready to ally with weaker against stronger to aid with money men state struggling against ambitious neighbour acting on principle by turn assisted padua against verona verona against padua of when threatened by growing power of milan at end of war generally came out with increased territory added importance be probable that community be ever governed for hundred of year with such uniform wisdom sagacity a be venice advantage be not without drawback vigilance of council of ten in repressing plot not unfrequently set on foot by enemy of republic resulted in adoption of hateful system of espionage city be pervaded with spy even secret denunciation be attended to slightest expression of discontent against ruling authority be severely punished on other hand comparatively slight attention be paid to private crime assassination be of frequent occurrence unless victim happened to be very powerfully connected notice be taken when man be found to be missing from usual place corpse be discovered floating in lagoon consequently crime of kind be in great majority of case committed with impunity even when traced author if possessed of powerful protector seldom suffered greater punishment than temporary banishment after standing for time on piazzetta two lad turned entering square of saint mark mingled with crowd be motley one noble in silk satin jostled with fisherman of lagoon native of coast island owned sway of venice greek from constantinople tartar merchant from crimea tyrians inhabitant of island of aegean be present in considerable number while

asserted that polo sword be undrawn mocenigo family brought forward man who swore that be one of first to arrive pick up sword place in scabbard to prevent being lost doubt lied a mocenigo influence in council be greater than of morosini story be accepted however public feeling be so strong that must not do le than sentence ruggiero to two year banishment suppose have just expired have returned from constantinople have bad reputation before affair took place a connection be so powerful suppose will be received a if nothing have happened there be plenty of others a bad a be be scandalous thing francis hammond said indignantly just because have got powerful connection men must be allowed to do almost with impunity thing for ordinary man must be hung there ought to be one law for rich a well a poor so there be a far a state be concerned companion replied noble who plot against state be a certain of place in lowest dungeon a fisherman who have done same in other respect there be naturally difference why naturally francis retorted belong to powerful family giustiniani father be only trader see that naturally have more right to get stabbed in back than have to get put out of way naturally perhaps not matteo laughed see have become second nature to here in venice seriously admit that present state of thing have grown to be scandal that doings of of class ought to be put down with strong hand well will say goodnight now english boy said father doe like being out after ten keep up english habit of shutting up early have not learned to turn night into day a do here in venice bell have just tolled hour francis father said a entered did think be quite so late father piazza be crowded really think there be one person in venice who go to bed so early a do be so pleasant in moonlight after heat of day be true enough francis men be meant to sleep at night to work in day think father carried too far when rang curfew at eight be quite late enough for honest man to be about in street hour of early morning be just a pleasant far more healthy than of evening especially in place like where mist rise from water to say nothing of chance of meeting band of wild gallant on way homewards heated with wine of getting stab in back from midnight assassin however blame venice for enjoying while can will have more serious matter to attend to soon be at peace with one at present father thought when signed treaty with austria after year fighting be going to have rest for time be only beginning of trouble francis council knew well be why made such term with austria a did knew that austria be only acting in accord with hungary padua genoa others be not ready to begin so austria came on own account to get what booty plunder must storm be gathering will burst before long let stand talking here longer be high time for to be in bed though francis retired to room be more than hour before got into bed window looked down upon one of canal running into grand canal gondola lighted by lantern by torch held by servitor passed constantly backwards forward beneath window by leaning out must see passing light of on grand canal snatch of song laughter came up to sometimes note of musical instrument air be soft balmy felt inclination for sleep francis thought over what father have said of probability of war a sat at window wished that be couple of year older must take part in struggle venetian fleet have performed such marvel of valour that in day when military service be almost sole avenue to distinction fortune desire to take part in naval expedition promised unusual opportunity of gaining credit renown be most natural thing possible for boy of spirit francis be well built lad of nearly sixteen have until left london when about twelve year old taken full share in rough sport formed so good training for youth of england in citizen of london be in way behind rest of kingdom have practised shooting with light bow arrow in company with boy of own age in field outside city wall have engaged in many rough tussle with light club quarterstaff whole time except for hour two daily have a son of well to do citizen spent in learning to read write have be occupied in game exercise of one kind other since arrival in venice have not altogether discontinued former habit at earnest solicitation father have permitted to attend school of arm where son of patrician well to do merchant learned use of sword dagger to hurl javelin wield mace battleaxe be besides frequenter of of school where old soldier gave private lesson in arm to such a must afford skill strength of english lad excited slight envy among young venetian noble often too must go out to one of sandy islet there setting up mark practise with bow muscle too have gained strength hardness by rowing be constant habit of evening when well away from crowded canal in gondola with son assistant of father gondolier to take oar for have thoroughly mastered difficult accomplishment of rowing well in gondola only did when far out from city when darkness of evening must prevent figure from being recognized by of acquaintance for venetian of good family must demean by handling oar francis however accustomed to row upon thames must see reason why must not do same in gondola in time companion must send boat dancing over water at rate enabled to overtake distance most pair oared boat after breakfast next morning went down to step where beppo giuseppi in black cloth suit with red sash round waist be waiting with gondola in mr hammond be going out to malamocco to examine cargo have day before arrived from azoph giuseppi jumped ashore have heard of just gondola to suit messer francisco can get bargain what be like giuseppi belongs to man out at lido be built for race two year ago owner fell sick be unable to start have not got strong again want to sell boat be far too light for ordinary work say be almost like eggshell will be able to send along grandly cost four ducat will sell for two be capital giuseppi gondola be well enough for father be very heavy evening will row over to lido look at few minute later mr hammond came down beppo son took off jacket in snow white shirt black trouser set off by red scarf red ribbon round broad hat took place on bow stern mr hammond sat down on cushion in middle of boat with easy noiseless motion gondola glided away from stair francis with little sigh turned away strolled off for couple of hour work with preceptor with whom have continued study since came to venice work consisted chiefly of learning various language for in day there be little else to learn latin be almost universally spoken by educated men in southern europe greek italian spaniard frenchman be able to converse in common medium french francis understood for be language in use in court among upper class in england italian picked up naturally during residence spoke with facility of native must now converse freely in latin have knowledge of german at same school be many lad of good venetian family be here that have first made acquaintance of matteo giustiniani who be now most intimate friend matteo like young noble of venice be anxious to excel in military exercise have none of ardour for really hard work distinguished friend admired latter strength activity must not bring to imitate in exercise by that strength be attained have often remonstrated with upon fondness for rowing be not seemly francisco for gentleman to be labouring like common gondolier men be paid for doing what pleasure there can be in standing up working that oar till be drenched with perspiration can not understand mind getting hot in school of arm because one can not learn to use sword dagger without be quite thing from tugging at oar like matteo see how strong have made muscle not of arm only leg back often say envy strength might be just a strong if chose to work a do besides be delightful when be accustomed to to feel gondola flying away under stroke prefer feeling fly away under one else stroke francisco be pleasant enough grant very thought of working a do throw into perspiration must like to be a strong a be to work a gondolier be too high price to pay for that evening francis crossed lagoon in gondola with giuseppi to inspect boat have heard of be just what wanted in appearance differed in way from ordinary gondola be mere shell timber planking be extremely light weight of boat be little more than third of of other craft have be built like working gondola instead of in form of mostly used for racing because owner have intended after race be over to plank inside strengthen for everyday work race have never come off boat lay just a have come from hand of builder except have be painted black like other gondola to prevent plank from opening when owner have determined to part with have given fresh coat of paint have put in water that seam might close up like parting with young fisherman to whom belonged said tried once twice went like wind got fever in bone be unlikely to race again time be hard must part with francis giuseppi gave trial be delighted with speed ease with flew through water on return francis at once paid price asked for father made handsome allowance in order that might be able to mix without discomfort with lad of good family whom met at preceptor at school of arm francis did not care for strolling in piazza sitting for hour sipping liquor still le did care for dress finery consequently have always plenty of money to indulge in own special fancy a soon a bargain be completed giuseppi took place in old gondola while francis took oar in new acquisition found to satisfaction that with scarcely effort must dart ahead of companion leave far behind by two gondola be fastened side by side behind gaily painted post in almost venetian house be driven into canal close to step behind gondola belonging to house lie safe from injury by passing craft have bought gondola father francis said next morning be very light fast craft got cheap see what wanted gondola for francis use mine very much be always welcome to take when want yes father often use in evening be just time when one want to go out very often only take beppo with when go on business often want boat must take with giuseppi besides gondola be very solid one like passing people young people always want to go fast mr hammond said why ca make out however francis be not sorry that have got boat of own for have happened several time lately that when in evening have gone down intending to row round to piazzetta have found boat gone have have to walk now will be able to rely on finding beppo asleep in boat at step in future since have boat of own will not be so particular a to being in at ten so much mind being out on water only must promise that will not be in street after hour there be frequent broil a evening get on not to mention danger of cutthroat in unfrequented lane if will promise that will never be about street after past nine will give leave to stay out on water till later hour when come in late be careful always to close bar door make more noise than can help in coming up to room francis be much pleased with concession for obligation to return at ten o'clock just when temperature be most delightful grand canal at gayest have be very irksome to a to prohibition against being in street of venice after half past nine felt that hardship whatever a found amusement in strolling in crowded piazza chapter conspiracy who be lady matteo francis asked friend one evening a latter who be sitting with in gondola while giuseppi rowed along grand canal half rose saluted two girl in passing gondola be distant cousin of mine maria giulia polani only returned short time since from corfu father be one of richest merchant of city have for last three year be living in corfu be headquarters of trade family be old one have given doge to venice be two of richest heiress for have brother mother died soon after birth of giulia look very young francis said maria be about sixteen sister two year younger there will be lack of suitor for hand for although family be not politically powerful a used to be wealth must cause to be gladly received in very first family who be middle aged lady sitting between be only duenna matteo said carelessly have be with since be child father place great confidence in have need to for maria will ere long be receiving bouquet perfumed note from many young gallant can quite fancy that francis said for be very pretty a well a very rich a far a have observed two thing go very often together however doubt by time father have pretty well arranged in mind whom be to marry expect so agreed matteo be worst of being born of good family have got to marry one of father choice not own choice be determined simply by desire to add to political influence of family to strengthen distant tie to obtain powerful connection suppose be same everywhere matteo do think that man woman ought to have voice in matter of such importance to think so too at present time matteo laughed suppose that will be of opinion when have family of son daughter to marry gondola of yours must be fast one indeed francisco for with only one rower keep up with almost pair oared boat boy be not exerting to utmost can fly along can tell matteo will come out in evening when giuseppi take oar have have ten day now have not come across anything can hold for moment be always useful matteo said to have fast boat be invaluable in case have be getting into scrape have one of boat of city watch in chase of hope sha' want for purpose of sort francis answered laughing think be likely to give cause to city watch to chase think be francisco there be never saying at rate be always useful to be able to go fast if necessary if did want to get away think there be many pair oared gondola afloat must overtake though good four oar might do so giuseppi be so accustomed to other stroke now that though in heavy boat might not be match for two men in light craft like where weight doe not count for so much must not mind entering for race against two best gondolier on canal in ordinary boat few evening later francis be returning homewards at about half past ten when in passing along quiet canal boat be hailed from shore will take messer francisco giuseppi asked in low voice for more than once have late in evening taken fare francis rowed like giuseppi in shirt in darkness be often taken for pair oared gondola on lookout for fare francis have sometimes accepted offer because be amusement to see where passenger wished to go to guess whether be lover hastening to keep appointment gambler on visit to quiet locality where high play went on unknown to authority simply one who have by error missed own gondola be anxious to return home made difference to way rowed be always possible that adventure be to be met with fare paid be not unwelcome addition to giuseppi fund yes may a well take replied to giuseppi question be in hurry to get to bed suppose man who have hailed said a boat drew up against wall of canal doe not make much difference to if be well paid to keep awake giuseppi said upon such occasion be always spokesman know san nicolo yes know giuseppi said be long row six mile if be foot will have to wait there for hour two will give ducat for night work what do say partner giuseppi asked francis may a well go lad replied after moment pause row be certainly long one night be delightful half ducat be prize for giuseppi what influenced francis principally in accepting be curiosity san nicolo be little sandy islet lying quite on outside of group of island be inhabited only by few fisherman francis wondered that man evidently by voice manner of address belonging to upper class must want to go to place a at hour of night certainly ordinary motif must actuate a stranger took place in boat francis saw by light of star that be masked there be nothing very unusual in a mask be not unfrequently worn at night by young gallant when engaged on frolic in wished identity to be unrecognized still added to interest of trip dipping oar in water set out at slow steady stroke well within power adopted partly in view of length of row before partly because idea struck that might be a well that passenger must not suspect that boat be other than ordinary gondola passenger however be well satisfied with speed for passed two three other gondola before issuing from narrow canal starting across broad stretch of lagoon not word be spoken until gondola neared destination then passenger said row well if like job may employ again be always ready to earn money francis said speaking in gruff voice quite unlike own very well will let know a return what night will want again suppose can keep mouth shut on occasion can go without gossiping to fellow a to job on be employed can do francis said be matter to where customer want to go if be willing to pay for a to gossiping there be saying ' silver gag be best for keeping mouth closed ' few minute later bow of gondola ran up on sandy shore of san nicolo stranger made way forward leapt out with word may be two hour before be back walked rapidly away why messer francisco giuseppi said when passenger be well out of hearing what on earth possessed to accept fare to place a of course for be glad enough to earn ducat will buy new jacket with silver button for next festa to make such journey a be too much will be very late before be back if padrone knew must be very angry did do to enable to earn ducat giuseppi although be glad enough must do so did because seemed to promise chance of adventure there must be something in noble for have doubt be one must never be coming out to san nicolo at time of night without very strong motive there can be rich heiress whom might want to carry off living here so that ca be what have come for think there must be secret meeting for a came across lagoon saw one two beat in distance heading in direction anyhow mean to try find out what mean have better not sir giuseppi said earnestly if there be plot on foot have best not get mixed up in one be too high too low to escape vengeance of council if found plotting against state before now gondola staved in empty have be found drifting on lagoon men who rowed have never be heard of again once in dungeon of saint mark must be of use to plead that have entered into affair simply for amusement fact that be not regular boatman must make matter worse maxim 'dead men tell tale be largely acted upon in venice think best plan will be to row straight back leave fare to find way home a best may mean to find something out about if can giuseppi state secret may be dangerous may be valuable anyhow there can be great risk in on water think can show heel to anyone who chase once in venice be absolutely safe for one must suspect gondola of mr hammond english merchant of having connection with hired craft with two gondolier be true enough sir like for however if have made up mind to there be nothing more to be said very well stay here will go look round have better get gondola afloat be ready to start at instant so that if must have to run for can jump on board be off in moment francis made way quietly up to little group of hut inhabited by fisherman in none of must see sign of life light be visible must hear murmur of voice there be knew other building scattered about on island have only light of star to guide not knowing anything of exact position of house thought better to return to boat can find sign of giuseppi better messer francisco there be sort of game be well for safety of hunter not to discover be very glad can tell when heard whistle made out figure returning at walk now be back will take hour nap must advise to do same francis have thought of sleep sat down at end of gondola wondering over adventure considering whether not must be worth while to follow up night that be plot of sort have little doubt there be always in venice two party equally anxious perhaps for prosperity of republic differing widely a to mean by prosperity must be best achieved a to alliance must in long run prove most beneficial to there be also needy desperate men ready enough to take bribe from who might offer to intrigue in interest of padua ferrara verona milan genoa might for time be paymaster francis be english have be long enough in venice to feel pride in island city to be almost a keenly interested in fortune a be companion friend certain sense of duty mingled with natural love of adventure decided to follow up chance have befallen to endeavour to ascertain nature of plot be have little doubt being hatched at san nicolo in very few minute regular breathing of giuseppi who have curled up in bottom of boat showed that have gone to sleep did not stir until hour half after return of francis latter heard fall of footstep approaching gondola wake up giuseppi here come fare francis stood up stretched a stranger came alongside a if too have be fast asleep take back to spot where hailed fare said briefly a stepped into boat threw back on cushion without word lad dipped oar in water gondola glided away towards venice just a reached mouth of grand canal be about to turn into six oared gondola shot out from under point voice called out stop in name of republic give account of yourselves row on passenger exclaimed starting up ten ducat if can set safely on shore have lad be real gondolier be probable that even tempting offer must not have induced to disregard order from galley for must have run slight risk in so doing francis have desire to be caught perhaps imprisoned for considerable time until be able to convince council that share of night work have be merely result of boyish freak with two stroke of oar therefore swept boat head round thereby throwing pursuer directly astern of then giuseppi threw whole weight into stroke boat danced over water at pace very different to at have hitherto proceeded fast a went galley travelled somewhat faster rower doing utmost in obedience to angry order of officer have race be continued on broad stretch of water must sooner later have overhauled gondola francis be perfectly aware of edged boat away towards end of piazzetta then shooting head round dashed at full speed along canal by side of ducal palace galley being at time forty yard behind first to right francis said with scarce pause in speed turned off at right angle up first canal came to again again turned twisted regardless of direction in canal took only object being to gain on pursuer who lost considerably at turn being obliged always to check speed before arriving at angle to allow boat to go round in ten minute be far behind then abated speed turned boat head in direction in wished to go by san paolo stranger said be well done be master of craft sent boat along at pace must have astonished fellow in lumbering galley have reason to fear care to be interfered with questioned by jack in office of republic few minute later reached place where embarked a got out handed money have promised to giuseppi next thursday night said at half past ten seems dangerous sort of service signor giuseppi said hesitatingly be joke to disobey officer of republic next time may not be so fortunate be worth taking little risk when be well paid other said turning away be not likely will run against one of state galley night home now giuseppi francis said can talk about tomorrow be best night work ever did in life a have have grand excitement be contented during next few day francis debated seriously with whether to follow up adventure finally decided on doing so feeling convinced that there must be real danger even be boat seized by one of state galley a story that have gone into matter simply to discover whether plot be intended against republic must finally be believed a must be beyond bound of probability that lad of age must have be concerned in such conspiracy a to giuseppi offered remonstrance when francis told that intended to go out to san nicolo on following thursday for ten ducat have received be sum larger than must have saved in couple of year steady work be indeed quite fortune in eye sum must be able when time came to buy gondola of own to marry set up housekeeping in grand style a for danger if francis be willing to run must do same for after few month imprisonment be worst must befall for share in business before day came matteo giustiniani told francis piece of news interested remember cousin maria polani whom met other evening on grand canal of course do matteo what of well what do think ruggiero mocenigo whom pointed out to on piazza man who have be banished for two year have asked for hand in marriage be not going to have hope francis said indignantly must be shame indeed to give to such man a be just what father thought francisco refused ruggiero pretty curtly told believe must rather see in grave than married to hear there be regular scene ruggiero went away swearing polani must regret refusal suppose cousin doe not care much about threat francis said suppose care much about matteo replied ruggiero be very powerfully connected may do damage not to speak of chance of hiring bravo to stab on first opportunity know father advised polani to be very cautious where went at night for time fellow ruggiero be dangerous enemy if be to get polani stabbed must be next to impossible to prove that be doing however strong suspicion might be for mere suspicion go for nothing against man with influence connection have two near relation on council if be to burn down polani mansion to carry off maria chance be against being punished if did keep out of way for few month a in england powerful baron be in habit of waging private war with other carrying off bride by force be very rare event state of thing did not appear to francis a outrageous a must do to english lad of present day shook head of course one understands matteo everywhere powerful noble do thing must be regarded a crime if done by others elsewhere people can fortify house call out arm retainer stand on guard that here in city like private feud must be carried on men stabbed when unconscious of danger seems to detestable of course be right matteo said carelessly know how be going to put stop to after quarrel here only involve life two while in other country noble go to war with other hundred of life of people who have nothing to do with quarrel may be sacrificed be light in francis have hardly looked upon matter before be obliged to own even private assassination detestable a be yet caused much le suffering than feudal war still be not disposed entirely to give in to friend opinion be true matteo at same time in war be fair fighting while stab in back be cowardly business be not always fair fighting matteo replied hear of castle being surprised people massacred without chance of resistance of village being burned people butchered unresistingly think there be so much more fairness one way than other polani know will have to be careful if like can hire bravo to put ruggiero out of way just a ruggiero can do to remove there be good deal to be said for side of question francis felt be so that although have abhorrence of venetian method of settling quarrel saw that a far a public be concerned be really preferable to feudal method of party calling out retainer going to war with other especially a assassination played inconsiderable part in feudal struggle of time on thursday night gondola be in waiting at agreed spot francis have thought probable that stranger might time ask question a to where lived usual place of plying for hire must endeavour to find out a much a must about a must not suspect that be engaged in very unusual enterprise have therefore warned giuseppi to be very careful in reply knew that be not necessary to say more for giuseppi have plenty of shrewdness must be sure invent plausible story without least difficulty possessing a did plenty of easy mendacity so general among lower class of race inhabiting country bordering on mediterranean fare came down to gondola few minute after clock have tolled half hour see be punctual said be more than most of men be francis be rowing bow oar therefore stood with back to passenger be not likely to be addressed by a must naturally turn to giuseppi who stood close behind a francis have expected a soon a be out on lagoon passenger turned to companion began to question can not see face said by figure be young be not be twenty two giuseppi said brother be year younger be name giovanni beppo morani be boat own be signor father died three year ago leaving boat where do usually ply anywhere signor just a fancy seizes sometimes one place be good sometimes where do live live anywhere signor when night come business be over tie up boat to post wrap ourselves up go to sleep at bottom cost nothing be just a comfortable there a must be on straw in room then must be saving money yes be laying money by day

going journey over rough ground among gondolier shoe be unknown francis generally took off for coolness comfort when out for evening in boat kept distance behind man be following for a there be hedge inclosure must make out figure against sky at considerable distance a francis have expected did not make towards village kept along island at short distance from edge of water presently francis heard dip of oar gondola ran up on sand halfway between man be following threw down on ground two men alighted went in same direction a one who have gone ahead francis made detour so a to avoid being noticed by gondolier then again followed after keeping more than quarter of mile near water two figure ahead struck inshore francis followed in few minute stopped at black mass rising above sand heard knock then low murmur a if be answering question from within then entered door closed moved up to building be hut of size have deserted appearance stood between two ridge of low sand hill sand have drifted till be halfway up wall there be garden inclosure round passerby must have concluded that be uninhabited shutter be closed gleam of light showed from within after stepping carefully round took post round angle close to door waited presently heard footstep approaching three knock be given on door voice within asked who be there reply be one who be in distress question came what ail answer be wrong within then there be sound of bar being withdrawn door opened closed again there be four other arrival same question be asked answered time then minute elapsed without fresh comer francis thought that number be probably complete lay down on sand with dagger began to make hole through wood be old rotten gave difficulty in piercing applied eye to orifice saw that there be twelve men seated round table of facing knew three four by sight be men of good family two of belonged to council not to inner council of ten one sitting at top of table be speaking although francis applied ear to hole have made must hear confused murmur must not catch word now rose cautiously scooped up sand so a to cover hole in wall swept little down over spot where have be lying although have doubt that breeze must spring up before morning must soon drift light shifting sand over obliterate mark of recumbent figure then went round to other side of hut bored hole so a to obtain view of face of whose back have before be towards one of be ruggiero mocenigo be stranger to francis difference in fashion of garment indicated that be not venetian francis thought hungarian other three be not noble one of francis recognized a being man of much influence among fisherman sailor other two be unknown to a upwards of hour have be spent in making two hole taking observation francis thought better now to make way back to boat especially a be evident that must gain nothing by remaining longer therefore after taking same precaution a before to conceal sign of presence made way across sand back to gondola heaven be praised be back again giuseppi said when heard low whistle a came down to boat have be in fever ever since lost sight of have succeeded have found out that there be certainly plot of sort being got up know of concerned in must hear nothing went on still have succeeded better than expected be well satisfied with night work hope wo come again messer francisco in first place may not always have fortune to get away unseen in next place be dangerous matter to have to do with conspiracy side be on way to live long in venice be to make enemy yes know that giuseppi have decided yet what to do in matter quarter of hour later fare returned to boat time took long detour entering venice by one of many canal reached landing place without adventure stranger handed giuseppi ducat know when will want again will mark hour a agreed on pillar fail to go there afternoon even if see might a well come round here at half past ten of night may want suddenly before going to sleep night francis thought matter over seriously finally concluded that must have more to do with doubt by crossing over to san nicolo in daytime might be able to loosen plank at back of hut to cut so large opening that must hear a well a see what be going on within supposing discovered that plot be on hand in favour of enemy of venice such a padua hungary what be to do next at best if denounced officer of republic surrounded hut when conspirator be gathered there arrested found upon in house proof sufficient to condemn own position must not be enviable must gain indeed gratitude of republic a for reward have need of on other hand must draw upon enmity of eight ten important family connection follower life must be placed in imminent danger must be more bitter against inasmuch a discovery must not have be made by accident by act of deliberate prying into matter concerned in way not being citizen of republic so far action in matter have be mere boyish freak now that saw be likely to become affair of grave importance involving life of many person determined to have nothing further to do with chapter on grand canal giuseppi next morning heard announcement of determination of francis to interfere further in matter of conspiracy at san nicolo with immense satisfaction for last few night have scarcely slept whenever dozed off dreamed either of being tortured in dungeon of being murdered in gondola money must make up for constant terror assailed in waking moment be more anxious for employer than for for be upon that vengeance of conspirator must fall rather than upon young gondolier who be only obeying order of master be then with unbounded relief that heard francis have decided to go no more out to san nicolo during next few day francis went more frequently than usual to piazza of saint mark have difficulty in recognizing there various person have seen in hut in ascertaining name family one of citizen have failed to recognize be large contractor in salt work on mainland other be largest importer of beast for supply of meat to market of city francis be well satisfied with knowledge have gained might never be of use to might on other hand be of importance when least expected a matter of precaution drew up exact account of proceeding of two night on lagoon giving account of meeting name of person present placed in drawer in room told giuseppi what have done think there be least chance of ever being recognized giuseppi there be not enough light for man to have made out feature still there be nothing like taking precaution if think be likely mind if anything must ever happen to if must be missing for example not return by following morning take paper out of drawer drop into lion mouth then if be questioned tell whole story will never believe messer francisco giuseppi said in alarm will believe because will be confirmation of story think that there be least chance of ever hearing anything further about why not denounce at once without putting name to giuseppi said then must pounce upon over there find out about for have thought about giuseppi there be something treacherous in secret denunciation men have done harm a foreigner political scheme greatly concern must not like to think have sent twelve men to dungeon perhaps to death think be pity ever went there at messer francisco well perhaps be giuseppi never thought must turn out serious affair like however do wish have gone now not that think really matter that will ever hear anything more of may perhaps day see result of conspiracy be if object be such a guess to be namely to form party opposed to war with hungary padua genoa for day after francis abstained from late excursion in gondola be improbable that giuseppi must be recognized did late passenger meet still be possible that might be so when went out sat quietly among cushion while giuseppi rowed a must be pair oared stranger must be looking for be sure that conspirator must feel uneasy when boat did not come to rendezvous especially when found that on three successive day figure be marked a have be arranged on column at corner of piazzetta giuseppi learned indeed week later that inquiry have be made among gondolier for boat rowed by two brother giovanni beppo inquirer who be dressed a retainer of noble family have offered five ducat reward for information concerning such name however be down upon

among boatman be that lady must have be carried off that friend be seeking for clue a to spot to have be taken one evening francis have be strolling on piazza with matteo have remained out later than have done since night of last visit to san nicolo took seat in gondola when giuseppi asked if must go home said must first take turn two on grand canal a night be close sultry there be moon now most of gondola carried torch giuseppi be paddling quietly when pair oared gondola shot past by light of torch carried francis recognized lady sitting in to be maria giulia polani with duenna two armed retainer sat behind be francis supposed returning from spending evening at house of of friend there be few boat now passing along canal polani gondola be considerable distance ahead when francis heard sudden shout of mind where be going then there be crash of two gondola striking other followed by outburst of shout cry of alarm with francis thought clash of sword row giuseppi exclaimed leaping from seat catching up other oar with swift powerful stroke two lad drove gondola towards scene of what be accident attempt at crime have doubt be when arrived at spot four oared gondola lay alongside of polanis gondolier with oar two retainer with sword have offered stout resistance to armed party who be trying to board from other craft resistance be well nigh over by time francis brought gondola alongside one of retainer have fallen with sword thrust through body gondolier have be knocked overboard by blow from oar two girl be standing up screaming surviving retainer be being borne backwards by three four armed men who be slashing furiously at quick lady jump into boat francis exclaimed a came alongside leaning over dragged one after other into boat just a last defender fell with fierce oath leader of assailant be about to spring into gondola when francis snatching up oar smote with strength on head a be in act of springing fell with heavy splash into water between boat shout of alarm rage rose from follower gondola be now separated in moment that of francis be flying along canal at top of speed calm yourselves lady francis said there be fear of pursuit will stop to pick up man knocked into canal by time get on board will be out of reach what will become of signora eldest girl asked when recovered little from agitation harm will befall may be sure francis said be evidently attempt to carry off now that have escaped will care nothing for duenna seemed to have lost head altogether for a lifted into boat clung so fast to garment that fancy portion of be left in grasp do know where to take see be going in right direction girl asked to palazzo polani francis said have honour of being friend of cousin matteo giustiniani being with one day when passed in gondola named to friend of matteo girl repeated in surprise pardon signor thought be two passing gondolier be so dark must not recognize see be so unusual to see gentleman rowing be english signora be fond of strong exercise so after nightfall when can not shock friend often take oar thank sir with heart for sister for service have rendered can hardly understand what have passed even now seems like dream be going quietly along home when large dark gondola dashed out from one of side canal nearly ran down gondolier shouted to warn ran alongside then men jumped on board there be terrible fight moment expected that gondola must have be upset beppo be knocked overboard saw old nicolini fall then just a seemed over appeared suddenly by side dragged on board boat before have time to think be be rather rough signora there be time to stand on ceremony here be palazzo boat be brought up by side of step francis leapt ashore rang bell then assisted girl to land in minute door be thrown open two servitor with torch appeared there be exclamation of astonishment a saw young lady alone with strange attendant will do honour of calling tomorrow to inquire if be worse for adventure signora indeed eldest girl said must come up with see father must tell have happened will be angry indeed did suffer rescuer to depart without having opportunity of thanking francis bowed followed girl upstairs entered large very handsomely furnished apartment where tall man be sitting reading why girl exclaimed a rose what have happened look strangely excited where be duenna who be young gentleman who accompanies have be attacked father on way home girl exclaimed attacked signor polani repeated who have dared to venture on outrage know father maria said be four oared gondola ran suddenly into thought be accident till number of men with sword drawn leaped on board then nicolini francia drew sword tried to defend beppo jacopo fought bravely too with oar beppo be knocked overboard be afraid nicolini francia be killed in moment must have got at when young gentleman came alongside in gondola dragged on board for be too bewildered frightened to do anything one of seemed leader of party tried to jump on board protector struck terrible blow with oar fell into water then gondola made off so far a must see did not chase be scandalous outrage will demand justice at hand of council young sir have laid under obligation will never forget have saved daughter from worst calamity must befall who be to whom be thus indebted name be francis hammond father be english merchant who have for last four year established here know well by repute polani said trust will know more of in future where be duenna girl remained behind in gondola father seemed too frightened to move lady seemed to have lost head altogether francis said a be lifting daughter into gondola in very hasty unceremonious way for resistance of servitor be overcome there be time to be lost held so tightly to robe that be rent in hand signor polani struck gong let gondola be manned instantly said let six of take arm go in search of boat let man at once summon leech for of on board be fear grievously wounded if not killed there be occasion to carry out order concerning boat for before be ready to start missing gondola arrived at step rowed by remaining gondolier duenna be lifted out sobbing hysterically body of two retainer be then landed one be dead other expired few minute after being brought ashore did not observe anything particular about gondola maria giulia father saw mark escutcheon upon though might have be there without noticing be too frightened to see anything came so suddenly upon be a far a noticed plain black gondola francis said men concerned in affair be dressed in dark clothes without distinguishing badge how be came to interfere in fray young gentleman few of people must have done so holding to be dangerous thing for man to mix up in quarrel in have concern must probably have mixed up in in case when cry of woman francis replied in truth recognized signora a gondola passed mine knew to be cousin of friend matteo giustiniani therefore when heard outcry ahead naturally hastened up to do what must in matter well did polani said heartily trust that man felled into water be who be author of outrage think need seek far for suspicion point very strongly in one direction tomorrow will lay matter before council demand reparation now signor if will permit will take leave francis said hour be late signora will require rest after fright emotion will see tomorrow sir will do honour of calling early upon father to thank for great service have rendered signor polani accompanied francis to step while two servant held torch while took seat in gondola remained standing there until barque have shot away beyond circle of light seem fated to have adventure giuseppi do indeed messer francisco be more to liking than last arrived just at nick of time half minute young lady must have be carried off be rare blow dealt leader fancy never came up again that be why got away without being chased be of opinion giuseppi if be case will not have heard last of messer francisco only someone of powerful family must venture upon so bold deed a to try to carry off lady of birth on grand canal may find that adventure have created for enemy not to be despised ca help if have francis said carelessly on other hand will gain for influential friend in signor polani who be not only one of richest merchant of venice closely related to number of best family of city influence will not protect against point of dagger giuseppi said share in business can not become public think that must be wise to give up evening excursion at present agree with giuseppi go about with torch burning so no one who meet be likely to recognize one gondola in dark be pretty much like however many enemy have must not be afraid of traversing canal next morning at breakfast time francis related to father adventure of previous evening be mistake son to mix up in broil concern in present instance may be that adventure will turn out to be advantageous to prospect signor polani be one of most illustrious merchant of venice name be known everywhere in east there be not port in levant where galley trade friendship of such man can not be most useful to upon other hand will probably make enemy by interference with plan of unscrupulous young noble venice be not healthy city for who have powerful enemy still think that advantage will more than balance risk however francis must curb spirit of adventure be not son of baron count winning of honour glory by deed of arm befits must be of advantage to in way trader of city of london must be distinguished for probity attention to business methinks ere long will be well to send home to take place in counting house under eye of partner john pearson hitherto have not checked love for arm intercourse with youth of far higher rank than own have be for time doubting wisdom of course in bringing out here with have regretted did not leave in good hand at home event of last night show that time be fast approaching when can no longer be considered boy will be better for to turn at once into groove in be to travel than to continue mode of life will unfit for career of city trader francis knew too well duty towards father to make reply heart sank at prospect of settling down in establishment in london life there have not be unpleasant one knew that must find terribly dull after freedom liberty have enjoyed in venice have never however even to indulged idea that other career save that of father must be have regarded a matter of course that day must take place in shop in cheapside now that be suddenly presented to a something must shortly take place feeling of repugnance towards life came over not that dreamt for moment of trying to induce father to allow to seek other calling have be always taught to consider position of trader of good standing of city of london a one of most desirable possible line between noble citizen be so strongly marked that one thought of overstepping citizen of london be a proud of position a tenacious of right a be noble be ready enough to take up arm to defend privilege to resist oppression whether came from king noble few indeed even of wilder spirit of city ever thought of taking to arm a profession be true that honour rank be to be gained by who rode in train of great noble to war noble drew following from own estate not from among dweller in city although body of men at arm archer furnished by city to king in war always did duty stoutly in field have opportunity of distinguishing singly deed attracted attention led to honour rank be performed by esquire candidate for rank of knighthood who rode behind baron into thick of french chivalry therefore francis hammond have never thought of taking to profession of arm in own country though when news arrived in venice of desperate fighting at sea with genoese have thought to that most glorious thing in life must be to command well manned galley a advanced to encounter of enemy superior in number have never dreamed that aspiration must ever be satisfied be merely one of fancy in lad so often indulge still thought that be soon to return take place in shop in chepe be exceedingly unpleasant to soon after breakfast bell at water gate rang loudly minute later servant entered with news that signor polani be below begged interview mr hammond at once went down to step to receive visitor whom saluted with ceremony conducted upstairs be known to by name doubt signor hammond a be to venetian said when first formal greeting be over be not man of ceremony judge be even if be present be not occasion for son have doubtless told of inestimable service rendered to last night by saving daughter rather eldest daughter for be doubtless whom villain sought from being borne off by one of worst most disreputable of many bad disreputable young men of city be indeed glad signor polani that son be able to be of service to have somewhat blamed have let have own way so much permitted to give up to exercise of arm more befitting son of warlike noble than of peaceful trader quickness boldness mastery of arm give be yesterday of service longer regret time have spent since have enabled to be of aid to daughter of signor polani mastery of arm be always useful whether man be peace loving citizen one who must carve way to fame by mean of weapon merchant of mediterranean might give up trade if be not prepared to defend ship against corsair of barbary pirate who haunt inlet islet of levant now a have ever done since day of rome besides be duty of citizen to defend native city when attacked lastly there be private enemy man who rise in smallest degree above fellow be sure to create for moreover training in arm a say give readiness quickness enables mind to remain calm steadfast amidst danger of sort methinks add not little to man dignity self respect to know that be equal man to man to with whom may come in contact here in venice be soldier sailor son will make worse merchant rather better for being able to wield sword dagger even now said with smile have proved advantage of training for though say not boastfully nicholas polani have in power to be of use to friend foremost among will henceforward count brave son if will permit will trust excuse paying short visit morning for be on way to lay complaint before council have already be round to several of friend phillipo giustiniani six others nearest related to will go with being aggrieved at outrage to family nearly connected crave to permit to take son with in order that may be at hand if called upon to say what know of affair assuredly be duty to go with if desire although own be not sorry that must see a tell badge cognizance must enable to say aught can lead to identification of who must have abducted daughter be too well known fact that be dangerous to make enemy in venice for even most powerful protection doe not avail against stab of dagger be true enough merchant said frequency of assassination be disgrace to city will ever be put down until men of high rank be executed seignory show that be a jealous of life of private citizen a be of honour well being of republic francis gladly threw aside book when be told that signor polani desired to accompany be soon seated by side of merchant in gondola how old be friend merchant asked a boat threaded maze of canal be just sixteen signor more merchant said in surprise have taken for well nigh two year older have just come from palazzo giustiniani young kinsman matteo tell that in school of arm there be none of young noble who be match with rapier battleaxe fear sir francis said modestly have given up more time to study of arm than befits son of sober trader not at venetian replied trader have to defend right liberty good ship just a much a noble have to defend privilege castle here in venice there be such distinction of rank a there be elsewhere certain family distinguished among rest by long standing wealth influence service have rendered to state be of senatorial rank constitute nobility there be title among be citizen of republic with right privilege can not be infringed even by most powerful poorest citizen have equal right to make a proficient in arm may be called upon to wield in defence of state a doge in country also believe men be obliged to learn use of arm to practise shooting at butt to make efficient if called upon to take part in war of country have heard that at joust champion of city of london have ere now held own against of court have done so francis said yet know not why be considered unseemly for son of well to do citizen to be too fond of military exercise idea be foolish one venetian said hotly have score of time defended ship against corsair pirate genoese other enemy have fought against greek be forced to busy in more than one serious fray in street of constantinople alexandria other port have served in galley of state men who live by trade must be in favour of peace must also be prepared to defend good better able be to do more honour to here be at piazzetta group of noble be standing near landing place signor polani at once went up to introduced francis to a gentleman who have done daughter kinswoman such good service francis be warmly thanked congratulated by will wait near entrance signor polani said see that young cousin matteo have accompanied father will doubt find enough to say to other while be with council gentleman entered palace matteo who have remained respectfully at short distance from senior at once joined friend well francis congratulate heartily though feel quite jealous of be splendid to think of dashing up in gondola carrying off pretty cousin from clutch of villain ruggiero mocenigo just a be about to lay hand on be sure be ruggiero matteo oh there ca be doubt about know have asked for maria hand when polani refused have gone off muttering threat know what character be be capable of evil action besides say that have dissipated patrimony in gaming other extravagance at constantinople be deep in hand of jew if must have succeeded in carrying off maria must more than have mended fortune for sister be acknowledged to be richest heiress in venice oh there be not shadow of doubt that be wo hear saying anything against love of prowling about in gondola of yours since have brought piece of good fortune for be piece of good fortune francis to have rendered service to polani to say nothing of rest of who be connected with family can tell that there be score of young men of good birth in venice who must give right hand to have done what did must have considered fortunate to have be of service to girl threatened by violence though have only be fisherman daughter francis said be specially pleased because be relative of yours matteo to say nothing to being two of prettiest girl in venice matteo added slyly that count for something too doubt francis said laughing though did think of wonder went on gravely whether be ruggiero whom struck down whether came up again to surface have very powerful connection know matteo if have gained friend will also have gained enemy by night work be so matteo agreed for sake own hope that ruggiero be at present at bottom of canal be certainly no credit to friend although must of course have stood by think will feel at heart in way displeased to know that will trouble no longer if men got out again must say have best be careful for ruggiero be about last man in venice must care to have a enemy however wo look at unpleasant side of matter will hope that career have be brought to close know way to hope francis said gravely will certainly be dangerous enemy if be alive yet thought of having killed man trouble much must not trouble at if be in place matteo said if have not killed may be very sure that must have killed that deed must have caused compunction whatever be fair fight just a if have be hostile galley in mid sea see why thought of having rid venice of one of worst citizen need trouble in way see have be brought up with rather different idea to yours matteo father a trader be adverse to fighting of kind save of course in defence of one country although have not blamed in way for part took can see that be much disquieted indeed speaks of sending back to england at once oh hope not matteo said earnestly hitherto have be great friend francis will be more in future polani friend will regard a one of be even thinking on way here that perhaps might enter service of state together get appointed to war galley in few year father hair must stand up at thought matteo though for must like nothing so well however must never have be still be sorry indeed at thought of leaving venice have be very happy here have made friend there be always something to do talk about life in london must be so dull in comparison here come one of usher from palace official came up to asked if of be messer francisco hammond finding that have come to right person requested francis to follow

asked when have finished be then told to retire usher then brought francis forward be messer francisco hammond said tell story own way doge said francis related story of attack on gondola escape of lady in boat how came foreigner youth to interfere in fray of kind one of councillor asked did not stop to think of being stranger youth francis replied quietly heard scream of woman in distress felt naturally bound to render what aid must did know who lady be knew only by sight friend matteo giustiniani have pointed out to on one occasion a being daughter of signor polani connection of when gondola have passed mine few minute previously recognized face by light of torch in boat be torch burning brightly of council asked because may be that attack be not intended against against others light be bright enough for to recognize face at glance francis said also yellow white sash of gondolier did see badge cognizance on gondola on person of assailant did not francis said certainly wore none one of torch in polani gondola have be extinguished in fray other be still burning have gondolier worn coloured sash other distinguishing mark must have noticed must recognize be to see again of assailant must not francis said be masked say struck down one who appeared to be leader with oar a be about to leap into boat how be oar be in hand instead of of gondolier be rowing francis said in london rowing be amusement of boy of class be fond since have be out here with father have learned to row gondola sometimes when be out of evening take oar a well a gondolier enjoying exercise speed at boat go along be not rowing when signora boat passed upon hearing scream stood up took second oar to arrive a quickly a possible at spot be how be that have in hand when man be about to leap into boat then there be nothing at so far a know to direct suspicion against anyone a author of attack there be nothing francis said either in gondola in attire person of concerned in fray must give slightest clue a to identity at rate young gentleman doge said appear to have behaved with promptness presence of mind courage for need courage to interfere in fray of sort beyond year in name of republic thank for having prevented commission of grievous crime will please to remain here for present may be that when person accused of crime appears before may be able to recognize figure be with mixed feeling francis minute two later usher announce that signor ruggiero mocenigo be without awaiting pleasure of excellency let enter doge said curtain fell back ruggiero mocenigo entered with haughty air bowed to council stood a if expecting to be questioned be charged ruggiero mocenigo doge said with being concerned in attempt to carry off daughter of signor polani of taking part in killing of three servitor of gentleman on what ground be accused ruggiero said haughtily on ground that be rejected suitor for elder lady hand that have uttered threat against father who so far a know have other enemy seems somewhat scanty ground for accusation of such gravity ruggiero said sneeringly if suitor who grumble when offer be refused be to be held responsible for accident may take place in lady family methinks that time of reverend illustrious council will be largely occupied will remember doge said sternly that previous conduct give good ground for suspicion against have already be banished from state for two year for assassination such report a reached of conduct in constantinople during exile be reverse of satisfactory have not be so prayer of friend that term of banishment might be shortened must doubtless have produced effect at rate ruggiero said can with little difficulty prove have hand in attempt upon signor polani daughter last night seeing have friend spending evening with that indulged in play until three o'clock morning hour at must imagine signora polani must scarcely be abroad at what time did friend assemble at nine o'clock ruggiero said met by

mocenigo acknowledge excellency signor polani said rising that ruggiero mocenigo have proved that took personal part in affair will submit to that in way prof that be not author of attempt must know that first suspicion must fall upon must therefore naturally leave matter to be carried out by others must take precaution to enable to prove a have done that be not present still maintain that circumstance of case threat to fact that daughter will naturally inherit portion of what wealth might posse that a know can prove ruggiero mocenigo have be lately reduced to borrowing money of jew point to being author of attempt must at once satisfy anger against for having declined honour of alliance repair damaged fortune there be few word of whispered consultation between councillor doge

council said to official officer produced small dagger with fine steel blade gold handle thickly encrusted with gem be dagger senator asked francis can not say that be dagger francis replied closely resembles if be not same have doubt suppose seeing wound on temple dagger found in girdle fact that body have evidently only be few day in water that be man whom struck down in fray on canal signor have doubt that be same person will do council said can retire thank in name of justice for evidence have given francis be led back to gondola conveyed to father house hour later signor polani arrived matter be finished said can not say satisfactorily to for punishment be wholly inadequate to offence at rate have not got off altogether unpunished after left passed from prison into palace then whole council assembled a before in council chamber may tell that body be found be that of cousin intimate of ruggiero mocenigo two have be constantly together since return of latter from constantinople be found by inquiry at house of young man father that left home on evening upon attack be committed saying that be going to mainland might not be expected to return for day council took for granted from wound in head fact that leech have testified that body have probably be in water about three day that be man be stunned by blow drowned in canal ruggiero urged that discovery in way affected that cousin have doubt attempted to carry off daughter on own account there be eventually division among council on point maria be sent for on being questioned testified that young man have never spoken to that indeed did not know even by sight majority thereupon came to conclusion that must only have be acting a instrument of ruggiero be not in apartment while deliberation be going on when returned president announced that although there be absolute proof of ruggiero complicity in affair yet that considering application for daughter hand threat on refusal to request previous character intimacy with cousin council have doubt that attempt have be made at instigation therefore sentenced to banishment from venice island for three year must be better pleased if have sent back to constantinople one of island of levant mr hammond said if be allowed to take up abode on mainland may be only two three mile away in case of man of description be much too near to be pleasant for who have incurred enmity be true signor polani agreed friend be indignant that must not have be banished to distance where at least must have be powerless for fresh mischief on other hand friend will doubtless consider that have be hardly treated however a far a daughter be concerned will take good care that will have opportunity of repeating attempt for have ordered on account to be absent from palazzo after shade of evening begin to fall unless be with will increase number of armed retainer in house by bringing of men on shore from ship arrived last night in port can not believe that even ruggiero must have insolence to attempt to carry off from house by force when one have to deal with man like one can not take too great precaution have already ordered son on account to be out after nightfall in street in gondola mind for unless gondolier wear badge be impossible to tell one boat from after dark besides a tell boat be so fast that have fear whatever of being overtaken even if recognized chased will not feel comfortable so long a be here will send back to england on very first occasion that offer trust such occasion may occur just yet signor hammond must be sorry indeed for son to be separated so soon from must talk matter over together perhaps between may hit on plan by while may be out of reach of peril have incurred on behalf of family may yet be wasting time altogether separated from for next fortnight francis spent most of time at palazzo polani merchant be evidently sincere in invitation to to make house home if day passed without lad paying visit must chide gently for deserting be frequently present in balcony where four young people for matteo giustiniani be generally of party sat chatted together gouvernante sitting austerely by with at time strong expression of disapproval on countenance at laughter merriment although a charge father approved of intimacy of girl with young cousin english lad must offer open objection in afternoon party generally went for long row in four oared gondola always returning home upon approach of evening to francis time be delightful have have sister of own although have made acquaintance of number of lad in venice have accompanied father to formal entertainment at house of friend have never before be intimate in of family gaiety high spirit of two girl when be in house amused pleased especially a be in contrast to somewhat stiff dignified demeanour assumed when passing through frequented canal in gondola like woman castaldi francis said one evening a after leaving palazzo giuseppi rowed towards palazzo giustiniani where matteo be to be landed gouvernantes be not popular a class with young men matteo laughed seriously matteo like be quite sure that for reason other doe not like have seen watching a cat must watch mouse be going to spring on perhaps have not forgiven francisco for saving two charge leaving to mercy of assailant know matteo conduct appeared to at time to be very strange of course might have be paralysed with fright be certainly curious way clung to dress tried to prevent from leaving boat really think francis that wanted to be captured know whether must be justified in saying a much a matteo certainly must not say so to anyone else ca help thinking that such be case like face like woman strike a being deceitful certainly did try to prevent carrying girl off have not dress given way in hand must have done so anyhow strike that ruggiero must have have accomplice in house how else must have known of exact time at must be passing along grand canal for that gondola be in waiting to dash out surprise there be doubt be asking signora giulia other day how be be so late for say that father never liked being out after dusk in venice though at corfu did not care how late be upon water replied that did not quite know how happened sister have said time before thought be time to be going gouvernante who be generally very particular have said that there be occasion to hurry a father knew where be must not be uneasy thought woman must have mistaken time did not know how late be of course prof nothing still own putting thing together have suspicion be certainly curious francisco though can hardly believe possible that woman must be treacherous have be for year in service of family cousin have confidence in may be matteo ruggiero may have promised so highly that may have persuaded to aid must have afforded to be generous if have be successful there be thing by bye francisco did not strike at time now speak of may be link in chain be laughing at maria about screaming saying what noise three of must have made said 'oh there be only two of giulia screamed for aid at top of voice signora be a quiet brave a possible did not utter sound doe agree matteo with being so frightened a to hold girl tightly almost prevent escape with row made sobbing cry when came back of course there be not enough to go upon must hardly venture to speak of to signor polani to accuse woman in whom have perfect confidence of such frightful treachery on such vague ground of suspicion still do suspect hope when go away from venice will a far a can keep eye upon know how to do matteo said laughing will tell cousin that like advise in future not on account to stay out after dusk even if give permission to do so if learn anything more to justify suspicion will tell cousin what think though wo be pleasant thing to do however ruggiero be gone now hope sha' hear anything more about hope not matteo be sure be not man to give up plan have once formed easily more than be to forgive injury however here be at step will talk other matter over time anyhow be glad have told what thought for have be worrying now that find think idea about be altogether absurd will keep eye more open than ever in future be convinced be bad one only hope may be able to prove have made very uncomfortable francisco matteo said a stepped ashore will talk about again tomorrow will meet at cousin in evening before time have better think over whether ought to tell anyone suspicion can hold council in gondola on way back francis did think matter over night felt that fact told by giulia that gouvernante have be mean of staying out later than usual on evening of attack added great weight to vague suspicion have previously entertained determined to let matter rest no longer that next day must speak to signor polani even at risk of offending by suspicion of person who have be for year in confidence accordingly went in morning to palazzo found that signor polani be absent must not be in until two three o'clock in afternoon did not see girl who knew be going out to spend day with friend at three o'clock returned found that polani have just come in why francisco merchant said when entered have forgotten that daughter will be out day signor have not forgotten that wish to speak to dare say will laugh at hope will not think meddlesome impertinent for touching upon subject concern nearly be sure will not be meddlesome impertinent francisco signor polani said reassuringly for saw that lad be nervous anxious tell what have to say can promise beforehand that whether agree with not in what may have to say will be in way vexed for will know have said with best intention have to say sir concern signora castaldi daughter gouvernante know sir that repose implicit confidence in judgment formed after year of intimate knowledge be hardly likely to be shaken by what have to tell spoke to matteo about a be somewhat of opinion have decided that be at least duty to tell circumstance can then form own conclusion francis then related fact known to first that assailant of gondola must have have accurate information a to hour at must come along secondly that be at gouvernante suggestion that return have be delayed much later than usual lastly that when attack took place gouvernante did not raise voice to cry for assistance that have at last moment so firmly seized dress that be only by tearing girl from grasp that have be enabled to get into boat there may be nothing in said when have concluded at least sir thought that be right must know will believe that be only anxiety a to safety of daughter have led to speak to of be quite sure signor polani said cordially be perfectly right in speaking to own however that for moment think that circumstance be more than mere coincidence signora castaldi have be with for upwards of ten year have instructed trained daughter entirely to satisfaction say that be everything that one must wish then one be perfect have confidence in fidelity trustworthiness own that chain have put together be strong one have lately entered service be person of whom knew little must attach great weight to fact although taken in amount to much doubtless saw that daughter be enjoying in society of friend in kindness of heart erred a certainly did err in allowing to stay longer than must have done then a to not cry out when attacked woman behave differently in case of danger scream loudly others be silent a if paralysed by fear must seem to have be case doubtless instinctively grasped girl for protection in fright did not even perceive that boat have come alongside know that be friend trying to save that someone informed assailant of whereabouts of daughter time be coming home be clear might have be seen going to house swift gondola have be placed on watch have boat started a soon a took seat in gondola on return hastened by narrow canal to spot where accomplice be waiting must have warned in ample time of approach of gondola with daughter have a may believe thought matter deeply over for be evident to that news of daughter coming must have reached assailant beforehand be most unwilling to suspect treachery on part of of household came to conclusion that warning be given in way have suggested at same time francisco thank deeply for having mentioned to suspicion have formed although think that be wholly mistaken certainly will not neglect warning will watch very closely conduct of daughter gouvernante will take precaution to put out of power to play false even while can not for moment believe must be so base treacherous a to attempt to do so in case signor will feel that mission have not be unsuccessful however mistaken may be trust sincerely that be wholly wrong thank much for kind way in have heard express suspicion of person in confidence gravity with merchant have heard francis ' story vanished immediately left room smile came over face boy be boy world over said to though young friend have almost stature of man a well a quickness courage of one have plenty of sense in other matter have at once prejudice romantic idea of boy have signora castaldi be young pretty idea that be treacherous must have ever entered mind what young fellow yet ever liked gouvernante who sits by work at tambour frame with disapproving expression on face while be laughing talking with girl of own age must have felt same when be boy still to picture poor signora a traitoress in pay of villain mocenigo be too absurd have greatest difficulty in keeping gravity when be unfolding story be excellent lad nevertheless true honest brave lad with little of bluffness that say nation posse with heart of gold unless be greatly mistaken at seven o'clock francis be just getting into gondola to go round again to signor polani when gondola came along canal at top of speed recognized at once badge of giustiniani stopped suddenly a came abreast of own boat matteo in state of highest excitement jumped from own boat into of francis what be matter matteo what have happened have terrible news francisco cousin have disappeared disappeared francis repeated in astonishment how have disappeared father have just be round to see mine be half mad with grief anger know have gone to spend day at persanis yes yes francis exclaimed do go on matteo tell about quickly well seems that polani for reason other thought must go fetch at five o'clock arrived there in gondola only to find that have left two hour before be right francisco be that beldam castaldi went with there in morning left there be to have come in gondola for at six at three o'clock arrived saying that father have met with serious accident having fallen down step of one of bridge broken leg that have sent to fetch at once of course left with instantly polani questioned lackey who have aided to embark said that gondola be not one of boat be apparently hired gondola with closed cabin girl have stopped in surprise a came down step maria said 'why be not gondola ' castaldi replied 'no own gondola have gone off to find bring leech a father be urgently wanting hailed first passing boat make haste dear father be longing for ' so got on board at once gondola rowed swiftly away be know about except that story be lie father never sent for up to quarter of hour ago have not reached home chapter finding clue be awful matteo francis said when friend have finished story what be to be done be just thing francisco what be to be done cousin have be already to city magistrate to tell have taken place to request aid in discovering where girl have be carried to believe that be going to put up proclamation announcing that will give thousand ducat to whomsoever will bring information will enable to recover girl will set gondolier on canal on alert of must surely have noticed closed gondola rowed by two men for at time of year very few gondola have cover on seems to be terrible not to be able to do anything so came straight off to tell have better send gondola home matteo may be wanted will paddle out to lagoon talk over surely there must be something to be done if must think of be terrible indeed matteo repeated after have sat without speaking for minute one feel quite helpless bewildered to think that only yesterday evening be laughing chatting with now be lost in power of villain mocenigo who may be sure be at bottom of by way said suddenly do know where have taken up abode heard that be at botonda near chioggia week ago whether be there still have not least idea seems to that thing to do be to find keep in sight will probably have hidden away somewhere will not go near for time for will know that will be suspected perhaps watched why must not force maria to marry at once matteo said see when have once made wife will be safe for cousin must be driven then to make term with for sake may try francis said must know that maria have plenty of spirit may refuse to marry threaten a will may think that after have be kept confined for time find that there be hope of escape except by consenting to be wife may give way in case seems to that thing to be done be to find ruggiero to watch movement have doubt cousin have already taken step in direction matteo said feel sure that in case will receive support of influential man in venice outside mocenigo family connection carrying off of lady in broad daylight will be regarded a personal injury in family last attempt be different say be not bad enough be not like decoying girl from home by false message one must feel safe if such deed a be not severely punished let go back again matteo be use thinking of anything until know what have really be done be sure to be able to learn at home what step have be taken on reaching home matteo learned that polani accompanied by two member of council have already started in one of swiftest of state galley for mainland council have be hastily summoned upon hearing polani narrative have dispatched two of number with official of republic to botonda if ruggiero be found to be still there be to be kept prisoner in house in be staying under strictest watch if have left order be to be sent to town in venetian dominion on mainland for arrest when discovered in case be to be sent prisoner strongly guarded to venice other galley have be simultaneously dispatched to various port ordering strict search of boat arriving leaving directing minute investigation to be made a to occupant of boat have arrived during evening night fact that thousand ducat be offered for information must lead to recovery of girl be also to be published far wide news of abduction have spread greatest indignation be excited in city sailor from port of malamocco came over in great number regarded outrage on family of great merchant a almost personal insult stone be thrown at window of palazzo mocenigo attack must have be made upon have not authority sent down strong guard to protect person belonging to house family connected with be assaulted in street venice be in uproar there be one comfort giuseppi said when heard from francis what have taken place just at present mocenigo will have enough to think about own affair without troubling about have be in tremble ever since day have dreamed bad dream night be more nervous for than be for giuseppi have be careful too for although ruggiero be away friend be here active too a see by successful attempt think that at present be likely to let matter sleep public opinion be greatly excited over affair a if be found with stab in back must after what have passed be put down to think will leave alone do hope father francis said at breakfast next morning that there may be opportunity of sending back to england until something be heard of polanis have somewhat changed mind francis a to matter after what signor polani said other day feel that must be foolish for to adhere to plan with immense trade business connection can do almost anything for introduction into business be so vastly better than entering shop in city that be best in way that must stay here for present of course for time will be able to think of nothing missing daughter at rate can remain here until have leisure to pursue subject to state further than did other day what proposes for own business be good one for london trader be nothing by side of transaction of merchant prince at venice among very first of whom signor polani be reckoned francis be greatly pleased at father word have ever since polani have spoken to be pondering matter in mind knew that to enter business under protection must be one of best opening even venice must afford father be slow to change plan francis greatly feared that must adhere to original plan be hoping father that must think favourably of what signor polani said although of course kept silence knowing that must do what be best for now must ask if will until matter be cleared up excuse from task must learn nothing did continue at for mind must be ever running upon signor polani daughter must be altogether too restless to apply seems to too that might a row here there in gondola obtain clue a to place of concealment see how must do francis when so many others far better qualified than will be on lookout still a agree with that be not likely to apply mind diligently to task a indeed will shortly be giving up altogether grant request polani returned in evening to venice ruggiero mocenigo have be found professed great indignation at accusation brought against of being concerned in abduction of lady protested furiously when heard that until be found be to consider prisoner signor polani considered that indignation be feigned have doubt a to reality of anger at finding that be to be confined to house under guard immediately after return polani sent gondola for francis be pacing up down room when lad arrived suspicion have turned out correct a see francis must to heaven have acted upon at once then must not have happened seemed to altogether absurd when spoke to that woman have for year treated a friend must thus betray yet warning made uneasy so much so that set off to fetch home at five o'clock only to find be too late scarcely know why have sent for francis except that a have found to cost that be more clear sighted in matter than want to know what think now whether plan offering even chance of success have occurred to that have be carried off by friend of mocenigo have doubt fear signor francis said that there be little hope of thinking of anything have not already occurred to seems to hardly likely that can be in city although of course may be confined in house of mocenigo agent still must be sure that must offer large reward for discovery must be more likely to take right away besides must think that be be intention to join wherever may be a soon a learned that be in hand of accomplice fortunate discovery that have gone so soon after have be carried off going straight to armed with order of council probably upset calculation for be likely enough that agent have not arrived at house that learned from for first time that plan have succeeded have arrived two three hour later might have found gone be what calculated francisco agent have four hour start of must doubt carry girl to place of concealment chosen must then bear news to whereas going direct in one of state gondola might reach before did feel assured that did so be nigh midnight when arrived be still up doubt not awaiting arrival of villain have employed first step be to set watch round house with order to arrest who might come inquire for one however came news indeed of sudden arrival of state galley at hour have caused excitement in place agent might well have heard of upon arrival agree with in thinking be not in town make search more difficult question be what ought to do next reward that have offered will certainly bring news signor if save absolutely concerned have observed anything suspicious must send to fishing village on islet on mainland to publish news of reward have offered beyond see that anything can be done too have thought of nothing else since matteo brought news of being carried off will be of use can see going among fisherman questioning because with reward in view be certain that anyone who have anything to tell will come of own accord to do so know be case already francisco authority have be busy day with matter score of report a to closed gondola being seen have reached so far nothing have come of many of gondola have be traced to destination in case be there anything to justify suspicion happily a long a mocenigo be in confinement feel that actual harm will happen to girl villain be a crafty a fox may elude vigilance of officer in charge of be going to council presently to urge that must be brought here a prisoner from what hear there be little chance of request being complied with friend be already declaiming on injustice of man being treated a criminal when there be shadow of proof forthcoming against disturbance last night have angered many who have great friendship for who be indignant at attack of populace upon house of noble so see that there be faint chance that must bring prisoner think sir be in case must put trusty men to watch round house where be confined so that in case must escape vigilance of guard might seize upon everything depends a say upon being kept in durance will do so francisco at once will send to two of officer at port tell to pick out dozen men on whom can rely to proceed to botonda to watch closely everyone who enters leaf house without at same time making conspicuous at rate will be handy there in case mocenigo friend attempt to rescue by force might be done with success for house occupies stand at short distance out of town official in charge of mocenigo have only eight men with yes advice be excellent will follow at once must other idea occur to pray let know immediately saved daughter once although know there be reason why must be so still feel sort of belief that may somehow be instrumental in again being brought back to will do best sir may depend upon francis said earnestly be own sister must not feel more strongly interested in behalf francis spent next week almost entirely in gondola starting soon after daybreak with giuseppi must row across to village on mainland make inquiry of sort there must visit little group of fisherman hut built here there on post among willow must scan house a passed with vague hope that face might appear at window hand be waved for assistance during time have found nothing seemed to offer slightest clue be inquiry set on foot by signor polani more successful piece of information seemed to bear in slightest degree upon affair be investigated in case be found of slightest utility one evening be returning late tired by long day work discouraged with utter want of success when just a have passed under ponto maggiore light on bridge fell on face of sitter in gondola coming other way be man woman latter be closely veiled night be close oppressive just at moment when francis ' eye fell upon lifted veil for air francis recognized instantly for moment stopped rowing then dipped oar in a before directly other gondola passed through bridge behind own have got beyond circle of light swept suddenly round giuseppi gave exclamation of surprise giuseppi have luck at last did notice that gondola met just now woman sitting in be castaldi woman who betrayed signora what will do messer francisco giuseppi who have become almost a interested in search a master asked there be only single gondolier one other man if take by surprise can master will not do giuseppi woman must refuse to speak though must force to do so in dungeon girl must be sure to be removed moment be known be captured must follow see where go to let get well behind so that can just make out in distance if have suspicion that be being followed will land at first step slip away from be landing now signor giuseppi exclaimed directly afterwards will push on overtake on shore be too late giuseppi be hundred fifty yard away must have mixed in crowd be lost long before must get ashore follow row on fast not over towards side if gondola move off will make straight for step try to follow though chance of hitting upon in narrow lane turning be slight indeed if a hope gondola stop at step most likely will return to in time so will row in to bank hundred yard farther up canal wait person who have be seen in gondola have disappeared when came abreast of gondolier have seated in boat with evident intention of waiting francis steered gondola at distance of few yard from a shot past did not abate speed continued to row till be three four hundred yard farther up canal then turned gondola paddled noiselessly back until must see outline of boat be watching hour elapsed before movement be visible then francis heard sound of footstep must just make out figure of person descending step entering gondola then boat moved out into middle of canal where few boat be still passing to fro francis kept gondola close by bank so a to be in deep shade of house boat be following again passed under ponto maggiore for distance followed line of grand canal keep eye upon giuseppi be sure to turn off one way other soon if be too far ahead of when doe so then may give slip altogether gondola continued course whole length of canal then straight on until nearly opposite saint mark passed close to larger gondola with four rower coming slowly in other direction seemed to francis that two boat paused when opposite other that few word be exchanged then boat be watching turned out straight into lagoon be rather lighter here than in canal bordered on side by house francis did not turn head of gondola for minute two will be very difficult to keep in sight out here without making out giuseppi said yes be likely enough that be only going out there in order that may be quite sure that be not followed before striking off to place want to go to may possibly have made out guess that be tracking must be sure to keep eye ear open can only just make out now messer francisco a will have building behind will not be able to see a well a can see think can go now will risk at rate giuseppi have lost sight of already will never do to let give slip dipped oar in water gondola darted out from shore have not gone fifty stroke when heard sound of oar close at hand to right giuseppi hard francis cried a glanced over shoulder sweep with oar brought gondola head in moment almost at right angle to course that have be pursuing next sent dancing on new line just a four oared gondola swept down upon missing stern by only three four foot have be le quick in turning iron prow must have cut right through light boat giuseppi burst into torrent of vituperation at carelessness of gondolier who have so nearly run into francis silenced at once row giuseppi be done on purpose be gondola other spoke to assailant be turning also in few second be in pursuit francis understood now gondola have be following have noticed have informed friend waiting off saint mark of fact intent upon watching receding boat have paid no further attention to four oared craft have made turn lay waiting in readiness to run down must follow in track of other boat francis soon saw that craft behind be fast one rowed by men who be first rate gondolier fast a own boat be flying through water other gained upon steadily be heading now for entrance to grand canal for pursuer in wider sweep have made in turning be nearer to piazza than be cut off flight in direction keep cool giuseppi said will be up to in minute two when bow be within yard two of say 'now sweep head straight round towards lagoon can turn quicker than can then let gain upon will then turn again gondola in pursuit came up hand over hand francis kept looking over shoulder when saw bow gliding up within few foot of stern exclaimed now with sudden turn gondola again swept out seaward pursuer rushed on for length two before must sweep round while volley of imprecation threat burst from three men who be standing up in with drawn sword francis giuseppi be now rowing le strongly gaining breath for next effort when gondola again came up to swept round to left a pursuer followed headed for grand canal make for step of santa maria church will jump out there trust to foot two lad put out strength now be three boat length ahead before pursuer be fairly on track be now rowing for life for knew that must hardly succeed in doubling again that gondola behind be so well handled that must not gain on at turning be to venture into narrow channel be question of speed alone so hard did row that gondola in pursuit gained slowly on be still two length ahead when dashed up to step of church simultaneously sprang on shore leaped up step dashed off at top of speed hearing a did so crash a gondola ran into light craft there be moment delay a men have to step across boat to gain shore be fifty yard ahead before heard sound of pursuer foot on stone step be lightly clad shoeless carried nothing to impede movement have therefore little fear of being overtaken after racing on at top of speed for few minute stopped listened sound of pursuer footstep died away in distance after taking few turn to put off track pursued way at more leisurely pace have smashed gondola giuseppi said with sob for be very proud of light craft never mind gondola francis said cheerfully if have smashed hundred must not matter woman have got away have learned nothing giuseppi said surprised at master cheerfulness think have learned something giuseppi think have learned everything have doubt girl be confined in hut on san nicolo wonder never thought of before made so sure that must be taken somewhere close to where mocenigo be staying that never occurred to that might hide out there ought to have known that be just thing must do for while search must be keen among islet near land village there one must think of looking for on seaward island have doubt be there now that woman came ashore to report to friend four oared boat have chased be in waiting off saint mark to attack boat might be following will go to signor polani at once tell have happened suppose be about one o'clock now have not noticed hour be past eleven before first met gondola must have be good deal more than hour lying there waiting for quarter of hour walking took to palazzo of polani rang twice at bell at land entrance before face appeared at little window of door asked who be there wish to see signor polani at once francis said signor retired to rest hour ago man said never mind that francis replied be francis hammond have important news to give a soon a servitor recognized francis ' voice unbarred door have news of lady asked eagerly have news will hope lead to something francis replied moment later voice of polani who although have retired to room have not yet gone to sleep be heard at top of grand stair inquiring who be who have come so late for although men have be arriving day with report from various island village thought that one must come at hour unless news be important francis at once answered be signor polani francis hammond have news think may be of importance although may be mistaken still be certainly news may lead to something merchant hurried down what be francisco what have learned have seen woman castaldi have followed know for certain where be going for have be chased by large gondola have narrowly escaped with life still have clue to whereabouts francis then related event of evening why did not run into boat give alarm at once francisco gondola passing must have given assistance when declared who be for affair be talk of city if woman be in power must soon find mean to make speak yes signor moment be known to be in power may be sure that must remove daughter from place where have be hiding thought therefore best plan must be to track doubt must have succeeded in doing so have not be for attack upon by gondola be right doubt francisco still be unfortunate for see that be now nearer than be before except that know that woman be in habit of coming into city think be nearer sir for have adventure time ago may afford clue to hiding place then told merchant how have one evening taken man out to san nicolo have discovered that hut in island be used a meeting place by various person among whom be ruggiero mocenigo might have thought of place before signor in fact never entered mind from first considered so certain that men who carried off daughter must take to hiding place where mocenigo must speedily join that san nicolo never entered mind own be very stupid for seems now to that natural thing for to do must be to take in very opposite direction to in search for must be made story have be frequently interrupted by exclamation of surprise by polani at conclusion laid hand on francis ' shoulder dear boy said how can thank seem to to be born to be preserver of daughter can not doubt that suspicion be correct that be confined in hut at san nicolo how fortunate that did not denounce conspiracy for conspiracy doubt be that discovered for have done so other place must have be selected for girl prison must not be too sanguine sir girl may not be in hut still may come on clue there may lead to if not will search island on side a closely a have done on mainland now will send for gondolier set out at once there be ten twelve men in house be hardly likely that will place guard over of anything like strength a of course will be anxious to avoid observation by islander think must do anything tonight sir francis said gondola chased will be on alert can not of course suspect in slightest that have clue to hiding place of daughter still might think that if be really pursuing other gondola have recognized woman castaldi might bring news to that stir might be made may therefore be watching to see if anything come of if saw bustle gondola setting out taking direction of island might set off get there first for be very fast craft remove daughter before reach hut must say wait till morning may be watching house now if in hour two see be quiet will doubt retire with belief that danger be at end then in morning must embark men in two three gondola must not start from own step for doubt house be watched let men go out singly embark at distance from here not at same place once out upon lagoon must row quietly towards san nicolo keeping considerable distance apart men lying down in bottom a boat approach island so that if anyone be on watch will have suspicion a be only one know position of hut will be with in first gondola will not land near hut pas by land at other end of island other gondola will slowly follow land at same spot then three four men can go along by sea face with order to watch boat hauled up upon shore there stop party making down towards rest of will walk straight to hut a lie among sand hill hope will be able to get quite close to before approach be discovered excellent plan francisco though be so impatient that night will seem endless to certainly plan be best even if house be watched be seen to enter if remains perfectly quiet will naturally suppose that news brought be not considered of sufficient importance to lead to action will of course remain here till morning can not do sir though will return first thing there be lying on table paper with particular name of person saw meet in hut request to father that if return in morning will at once lay before council place there day when go out in order that if must be seized carried off by mocenigo people must have mean of forcing to let go although know absolutely nothing of nature of conspiracy will not know how much be aware of what particular may have given in document a must name to present among be envoy of king of hungary now in city must hardly dare harm when knew that if did so affair must be brought before council be excellent precaution francisco why be a prudent thoughtful a be courageous be not likely to be of much use sir francis said modestly be very much more likely to get stab in back than to be carried off still be just possible that mocenigo might like to see vengeance carried out be therefore worth while guarding against a see will be necessary for to be back sometime before morning at rate francisco have better wait here until morning break room be not likely to be entered for hour after so while be preparing for expedition can go out make way to grand canal hail early gondola be put down at own step when a have told can

go with will be sure to want to question will have to say what be reason for thinking daughter be hid in hut signor francis said a gondola rowed towards saint mark can only do by telling of secret meeting want to denounce number of people besides ruggiero have evidence against know what be plotting have wish to create for more enemy be quite enough to have incurred enmity of connection of house of mocenigo be true enough francisco see how be to be avoided unfortunately did recognize others besides ruggiero quite so signor be not going to tell lie about whatever consequence may be still wish must get out of wish must francis see escape for especially a say did not recognize ruggiero a passenger carried signor did not might have be can not say be wrapped in cloak did not see feature be pity francisco for have known statement that moved by curiosity followed saw into hut must have be sufficient without entering into other matter most of countryman must not hesitate about telling lie to avoid mixing up further in such matter for danger of making enemy be thoroughly appreciated here be perfectly right like steady love of truth whatever consequence to yourself certainly a soon a matter be concluded will be better for to quit venice for time be going to council direct signor be going first to magistrate to tell have in hand five person who have be engaged in carrying off daughter beg to send at once to take into custody then will go before council demand justice upon mocenigo against whom have now conclusive evidence will not be wanted at magistracy own evidence found keeping guard over daughter will be quite sufficient for present after that girl evidence will be sufficient to convict without name appearing in affair at will try whether can not keep name from appearing before council also yes think might do a first step give promise not to name unless find absolutely necessary may a well remain here in gondola until return be upwards of hour before signor polani came back to boat have succeeded said in keeping name out of first of told daughter story then said that having obtained information ruggiero before be banished from venice be in habit of going sometimes at night to hut on san nicolo proceeded thither found daughter concealed in hut whose position have be described to of course inquired where have obtained information replied that a knew have offered large reward must lead to daughter discovery that reward have attracted one in secret of mocenigo that for man own safety have be compelled to promise must not divulge name of council be inclined to insist others pointed out that for end of justice mattered in way how obtained information have at rate gone to island found daughter there evidence if be in accordance with what have stated be amply sufficient to bring guilt of abduction of daughter home to ruggiero against whom other circumstance have already excited suspicion galley have already started for mainland with order to bring back prisoner girl be to appear to give evidence tomorrow woman castaldi be to be interrogated by council afternoon have doubt will make full confession seeing that daughter evidence be in sufficient to prove guilt that can be proved from other source that be who inveigled away by false message from be glad indeed signor be not to be called that affair of conspiracy be not to be brought up must with permission now return home giuseppi took message to father from first thing explaining absence told when left house to go at once to tell that daughter have be recovered must return before long still will want to hear from a to event of night will also tell francisco will call upon afternoon have much to say to be glad signor polani be coming mr hammond said when son gave message be quite resolved that will quit venice at once wish to blame for what have done indeed be likely to have favourable effect upon fortune at age have mixed up in adventure of kind taken part in affair of great house drawn upon enmity of one of most powerful family of venice be altogether strange improper for lad of year belonging to family of quiet trader have be thinking about morning be quite resolved that sooner be out of venice better if saw way of sending off before must do so signor polani have say so far concealed from council fact that have be mixed up in business there be saying how soon may come out know that venice swarm with spy be likely before many hour to learn fact of midnight arrival at polani house a order be given for preparation of expedition to island before time will not need much penetration to conclude that be bearer of news led to discovery of maiden besides accompanied expedition acted a guide to hut part of will learn from servant of house part of may get out from sailor who over wine cup be not given to reticence council may not have pressed polani on point take word for of at least will endeavour to get to bottom of especially mocenigo connection who will naturally be alarmed at thought that there be somewhere traitor among own rank affair have become very serious francis far beyond compass of boyish scrape time must be lost in getting out of venice have doubt polani will see matter in same light for know way of countryman even better than do interview between two trader be long one at conclusion francis be sent for francis father said signor polani have have kindness to make offer of most generous nature not at messer hammond venetian interrupted let there be mistake upon score son have rendered service impossible for ever to repay adequately have laid under obligation greater than can ever discharge at same time fortunately be in position to be able to further interest in life have proposed francisco that will enter house at once will of course for year learn business will do so in position son of mine must occupy when come of age will take place a partner with father will return to england informs that be now longing to return to own country have for time be thinking of doing so have proposed to that will act a agent there hitherto have not traded direct with england in future will do so largely father have explained to somewhat of transaction see there be good profit to be made on trade with london by merchant who have advantage of advice assistance of one like father thoroughly conversant in trade thus hope that arrangement will be largely to mutual advantage a to will probably be reluctant to establish for life in country there be reason why in time when father wish to retire from business must not establish in london in charge of english branch of house be most grateful to for offer signor be vastly beyond anything that ambition must ever have aspired to can only say will try best to do justice to kindness to have fear a to francisco merchant said have shown so much thoughtfulness in business will have fear of entrusting even weighty affair of business in hand must remember always that will still consider debtor thoroughly agree with father view a to necessity for leaving venice a soon a possible in few month matter will have blown over angry feeling excited will calm down will then be able to come go in safety at present be best out of town have therefore arranged with father that will embark tonight on board bonito sail tomorrow will have much to say to father now hope will find time to come round say goodbye to daughter evening adventure francis mr hammond said when merchant have left have turned out fortunate indeed have opening now beyond anything must have hoped for signor polani have expressed most warmly told that need concern further with future for must now be affair arrangement that have made with will enable to hold head a high a in city for will give almost monopoly of venetian trade although said that have long be thinking of entering into trade direct with england there be doubt that be feeling towards have influenced now in matter business here

matter altogether offer then of signor polani be in respect acceptable will give up own business start anew selling a will on commission will run risk while profit will be far larger than must myself make for polani will carry on on great scale a for will soon learn way of trade will be able to come home join eventually succeed in business fairer prospect must well open to young man if show a keen in business a have be energetic in pursuit have adopted assuredly great future be open to may look to be one of greatest merchant in city of london know not yet what offer polani may make here hope that will not settle in venice permanently will always remember that be englishman son of london citizen that will never lose love for native land yet hurry home for sake two brother will soon have finished schooling will of course be apprenticed to a soon a return if a hope turn out steady industrious will by time come to man estate be of great assistance to in business now will be wanting to say goodbye to friend be careful last evening for be just when be thinking most of other matter sudden misfortune be likely to come upon delighted with good fortune rather because opened up life of

told beppo son that next day be leaving venice be going to enter service of signor polani giuseppi ceased rowing throwing down at bottom of gondola began to sob violently with abandonment to emotion

polani found in hut on san nicolo father can not think how came to hear of hiding place say polani must not say how learned news father supposes heard from member of ruggiero household francis hesitated for moment have at first be on point of telling matteo of share have have in recovery of girl thought that although friend must be trusted not to repeat news wilfully might accidentally say something must lead to fact being known that a polani have strongly enjoined necessity of keeping secret have declined to mention even to council source from obtained information must look upon a babbler unworthy of trust did find that matteo have be let into secret doe not much matter who be polani learned news from great point be have found daughter safe from injury hear have brought back with woman who betrayed be fortunate indeed that took such prompt measure with ruggiero thus prevented escaping from mainland making off with girl a of course intended to do father tell matteo said that state gondola have already be dispatched to bring ruggiero prisoner here that even powerful connection will not save from severe punishment for public indignation be so great at attempt that friend will not venture to plead on behalf now have bit of news to tell matteo signor polani have most generously offered position in house be to sail tomorrow in one of ship for east congratulate

have not brought father to hiding place there must have remained until ruggiero mocenigo came carried away francisco brought father news matteo exclaimed in astonishment why be who found out after did

astonished friend signor polani father impressed upon so strongly must keep silent a to share in business thought better not even to mention to at present be purely result of accident be nothing of sort maria said be result of keeping eye open knowing how to put two two together did not know francisco that be secret have not seen father since have returned suppose thought must see nobody until saw again so did not tell that be not to mention name in affair will be careful in future how be francisco matteo asked now know so much a suppose can be told rest can understand well enough why be to be kept secret why cousin be anxious to get out of venice at once francis related manner in first became acquainted with existence of hut on island fact of being frequented by ruggiero mocenigo how on catching sight of gouvernante in gondola seeing make out across lagoon idea struck that girl be confined in hut be very simple see matteo concluded will never say anything against learning to row

went on for will be back two three month will take good care that papa doe not send ship off in hurry again will be almost a good a having brother look upon almost a brother now francisco very good brother too think that man will molest more if thought there be chance of must ask papa to keep for time because must feel confident that must manage to protect somehow think there be slightest chance of more trouble from francis said be sure of long term of imprisonment for carrying off be least can do to must think maria said indignantly certainly will not feel comfortable while be at large after hour talk francis friend took leave certainly be born with silver spoon in mouth matteo said a took seat in gondola cousin doe well to get out of venice at once for can tell there be score of young

spent time with father talking over future arrangement have doubt that will see sometimes francis for polani will be sure to give opportunity of making trip to england from time to time in one of ship trading thither unless anything unexpected happens future appears assured polani tell will always regard in light of son have fear of doing anything to cause to forfeit good opinion of be over adventurous for even in merchant ship there be many peril to be met with pirate swarm in mediterranean in spite of effort of venice to suppress when war be going on venice genoa send out number of ship whose doings savour strongly of piracy remember that first duty of captain of merchant ship be to save vessel cargo that must not think of fighting unless see other method of escape open to be possible that after time may send one of brother out here will depend upon what find of disposition when get home for will be worse than useless to send lad of headstrong disposition out to care of one few year older than can talk about when come over to england see what position be occupying here fear that venice be about to enter upon period of great difficulty danger there can be little doubt that genoa padua hungary be leagued against powerful a be great a be resource will be taxed to utmost to carry through danger threaten however have faith in future believe that will weather storm a have done many have preceded venice have rare virtue of endurance greatest danger most disastrous defeat fail to shake courage only arouse to greater effort in respect be in greatest contrast to rival genoa who always loses heart moment tide turn against doubt be due in slight extent to oligarchic form of government people see noble who rule calm self possessed however great danger remain confident tranquil while in genoa misfortune be signal for struggle between contending faction occasion be seized to throw blame contumely upon in power people give way to alternate outburst of rage depression say there be fault in government of venice taking altogether there be government in europe to compare with during last three hundred year history of other city in italy may say of other nation in europe be one long record of intestine struggle bloodshed while in venice there have not be single popular tumult worthy of name be to strength firmness moderation of government that venice owes advancement respect in be held among nation a much a to commercial industry of people alone among nation must for year have withstood interdict of pope misfortune have sometimes befallen alone have never felt foot of invader bent neck beneath foreign yoke to preserve existence here save only in matter of government opinion be free stranger of nationality be welcome be grand city grand people

perfectly well by usual cabin be only size of yours two have be thrown into one to make light airy where do sleep giuseppi be going to sleep in passage outside door messer francisco oh sha' like francis said ought to have better place than giuseppi laughed why messer francisco considering that time slept in gondola other half on straw in kitchen will do capitally of course must sleep in fo'castle with crew if liked must find hot stifling there chose place asked captain if must sleep there have given leave in hour bonito have passed through malamocco channel be out on broad sea wind be very light just sufficient to keep great sail bellied out sailor be at work coiling down rope washing deck making everything clean tidy be good start messer hammond captain said coming up to if wind hold will be able to make course round southern point of greece then on to candia be first port always like light breeze when first go out of port give time for everyone to get at home have thing shipshape before begin to get lively doe not look a if must ever get lively francis said looking at heavy vessel be lively enough in storm can tell captain said laughing when once begin to roll doe in earnest be fine sea boat have fear of gale wish must say a much of pirate however have always be fortunate a carry stout crew must give good account of herself against of small piratical vessel that swarm among island although of course if fell in with two three of together must be awkward how many men do carry altogether captain just seventy see row thirty oar in case of need put two men to oar though doe look fast can get along at fine rate when oar be double banked have shown heel many time order be strict be never to fight if can get away by running suppose have to fight sometimes francis asked yes have be in tough fight several time though not in bonito be only built last year once in lion be attacked by three pirate be at anchor in bay wind be blowing on shore when suddenly came round headland so there be chance of running have to fight out fought for five hour before sheered off pretty well crippled one of in flame for carried greek fire three four time nearly got footing on deck managed to beat off somehow lost third of crew think there be man escaped without wound be laid up for three month after got home with slash on shoulder pretty nigh took off left arm however saved ship cargo be valuable one messer polani saw that one be worse for share in business there be more liberal hearted man in trade than be may be scarcity of hand in port there be never difficulty in getting good crew together for vessel of course there be rough with smooth year ago be in prison for six month with crew in azoff be work of rascally genoese who be always doing bad turn when have chance even when be at peace with set mind of native khan be prince of country against by lying story that have be engaged in smuggling good in at port suddenly in middle of night in marched soldier on board ship two other venetian craft lying in harbour took possession of shut up in prison there be till messer polani got news sent out ship to pay fine demanded be joke can tell for prison be so hot crowded food so bad that got fever pretty near half of died before ransom came then at constantinople genoese stirred people up against once twice sailor ashore have to fight for life genoese be always doing mischief suppose do mischief sometimes captain imagine be one side of course pay out when get chance captain replied be likely be going to stand being always put upon not take chance when come only want fair trade favour while rascal want to know have chance with when come to fair trading know captain that genoese say just same thing about venetian that venetian do about so expect that there be fault on side captain laughed suppose want to have matter own way messer hammond consider genoese have right to come interfering with to eastward of italy have got france spain to trade with western part of italy why keep there besides look upon a landsman why can always lick at sea in fair fight generally captain admit generally thrash still know have sometimes got better of even when force be equal captain grunted must not deny fact sometimes captain do duty said put lot of young patrician in command of galley men know one end of ship from other then of course get worst of maintain that properly fought venetian ship be always more than match for genoese think generally be captain hope will always prove so in future see though be english have lived long enough in venice to feel like venetian have never be to england captain said though good many venetian ship go there year tell be island like venice only deal bigger than have got in mediterranean who have be there say sea be mighty stormy that sailing up from spain get tremendous tempest sometimes with wave ever so much bigger than have here longer more regular not so trying to ship a short sharp gale of sea believe be so captain though know anything about be year since came out voyage be very calm one three day of quiet sailing bonito rounded headland of morea shaped course to candia voyage be very pleasant one to francis day captain brought out list of cargo instructed in price of description of good told of various description of merchandise must be likely to purchase at different port at be to touch price must probably have to pay for certain time too be devoted day to examination of chart of various port island captain pointing out mark be to be observed on entering leaving harbour best place for anchorage point where shelter must be obtained must high wind come on after losing sight of morea weather changed cloud banked up rapidly in southwest captain ordered great sail to be furled be going to have serious gale said to francis be unusual at period of year have thought for last two day be going to have change hoped to have reached candia before gale burst upon fear that will drive off course by evening be blowing hard sea got up rapidly ship speedily justified remark of captain on power of rolling oar at men have be labouring since sail be furled be laid in be impossible to keep course captain said must run up among island anchor under lee of one of must recommend to get into bed a soon a possible have not learned to keep leg in storm see that lad of yours be very ill already a show sign of suffering thus far will probably escape be time however before francis went below scene be novel to be astonished at sight of wave at manner in tossed great ship about a if be eggshell when became quite dark must see nothing white crest of wave foam that flew high in air time bluff bow of ship plunged down into hollow took captain advice retired to cabin be on deck again early gray mist overhung water sea be of leaden colour crested with white head wave be far higher than have be on previous evening a came racing along behind bonito crest seemed a if must rise over stern overwhelm apprehension be soon dispelled a saw how lightly vessel rose time although showing very small breadth of sail be running along at great rate leaving white streak of foam behind captain be standing near helm francis made way to well captain how be getting on where be asked cheerfully be getting on well enough messer francisco a can see for bonito be a good sea boat a ever floated must not care for wind be twice a strong a be be not storm be thinking about island if be down in mediterranean must turn into cot sleep soundly here be matter be somewhere up among island where man can say wind have shifted bit two three time during night a be obliged to run straight before there be calculating to within few mile where be have tried to edge out to westward a much a must with wind blowing height of ship out of water sag away to leeward so fast that nothing be gained by according to calculation can not be very far from west coast of mitylene if cloud must lift give look round for two minute must know about a know outline of island in aegean a over on side be always in sight of two three of must know about if must get view of land now for aught know may be running straight down upon rocky coast idea be not pleasant one francis strained eye gazing through mist what must do if saw land captain asked presently get out oar row head round try to work either to right left whichever point of land seemed easiest to weather of course if be mainland be being driven on there must be use must try row into teeth of gale so a to keep off land a long a possible in hope of wind dropping when got into willow water must drop anchor still keep on rowing to lessen strain upon if gave there must be end to bonito if a think be driving towards mitylene there be safe harbour on side of island will certainly run into be well sheltered landlocked two more hour passed then there be startling transformation cloud broke suddenly cleared off a if by magic sun streamed brightly out wind be blowing a strong a ever change in hue of sky sea must at once have raised spirit of tired crew have not long line of land be seen stretching ahead of at distance of four five mile just a thought captain exclaimed a saw be mitylene sure enough entrance to harbour spoke of lie away there on beam oar be at once got out sail braced up little bonito made for point indicated by captain who took helm half hour be close to land francis must see sign of port in few minute bonito rounded end of low island passage opened before passed through found in still water in harbour large enough to hold fleet of venice anchor be speedily let drop seems almost bewildering francis said hush quiet here after turmoil of storm outside to whom doe mitylene belong genoese have trading station castle at other side of island belongs to constantinople other side of island be rich fertile a see be mountainous barren people have not very good reputation if have be wrecked must have be plundered if not murdered see two vessel lying close to shore near village be pirate when get chance may be quite sure in fact island swarm with venice doe can to keep down genoese hungarian rest of keep so busy that have time to take matter properly in hand make clean sweep of chapter attack by pirate boat be lowered captain went ashore with strong crew armed to teeth francis accompanied native be sullen in manner expressed willingness to trade to exchange hide wine for may a well do little barter captain said a rowed back towards ship port be not often visited road across island be hilly rough so ought to be willing to sell good cheaply did not seem pleased to see nevertheless francis said see genoese have got footing in island of course represent to native a being robber who must take island if got chance round coast island people be partisan of venice genoa care very little for constantinople although form part of empire constantinople tax heavily be too weak to afford protection of course be greek greek of island have very little in common beyond language with greek of constantinople see too that turk be increasing in power know that if be to be saved from falling into hand of moslem be venice genoa who will protect not constantinople who will have enough to do to defend a to must naturally prefer venice because venice be far better mistress than genoa of course when genoese get footing spread lie a to tyranny greed so come that people of island be divided in wish that while be gladly received in of be regarded with hate suspicion in others trade at once began continued until evening how long do expect to stay here captain francis asked that must depend upon wind may go down tomorrow may continue to blow strong for day be use attempting to work down to candia until change direction must hope however that in day two may be off be doing little more than wasting time here strong watch be placed on deck at why surely captain there be fear of attack war have not yet be proclaimed with genoa although there be little doubt will be so in few week perhaps few day there be never real peace between venice genoa in sea captain said a war be now imminent one can not be too watchful state galley must not be attacked merchant vessel be different who be to inquire about merchant ship why if be attacked plundered here who must be wiser must either have throat cut be sent to rot in dungeon of genoa not till there be exchange of prisoner perhaps year hence must in venice know what have befallen when week passed news came to venice of having reached candia must be supposed that have be lost in storm signor polani must run pen through name of bonito put down a total loss there must be end of till of who be alive when prison door be opened made way back to venice messer francisco in eastern water one must always act a if republic be at war why did not antonio doria in time of profound peace attack seize eight venetian ship laden with good killing two of merchant on board putting ship at ransom a to single vessel missing never heard of number be innumerable be put down to pirate trust genoese be often at bottom of be robber genoese in fair trade can always beat know so be always seeking pretext for quarrel with francis smiled quietly at bigoted hatred captain bore genoese thought useless to argue with next morning came up on deck soon after daybreak see one of vessel have taken departure said a glanced towards spot where have be lying so have captain said have not noticed that before wonder what fellow have gone for good may be sure why be blowing hard outside still a may see by rate light cloud travel must never have put to sea without having motive must have have strong crew on board to row out in teeth of gale far enough to make off land that fellow be up to mischief of sort few minute later captain ordered boat to be lowered rowed out to rocky islet at mouth of harbour landing climbed up rock looked out to sea in hour returned to ship be use said to francis wind be blowing straight into passage must not row bonito out against be different with craft went out yesterday evening for have doubt started a soon a became dark be low in water must not hold wind besides doubt lowered mast with strong crew might well have swept out with bonito with high side heavy tonnage must not be done what do think went out for captain be likely enough that may have gone to one of other island may return with dozen other craft pirate like news that venetian merchant ship without consort be weather bound here must bring upon like bee be dangerous thing sailing alone have talked over several time with master other merchant generally send ship in company of eight ten be then strong enough to beat off attack of pirate messer polani always sends vessel out singly what say be ' single ship always travel faster than convoy because must go at rate of slowest among then captain be free to go where will without consulting others according a get news where trade be to be done when get there can drive own bargain without competition of other ship so see there be advantage way padrone ship run greater risk if get through safely bring home much larger profit than do of others a rule prefer sailing singly just at present time must be well pleased to see dozen consort lying alongside three time during day captain paid visit to rocky island on return for last time before nightfall said to francis wind be certainly falling hope that tomorrow morning will be able to get out of trap be convinced that there be danger see nothing else do captain beyond departure of craft to make think that there be danger yes have seen two thing captain said in first place demeanour of people have changed seem more unfriendly than be before a moved about place today seemed to that there be suppressed excitement people gathered together talked earnestly separated if of crew happened to go near even laughed when thought that none of be looking looked serious sullen if turned round be convinced that be expecting something to happen have reason for suspecting have kept sharp watch on high hill behind village tell there be nothing at top except curious stone look a if have once be tree so there be nothing can want to go up for several time today have made out figure of men climbing that hill when got to top stood for time a if be looking out over sea then came down again without doing anything now men climb hill a merely for exercise went up because expected to see something that something must only be fleet of pirate boat from other island must give year pay if must get out of place evening can not be done must wait till tomorrow morning will try then even though risk being driven on rock however if do come tonight will not catch asleep order be issued that whole crew be to remain in readiness for attack that whose watch be below be to sleep with arm beside lower port be closed strong watch be kept on deck be certain that happened bonito must not be taken by surprise being assured by captain that be not probable that attack must be made before morning a pirate not knowing exact position must wait until first gleam of daylight enabled to make out where be lying to advance in order against francis lay down on couch leaving order that if asleep be to be called two hour before daybreak slept little however getting up frequently going out to ascertain if sound indicated presence of enemy upon one of occasion found that person leaning next to against bulwark gazing towards mouth of harbour be giuseppi have be here long giuseppi since be out last messer francisco thought must wait bit listen have heard anything have heard sound several time what sort of sound giuseppi such sound a be made when sail yard be lowered have heard over over again when out at night on lagoon near port there be mistake in creaking of block a halyard run through be sure that since have be here several vessel have brought up inside mouth of harbour of sailor have heard same noise so there can not be mistake about if captain like will take small boat row out find out about will ask captain giuseppi captain however said that there must be use in being done whether there be few whether there be many of must wait till morning before go out there will be no working out that channel in dark even if be unopposed must have managed to come in francis said doubt of comrade in other barque people from village show light out there to guide in besides wind be favourable to against young sir there be nothing to do to wait in morning if there be few of will try to break through gain sea if there be many will fight here a then hand will be available for combat while if be rowing half of must be occupied with oar if lad be to go a proposes might fall into hand of enemy a information must gather must be in case of use be best must remain where be hour seemed long until first tinge of daylight appeared in sky hand be on deck now for news that vessel have be arriving in port have convinced that danger really threatened be not until hour later that be able to make out dark object lying in under shadow of islet across mouth of harbour there be messer francisco captain said ten of a far a can make out there may be more for likely enough of be lying side by side there may too be round corner where can not see half hour will know about francis be half surprised that captain did not order oar to be put out lashed in position for be recognized plan for preventing ship from being boarded by enemy who must thus only approach at lofty poop forecastle be not going to get out oar to keep off messer francisco in first place side be so high out of water that pirate will have difficulty in boarding in case in second place if get oar out row full at sooner later will break off be important that must be able to row have be thinking matter over idea be a soon a advance to get three four oar at work on side so a to move gradually through water towards harbour mouth rower will be charged to let oar swing alongside whenever of craft dash at will want oar a well a sail to get away when be once outside think have much chance of finally beating off if stop fight here if can do so for time can manage to creep out of harbour may be well when daylight fairly broke be able to make out enemy vessel be of size from long low craft carrying great sail long bank of oar down to boat of few ton burden seemed crowded with men none of be anything like a high out of water a bonito captain said will find very difficult to climb up side still odds against be serious will give warmer reception than expect will hardly calculate on being so strong handed so well prepared for everything be indeed ready for combat two three barrel of compound known a greek fire have be brought up from hold cook have heated cauldron full of pitch thirty men with bow arrow be on poop rest with spear ax sword stood along bulwark may a well get a near entrance a can before fight begin captain said get up anchor a soon a be aboard get out four oar on side anchor have already be hove short be soon in place then oar dipped into water slowly bonito moved towards mouth of harbour scarcely have oar touched water than bustle be perceived on board piratical ship oar be put out in two three minute pirate be under way advancing at rapid pace towards bonito crew made reply to shout yell of pirate in accordance with order of captain remained in stooping position so that figure of captain a hauled up flag with lion of venice to masthead be alone visible to pirate a approached volley of arrow be shot at bonito not shot replied until be within fifty yard of ship then captain gave word archer sprang to foot from eminence poured arrow thick fast on to crowded deck of pirate captain gave word to rower relinquished oar swung in by side of vessel moment later two of largest craft of pirate dashed alongside instant did so be saluted with shower of boiling pitch while pot full of greek fire be thrown down upon who tried to climb up side of bonito be speared with lance cut down with battleaxes combat be of short duration many of on whom boiling pitch have fallen jumped overboard in agony while others did same to escape greek fire in vain endeavoured to extinguish fire quickly spread to woodwork in five minute after beginning of fight two craft dropped astern from bonito with flame already rising fiercely from in meantime other vessel have not be idle storm of missile be poured upon bonito fate befell comrade however showed how formidable be vessel have regarded a easy prey when first assailant of bonito dropped astern none of others cared to take place man oar again captain ordered bonito again moved forward crew stooping behind bulwark while archer only rose from time to time to discharge shaft thing be most afraid of captain said to francis who be standing beside be that will ram with prow bonito be strongly built chance be that must knock hole in must think captain that if be to get up of bale of cloth fasten rope to might lower over side so break shock be worth trying anyhow captain said score of sailor be at once sent down to fetch up bale rope be fastened round be laid along by bulwark in readiness for being lowered instantly ten bale be placed on side three men told off to bale by time be halfway to mouth of harbour preparation be completed just in time for small boat suddenly drew aside two of largest of pirate craft rowed by twenty four oar dashed at one on side captain shouted order men sprang to foot be seen at once that vessel must strike about midships three bale on side be raised to bulwark lowered down with rope until close to water edge closely touching other francis sprang on to bulwark superintended operation on one side while captain did same on other few foot more astern lad be right now keep bale touching be just in line instant later bonito reeled from shock of two tremendous blow bow of pirate be stove in thick bale enabled bonito to withstand shock although side creaked seam started water flowed in freely of crew thought little be occupied in hurling dart arrow combustible into pirate a backed off in already sinking condition now think can go captain said ordered whole of oar to be manned be speedily got out bonito made way out through mouth of harbour pirate in lighter boat rowed round round shooting cloud of arrow not venturing to come to close quarter after fate have befallen four largest vessel of fleet a soon a be clear of islet sail be hoisted wind have fallen much during night have worked round to east under sail oar bonito left island none of pirate venturing to follow in pursuit oar be soon laid in men with mallet chisel set to work to caulk seam through water be making way casualty be now inquired into be found that six men have be shot dead nine twenty have received wound more le severe from arrow of pirate francis have be twice wounded while superintending placing of bale one arrow have gone through right leg have struck in side glanced off rib wo do messer francisco captain said a assisted giuseppi to bandage wound signor polani placed on board to learn something of seamanship commerce not to make target for arrow of pirate however have to thank for saving of bonito for assuredly must have be stove in have not happy thought of hanging bale overboard struck must be of use against war galley whose beak be often below waterline against craft like pirate act splendidly there be doubt that saved ship from destruction from death for after burning of two first vessel attacked may be sure must have shown little mercy ca think how came to think of why have read in book captain of defender of wall hanging over truss of straw to break blow of battering ram machine of besieger directly said be going to ram struck might do same then thought that bale of cloth similar to got up on deck to trade with islander must be just thing be close shave captain said be leaning over saw whole side of ship bend beneath blow expected to hear rib crack beneath fortunately bonito be stronger built than assailant bow crumpled in before side gave heart be in mouth for time can tell so be mine captain hardly felt two arrow strike must have be shot from one of other boat then must not help laughing to see way in men at oar tumbled backwards at moment when vessel struck be a if invisible giant have swept off seat together wind continued favourable until arrived at candia where captain reported to commander of venetian war galley lying in port attack have be made upon galley at once started for scene of action to destroy pirate might find there among neighbouring island in various inlet bay of mainland having delivered letter landed portion of cargo for use of polani agent in island bonito proceeded to cyprus for week cruised along coast of syria trading in various turkish port for venice although have shared in of crusade be now a have often be before on friendly term with turk interest lay in direction carried on large trade with in day when lay under interdict of pope europe stood aloof from drew store of provision from moslem port be thus enabled successfully to resist pressure suffered from interdict foresaw too growing power of turk perceived that in future must triumph over degenerate greek empire at constantinople have spent blood treasure freely in maintaining that empire weakness profligacy of emperor intestine quarrel disturbance be forever going on ingratitude with have always treated venice have completely alienated venetian from genoa have indeed for many year exercised far more preponderating influence at constantinople than venice have done having completed tour of syrian port bonito sailed north with intention of passing dardanelles bosphorus proceeding to azoph when reached little island of tenedos few mile from entrance to strait heard news compelled captain to alter intention revolution have broken out in constantinople aided by genoese of pera cruel tyrant calojohannes th have be deposed heir andronicus whom have deprived of sight thrown into dungeon released placed on throne a reward for service have rendered andronicus issued decree conferring tenedos upon news have just arrived when bonito entered port town be in ferment there be two three venetian warship in harbour venetian admiral being without order from home a to what part to take in such emergency remained neutral matter be however important one for possession of tenedos gave owner command of dardanelles fleet lying there must effectually block passage people thronged up to governor house with shout of down with genoa governor being unsupported by greek genoese troop bowed to popular will declared that did not recognize revolution have taken place in constantinople refused to submit to decree of andronicus donato trono venetian merchant resident in island other venetian harangued people pointed out to that alone must not hope to resist united force of greece genoa that only hope of safety lay in placing under protection of venice people seeing justice of argument of venetian preferring venetian rule to of genoa agreed to proposal banner of st mark be raised amid great enthusiasm island declared subject to venice genoese galley in port immediately set sail quickly carried news to constantinople where emperor at once threw whole of venetian resident into prison a soon a news of reached tenedos captain of bonito held consultation with francis be evident messer francisco that can not proceed upon northward voyage must be captured held at constantinople even did succeed in passing at night must fall into hand of genoese who be far stronger in black sea than be for if venice accepts offer of people of place take possession of island genoa be sure to declare war think then that have better make way back to venice with what cargo have on board there get fresh order from padrone have not done badly so far be better to make sure of what have got than to risk loss for at day may fall in with genoese fleet sailing hither francis quite agreed with captain opinion bonito sailed for south touched on way at several island news that early outbreak of hostility between genoa venice be probable in case there must be almost complete cessation of trade produced so strong desire on part of islander to lay in store of good that captain be able to dispose of rest of cargo on good term to fill up ship with produce of island thus bonito be deep in water when re entered port of venice after absence of about three month a soon a anchor be dropped captain accompanied by francis hired gondola rowed into city to give account to signor polani of success of voyage to lay before list of cargo with bonito be laden merchant received with great cordiality embraced francis with affection of father do go at once into salon francisco will find daughter expecting there for news came hour ago that bonito be entering port of course heard from letter from candia of adventure with pirate gallant way in bonito defeated will find captain have ordered extra month pay to be given to on board captain did full justice francisco in account of matter to quickness in suggesting method by effort of ramming of enemy be neutralized for courage showed in carrying out idea will talk of afterwards have business to transact will occupy for time so sooner go better francis at once took off joined girl who received with heartiest greeting be glad indeed francis maria said when father told that bonito be signalled a entering port letter have come for time feared that must have entered dardanelles reached constantinople before news arrived there of affair at tenedos in case must no doubt have be seized thrown into dungeon be at tenedos when affair took place francis said have have opportunity since of sending letter by ship likely to be here before outbreak made alter plan for of course must not have be safe to have sailed farther when emperor be so enraged against venice need hardly tell be not sorry when turned face again towards venice have enjoyed voyage very much have have plenty to occupy still three month at time be long enough be beginning to long for sight of venice for sight of venice maria repeated holding up finger reprovingly of francis said smiling did not think necessary to put in because must know that be venice to that be much better maria said approvingly think have improved since have be away do not think so giulia think that sort of nonsense be improvement giulia said gravely of young venetian gallant can say that sort of thing want flattery from francisco must say want giulia maria said laughing like own even from francisco may not mean anything be pleasant nevertheless besides one like to think that there be just little truth in not much perhaps just little in what francisco said for instance of course be not venice to still just a be pleased to see be pleased to see why must say so in pretty way be very well for to set up a being above flattery giulia be young yet have doubt will like when get a old a be giulia shook head decidedly always think said when hear man saying flattering thing to girl that be least complimentary thing can do for be treating a if considers that be fool otherwise must never say such outrageous nonsense to there francisco maria laughed be fairly warned now beware how venture to pay compliment to giulia in future must be dull world if one be to think a do giulia to say exactly a meant young man saying to ' think be nice sort of girl prettier than rest good tempered pleasant to be desired because father be rich ' nice sort of way must be to be made love to there be occasion for to say anything at giulia said indignantly go about saying to ' think be good looking well mannered witty ' like because say be brave soldier good swordsman why must say such thing to suppose can tell if anyone like without nonsense perhaps so elder girl assented yet maintain be pleasant at rate be custom a be custom must put up with do say francisco know anything about francis said certainly of compliment have heard paid be barefaced falsehood have wondered how men must make how woman must even affect to believe in on other hand suppose that when people be in love really do think person be in love with be prettier more charming braver more handsome than anyone else in world that though may be flattery be really true in opinion of person who utters now let leave matter alone for present francisco be dying to hear about adventure especially that fight with pirate captain in letter merely said that be attacked beat pirate off that must have be sunk if have be that at suggestion lowered bale of cloth over to break shock that so many men be killed so many wounded that be hit twice by arrow wound be healing be said for papa read that portion of letter out to now want full particular account of affair francis gave full account of fight then related other incident of voyage know many of port touched at maria said when have finished for when be little girl papa took sometimes for voyage in ship when time be peaceful there be danger now let order gondola go for row papa be sure to be occupied for ever so long with captain chapter capture of lido signor polani told francis that evening that be much pleased with report that captain have given of eagerness to acquire information in mercantile nautical matter of manner in have kept ship book entry of sale purchase of good many young fellow at age francis when there be compulsion for to have taken matter into charge must have thought only of amusement gaiety when be in port be glad to see that have real interest in whatever line in life young man take up will never excel in unless go into with heart be very glad to see that have thrown so heartily into new profession bonito made most satisfactory voyage far more so than anticipated when found that must not be able to carry out programme have laid down for rise in price in latter part of voyage have more than made up for loss of trade in black sea have done a much in three month be absent a must have expected have be a anticipated six month away will be little time before start again a wish to see how matter be going before send bonito out upon adventure at present nothing be settled here that there will be war with genoa before long be certain must rather postpone a long a possible senate have not yet arrived at decision to accept offer of tenedos negotiation be going on with genoa constantinople have little hope that anything will come of be getting late in season now war will hardly break out until next spring have doubt struggle will then begin preparation be going on with speed in dockyard be endeavouring to obtain ally combination be so strong against venice that be meeting with little success ferrara be really only friend on whom can rely be not in position to aid materially in such struggle a will be be glad to tell that affair in be concerned before sailed have now completely dropped nothing have be heard of mocenigo since made escape decree of banishment be passed against where be know not that wretched woman be sentenced to four year imprisonment upon petition will be released at end of six month on promise that will not again set foot in territory of republic a mocenigo have not be brought to trial there will be further official inquiry into matter have not be further questioned a to source from obtained information a to girl hiding place share in matter be therefore altogether unsuspected think that there be further danger to from mocenigo partisan must be glad enough to remain in venice fortnight so sir francis said if at end of time have vessel going out will prefer to go in now that study be over will very soon get tired of doing nothing perhaps in few year may care more for gaiety of venice certainly at present have interest in must rather be at sea matteo tell that have promised will make few voyage in ship that have told will go in one of shortly if so must be very pleasant to if can sail together will arrange so francisco must be for benefit of cousin who be good lad harebrained without ballast for to go with must indeed have proposed vessel in have decided will sail will be ready for sea in ten day so thought that must prefer longer stay in venice before again set sail if however be wish to be off again so soon will arrange for to sail together time will go officially a supercargo since now understand duty captain of vessel in will sail be good sailor brave man have aptitude for trade must have sent supercargo with decision to go relief of for be not sorry for men who be at once good supercargo honest men be difficult to get fortnight passed rapidly francis enjoyed stay at merchant greatly be not sorry when at end of ten day polani told that lading of vessel must begin next day that have best go on board early see cargo shipped so that might check off bale cask a be sent on board see where description of good be stowed away think papa be too bad of sending francisco away so soon maria said when at evening meal learned news of early departure be own doing father said be who want to go not who send consider that be entirely fault fault two girl repeated in surprise certainly if have made venice sufficiently pleasant to must not wish to leave be too busy to see about such thing left to to entertain a be in such hurry to get away again be evident that have not succeeded in doing so indeed signor polani daughter have be everything be kind have taste for assembly entertainment feel out of place there amid gaily dressed noble lady sooner do get there than begin to wonder how anyone can prefer heated room clatter of tongue to quiet pleasure of walk backwards forward on deck of good ship besides want to learn profession there be so much to learn in that feel have time to lose be right glad to see eagerness in direction francisco did jest with daughter have not yet asked what be destination of lido for be name of new vessel time be going quite in new direction in spring be certain to have war with genoa a parma hungary will probably take side against may find cut off from mainland in case of disaster happening to fleet in sore strait for food be therefore going to gather into warehouse a much grain a will hold will be benefit to state will bring good profit for price of wheat will be high in city if be leaguered on land side lido will go down to sicily fill up there with corn will have to use care before entering port for with war now certain party will begin to snap up prize when get chance so must keep sharp lookout for genoese galley if find coast be too closely watched will go to moorish port be friend with at present though doubtless a soon a genoa get to blow will be resuming piratical work thus will time take in much smaller amount of cargo a will have to pay for most part in gold mattered little to francis where voyaged matteo who have be greatly delighted at thought of sailing with friend be much disappointed when heard that be only going to fetch grain from sicily why be nothing to call voyage said in tone of disgust when francis told destination of lido have hoped be going to make long voyage touch at sort of place just a did last time see that matter much matteo will learn navigation just a well from one course a voyage will not be long one unless meet with unfavourable wind there be saying what may happen may meet with adventure even on voyage to sicily back trip down to sicily be quickly made francis have worked hard on first voyage be now able to make daily calculation a to run made course steered position of ship found that tallied closely with of captain matteo shared large handsome cabin time passed pleasantly a vessel ran down coast of italy once out of adriatic sharp lookout be kept coast of sicily be made without seeing sail of suspicious character lad be struck with surprise admiration when on coming on deck in morning saw great cone of etna lying ahead of of have ever seen mountain of size interest in scene be heightened by slight wreath of smoke curled up from summit of hill be well worth voyage if be only to see mountain francis said what immense height be how regular in shape yet matteo said who have journeyed from italy into france tell that there be mountain there beside etna be a nothing mountain be continuation of range of hill can see from venice top be always covered with snow can not be ascended by man whereas be easy say to reach top of etna yes look easy enough francis agreed seems such regular slope that one must almost ride up dare say when be close must find sort of difficult place must like to try matteo said what grand view there must be from top be port be going to try first captain anywhere near foot of mountain be going round southern part of island on side ground be le fertile must have difficulty in obtaining cargo even be to put into port on side must not be able to climb mount etna sicily have be unfortunate country great natural wealth have rendered object of desire to neighbour be battleground of roman carthaginian pisa genoa naples have contended for possession moor frequently make descent upon coast have seldom enjoyed peaceful settled government consequence be that general lawlessness prevails in district remote from town while in forest clothe side of mount etna there be numerous horde of bandit who set authority at defiance levy blackmail throughout surrounding village carry off wealthy inhabitant put to ransom one in sens must think of ascending mountain unless have something like army with must like to try same matteo asserted if there be wood over be not likely one must happen to meet with of people must like above thing to get to top of hill must be harder work than think young sir captain said have idea from distance what height be what long journey be to ascend to top have be told that be hundred twenty mile round foot think must like matteo if be to try francis said laughing know be a lazy a can be hate exerting be sure that before got quarter distance up mountain must have only one wish must be to be at bottom again know matteo said hate exerting uselessly wasting strength a do in rowing at oar anything of sort to do anything great must not mind exertion must go on until dropped be very well matteo to do anything great have got to do small thing first must never wield sword for five minute unless have practised with will never succeed in accomplishing feat requiring great strength endurance if practise muscle on occasion used to grumble at height when came up to room in old house suppose etna be something like two hundred time a high that doe sound serious undertaking matteo said laughing be afraid that will never see view from top of etna certainly will not if will be necessary beforehand to be always exercising muscle by running up stair of high house next day be off girgenti port at hoped to obtain cargo steered in until encountered fishing boat learned from on board that there be genoese vessel in port a far a men knew state galley anywhere in neighbourhood obtaining news sailed boldly into port dropped anchor francis who have received before starting list of house with whom signor polani be in habit of doing business at once rowed ashore matteo giuseppi accompanying business arrangement be soon completed harvest have be good one there be abundance of corn to be have at cheap rate in hour arranged for a large quantity a lido must carry work of loading soon commenced in four day ship be full up to hatch francis went on shore to settle various account be just making last payment when matteo ran into office four genoese galley be entering bay francis ran out saw four genoese galley rowing in be too late to escape even be empty must not get away laden a lido be must row three foot to one what will do francisco francis stood for minute thinking have better stay here matteo will row out to ship send most of men on shore if seize ship may not take on board prisoner if do there be reason why must take have better come on shore too francisco leave captain in charge can do good by staying there polani must be more concerned at capture than must at loss of dozen ship if must do good must be different a be must be foolish to risk capture will see francis said at rate do stop here jumping into boat rowed towards lido be lying cable length from shore a neared shouted to men to lower boat captain said know whether there be danger of being captured by genoese be useless to run unnecessary risk therefore send crew three four men on shore if genoese board have paper a peaceful trader buying wheat if in spite of capture must take chance surely be not thinking of stopping messer francisco padrone must be terribly vexed if be taken specially ordered before started to see that unnecessary risk be run to prevent from thrusting into danger therefore a captain of ship must insist that go on shore think ought to stay here francis said think so captain said firmly will not suffer have to answer for safety to padrone if go by will order men to put into one of boat by force mean disrespect know duty be to prevent from falling into hand of genoese will not oblige to use force captain francis said smiling will do a wish in five minute men be save four whom captain have selected in boat rowing towards shore matteo be awaiting when landed be right francisco be half afraid must stay on board know how obstinate be whenever take thing into head captain be more obstinate still matteo said that unless came away must send on shore by force like deserting ship be nonsense francisco if genoese take take remaining on board must not do good what be going to do now will at once leave place with men matteo retire into country behind be not likely genoese must land seize here might do so inhabitant to please genoa might seize send on board at rate will be safer in country men have by captain order brought arm ashore on leaving ship be suggestion of francis who said that be unarmed people might seize hand over to genoese at head of party be about fifty strong francis marched up through little town out into country have really little fear that genoese must arrest on shore that people must interfere with for must not care to risk anger of venice by interfering in such matter thought probable however that if men remained in town broil must arise between of genoese sailor who might land a soon a genoese galley came up to head of bay boat be lowered rowed to lido at whose masthead venetian flag be flying officer followed by six men climbed up on to deck be captain of ship officer asked a captain approached be captain said what ship be be lido property of messer polani merchant of venice laden with cargo of wheat then be prisoner genoese said vessel a lawful prize there be peace between republic captain said protest against seizure of ship a act of piracy have news that several of ship have be seized by venetian officer said therefore capture vessel in reprisal where be crew there be only four on board captain said have filled up cargo be going to sail tomorrow therefore rest of crew be allowed to go on shore think be likely that will return now for one of genoese sailor have hauled down flag of venice have replaced with of genoa genoese officer briefly examined vessel whom have here on board with asked struck with furniture fitting of francis ' cabin be cabin of matteo giustiniani young noble of venice who be making first voyage in order to fit for entering service of state of francisco hammond who stand high in affection of patron genoese uttered angry exclamation name of polani be well known in genoa a one of chief merchant of venice a belonging to ducal house while family of giustiniani be even more illustrious have passenger fallen into hand ransom might have be obtained greatly exceeding value of lido cargo leaving four of men on board went off to galley of officer commanding fleet presently returned with large boat full of sailor men can go ashore said to captain admiral doe not deem worth trouble of carrying to genoa be quick will have to swim to shore a lido boat have gone ashore captain hailed fishing boat be passing with four sailor be rowed to shore well content that have escaped dungeon of genoa rightly imagined that men be released solely on account of paucity of number have whole crew be captured must have be carried to genoa admiral did not care to bring in five prisoner only preferred taking ship alone francis with party followed line of coast ascending hill rose steeply from edge of sea at short distance from town have brought with from town supply of food sufficient for four five day encamped in little wood near edge of cliff from have view of port must watch doings of genoese galley fire be lit meat cooked over just a meal be prepared captain four sailor joined amid hearty cheer from crew have made protest captain said a took seat by side of francis padrone can make complaint before council if think fit to do so there be small chance that will ever recover lido value of cargo like losing ship francis said of course be only stroke of bad fortune must neither fly defend still one hate arriving home with story that one have lost ship yes captain agreed messer polani be just man yet one care to employ men who be unlucky worst of be that last ship commanded be wrecked many men must not have employed again although be fault after second affair in few month time will get name of being unlucky man one in sens must employ man who be always losing ship do think that there be chance of recapturing captain not least in world captain replied even supposing that must get on board overpower genoese without being heard get out of port without being seen must not get away laden a be with grain will sail very slowly genoese must overtake in few hour need tell that then there must be very little mercy shown to on board be true enough francis said still like idea of losing lido after meal be over francis rose asked matteo to accompany on stroll along cliff giuseppi a usual following walked along until rounded head of bay be able to look along coast for distance be steep rocky worn into number of slight indentation in one of rose ledge of rock at very short distance from shore how much further be going francis matteo said when have walked couple of mile about quarter of mile matteo want to examine ledge of rock saw from first point what on earth do want to look at for francis certainly be most curious fellow ever met scoffed at when said must like to go up mount etna now here be dragging along cliff just to look at rock of possible interest to one be point to be inquired into matteo think be possible may prove very interesting matteo shrugged shoulder a often did when felt too lazy to combat eccentric idea of english friend there be francis said at last standing on edge of cliff looking down nothing must be better be glad think so francisco matteo said seating on grass hope intend to stay little time to admire for own must like rest before go back francis stood looking at rock bay be willow one be five six hundred yard from point to point rock rising nearly in line between point showing for about two hundred yard above water at about same distance from cliff behind what height do think rock be above water giuseppi be difficult to judge signor be so high above must think in middle must be ten twelve foot must think likely be more than double that giuseppi will see better when get down to bottom daresay will find place where can clamber down somewhere dear francisco matteo said earnestly be anything matter with begin to have doubt of sanity what on earth do rock matter to one way other what can care whether be thirty inch thirty foot above water differ from other rock a far a can see be very rugged very rough must be very awkward if lay out at sea instead of in little bay where be in nobody way be not enough that have tramped two mile to have look at mean four mile a have got to return somehow now talk about climbing down break neck cliff to have look at close francis paid attention to matteo word be gazing down into clear smooth water be so transparent that stone pebble at bottom must be seen water look extremely willow giuseppi what do think seems to signor that there be not foot of water between rock shore doe look so giuseppi be possible that transparency of water deceives that there may be ten twelve foot of water there however be what must go down find out now first thing be to look about find point at can get down to beach well will lie down take nap till come back matteo said in tone of resignation have interest either in rock in water a far a can protest do so against whole proceeding to savour of madness understand silly fellow what be thinking about francis said impatiently not in smallest degree francisco trouble to tell make matter have idea in head carry out by mean only ask to cut hand tear clothes put into perspiration by climbing down cliff idea be matteo there be chance of carrying off lido by speed from genoese if must get out of bay might bring round here lay behind rock genoese must pas by without dreaming be there mile out rock must look a if form part of cliff none must suspect there be passage behind be something like idea matteo said jumping to foot why did not tell of before have quite alarmed seriously began to think that have become little mad be wondering whether have not better go back fetch captain of men to look after now let look at rock again why man there be not water enough to float boat between shore much le lido draw nine foot of water now be loaded know matteo looking down on water from height be very deceiving if be clear transparent there be nothing to enable to judge depth at rate be worth trying before go down will cut long stiff rod with can measure depth have first to find place where can get down to water after quarter of hour search found point where descent seemed practicable little stream have worn deep fissure in face of rock shrub bush have grown up in crevice afforded hold for hand there appeared great difficulty in getting down before starting cut three stiff slender rod twelve foot in length then set to work to make descent be by mean difficult in few minute stood by edge of water be great advantage path being so easy francis said for in case did discover ship must land climb to top before have time to come to shore once there must keep whole force in galley at bay now for main point depth of water matteo shook head be useless to take trouble to undress francis said a latter threw off jacket giuseppi can wade out to rock without wetting knee giuseppi can try if like francis said will wager will not get far giuseppi a convinced a matteo of willowness of water stepped into be surprised to find before have gone many pace water be up to waist well must have believed if have seen matteo said when returned think must have got into deep hole among rock however will soon see too began to undress in few minute three lad be swimming out towards rock a francis have anticipated rose from twenty to thirty foot above level of sea water deepened fast for last thirty forty yard be unable to touch bottom even when thrusting down rod to fullest depth then tried depth in passage at end of rock found that there be ample water for lido when ascertained to satisfaction swam back to shore will believe in future francis even if assert that moon be made of cheese must have taken oath that there be not foot of water between rock shore hardly ventured to hope that be a deep a be francis said know how deceiving clear water be when look down upon from height however point be settled must see mast above rock francisco be sure to keep sharp lookout a go along must take mast out of francis said know how be to be done captain will know if ca be managed must cut down there be difficulty about now will make way back again will be dark in couple of hour time everything depends upon whether have towed lido out anchored among galley if have fear scheme be impracticable if let remain where be lying might get out without being noticed for there be moon a began to ascend cliff francis stopped suddenly must never be able to find place in dark said giuseppi must stay here do collect quantity of dried stick lay in readiness at point opposite ledge will show light a come along be if succeed in getting lido out directly see set fire to stick fire will be guide to a to position of rock perhaps have better take stick off to ledge messer francisco light fire on rock at end water be deep few yard out a found so must sail close to fire then round behind rock without danger will be best way giuseppi how will get stick off without wetting will make bundle three four time a big a want giuseppi said then half of will be dry can put clothes on tinder will answer for fire must rather have be with in adventure there will be no danger there giuseppi so need not be anxious about have to be done quietly secretly there will be fighting genoese be too strong to think of if be discovered in attempt a make off will take to boat again row straight on shore keep sharp lookout for will hoist two light one above other to prevent mistaking fishing boat may be coming along for now matteo for climb have time to lose two lad climbed to top of cliff then started at brisk pace along top in hour reached wood be beginning to wonder what have become of captain said a joined have be settling how to carry off lido francis said have arranged everything captain laughed if must fly with through air might get away see other way have be thinking over since left with luck might get safely out of bay galley row four foot to one a must be sure to send one way other along coast must pick up again in two three hour after daylight nevertheless have settled captain have found place where can hide genoese might search coast for month without finding if be so be possible captain said eagerly may be sure will not find backward in doing best francis described nature position of rock must afford shelter mean by have ascertained that there be plenty of water for lido behind seems plausible captain said when have concluded be quite ready to make attempt if in opinion can be done be messer polani representative for own sake a well a must do anything promise chance of recapturing ship besides a say there be little danger in for can take to boat make for shore if discovered lido be still lying where anchored can have fear of recapture for must know that must overtake easily enough daresay intend to sail tomorrow morning did not think worth trouble to get up anchor tow out to where be lying detail of expedition be now discussed arranged men told off to various duty at eleven o'clock at night when in town be fast asleep party quitted bivouac marched down again to port chapter recaptured one be astir in street a band marched through reached port without encountering single person small boat be chosen in captain francis matteo two of strongest most powerful of sailor embarked be thought unlikely lying a lido did within couple of hundred yard of genoese galley very vigilant watch must be kept not more than two sailor must probably be on deck dark mass of ship must just be made out from shore when be ready two sailor with oar pushed off with strength then stood perfectly quiet impetus be sufficient boat moved so slowly through water indeed before reached ship francis thought must be necessary for men to row stroke two boat still moved on until at last touched side of ship have removed boot before starting now clambered up side without making slightest noise once on deck stood perfectly quiet listening presently heard murmur of voice on other side of vessel very quietly crept towards sound at length made out two figure leaning over bulwark talking man work have be settled there be confusion one of sailor francis stole towards one of men while other matteo approached second captain stood with sword bared in readiness to cut down other man who might be on deck genoese did not look round francis gave word now in moment two sailor seized from behind with grasp of iron while lad at same moment passed bandage tightly round mouth before genoese be quite aware of what have happened be lying bound hand foot gagged upon deck party now made search found one else about then secured fastened down hatch of forecastle by coiling rope upon quietly opened door leading to poop cabin entering seized bound two officer sleeping there without slightest noise resistance then took light from cabin showed towards shore at signal sailor who have already taken place in boat at once rowed out to vessel when be on board boat be fastened alongside in case must be necessary to abandon ship again cable be then cut one of sailor have already ascended shroud poured oil over block through halyard ran so that sail must ascend noiselessly wind be very light scarcely enough to belly out sail be fortunately in right direction lido began to steal through water not word have be spoken since first started francis now whispered to captain think can make out genoese ship so can captain said can not see be against skyline while be in shadow of shore so far be perfectly safe if breath of wind will carry far enough out to be able to use oar without hearing will certainly get away progress of lido be so slow that be nearly hour before captain said that thought be now fairly round point of bay must use oar have better tow said sweep make noise can be heard mile away on calm night like whereas if be careful men in boat can row almost noiselessly ten of men accordingly took place in one of large boat in have come on board rope being passed down to began rowing at head of ship may a well lower sail captain said be doing good now indeed think be current rather than wind have helped so far will put two lantern over side francis said may have gone farther than think must never do to pas hiding place men in boat rowed vigorously be slow work towing deeply laden vessel at last however light burst suddenly up from shore there be giuseppi francis exclaimed be further out than thought be must be fully mile half away men in boat be told to row direct for light of sweep be got out helped vessel through water a drew near must make out giuseppi throwing fresh wood on fire can steer within ten yard of where be standing captain directly be abreast of put helm hard to port have better get sweep in now le way have on better well giuseppi hailed a came within fifty yard of well giuseppi there have be fighting so have lost nothing put wood on fire want a much light a can to get in flame shot up high captain have difficulty in rounding corner of rock bringing up vessel behind kedge be dropped men in boat rowed to end of rock brought off giuseppi be beginning to be anxious lad said a joined on deck when first saw signal took for fishing boat be so far off that two light looked like one by dint of gazing made out at last then lit fire now captain francis said have good deal to do before morning for take will be easy matter to get out mast there must be difficulty in getting mast out captain answered have only to knock out wedge loosen stay get up tripod made of three spar to lift out see how be to be got in again how be that captain must have thought more difficult to get mast in than to take out must be so under ordinary circumstance captain replied see hold be full of grain a mast come out hole leaf will fill up there will be getting down again to step on keel without discharging cargo yes see that captain then think have better cut down mast in case how be to raise will cut off about six foot above deck messer francisco then when want to set sail again have only to rear mast up by side of stump lash securely of course will be six foot shorter than before be of little consequence then so let be francis said sooner begin better just at moment there be violent knocking against hatch of forecastle have forgotten about sailor captain said laughing suppose men who be to relieve watch have woke up finding must not get out have aroused comrade will leave there take out bind matteo asked have better have up captain said suppose there be more than twenty of must be best to bind put down in hold with corn otherwise may manage to break out when be not expecting might give trouble accordingly sailor gathered round hatch rope be then removed hatch taken off what fooling be up to one of genoese exclaimed angrily a rushed up on deck have nearly stifled down below putting on hatch fastening stopped abruptly a on gaining deck saw crowd of armed figure round for lantern have be placed so a to throw light upon spot be prisoner captain said be useless to attempt resistance help help treachery one of genoese shouted at top of voice be useless for to shout captain said be mile away from fleet now do surrender be to attack taken by surprise unarmed genoese who have gained deck sullenly replied that surrendered be bound led away others ordered to come up on deck there be found to be four twenty in be soon laid side by side on grain in hold hatch being left off to give air mast be then cut through be with trouble lowered to deck there be nothing more to be done now captain said think can safely turn in till morning then ordered under officer to place two men on watch on rock two men on deck two men to stand a sentinel over prisoner rest to lie down directed that must be roused at earliest streak of daylight lad be soon fast asleep must hardly believe that night be over when giuseppi awakened with news that day be breaking be soon on deck found that crew be already astir sentinel on rock be at once ordered to lie down so that must command view of sea without exposing to sight boat be drawn up alongside everything put in readiness for instant debarkation then party waited for appearance of genoese galley will be along in le than hour captain said be light enough now for watch to have discovered that lido be missing will not be many minute before be under way will calculate that can have five six hour start at utmost three hour rowing will bring up to have fear whatever of discovering a go along francis said only fear be that after rowing for three four hour seeing sign of will guess that be hidden somewhere under cliff will come back along shore searching bay there be chance of that captain agreed must think only chance when party who come way find overtake will suppose that have sailed to west that on return will find in hand of comrade when also come back empty handed will conclude that have sailed straight out to sea of course may have sent galley southward also will conclude that have somehow missed when return without news hardly think that idea that may be hidden so close to will enter mind only fear entertain be that peasant may happen to come to edge of cliff see lying here may take news back to girgenti yes there be certainly danger of francis said think captain must be best plan to land twenty men at once giuseppi will show way up cliff then must take station at short distance apart along edge of cliff from point to point of little bay with order to seize one who may approach bring down here must of course be told to lie down a line of sentry along top of cliff might attract attention of somebody on galley lead to search yes think will be wise precaution captain agreed thomaso do take twenty men post a hear messer francisco say tell to lie in bush keep out of sight on account to show unless someone come along sufficiently near to look over edge of cliff giuseppi francis said do act a guide to party will have plenty of time to get to top to return before galley come along quarter of hour later captain with matteo francis landed on ledge took place of sentry in twenty minute simultaneous exclamation burst from a genoese galley be seen rowing rapidly along have sent only one galley francis said of course must know that be sufficiently strong to overpower without difficulty suppose one have gone west others have put out to sea in different direction that certainly be best course must have adopted be very lucky that did not attempt to escape seaward for must assuredly have have suppose captain intend to sail tonight certainly captain replied will get everything in readiness for hoisting mast a soon a galley have passed on way back there be fear of coming along again later on for men will have have eight hour row of first part at rate at full speed besides will not know until galley return that have not be found so think will be quite safe to get up mast a soon a have passed then directly be dark will man oar row to southwest will be far away before morning even if look further for be hardly likely to do how about prisoner captain have choice to take with messer francisco be sure want to be bothered with can not land before leave must carry news to girgenti in hour must be caught first thing in morning be late in afternoon before galley be seen returning rowing slowly heavily expect captain said kept up racing pace at started for four hour by time must have be completely worn out doubt anchored waited for hour for men to feed rest for from hurry with started may be sure that did not wait to break fast must give month pay to be in harbour evening what temper must be in when find after toil that have slipped through finger how will talk matter over discus way went how men in ship will say that others can not have used eye exerted else must have be overtaken messer francisco be indebted to not only for having saved ship for giving joke will laugh over whenever think of will be grand story to tell over wine cup how cheated whole genoese fleet carried off lido from under nose what tale will be to relate to genoese when meet in port after war be over will be enough to make dance with rage now lad went on turning to men stand to tackle moment galley get out of sight round point up with mast ten minute later mast be up stout rope be lashed round stump wedge driven in to tighten cord to utmost rigging be of simplest description before dark everything be in readiness for hoisting sail think can make out now captain said think must francis agreed have better wait quarter of hour must be absurd to run risk after everything have turned out so well men can get into boat tow out through channel then can hoist boat on board by time must be nearly dark enough think there will be breeze presently captain said from right direction however men wo mind working hard for bit have have easy time for last two day oar be manned men set to work with hearty goodwill be delighted at escape from island for might have be there time before got passage back still more pleased at having tricked genoese lido heavy laden a be moved at steady pace through water under impulsion of oar for hour rowed parallel with shore a have made out to sea might possibly have be seen by one of galley returning late from search for at end of time captain turned head from shore a soon a got well out from under shelter of land breeze made felt sail be hoisted for time men kept on rowing breeze increased rapidly captain ordered oar to be laid in double allowance of wine be served out hour two spent in song hilarity then watch below be sent down francis matteo turned into cot in morning breeze be blowing strong sail have be taken off mainmast that on foremast be dragging lido through water at good rate of speed before night be off cape spartivento wind held till next morning when be abreast of gulf of taranto then came long spell of calm baffling wind be fortnight before campanile of venice be seen rising apparently from water have be anxious about signor polani said when francis arrived one of galley brought report that genoese fleet be cruising on coast of sicily a although war have not yet be openly declared party be making prize be afraid that might have snapped up did snap up francis said smiling caught in port of girgenti standard of genoa waved over lido how can that be polani said when have returned in for be signalled a approaching port hour ago must hardly have persuaded genoese by fair word to release prize that have once taken eh captain be not genoese way captain said did better than signor recaptured carried off from under nose be joking polani said for signalled lido a returning laden laden ship must never get away from state galley however long start fat pig might a soon try to escape from hunting dog be so messer polani did not trust to speed tricked famously sir at least when say did messer francisco here did for credit be due solely to if have not be for young gentleman crew must now have be camping out in forest of sicily without slightest prospect of being able to make way home lido must now be moored in port of genoa be so cousin polani matteo said be to francisco that owe escape owe safety of lido cargo be just happy idea occurred to francis said a must assuredly have occurred to captain pesoro if have be with to anyone else after have first suggested captain carried out arrangement not at messer francisco captain said obstinately have part hand in business beyond doing what suggested must have got lido off just a well if have be there well will judge for when hear polani said a must be interesting story daughter must like to hear also so come into next room tell tale will order up flagon of cyprus wine to moisten throat first of captain began after girl have greeted francis have taken seat must tell how lido be captured then related how genoese fleet have suddenly appeared before how seeing impossibility of escape have sent all on shore with exception of four sailor how have with be released sent on shore be genoese over polani said if must have sent forty prisoner home must have done so fact that there be only five on board when took vessel must seem to to detract from credit of capture captain then told how fearing that people of girgenti might give up to genoese fight might ensue among genoese sailor who landed have marched crew away out of town now captain matteo broke in will tell next bit because be with francis when found hiding place then related how francis have seen ledge of rock in distance have dragged along cliff two mile to observe more closely how have come to conclusion that companion have lost sens then described exact position clearness of water how have be convinced that there be not depth to float rowboat inside rock how have gone down swum out fathomed water then returned to wood captain then took up tale again completed to end there be doubt be right captain polani said that be entirely francisco quickness of observation readiness of plan determination to see if idea must be carried into effect saved lido that possessed quality be not new to for have already greatly benefited by if have not be born peaceful trader must have made great captain day quality must distinguish man in war be also useful in peace think fully a honourable to be successful merchant a successful soldier henceforth francisco will no longer consider a in leading string will feel that can confide important business to young a be next voyage francis made be to jaffa be accomplished without adventure on return found that venice be in state of excitement war have at last be declared effort be being made to fit out fleet must cope with of genoa command be entrusted to vettore pisani who be invested in church of saint mark with supreme command of fleet by doge who handed to admiral great banner of venice with word be destined by god to defend with valour republic to retaliate upon who have dared to insult to rob of security owes to virtue of ancestor wherefore confide to victorious great standard will be duty to restore to unsullied triumphant carlo zeno noble who have gained high reputation in various capacity be appointed commissioner captain general of negropont three first division of inscribed in register a liable to serve in navy be called out on th of april pisani sailed from venice with fourteen war galley pisani enjoyed highest popularity among people of venice manner be that of bluff hearty sailor be always ready to share in hardship of men to set example of good temper cheerfulness a well a of bravery be quick tempered when in passion cared nothing whom struck when governor of candia have got into serious scrape by striking pietro cornaro officer of republic from whom happened to differ on point of routine be relative of doge andrea contarini have be employed not only a officer in navy a military engineer a diplomatist in capacity have shown equal talent be connected with polani family be at house several time before sailed here heard from kinsman account of manner in francisco have saved bonito from being rammed by pirate how have succeeded in getting lido out of hand of genoese be so much pleased that offered to take with in galley polani advised francis not to accept offer be quite true said that most of noble family be like engaged in commerce that one day be trading a merchant next fighting under state at present if take advice will stick to peaceful side of profession especially a being englishman be in way called upon to serve state in five six year if be then at war will be different have frequently offered galley for service of state can then take command of one will have doubt distinguish be to enter now might remain in service of state for year must be losing time a merchant there be country in when man once take up profession of arm remains soldier life may not only achieve honour wealth wide possession be not so in venice here be citizen a well a soldier if need be fight for state while war last then return to peaceful avocation even kinsman pisani may be admiral of fleet today week hence may be private citizen therefore lad think must be very foolish of to give up commerce at present to take military service quite agree with signor francis said although in truth for moment have felt strong mind to accept offer of pisani be just beginning to learn little of trade desire nothing better than to be successful merchant though confess must like to take part in such glorious sea fight a be likely to take place soon yes perhaps be killed in first engagement francis for skill bravery avail against bolt from genoese crossbow lad be content with trade especially since have seen already that even life of trader have plenty of incident excitement what with storm what with pirate what with enemy of state treachery of native people with whom trade there be lack of adventure in life of venetian merchant francis felt that be true that have in past six month have fully share in adventure stay on shore time extended over month be not until three week after pisani sailed that again set out notice be short one polani have be sent for to attend council early in morning on return said to francis must go down to port at once francis news have be received from pisani that have sailed almost into port of genoa without finding fleet of fieschi genoese have be in terrible state of panic lord of fiesole who be ally be menacing city by land stella company of condottieri be in pay be also marching against news that pisani be close at hand seems to have frightened out of sens first step a usual have be to depose doge choose however be not point pisani have written asking that ship with provision store will be sent out to be to go through strait of messina up coast of italy until meet force be far too small for to think of making attack upon genoa will wait in neighbourhood of city for short time in hope of fieschi fleet returning if doe not do so will come down coast searching for a doe not wish to put in port desire store mentioned to be sent out to have placed bonito at service have promised that will be ready to sail tomorrow morning if will send store on board today three other merchant placed ship at disposal may not sail for day two be particularly anxious that bonito will start at once a in addition to provision will carry store of javelin arrow other missile of there be not sufficiency in arsenal when pisani sailed will have strong party on board a speed be required oar must be kept going until join fleet therefore will place crew of lido on board a well a bonito own complement will bring number up to hundred men captain have have accident will not be able to go in charge therefore lido captain will command time will appoint specifically second in command a well a representative now get off on board a quickly a can for there be enough to keep at work till tomorrow morning to get everything in readiness for start have best run in say goodbye to daughter a may be that will not find time to return before sailing can send boy ashore for what thing require matteo will accompany few minute later francis be on way to port leaving giuseppi to charter gondola follow with trunk a polani have said be occupied without intermission until time for sailing next morning barge of state kept coming alongside with store provision from arsenal while other boat brought out ship store francis have to take note of came on board captain superintended setting up of rigging getting of ship into working order while under officer saw to hoisting in storing of cargo gang of men be at work tarring side of ship for have only two day before returned from trip to spain number of sailor be unloading cargo from one hatchway while fresh freight be being taken in at other seemed well nigh impossible that must be ready to sail at hour named everyone worked with will by daybreak thing be almost in order polani came down to port a soon a be light expressed satisfaction at work have be done hour afterwards anchor be weighed just a sail have be hoisted matteo arrived be only just in time matteo polani said why did not come off yesterday help be out matteo said when message came only returned just in time to go to entertainment at ducal palace knew must be of use on board while be only getting in cargo will never be of use on board matteo if go to entertainment when there be work to be done must have taken mark on bale a came on board just a well a suppose thought that dirt dust must suit fine gentleman like time unless come on board when sent for make a useful a can while ship be fitting out loading will not sail in one part of duty be just a important a other seamanship doe not consist solely in strolling up down deck watching vessel sail for destination matteo be abashed at reproach soon recovered usual spirit after polani have left when vessel be under way cousin be rather in sharp mood morning said with laugh to francis really did not think must be of good entertainment be grand one everyone be there must have be very sorry to have missed everyone to taste matteo for part must very much rather have be at work here night watching cargo got in checking off than have be standing about doing nothing in palace doing nothing matteo repeated indignantly why be talking to someone whole time be there talking about what matteo heat music costume last bit of scandal at piazza call talk call chatter now matteo will leave to own device for be going to turn in get sleep for few hour look a if wanted matteo said think that stand in even more need of wash be grimy with dust be just a well that cousin giulia did not come on board with father morning for sight of face must have given quite shock must have dissipated illusion may have have that be good looking fellow francis went off to cabin with laugh took matteo advice a to wash before turned in in few minute be asleep did not wake until giuseppi came to say that midday meal be just ready bonito made rapid voyage wind be light for most part favourable twenty four oar be kept going night day men relieving other two hour so that have six hour rest between spell of rowing when rounded southern point of italy sharp lookout be kept for fleet of fieschi passed through strait without catching sight of single vessel carrying genoese flag most vigilant watch be now kept for pisani galley always anchored at close of day lest must pas in dark occasionally overhauled fishing boat endeavoured to obtain news of two squadron beyond fact that fieschi have be seen steering north day before that sign have be seen of pisani returning fleet must learn nothing chapter battle of antium be running very far north captain said on th of may be near antium now be getting into what may call genoese water if anything have occurred to prevent pisani carrying out intention of sailing back along coast if have passed on way up position must be hazardous one for a soon a have rowed away genoese galley will be on move again even if fall in with fieschi may be snapped up by one of cruiser be rather risky captain francis agreed order be distinct be to sail north till met pisani must do so till be within sight of wall of genoa if then see be not lying off port will put about make way back again yes if give chance messer francisco long before be sufficiently near to genoa to make out whether pisani be lying off port will see from hill will send off galley to bring in however must take chance if get into scrape will look to confidently to get out again must advise not to count on francis said laughing be not always one get lucky combination of circumstance a did at girgenti at last obtained news from fishing boat that fieschi fleet have passed going northward on previous day be now lying in bay of antium a antium lay few mile north held consultation a to best method to pursue if sailed on there be risk of capture that risk did not appear to be very great genoese admiral must not expect to find venetian merchant ship so near to genoa might be able to pas without being interfered with on other hand news might possibly have come of departure of store ship from venice for pisani fleet in case strict lookout must certainly be kept must be necessary to keep so far to sea a to be out of sight of genoese in case there must be risk of missing pisani fleet on way down think captain said after long debate that have better anchor here close under shore tonight if be not mistaken will have gale in morning like look of sky tomorrow will see how weather be can then come to decision by morning a captain have predicted wind be blowing strongly heavy sea be running be agreed to keep along under lee of shore until must obtain view of bay of antium see if fleet of fieschi be still there if so must tack run back distance make straight out to sea so a to pas along four five mile from shore a must be unlikely in extreme that genoese admiral must send galley out to overhaul passing ship in such weather sailed along till neared slight depression known a bay of antium then bore farther out to sea suddenly fleet be seen running down coast at distance away 'bout ship captain cried genoese have be cruising further north be coming down coast in such weather a bonito ought to be able to get away from may be pisani fleet francis said a ship be put round be possible captain agreed can not run risk of stopping until make inquiry captain at least if run mile so out to sea must be able to see round point discover whether fieschi galley be there captain assented vessel head be turned from land in ten minute there be joyous shout on board bonito for genoese fleet be seen lying in bay distant fleet must then form that of pisani see francis exclaimed genoese have just caught sight of be hoisting sail be either going to meet to run away vessel be most numerous there be not much difference pisani have fourteen ship must be lagging behind have be lost how many do make out to be captain think there be only nine captain answered be just number of genoese then fieschi will fight if be not coward matteo said in case why be making out to sea fieschi may not care to be attacked at captain replied must give advantage to besides if be beaten there must be little chance of of escaping be right to make out to sea blowing a be will be next to impossible for to fight there two vessel must hardly get alongside to board in sea a expect fieschi think that will never attack in storm pisani must fight if be hurricane did indeed seem almost impossible to fight in such sea bonito be rolling gunwale under sail have be reduced to smallest proportion yet when squall struck be laid completely over on side rival admiral be too anxious to fight to be deterred by difficulty be bent upon bringing on action at once must give anything to be on board one of galley matteo said be horrible standing here doing nothing when fight a be going to begin can not edge down towards captain francis asked mean that must take part in fight for have hundred men galley must carry at least three time a many still might be near enough to see something perhaps to give succour to disabled ship drop out of fight will do so if like messer francisco captain said if will take responsibility if side get worst of must remember that bonito may be captured think there be much chance of pisani being beaten by enemy no stronger than francis said even if must be victorious genoese will certainly have enough on hand with repairing damage securing prisoner to think of setting off in chase of ship like ours be true enough captain agreed for be indeed a anxious a francis matteo to witness struggle vessel on side be under canvas for be impossible to row in such sea a soon a approached other fleet broke up vessel singling opponent out combat began be singular one differed widely from ordinary sea fight of time in combatant always tried to grapple with enemy carry by boarding be almost impossible now for seemed that vessel must be dashed in piece like eggshell be to strike other cloud of missile be poured from one to other archer plied bow great machine hurled javelin big stone crash of blow of latter against side of ship sounded even above noise of wind wave shouting of combatant a for cannon with galley be armed be far too cumbrous unmanageable to be worked in such weather sometimes one vessel lifted on crest of wave while opponent lay in hollow swept deck with terrible effect while few second later advantage be on other side for long time party seemed to gain advantage great number be killed on side victory did not incline way until mast of one of venetian galley be struck by heavy stone went over side at once fell out of line of battle opponent keeping close to pouring in volume of missile while sea taking on broad side washed number of crew overboard opponent seeing that be altogether helpless left to be taken possession of afterwards made for pisani galley be distinguished by flag at masthead be maintaining desperate conflict with galley of fieschi admiral ship be now swept with missile from side when adversary saw that crew be greatly weakened prepared to close in spite of state of sea if pisani must be captured there must remain seven venetian ship to nine genoese victory be certain captain of bonito have lashed together heavy spar thrown overboard having fastened strong rope to be riding head to wave by mean of sea anchor at distance of about mile from conflict cry of grief rage have arisen when crew saw that one of galley be disabled excitement became intense when saw unequal struggle pisani be maintaining be preparing to board captain francis said must go to admiral aid if ship be captured battle be lost be ready messer francisco if authorize certainly do francis said loss capture of bonito be a nothing in comparison to importance of saving pisani captain gave order for hawser to be cut sail hoisted cheer broke from crew a saw what be to be done arm have be served out at beginning of contest now seized gathered in readiness to take part in fight two genoese galley have thrown grapnel made fast one on side of pisani galley bulwark be stove in splintered a vessel rolled rigging of three ship became entangled genoese sprang on to deck of pisani galley with shout of triumph be met by admiral wielding mighty battleaxe survivor of crew combat be still raging when bonito sailed swiftly up sail be lowered a came alongside be lashed to one of galley manoeuvre be not performed without loss a approached with venetian flag flying at masthead genoese archer on poop of galley who have hitherto be pouring missile among pisani men turned round opened fire upon new foe arrow did far more execution here than have done among armour clad soldier of state captain fell dead with arrow struck full in throat ten twelve of sailor fell on deck beside pour in one volley francis shouted then throw down bow take to ax follow instant vessel be lashed francis sprang on to deck of galley matteo be by side giuseppi just behind whole crew followed climbing first upon poop fell upon archer who after short struggle be cut down then descending again to waist of galley leaped on to deck of pisani ship fell upon rear of genoese be taken completely by surprise absorbed in struggle in be engaged have noticed neither approach of bonito struggle on board own galley supposed that of venetian warship have come up to assistance of admiral taken then by surprise finding thus between two band of foe fought irresolutely crew of bonito with heavy ax cut down number of fighting way through mass joined diminished force of pisani admiral shouted battle cry of saint mark follower who have begun to give way to despair rallied at arrival of unlooked for reinforcement whole fell upon genoese with fury latter fought stoutly steadily now animated by voice example of fieschi assurance of victory be gone be gradually beaten back to deck of admiral ship here made desperate effort to cut lashing free vessel yard have got interlocked rigging entangled venetian sprang on to deck of ship renewed conflict there for time struggle be doubtful genoese have still advantage in number be disheartened at success have deemed certain having be so suddenly unexpectedly snatched from grasp presence of pisani in doubled strength of venetian be most popular of commander strove to imitate example set after ten minute hard fighting result be no longer doubtful many of genoese ran below others threw down arm admiral at last seeing further resistance be hopeless lowered sword surrendered sooner have resistance ceased than pisani turned to francis who have be fighting by side thank in name of myself republic said where have sprung from how came here know not seemed to to have fallen from heaven to assistance just at moment when be lost who be seem to know face though can not recall where have seen be francis hammond messer pisani have honour of seeing at house of patron signor polani be good enough to offer to take with to sea oh remember now pisani said how came here came in bonito one of polani ship be lying outside farther of venetian galley bring from venice of store for sent be lying off watching battle until saw that be sore beset in need of help must then no longer remain inactive captain be killed by arrow a ranged up alongside of galley be now in command be friend matteo giustiniani volunteer on board bonito remember master matteo pisani said a shook by hand have seen often at father house will have to give good account of for saw fighting bravely will talk more of afterwards must set to work to separate galley will have grinding other to piece then must hasten to assistance of friend genoese prisoner be fastened below venetian then set to work to cut lashing free rigging of ship francis kept only twenty men on board bonito remainder be distributed between two captured genoese galley admiral turned attention to battle be already almost over sight of venetian flag at masthead of admiral ship other galley struck dismay into genoese five of ship immediately hoisted canvas made off while other two surrounded by venetian galley hauled down flag battle have be sanguinary one eight hundred men be found alive on board four galley captured fight be known in history a battle of porto d'anzo struggle have lasted nearly whole day be growing dark when venetian fleet with prize anchored under shelter of land night long work of attending upon wounded went on be daybreak before wearied crew lay down for repose in afternoon pisani hoisted signal for captain of galley to come on board in presence formally thanked francis in name of republic for aid have afforded at most critical moment have not be for aid acknowledged that crew must have succumbed victory must assuredly have fallen to genoese after meeting be over took francis into cabin again offered post in own ship be merit properly rewarded said must appoint at once to command of galley to do so must do service for must excite against jealousy of young noble in fleet besides be so young that although council at home can not acknowledge vastness of service have rendered might make age excuse for refusing to confirm appointment if like to come a third officer can promise that will have rapid promotion speedily be in command of galley venetian have prejudice against foreigner hold very high command indeed army in field be frequently commanded by foreign captain francis thanked admiral heartily for offer said that father wish own led to adopt life of merchant that under patronage of messer polani prospect be so good that must not exchange even for command under state of venice be quite right lad admiral said government be ungrateful republic most of where be supposed to be equal there be ever envy jealousy against one who rise above rest multitude be fickle easily led first change of fortune however slight be seized upon by enemy a cause of complaint popular hero of today may be exile tomorrow like enough will see inside of venetian prison day impossible signor francis exclaimed people must tear to piece anyone who ventured to malign just at present lad just at present know countryman be not a light hearted fickle a of genoa be easily led will shout 'abasso a easily a 'viva time will show be within ace of being defeated today may not be close at hand to come to rescue next time now to business tomorrow morning will set crew to get out store distribute a required will place four hundred prisoner in hold will carry to venice with despatch announcing victory other four hundred genoese will send in galley be dismasted yesterday to candia to be imprisoned there will send prize crew home in galley have captured a soon a be refitted manned rejoin will sail in search of doria fleet will first cruise up adriatic in case may have gone way to threaten venice can more easily receive such reinforcement a may have be prepared for following day be spent in unloading vessel be accomplished by prisoner be then put on board francis at once ordered sail to be set bonito be started on homeward voyage a soon a bonito be signalled in sight signor polani went down to port to meet to ascertain where have fallen in with fleet for there be great anxiety in venice a news have be received from pisani for more than ten day vessel have just passed through entrance between island when gondola with owner be seen approaching francis went to gangway to receive why what have happened francisco polani asked a boat neared side of ship half bulwark be carried away whole side of ship be scraped scored look a if have be rubbing against rock not quite so bad a messer polani have be grinding against genoese galley against genoese galley merchant repeated in surprise stopping in passage up rope ladder have be lowered for why how be that never mind now first tell be news from fleet there be great news francis replied admiral fell in with fieschi off antium there be nine ship on side battle took place in storm be victorious captured four of genoese galley with fieschi eight hundred prisoner rest fled fieschi be now in cabin four hundred prisoner in hold be indeed great news merchant said will be immense relief to venice be getting very anxious for have pisani be defeated there be nothing to prevent genoese ravaging coast even assailing venice where be captain regret to say sir that have be killed a well a twenty seven of sailor many of others be more le severely wounded be bearer of despatch from admiral to council then get into gondola come along at once polani said deeply regret death of captain sailor will tell about a come along must not delay moment in carrying great news ashore have got despatch yes signor put into doublet when saw approaching thinking that must probably wish to take on shore at once now tell about battle merchant said a soon a have taken seat in gondola say there be nine ship on side pisani sailed away with fourteen have lost remainder came up next day francis replied fleet be in port north of antium when news came that fieschi fleet be there five of galley have be dismantled be under repair pisani must not wait for to be got into fighting order a be afraid lest fieschi might weigh anchor escape if delayed hour learned that genoese have nine ship with a have number ready for sea sailed at once weather be stormy sea very high when appeared within sight of antium fieschi sailed boldly out to meet battle lasted day for be next to impossible to board in end a say four genoese galley surrendered rest fled be terrible sight for seemed at moment a if wave must hurl vessel against other so break into fragment in case did accident happen why speak a if saw francisco have joined admiral before battle took place signor arrived near antium on evening before fight heard of fieschi presence there therefore anchored south of promontory in morning put out intending to sail well out to sea so pas genoese who be not likely in such weather to put out to question sail passing in distance a made off from land saw pisani fleet approaching then a fieschi put to sea saw that battle be imminent there be nothing for to do to lie to wait for battle to be over before delivered store having little doubt that pisani must be victorious then have battle gone other way merchant said bonito at present moment must probably be lying prize in harbour of genoa did not lose sight of probability of signor thought that if genoese must gain victory must be too busy with prize prisoner if not too crippled to pursue reckoned that in such weather bonito must be able to sail quite a fast a of genoese now tell about affair francisco where be fell in with genoese galley by what miracle did get off be in battle sir one of venetian galley have dropped out of fight disabled opponent went to assistance of admiral ship be engaged with pisani attempted to board on side seeing that be in great peril that if ship be taken battle must be a bad a lost thought that must approve of going to assistance did engaged one of galley a crew be occupied with admiral took by surprise created diversion that succeeded with what assistance must give in capturing opponent be done well indeed polani said warmly be risky matter indeed for with sailor unprotected by armour to enter into combat with iron clad soldier of genoa so captain twenty seven of men be killed must have have brisk fighting captain many of men be shot by genoese archer a ranged up alongside vessel others be killed in hand to hand fighting cousin matteo what have become of polani asked suddenly trust be not among killed be unharmed francis replied fought gallantly admiral next day offered to take on board own ship many of volunteer serving on board having be killed matteo of course accepted offer must have done better to have stayed on board ship for two year polani said learned business must have made far better sailor than can ever become on board state galley never expected to stick to have earnestness of purpose be too particular about dress to care about rough life of real seaman have plenty of courage sir have always found staunch friend doubt have courage merchant said come of good blood must hardly be coward think be good hearted lad too will have doubt make brave commander of galley more than matteo be never likely to become daughter be well hope francis asked quite well will not find at home sailed three day ago in lido for corfu be going to stay for time at villa there that affair of last year shook thought better that must go away for change hot month here be trying often unhealthy will go over next week to be with be now approaching piazzetta polani shouted out to various acquaintance met in passing news that pisani have gained great victory have captured genoese admiral with four of galley gondola at once changed course accompanied to gather further detail of fight news be shouted to other passing boat by time reached step of piazzetta throng be round on shore shouted out news spread rapidly from mouth to mouth shopkeeper left store lounger on piazzetta ran up be with difficulty polani francis must make way through shouting excited crowd to entrance of ducal palace polani at once led francis to doge to whom gave account of action messenger be immediately despatched to of member of council for be to that despatch have to be delivered a soon a sufficient number to transact business have arrived at palace doge led francis to council chamber be news that heard shouted in street a came thither true highness one of councillor asked a entered that fleet have gained victory over genoese be happy to say that be quite true young gentleman be bearer of despatch from admiral will doubtless give particular admiral pisani have chosen strange messenger for so important despatch one of party hostile to admiral said be usual to send despatch of kind by trusted officer think respectful either to council republic to send home news of victory by lad like admiral apparently chose young gentleman because owing to death of captain be in command of ship messer polani placed at service of republic be present at fight admiral intended a hear to set out at once in search of fleet of doria doubtless did not wish to weaken by despatching state galley with news perhaps may explain matter in despatch several other councillor have by time arrived despatch be opened admiral account of engagement be brief for be fonder of sword than pen stated that having obtained news that fieschi fleet be at anchor under promontory of antium sailed thither with nine ship being be at moment fit to take to sea that fieschi have sailed out to meet that engagement have taken place in storm prevented ship from pursuing usual tactic compelled to fight with missile at distance despatch then went on fought day upshot of be captured four of galley admiral eight hundred prisoner fortunately be unnecessary for to give seignory detail of fighting a can be furnished by messer francisco hammond who will hand despatch be witness of action on bonito have that morning arrived at antium with of store despatched have selected young gentleman a bearer of despatch because be to entirely owe that be not at present moment prisoner in genoa to republic owes that yesterday won victory be attacked by fieschi by galley in spite of weather cast grapnel on to ship boarded have already lost half of crew by missile thing be going very badly with when bonito came up to assistance grappled with one of galley captain be killed messer hammond of whom polani have so high opinion that have appointed second in command led men to rescue boarded galley slew who remained on board then crossing on to ship fell upon rear of genoese who be pressing backwards sailor undefended a be by armour fought like demon with ax led by messer hammond cut way through enemy joined reinforcement gave fresh strength spirit to men who have minute before thought that be lost together fell upon genoese before must recover from surprise beat back into admiral ship following there forced to surrender messer hammond fought by side although lad in year showed sturdy man at arm behaved with coolness bravery beyond praise hereby recommend to gracious consideration for assuredly to be due that be not fieschi who be writing to announce victory murmur of surprise from councillor greeted reading of portion of letter when be concluded doge be first to speak have indeed deserved well of republic messer hammond for know that admiral pisani be not one to give undue praise to exaggerate in aught be news to signor a well a to for in narrative to of event of fight passed over own share in though messer polani who accompanied did say that ship have taken part in fight that captain twenty seven men have be killed now young sir a admiral have referred to for detailed narrative of battle will thank to tell witnessed omitting detail of occurrence francis accordingly gave full account of action gave great praise to crew for valour with have fought against heavy armed genoese when have concluded doge said thank for narrative messer hammond a well a for great service have rendered state will now leave a have much to debate on regarding other matter to arrange for reinforcement for see by letter admiral asks will ask messer polani to remain in attendance for while a wish to consult with a to ship other matter a to will ask to come before again shortly after francis have left council first voted that five ducat must be given to man of crew of bonito that widow of who have be slain must be provided for at expense of state deferred question a to honour must be conferred upon francis until have consulted polani state barge be at once sent off to bring in prisoner from ship preparation made for accommodation for venice always treated prisoner taken in war with greatest kindness example genoa be very far from following then polani be sent for question of store ship gone into order be issued for redoubled activity in arsenal be arranged that several ship belonging to polani others must be at once purchased for service of state then asked for opinion a to reward must be given to francis upon merchant expressing ignorance of special service young friend have rendered passage from pisani letter relating to be read out lad be a modest a be brave merchant said for although of course told that ship have taken part in fight have done what must to assist admiral in service captain twenty seven men have lost life have idea of real nature of encounter feel very proud of service have rendered state for have rendered a private individual le important service regard a adopted son future partner in business such being case signor need gift of money from state have not of course being still minor taken up paper of naturalization a citizen doge said highness be intention to do so spoke to on subject once said that although regarded venice with affection must at time do everything in power for state must not renounce birthplace a englishman by taking oath of allegiance to state probably must after time return to native country pointed out to that although foreigner be given facility for trade in venice must be grievous disadvantage to in island especially with country such a egypt turk eastern empire with whom have treaty a unless be venetian must be unable to trade with fully saw force of argument persisted in determination if ask opinion therefore signor think honour too great must suggest that highest most acceptable honour must be bestowed upon must be that have at various time conferred upon foreign personage of distinction namely to grant freedom of venice inscribe name upon list of citizen without requiring of renunciation of own country taking oath of allegiance honour be assuredly great exceptional one doge said so be service that have rendered have converted what must have be defeat into victory have saved venice from grave peril will retire for few minute signor will then announce to result of deliberation on matter chapter in mocenigo power be fully hour before polani be recalled to council chamber saw at once by flushed angry face of of council that debate have be hot one at be not surprised for knew that friend connection of ruggiero mocenigo must vehemently oppose suggestion have made doge announced decision council thank for suggestion signor polani have resolved by majority to confer upon messer francisco hammond high honour of placing name upon list of citizen of venice without requiring from oath of allegiance to state a such honour have never before be conferred save upon personage of highest rank will be proof of gratitude venice feel towards one who have done such distinguished service decree to effect will be published tomorrow merchant retired highly gratified honour be great signal one material advantage considerable fact that francis be foreigner have be sole obstacle have presented to in associating with business for must prevent francis from trading personally with of country in venetian citizen enjoyed special advantage francis be immensely gratified when heard from merchant of honour to be conferred upon be of others reward must have selected have free choice be given be so great unusual honour that must indeed scarcely credit when merchant told result of interview with council difficulty being foreigner must throw in way of career a merchant in eastern water have be frequently in mind must foresaw greatly lessen usefulness that must be able to obtain naturalization without renouncing allegiance to england have never even hoped be very high honour doubtless polani said whit higher than deserve besides after cost venice nothing money be scarce at present at rate can congratulate a well a for foresaw many difficulty in way although ship carrying venetian flag must enter port of country trading with must personally be liable to arrest at time on being denounced a not being native of venice assuredly must be by rival in trade next day bulletin be published giving substance of pisani despatch announcing that in token of gratitude of republic for great service have rendered messer hammond must be at once granted freedom of venice name inserted on list of citizen during two day delight of venice at news of victory have be extreme house have be decorated with flag bell of church have peeled out joyously crowd assembled round polani palace insisted upon francis making appearance when greeted with tremendous shout of applause upon evening of second day said to polani have ship fit for sea signor because if so pray to send away matter where can not stand since decree be published morning have not have moment peace be too absurd when did more than sailor on board ship if went on must very soon be heartily sorry ever interfered on behalf of admiral merchant smiled have half promised to take with to reception at persanis evening have have dozen request of similar nature for night week next then if have ship ready signor will charter fishing boat engage couple of men go off for fortnight by end of time something fresh will have happened can send off if really wish francisco first thing tomorrow morning be despatching small craft with message to agent in corfu with letter for daughter will be delighted to see indeed will be glad to know that be with until can wind up several affair have in hand join be fast must be at corfu in eight forty hour after sailing francis gladly embraced offer started next morning vessel be small one designed to sail row crew consisted of twenty men who rowed sixteen sweep when wind be light unfavourable be open boat except be decked at end small cabin being formed aft for captain passenger there might be on board while crew stowed in little forecastle when boat be halfway across sail be seen approaching captain recognized a one of polani vessel in case francis said may a well direct course so a to pas within hailing distance when approach hoist polani flag signal to to lay to be done two craft brought up within thirty yard of other captain appeared at side of vessel doffed cap when recognized francis have news from east latter asked little signor few genoese pirate be among island be reported to have made capture have seen none there be nothing new from constantinople fresh attempt have be made by emperor to recapture tenedos did touch at corfu on way back left there yesterday signor strange craft have be reported a having be seen on coast carry flag from appearance be judged to be moor be at peace with moor francis said be year since ventured on depredation excepting on own water be so signor only tell be report at corfu appeared to be swift craft rowing great many oar movement certainly seem mysterious a have several time appeared off coast two vessel sailed from cyprus be to have touched at corfu have not arrived there when left say that several others be overdue say have anything to do with strange galley be general opinion in corfu that have something to do with be bearer of letter from governor to seignory praying that two three war ship may at once be sent down to island look strange certainly francis said can not believe that moorish pirate must be so daring a to come up into venetian water must not have thought so either signor may be that knowing there be war between venice genoa that state galley of republic instead of being scattered over sea be now collected in fleet thinking only of fighting other might consider good opportunity for picking prize be good opportunity certainly francis said must know that venice must sooner later reckon with must demand four fold indemnity for loss merchant may have suffered however will not detain longer will tell signor polani that met that be making good progress hoped to reach corfu time tomorrow be curious thing about galley captain of boat said to francis a men again dipped oar into water boat once more proceeded on way be much more likely to be genoese pirate than moor francis said may have purposely altered rig little in order to deceive vessel who may sight be very many year since moorish craft have be bold enough to commit act of piracy on side of sicily however must hope that will not fall in with if see anything answering to description will give wide berth besides be hardly likely must interfere with so small craft a ours for must be sure must be carrying cargo of great value twenty christian slave must fetch money among moor captain said let hope will see nothing of for must have chance of resistance against craft must go two foot to one next morning francis be aroused by hurried summons from captain half awake wondering what must be cause of call for boat lay motionless on water hurried out from little cabin day have just broken sky be aglow with ruddy light in east look there signor captain said pointing to south watch made out quarter of hour since thinking nothing of did not call what do think of two vessel be lying in close proximity to other at distance of about two mile from boat one of be large trader other be long galley rigged quite differently to of venice genoa be craft be speaking of captain said there be mistaking may be egyptian moor certainly come from african coast be got up in african fashion francis said may be a agreed yesterday genoese masquerading in fashion in order to be able to approach trader without suspicion being aroused look a if have made captive of vessel imagine must have come up to late yesterday evening have be at work night stripping hope be too busy to attend to sail have be lowered instant captain caught sight of vessel for there be scarcely enough wind to fill men be now rowing steadily think must have taken much of cargo out be very deep in water very deep francis agreed seems to to be deeper than did three minute ago be great deal deeper than when first caught sight of one of sailor said stood much higher in water than galley did now if anything galley stand highest see captain exclaimed suddenly galley be rowing oar on port bow bringing head round have noticed be going to chase have seen too much row men be for life if overtake be question between death slavery among moor sudden exclamation from one of men caused captain to glance round again at galley be alone now on water trader have sunk do take helm signor captain said hand will help at oar of oar be double banked beneath strength of twenty men boat moved fast through water galley be now rowing oar in full pursuit for quarter of hour not word be spoken man on board be doing utmost francis have glanced backwards several time at end of quarter of hour must see that distance between boat pursuer have distinctly lessened be gaining on captain asked for cabin in stern hid galley from sight of oarsman be gaining francis said quietly not rapidly row steadily lad despair when find how slowly gain may give up chase think not worth trouble jacopo said to old sailor who be rowing in bow who already be getting exhausted from exertion do lay in oar come aft will take place at end of hour galley be little more than quarter of mile away have better stop captain said have chance of getting away longer chase more furious will be what do think signor agree with francis replied have done that must there be use in rowing longer oar fell motionless in water few minute later long galley came rushing up by side fine row have given dog man shouted angrily a came alongside if have something on board will pay for chase have have will be worse for what boat be that be naxos belongs to messer polani of venice be bound to corfu bear letter from padrone to agent there have cargo on board letter perhaps may be worth more than cargo boat must carry so come on board let see what excellent polani say to agent now make haste of will be worse for be useless hesitating captain francis crew stepped on board galley just look round captain said to one of sailor if there be anything worth taking take then knock hole in bottom with axe francis a stepped on board galley looked round at crew be not genoese a have expected mixture of ruffian from port in mediterranean a saw at once by costume be greek from island smyrniots moor spaniard moor predominated nearly crew belonging to race then looked at captain who be eagerly perusing document captain have handed a eye fell upon francis started for recognized at once man whose design have twice thwarted ruggiero mocenigo felt that be in deadly peril after reading merchant communication to agent ruggiero opened letter addressed to maria have read few line when suddenly looked up then with expression of savage pleasure in face stepped up to francis so messer hammond good polani sends to stay for while with daughter truly when set out in chase morning of wretched rowboat little deemed that carried prize valued more than loaded caravel be to owe that be exile instead of being honoured son in law of wealthy polani be accursed interference brought misfortune upon thank heaven vengeance have come at last take below said turning to men put heaviest iron have got on fellow fasten with staple into deck thought be going to hang throw overboard went on turning to francis flatter that death will be so easy one will suffer thousand torment before die francis have not spoken word since ruggiero first turned to have stood with tranquil almost contemptuous expression upon face nerve muscle of body be strained in readiness to spring into action have expected that ruggiero must at once attack be determined to leap upon to sell life a dearly a possible sailor seized francis companion thrust down into hold be already crowded with upwards of hundred captive be chained with heavy manacle in obedience to ruggiero order staple be driven through link of chain deep into deck so that be forced to remain in sitting lying posture captain of naxos came sat beside who be pirate captain messer francisco who thus know have enmity against by speech be surely venetian yet how come venetian in command of pirate that man be ruggiero mocenigo same who twice attempted to carry off messer polani daughter second time succeeded must have be tried for offence by state have not aided by band of paduans escaped from keeping of guard of course heard of signor be away at sea at time heard how came up at moment when padrone gondolier have be overcome rescued daughter be villain mocenigo disgrace to name family remember name captain tell to of men so that if ever escape from slavery into doubt intends to sell may tell in venice that ruggiero mocenigo be pirate ally of moor a for there be think small chance of escape at rate if ever reach venice will be able to tell padrone how be that never arrived at corfu how fell into hand of old enemy still despair that may carry message there be many slip between cup lip mocenigo may have cause yet to regret that did not make end of a soon a got into hand may be so captain said indeed can not think that so brave young gentleman be destined to die miserably at hand of such scoundrel a man have shown to be a for death did come speedily sharply must far sooner die than live moorish slave santa maria how will wonder at home when day go on naxos doe not return how at last will give up hope thinking that have gone down in sudden squall never dreaming that be sold a slave to moor by countryman keep up heart captain be sure that when war with genoa be over venice will take matter in hand a know vessel have already carried tidings thither of depredation of moorish cruiser will take vengeance on moor may even force to liberate captive have taken besides may be sure that padrone when hears of moorish galley find never reached corfu although weather continued fine will guess that have fallen into hand will never rest till find where have be taken will ransom who survive at price may put upon will do best know be good master to serve once prisoner among moor hope of one ever being heard of again be slight sometimes of course men have be ransomed most a have heard can never be found by friend however ready may be to pay ransom might be asked just depends whether be sold to moor living in seaport not if be there must be no great difficulty in hearing of if be sold into interior inquiry be ever likely to discover must hope for best francis said chance of escape may occur have heard that christian captive who have be released say that moor be for most part kind master have heard so too captain said anyhow must rather be moorish slave than lie in genoese dungeon genoese be not like when take prisoner treat fairly honourably while treat prisoner worse than dog wish must do something for messer francisco case be deal worse than ours listen be quarrelling up on deck there be indeed sound of men in hot dispute trampling of foot clash of steel sound of body falling be not possible that one of cruiser can have come up be boarding pirate captain said for sail be in sight when be brought here looked round last thing before left deck what can be fighting about likely enough a to course have probably from what heard taken sunk several ship may be in favour of returning to dispose of booty while others may be for cruising longer only hope that scoundrel ruggiero be among heard fall be quiet now one party other have evidently got best of there be taking to oar again several day passed sometimes oar be heard going generally galley be under sail sailor brought down food water morning evening paid other attention to captive francis discussed with of other prisoner chance of making sudden rush on to deck overpowering crew arm have be taken from galley calculated contained fully hundred fifty men noticed too when sailor brought down food party armed in readiness be assembled round hatchway at other time hatchway be nearly closed being only left sufficiently open to allow certain amount of air to pas down into hold by steady tramp of step up down knew that two sentry be also on guard above most of prisoner be so overcome with misfortune have befallen prospect of life in hopeless slavery that have spirit to attempt enterprise whatever there be nothing to do to wait termination of voyage at end of six day there be bustle on deck chain of anchor be heard to run out two three hour afterwards hatchway be taken off when rest have ascended two men came below with hammer drew staple fastened francis to deck on going up be at first so blinded with glare of sunshine after six day in almost total darkness that must scarce see where be ship be lying at anchor in bay shore be low group of house stood abreast of where ship be anchored by appearance francis saw at once that be on coast of africa of island near prisoner be ordered to descend into boat lay alongside sailor taking place with ruggiero be not at first to be seen just a francis be preparing to take place in boat came out from cabin one of arm be in sling head bandaged take special care of prisoner said to men take off chain place sentinel at door of place of confinement must rather lose share of spoil have taken than must escape shackle have be removed from rest of captive on landing be driven into hut stood little apart from village francis be thrust into small chamber with five six companion next morning other prisoner be called out francis be left alone by day on return in evening told that prisoner have be employed in assisting to get out cargo with vessel be crammed in carrying to large storehouse in village must have taken rich booty indeed said one of prisoner who have already told francis that be captain of vessel have seen founder must tell pretty well what bale contain by manner of packing must say that there be pick of cargo of dozen ship there of here belong to three ship except taken with from talk of sailor heard that have already sent off two batch of captive by ship be cruising in company of also learned that quarrel took place just after be captured arose from fact that captain wished party to land to carry off two woman from somewhere in island of corfu crew insisted on first returning with booty urging that if surprised by venetian galley might lose result of toil be opinion of majority although few sided with captain being induced to do so by fact that offered to give up share of booty if must do so captain lost temper drew sword party be quickly overpowered have kept to cabin ever since suffering say more from rage than from wound however seems that a soon a cargo have be sold be to start for corfu to carry out enterprise be on island not very far from tunis fast rowing boat started early morning to merchant with whom deal for seems that certain amount of secrecy be observed in order that if complaint be made by venice moorish authority may disclaim knowledge of matter two day later prisoner captured be again led out guard telling that merchant who have be expected have arrived giuseppi who have hitherto borne up bravely be in agony of grief at being separated from francis threw upon ground wept tore hair besought guard to let share master fate whatever might be declared that must kill be separated guard must have be obliged to use force have not francis begged giuseppi not to struggle against fate to go quietly promising again again that if regained freedom must not rest until giuseppi be also set at liberty at last lad yielded suffered to be led away in heartbroken state by guard none of captive returned to hut francis now turned whole thought to freeing from chain have already revolved in mind possible mode of escape have tried strong iron bar of window found that be so rigidly fixed embedded in stonework that there be hope of escape in way even must have got through window weight of shackle must have crippled be fastened with two chain about two foot six inch long going from wrist of right hand to left ankle from left hand to right ankle thus be unable to stand quite upright anything like rapid movement be almost impossible bottom of window came within four foot of ground be only by standing on one leg lifting other a high a must that be able to grasp one of bar to try strength news have heard from fellow prisoner almost maddened thought far le of own fate than of of girl who must be living in quiet country retreat in ignorance of danger until suddenly seized by mocenigo band of pirate have on first day tried whether be possible to draw hand through iron band round wrist have concluded must not be done for be riveted so tightly a to press upon flesh therefore there be hope of freeing in manner only possible mean then must be to cut through rivet chain for tool must be required suddenly idea struck guard who brought in food be sicilian be evidently of talkative disposition for have several time entered into conversation with captive in addition to long knife carried small stiletto in girdle francis thought that if must obtain might possibly free accordingly at hour when expected guard to enter francis placed at window with face against bar when heard guard come in a usual close door behind turned round said who be damsel there be very beautiful pass here frequently there be just going among tree guard moved to window looked out do see just going round that corner there ah be gone guard be pressing face against bar to look in direction indicated francis who be already standing on left leg with right raised so a to give freedom to hand next to man have difficulty in drawing stiletto from sheath slipping into trouser be just too late said doubt often see see beautiful damsel about in wretched place man replied suppose be daughter of head man in village say have good looking one take pretty good care that be not about when be here suppose thought must be seen along path will keep good lookout for in future frighten away francis said laughing be one pleasant thing have in day to look at after more talk man retired francis examined prize be thin blade of fine steel at once hid in earth formed floor of hut hour later guard opened door suddenly be now dusk francis be sitting quietly in corner bring light thomaso guard shouted to comrade outside be getting dark in here other brought torch carefully examined floor of cell what be that be searching for francis asked have dropped dagger somewhere man replied ca think how fell out when did see last not since dinner time know have then thought possibly might have dropped here dagger be not sort of plaything one care about giving to prisoner chained a be francis said dagger must not be formidable weapon in hand man agreed must be useless to unless wanted to stick into own rib must have to sit down to be able to do even that be so lad be not for to question what captain say just do a be told own doe seem hard keeping young fellow like chained up a if be wild beast if have got pisani zeno a prisoner wanted to make doubly sure that must not escape must be well enough for lad like with one man always at door window barred so that lion must break through do think hard to keep chained like worst of be be going to have to stop here to look after till captain get back may be three week month who know why keep mouth shut philippo other man growled be always talk talk with be chosen because captain can rely upon can rely upon anyone philippo retorted who know that will get throat cut if fails in duty well come along other said want to be staying here night dagger be here be certain a be off guard at present want to be going a soon a be left alone francis unearthed dagger feeling sure that fresh visit must be made that evening a have hoped first attempt showed that iron of rivet be soft keen dagger at once notched off small piece of burred end again again tried time small piece of metal flew off after cut examined edge of dagger be well tempered seemed entirely unaffected now felt certain that with patience must be able to cut off projecting edge of rivet so be able to free hand therefore now examined fastening at ankle be more heavy on trying iron of rivet appeared to be much harder than kept manacle together be however now too dark to see what be doing concealing dagger again lay down with lighter heart than have from moment of capture even if found that lower fastening of chain defied effort must cut rivet at wrist so free one end of chain must then tie chain round leg weight must not be sufficient to prevent walking chapter pirate raid a soon a be daylight next morning francis be up at work experiment of evening before be at once confirmed three four hour work must enable to free wrist must make impression on rivet at ankle after few trial gave up a hopeless for be afraid if continued must blunt edge of dagger for hour sat still thinking at last idea occurred to iron must be ground by rubbing upon stone if must not cut off burr of rivet with dagger might perhaps be able to wear down by rubbing with stone at once turned to wall of cell be not built of unbaked clay so largely used for house of poorer class in northern egypt have evidently be constructed either a prison more probably a strong room where merchant kept valuable good be therefore constructed of block of hard stone seemed to francis that be sandstone to test quality sat down in corner where guard have night before placed supply of food water first moistened portion of wall then took up link of chain rubbed for time against at last to satisfaction bright patch showed that stone be capable of wearing away iron in vain did try to twist leg so a to rub rivet against wall gave up attempt a impossible be clear then that must have bit of stone to rub with at once began to dig with dagger in earth at foot of wall to see if must find such piece for long time came across chip even of smallest size a worked be most careful to stamp down earth have moved scattering over sand of there be abundance in corner of room to obliterate trace of work when breakfast time approached ceased for while after meal have be taken recommenced task met with little success till reached door here be more fortunate short distance below surface be number of piece of stone of various size have doubt have be cut from block to allow for fixing of lintel doorpost chose dozen piece of handiest size having flat surface then replacing earth carefully took one of piece in hand moistening with water set to work made little progress still stone did wear iron felt sure that by perseverance must succeed in wearing off burr day worked without intermission holding rag wrapped round stone to deaden sound worked till finger ached so that must no longer hold then rested for hour two resumed work when guard brought dinner asked when galley be to sail again be to have gone today man said captain have be laid up with fever have leech from tunis attending weak a be be so bent on going that must have have carried on board ship have not leech said that in case must not answer for life a in state blood be in wound must assuredly mortify did not remain perfectly quiet so have agreed to delay for three day francis be unable to work with stone at night for in stillness sound might be heard for hour hacked away with dagger at rivet on manacle next morning be at work a soon a chirrup of cicada began a knew must completely deaden sound might make by nighttime rivet end on iron round ankle be worn so thin that felt sure that hour work must bring level with iron before went to sleep rivet on wrist be in same condition learned from guard next morning that captain be better that be to be taken on board in cool of evening that vessel must start a soon a breeze sprang up in morning in afternoon two guard entered bade follow be conducted to principal house in village into room where ruggiero mocenigo be lying on couch have sent for ruggiero said to tell have not forgotten vengeance have be delayed from fault of mine will be sweeter when come be going to fetch polani daughter have heard that since thrust between have be familiar in house that polani treat a member of family that be in high favour with daughter have kept informed of what happened in venice have noted of thing down in account of what owe be going to fetch polani daughter here to make maria wife then will show how treat who cross path will be lesson to a well a for will wish dead thousand time before death come to always knew that be villain ruggiero mocenigo francis said quietly although hardly thought that man who have once honour of being noble of venice must sink to become pirate renegade may carry maria polani off will never succeed through in obtaining portion of father fortune for know that first moment hand be free will stab to heart rather than remain in power of wretch ruggiero snatched up dagger from table by couch a francis be speaking dropped again fool said be not going to carry off two girl do not see that will tame maria spirit effectually when know that if lay hand on will shift honour of being wife from herself to sister a laugh of anticipated triumph rang in francis ear latter in fury made spring forward to throw upon villain have forgotten chain fell headlong on to floor guard ruggiero shouted take fellow away charge watch over securely remember that life will answer for escape there be need for threat signor philippo said can rely on vigilance though a far a see if have child to watch must be safe in cell of fettered a be ruggiero waved hand impatiently two men withdrew with prisoner if be not that have not touched share of booty of last trip philippo said a left house must not serve day a be a soon a galley return get share of money of sum have promised if expedition of be successful will be off have have enough of be bad enough to be consorting with moor without being abused threatened a if one be dog a soon a be alone again francis set to work by afternoon end of four rivet be worn down level with iron needed pressure to make ring spring open then waited for evening before freeing a by chance might again be visited even if free before nightfall must not leave house philippo be later than usual in bringing meal francis heard angry word passing between comrade because have not returned to relieve sooner be everything ready for start francis asked man a entered yes crew be on board boat be to be on shore for captain at nine o'clock a there be little breeze blowing expect will get up sail start at once after few minute talk man left francis waited until became almost dark then inserted dagger between iron at point of junction at first wrench flew apart left hand be free few minute more work chain lay on ground taking up rattled together loudly in minute heard guard outside move come to door then key be inserted in lock door opened what on earth be doing now philippo asked a entered francis be standing close to door so that a guard entered have back to before question be finished sprang upon throwing headlong to ground with shock before astonished man must speak be kneeling upon with point of dagger at throat if make sound utter cry exclaimed will drive dagger into throat philippo must feel point of dagger against skin remained perfectly quiet want to kill philippo have not be harsh to must spare life if must hold hand back above head put wrist together that may fasten then will let get up philippo held up hand a requested francis bound tightly together with strip of twisted cloth then allowed to rise now philippo must gag then will fasten hand to bar well above head so that ca get at rope with teeth will leave here till comrade come in morning must rather that killed at once signor man said thomaso will be furious at having made escape for will certainly come in for share of fury of captain there be three four of crew remaining behind doubt will keep locked up till ship return in case captain will be a good a word have better kill at once what be to do philippo must ensure own safety if will suggest way by can do will must swear oath like signor will not give alarm will make straight across island get hold of boat there so a to be well away before escape be known in morning well look here philippo believe be sincere will take oath hold most sacred can accompany signor if will keep hand tied till be on other side of island stab if give alarm will not do philippo will trust altogether first take oath spoke of philippo swore terrible oath that must abstain from giving alarm must cross island make straight for mainland francis at once cut bond will lose share of plunder philippo will have to keep out of way to avoid captain rage therefore advise when get to

divided then left prison room philippo locked door after be there chance of thomaso returning speedily francis asked because if so might notice absence so give alarm before ship set sail in case must have whole crew on track think that will will be likely to be drinking in wine shop for hour two before return tell will do signor will resume place here on guard until have returned will relieve at midnight in darkness will not notice change of clothes there will still be plenty of time for to cross island get out of sight in boat before alarm be given will not be until six o'clock when ought to relieve again a say if alarm be to be given before vessel sail might start at once to cut off before reach mainland for must make sure that must try to escape in direction will be best plan philippo now goodbye francis walked down to shore there be boat lying there of size must launch unaided presently heard sound of oar small fishing boat rowed by two men approached look here lad said want to be put on board ship ought to have be on board three hour ago took too much wine lay down for hour two overslept do think can row quietly up alongside so that can slip on board unnoticed if so will give ducat for trouble can do that fisherman said have just come from ship now have sold catch of today there be dozen other boat lying beside bargaining for fish besides be taking on board firewood other store have be left till last moment so jump in will soon get there in few minute approached side of ship see have got dozen fish left in boat now francis said be of account one of men said be good enough for eating not such a buy on board ship where money be plentiful be heartily welcome to if have fancy for thank francis said will take two three of if can spare want to play trick with comrade a fisherman said there be several boat lying near vessel men be leaning over side bargaining for fish handing fisherman promised reward francis sprang up ladder to deck be unnoticed for other men have gone down into boat for fish mingling with sailor gradually made way to hatchway leading into hold descended ladder stowed away among quantity of cask filled with wine with water at farther end of hold a lay there devoutly thanked god that enterprise have be so far successful men came down from time to time with lantern to stow away lately arrived store none came near place where francis be hidden time seemed long before heard clank of capstan knew vessel be being hove up to anchor then after while heard creaking of cordage much trampling of foot on deck above knew that be under way then made a comfortable a must in cramped position went off to sleep when woke in morning light be streaming down hatch be only closed in rough weather a be necessary frequently to go down into for water store francis have brought fish with a mean of subsistence during voyage in case must be unable to obtain provision for there be occasion a there be abundance of fruit hanging from beam while pile of bread be stowed in partition at one end of hold during day however did not venture to move be heartily glad when again became dark must venture to get out stretch appropriated loaf bunch of grape took long drink from pail placed under tap of water butt made way back to corner after hearty meal went out again for drink then turned in to sleep so passed six day by rush of water against outside plank must always judge whether vessel be making brisk way whether be lying becalmed once twice after nightfall ventured up on deck feeling certain that in darkness there be fear of being detected from conversation overheard on seventh evening learned that corfu have be sighted that day for hour vessel sail have be lowered have remained motionless be now again making for land in course of two hour landing be to be made boat have be got in readiness men be to muster fully armed although a understood carrying off of two girl be special object be intended that must gather a much plunder a must be obtained island be rich for many wealthy venetian have residence there therefore with exception of few men left on board to take care of galley whole be to land picked boat crew be to accompany captain who be now completely convalescent rest be to divide in band scatter over country pillaging a went setting fire to house be considered that such consternation must be caused that nothing like resistance must be offered for time by daybreak hand be to gather at landing place how far spot be from town francis have mean of learning there be store of spare arm in hold francis furnishing with sword large dagger waited until heard great movement overhead then went upon deck joined gang of men employed in lowering one of boat boat be large one rowing sixteen oar carrying twenty men seated in stern here francis took place with others boat pushed off waited until four others be launched filled then order be given boat rowed in body towards shore men landed formed under respective officer one man remaining in boat to keep afloat francis leaped ashore while men be forming up found difficulty in slipping away unnoticed a did not know where path be be afraid of making noise lay down among rock until heard word of command to start given then cautiously crept out keeping far enough in rear to be unseen followed sound of footstep by short time have elapsed between landing start have doubt be guided by person perfectly acquainted with locality probably by native of island among mixed crew francis have during voyage thought over course must pursue on landing saw ignorant a be of country only hope be in obtaining guide who must conduct to polani villa before arrival of mocenigo band fact that crew be divided into five party be to proceed in different direction that did not know of be commanded by captain added to difficulty have kept together might after seeing direction in be going make detour get ahead of might now follow party going in entirely wrong direction before must obtain guide mocenigo band might have gone so far that must not be overtaken before reached villa there be nothing to do to get ahead of party in hope of coming upon habitation before going far a soon therefore a last band have disappeared started at run country be open with few wall fence therefore on leaving road be able to run rapidly forward in few minute knew that must be ahead of pirate then again changed course so a to strike road have left after running for about mile saw light ahead of soon arrived at cottage knocked at door then entered occupant of room man woman lad several child rose to foot at sudden entrance of stranger good people francis said have just landed from ship be bearer of important message to signora polani have lost way be necessary must go on without moment delay can tell how far villa of polani be distant be about three mile from here man said will give ducat to son if will run on with at once man looked doubtful apparel general appearance of francis be not prepossessing have be six day prisoner in hold without mean of washing see said producing ducat here be money will give at once if will order son to go with to hurry at top of speed be bargain man said here rufo start at once with signor come along boy said without word to parent francis followed out set off at run along road francis have said nothing about pirate to peasant for knew that did do so such alarm must be caused that must think of nothing flight must not be able to obtain guide be improbable that must be molested pirate be bent upon pillaging villa of wealthy must not risk raising of alarm by entering cottage where there be chance of plunder after proceeding few hundred yard lad struck off by byroad at right angle to have be following by direction took francis felt that must at first have gone far out of way that party going direct to villa must have have considerable start still reckoned that a be running at rate of three foot to one must march might hope to arrive at house well before not word be spoken a ran along lad be wondering in mind a to what must be urgent business must necessitate being carried at such speed while francis felt that breath be needed for work have to do only once twice spoke to ask how much further be to destination last answer be cheering few hundred pace farther there be light signor have not gone to bed be door francis knocked with pommel of sword keeping up loud continuous knocking minute two passed then face appeared at window above who be that knock so loudly at time of night be francisco hammond open instantly danger threatens signora quick for life servant recognized voice ran down without hesitation unbarred fastening for moment thought must have be mistaken a francis ran into lighted hall where be lady asked lead to instantly a spoke door standing by be opened signor polani with two girl appeared have be on point of retiring to rest when knocking began merchant with drawn sword be standing at door when recognized francis ' voice be about to utter exclamation of pleasure at seeing of astonishment not only at sudden arrival at appearance when francis burst out there be time for word must fly instantly ruggiero mocenigo be close at heel with band of twenty pirate girl uttered cry of alarm merchant exclaimed can not defend house francisco have eight men here can hold till assistance come ruggiero have hundred francis said can be brought up in short time must fly for god sake delay signor may be here at moment come girl polani said too went on turning to servant whom knocking have caused to assemble do follow resistance must only cost life here maria take hand francisco do see to giulia close door after last of bolt will give few minute before break in discover that have gone way be scoundrel coming francis pointed in direction from have come whole party started at fast pace in other direction have not be gone five minute when loud sudden knocking broke on silence of night be close thing indeed francisco merchant said a ran along close to other at present feel a if be in dream will tell presently be by time outside ground of villa of servant who knew country now took lead in few minute merchant slackened pace be out of danger now said will not know in direction to search for if scatter in pursuit must make very short work of might come up with know that be out of danger francis said hundred men landed mocenigo with twenty took line to house rest have scattered over country in smaller band bent on murder pillage therefore have best keep on a fast a can until well beyond circle be likely to sweep be unless lady be tired tired maria repeated why giulia go for long walk day must run for hour if necessary then come on dear merchant said be burning to know what mean be sure be equally curious nothing can be said till be in safety accordingly party again broke into run few minute later one of servant looking back exclaimed have fired house signor there be flame issuing from one of lower window expected that merchant said without looking back that scoundrel must in case light in fury at finding that have escaped have probably done so now in hope that light will enable to discover be well that be so far ahead for blaze will light up country for long way round there be wood little way ahead signor servant said once through that will be hidden from sight however great light arrived at wood again broke into walk few hundred yard beyond wood be rising ground from must see far over country let stop here merchant said be safe now have placed two mile between ourselves villain villa be now mass of flame exclamation of fury broke from men servant while woman cried with anger at sight of destruction concern yourselves merchant said house can be rebuilt will see that none of be poorer for loss of belonging now girl let sit down here hear from francisco how be that have once again be saviour before begin signor tell whether there be ship of war in port how far be distant from be not above six mile on other side of island be to say have be going towards since left villa see broke off there be flame rising in three four direction rest of villain be at work be there war galley in port francis interrupted yes three ship be sent here on report that moorish pirate have be cruising in water that several vessel be missing when story first came did not credit captain of ship who brought news told have met about halfway across have told about supposed pirate vessel arrived four day later brought letter from agent said word about boat having arrived then became uneasy when later news came still word of felt sure that something must have befallen that possibly report be true that have fallen into hand of pirate so at once started in one of galley council be despatching in answer to request of governor here in case signor there be not moment to lose governor must be informed that pirate be lying on opposite coast that crew have landed be burning pillaging if order be issued at once galley must get round before morning so cut off retreat of miscreant be quite right polani said rising at once will go on without moment delay girl can follow slowly under escort of servant oh papa maria exclaimed be not going to take francisco away till have heard story can not send forward servant with message to governor dear governor

of fresh voyage short time after return maria declared that must not be married unless remained to be present have got out of scrape hitherto francisco must see safely through a signor polani also declared that be not to be thought of francis must leave until after marriage be obliged to remain for be glad however when be over for found time on shore more tedious than usual girl be taken up with preparation for ceremony visitor be constantly coming going house be not like even when marriage be over be forced to remain time longer in venice genoese fleet be keeping sea pisani have not since battle of antium succeeded in coming up with consequence be that commerce be at standstill for risk of capture be so great that merchant ceased to send ship to sea profit must not repay for risk francisco merchant said one day when be talking over if only one cargo in ten fell into hand profit off other nine must be swept away a see that be longing to be afloat again can if like join one of state galley start next week to reinforce pisani fleet last time pisani wrote to said how glad must be to have with after service at antium have doubt whatever must procure for post a second in command in one of ship what do say must certainly like signor greatly a said before must be mere waste of time for to take service with state when be determined upon vocation of merchant did say that francis meant at time at present trade be a see at standstill so must not be losing time in next place be always advantage even to trader to stand well with state here in venice great merchant be of noble family trade be bar to occupying highest office of state many of doge have be merchant while merchant be often soldier diplomatist governor a state requires service have already see obtained considerable benefit by action at antium say that must derive direct benefit even be to distinguish again a highly a on occasion still be always well to gain consideration of fellow to be popular with people therefore if must like to take service with state until affair be decided with genoa sea be again open to ship think will be advantageous to rather than not then with permission will certainly do so signor francis said of course must prefer to go a officer on board one of ship if not will go a volunteer need not fear about francis with influence that of giustiniani repute have gained for may be sure of appointment rufino must have commanded one of ship have not be for marriage rufino giustiniani have indeed be most warm in expression of gratitude to francis to whom whole family have shown greatest attention giving many present a proof of goodwill gratitude be quite jealous of english friend rufino have said one day to maria do believe maria that care for more than do for be lucky for that be not two three year older maria laughed do care for dearly if have be a say older have fallen in love with ca say how must have be must acknowledge must be very hard to say to man who keep on saving from frightful peril then see girl ca fall in love with man who doe not fall in love with francisco be so different from venetian always say just what think never pay anyone even least bit of compliment how can fall in love with man like of course can love like brother do love francisco a if be brother think must have got further than if have be ever so old doe francis never pay compliment giulia never giulia said decidedly must be hateful of if did maria doe object to compliment giulia look for a if be daily bread maria will have to learn to put up with soon giulia for will be out in society now young men will crowd round chair just a have done round that of little flirt sister will have to put up with suppose giulia said quietly just a one put up with other annoyance must certainly never get to care for anyone who think so little of a to believe must be pleased by being addressed in such term from gather giustiniani said smiling that english lad bluntness of speech plea more than doe maria plea maria too giulia said though may choose to say that doe think quite right to discus at when owe a much a do giustiniani glanced at maria gave little significant nod think giulia regard francisco in brotherly way that do maria whispered presently to perhaps not maria answered see have not fallen in love with before met know giulia seldom speaks of when be alone if did suppose must tell sister secret sir day after conversation with francis polani handed nomination a second in command of pluto have obtained that morning from seignory will be glad to hear that be in ship matteo also sail for matteo have come home for brother wedding be very glad of francis said wish that poor giuseppi be also here to go with will miss terribly be most faithful devoted follower have already sent order to agent in tunis to spare pain in discovering to whom crew of naxos be sold be unfortunate that so many other captive be sold at same time a will make so much more difficult to trace men purchasing be not likely to know more than first name may not even take trouble to find out may give first appellation come to hand therefore have to find out who be now master of whole of captive sold at same time then to pursue investigation until discovers identity of men be looking for once have found will promise there will be delay have ordered to make best bargain in case can at rate be to buy one of may cost have sent personal description of man of boat crew a given to by friend relative here a will be assistance in search if for instance hears of christian slave named giuseppi living with master hundred of mile in interior fact that man be middle aged will show at once that be not giuseppi age of whom be in search have particularly impressed upon in letter that be especially anxious for rescue of captain young man giuseppi so hope that by time return from voyage may have received news of matteo be greatly pleased when heard that be going to sail under francis must rather that have be volunteer francis said seems absurd being appointed second officer while a yet have official position be not in least bit in world jealous francisco with exception of taking part in fight at antium have have experience whatever while have be going through sort of adventure for last two year always have come out of marvellously well hour after matteo left retainer of family brought francis letter from signor giustiniani inviting to come to house evening a many of matteo comrade on board pluto must be present on francis going to palace found assembled not only young men who must be matteo comrade a volunteer also captain other officer of ship to signor giustiniani personally presented francis while rufino matteo did must to ensure heartiest welcome for by telling everyone how greatly be indebted to how gallantly have behaved on several occasion many of young men already knew a matteo friend by be received with greatest cordiality reception by captain one two of other officer be much more cool captain whose name be carlo bottini be distant connection of mocenigo family be therefore already prejudiced against coolness of other officer be due to fact that francis foreigner several year junior to have be placed in command over head chapter battle of pola squadron consisting of four galley sailed for cyprus where pisani have just endeavoured without success to expel genoese from famagosta be towards end of august that effected junction with fleet pisani received francis with great warmth in presence of many officer remarked that be glad to see that republic be at last appointing men for merit not a heretofore allowing family connection influence to be chief passport to favour for two month fleet sailed among island of levant along shore of greece istria dalmatia hoping to find genoese fleet altogether without success in november when be on coast of istria winter set in with extraordinary severity frost be intense pisani wrote to government asking permission to bring fleet into venice until spring seignory however refused request for feared that be known that fleet have come into port for winter genoese must take advantage of absence to seize upon of island belonging to venice to induce inhabitant of city of istria dalmatia always ready for revolt to declare against first indication of winter be more than verified cold be altogether extraordinary out of nineteen galley of pisani only six be fit to take sea with full complement of men when spring of began many of vessel have be disabled by storm number of men have died more have be sent home invalided be only by transferring men from other vessel to six in best condition that crew of latter be made up to full strength a soon a terrible frost broke pisani received reinforcement of twelve ship from venice being for most part built equipped at cost of personal friend polani having contributed two of number with eighteen sail pisani put to sea to prosecute fresh search for genoese admiral doria fleet pluto be one of six vessel remained in good condition at end of winter thanks in small degree to energy care francis have bestowed in looking after welfare of crew in most bitter weather have landed with boat to see firewood be cut brought off in abundance not only for officer cabin to warm portion of ship inhabited by men knowing that polani must not grudge sum might be required obtained from agent ample supply of warm clothing bedding for men occupying incessantly for welfare while captain other officer passed time in warm comfortable cabin francis induced matteo several of comrade to brave weather a did to exert for benefit of men consequence be that while few of other ship retained enough men to raise sail in case of emergency strength of crew of pluto be scarcely impaired at termination of winter admiral on paying visit of inspection to ship be greatly struck with contrast appearance of crew afforded to of other galley warmly complimented commander on condition of men captain received praise a if be entirely due to said not single word of share francis have have in bringing about matteo be most indignant at injustice towards friend managed that through relative serving in admiral own ship true report of case must come to pisani ear francis be in way troubled at captain appropriation of praise due to there have not from time sailed be cordiality between francis other officer have be selected for position solely from family influence none of be acquainted with working of ship in day not only in venice in other country naval battle be fought by soldier rather than sailor noble knight with retainer embarked on board ship for purpose of fighting of fighting only management of vessel being carried on entirely by sailor under own officer thus commander of force on board galley of officer with exception of francis knew anything about management of ship be capable of giving order to crew among latter be who have sailed with francis in first two voyage gave so excellent report of to rest that be from first ready to obey order a promptly a of own sub officer francis concerned little with ill will be shown by officer knew that arose from jealousy not only of promotion foreigner junior in year have received over of fact that have already received thanks of republic for service have rendered stood high in favour of admiral who never lost opportunity of showing interest have in have hostility shown in offensive degree francis must at once have resented matteo of on board who have be comrade in fencing room have given such report of power with weapon that even most opposed to thought prudent to observe demeanour of outward politeness towards for three month search for genoese fleet be ineffectual trip have be made along coast of apulia fleet have returned to pola with large convoy of merchant ship loaded with grain when on th of may doria appeared off port with twenty five sail pisani be now by mean anxious to fight zeno be away with portion of fleet although have received reinforcement numbered twenty one vessel number of men be laid up with sickness admiral however be not free to follow out dictate of own opinion venetian have mischievous habit be afterwards adopted by french republic of fettering commander by sea land by appointing civilian commissioner a be termed in venice proveditors who have power to overrule nominal commander when therefore pisani assembled council of war informed of reason for wishing to remain on defensive until return of zeno be overruled by proveditors who not only announced unanimously in favour of battle sneered at pisani prudence a being result of cowardice pisani in indignation drew sword must have attacked proveditors on spot have not be restrained by captain however council decided upon instant battle pisani be forced by rule of service at once to carry decision into effect ascending poop of galley addressed in loud voice crew of ship gathered around remember brother that who will now face be same whom vanquished with so much glory on roman shore let name of luciano doria terrify be not name of commander will decide conflict venetian heart venetian hand let that love saint mark follow men received address with shout a soon a commander have regained galley fleet moved out to attack enemy fight be furious one vessel singling out opponent engaging hand to hand carlo bottini be killed early in fight francis succeeded to command galley have grappled with one of largest of genoese vessel desperate conflict went on sometimes venetian gained footing on deck of genoese sometimes be driven back genoese in turn poured on board decisive advantage be gained on side after hour fighting genoese crew be numerically much stronger than of pluto although francis with matteo comrade headed men cheered on must make impression on rank of enemy suddenly genoese threw off grapnel attached two ship hoisting sail sheered off francis looked round to see cause of sudden manoeuvre perceived for first time that genoese vessel be in flight with venetian pressing closely upon sail be at once hoisted pluto joined in chase flight be feigned one be only designed to throw venetian rank into confusion after sailing for two mile genoese suddenly turned fell upon pursuer a came up in straggling order result be decisive many of venetian ship be captured before rest came up to take part in battle others be hemmed in by numerous foe pisani after fighting until saw that be lost made signal for ship to withdraw from conflict with six galley succeeded in fighting way through enemy fleet gained refuge in port of parenzo rest be taken from seven to eight hundred venetian perished in fight two thousand four hundred be taken prisoner twelve commander be killed five captured genoese loss be also severe doria be among slain having be killed by spear thrust by donato zeno commander of one of galley almost at moment of victory pluto have defended for long time against attack of three of genoese galley have repeatedly endeavoured to force way out of throng genoese held fast with grapnel at last greater part of crew be driven down below francis seeing uselessness of further resistance ordered little group who be now completely pent in by genoese to lower weapon be more le severely wounded be bleeding from sword cut thrust be evil day for venice matteo said a having be deprived of weapon prisoner be thrust below heard genoese say that only six of galley have escaped rest have be taken be last ship to surrender be comfort anyhow now matteo before do anything else let bind up wound be bleeding in two three place be bleeding from something like dozen francisco so have better let play doctor first captain be always served last so do a be told strip off doublet now gentleman said turning to other officer let of do what can to dress wound of others can expect care from genoese leech who will have hand full for long time to come with own men there be among who will soon bleed to death unless wound be staunched let therefore take most serious case first so on in rotation until have be attended to be fortunate for in hold in be confined there be cask of water for for hour genoese paid attention to prisoner wounded be beginning to suffer agony of thirst when barrel be fortunately discovered head of one be knocked in willow tub used for serving water to crew filled men knelt down drank by turn from many be too enfeebled by wound to rise thirst be assuaged by dipping article of clothing into water letting fluid from run into mouth be not until next morning that prisoner be ordered to come on deck many have died during night others be too weak to obey summons name of rest be taken not little surprise be expressed by genoese officer at extreme youth of officer in command of pluto be only second in command francis said in answer to question carlo bottini be in command of ship be killed at commencement of fight how be that one so young came to be second must belong to great family to have be thus pushed forward above men so much senior be wise choice nevertheless commander of one of galley have be engaged with pluto said for be justice to own ship be better handled fought in venetian fleet be engaged with first for over hour fought on fair term yielding foot of ground although have far more men than carried noticed youth fighting always in front line with venetian marvelled at strength dexterity with used weapon afterwards when there be three of around fought like boar surrounded by hound be sure be brave youth well worthy position held to whatsoever owed belong to noble family of venice francis said name be francis hammond parent be english be not mercenary trust genoese captain asked earnestly be not francis replied be citizen of venice name be inscribed in book a comrade will vouch right glad be that be so genoese said for pietro doria who be now by death of brother in chief command have ordered that mercenary found among prisoner will today be slain be brutal order francis said fearlessly whosoever may have given mercenary taken in fair fight have a much right to be held for ransom fair exchange a other prisoner if admiral thus break law of war there be not free lance from one end of italy to other will take up a personal quarrel genoese frowned at boldness with francis spoke at heart agreed in sentiment expressed for among genoese officer generally there be feeling that brutal execution in cold blood be impolitic a well a disgraceful deed officer be now placed in fore hold of ship crew being confined in after hold soon afterwards knew by motion of vessel that sail have be put on so be on way to genoese prison francisco matteo said have narrow escape of before time suppose be fate there be certainly hope of rescue matteo be too early a yet to say whether there be hope of escape prospect looked darker when be in hand of ruggiero managed to get away then be alone closely guarded now have in ship well nigh two hundred friend prisoner like ourselves be true still to be counted on then too genoese be doubt so elated with triumph that be hardly likely to keep very vigilant guard over altogether must say that chance be in favour be sure that pluto be sailing alone must be very confident that might retake probably fifteen captured ship be sailing in company must at once come to aid of comrade here directly saw sign of conflict going on must hardly hope to recapture ship without making noise over must think not matteo agreed then again matteo even if find impossible to get at crew with to recapture ship chance may occur by may manage to make escape if say so francisco at once believe got out of scrape down at girgenti got be daughter out of worse scrape when be captive on san nicolo got out of worst scrape of when escaped from grip of ruggiero mocenigo therefore when say that there be fair chance of escape out of business look upon a almost a good a done be long way from matteo francis laughed still hope may manage somehow have greatest horror of genoese prison for be notorious that treat prisoner of war shamefully certainly mean to enter one if there be slightest chance of avoiding for today matteo will not even begin to think about in first place head ache with various thump have have in second feel weak from loss of blood in third wound smart most amazingly so do mine matteo agreed in addition be hungry for bread gave morning be not fit for dog although have to eat a be that nothing now matteo will try to get few hour sleep did not close eye last night from pain of wound think might manage to drop off now motion of vessel aided effect of bodily weakness that francis be feeling in spite of pain of wound soon went off into sound sleep once twice woke hearing voice movement supposed companion be asleep again went off until stream of light coming in from opening of hatchway thoroughly roused matteo who be lying by side also woke stretched there be general movement among ten young men who be comrade in misfortune here be breakfast voice from above hatchway said basket containing bread bucket of water be lowered by rope breakfast matteo said why be not two hour since breakfasted last suspect be twenty two matteo have have very long sleep feel better of now let divide liberal breakfast captor have given fortunately there be just enough light coming down from scuttle to enable to do so fairly there be general laugh from comrade at cheerful way in francis spoke only one of have be officer on pluto rest be like matteo volunteer of good family there be good deal of light hearted jesting over meal when be over francis said now let hold council of war be better off than pisani be anyhow one of young men said for be not hampered with proveditors anything that captaincy may suggest will may be sure receive assent be captain no longer francis replied be prisoner now equal one have free voice free vote then give voice vote at once francisco matteo said to proposal that remain captain that obey a cheerfully willingly a must if be on poop of pluto instead of being in hold in first place at carlo death became captain by right so long a remain together in second place have more experience than of put together very much better head than most of included therefore comrade vote that messer francisco hammond be still regarded a captain obeyed a such there be general chorus of assent for energy francis have displayed throughout trying winter manner in have led crew during desperate fighting have won for regard respect of very well then francis said if wish so will remain leader will nevertheless hold council of war question will first present to consideration be be best way to set about retaking pluto there be burst of laughter among young men matter of fact way in francis proposed what seemed to impossibility amused immensely be quite in earnest francis went on when laughter have subsided if be possibly to be done mean to retake pluto have very little doubt that be possible if set about in right way in first place may take a absolutely certain that very considerably outnumber genoese on board must have suffered in battle almost a much a did have have nearly a many killed wounded in second place if doria intends to profit by victory must have retained fair amount of fighting men on board of galley weakened a force be by loss of action can spare comparatively small force on board of fifteen captured galley must think probable that there be not more than fifty men in charge of pluto number fully three time force mere fact that let down food to by rope instead of bringing down showed consciousness of weakness what say be quite true paolo parucchi other officer of pluto said be fifty well armed men be hundred fifty without arm shut down in hold to must be added fact that be cut off from men men from be a be without head to plan while be without arm to strike murmur of approval be heard among of young men suppose that there be difficulty in way francis said quietly that have only next time hatch be opened to say to above 'gentlemen of genoa be more numerous than be therefore request to change place with immediately ' have asserted so far be that be sufficiently strong to retake ship if get opportunity what have now to settle be how opportunity be to come about to begin with have anyone dagger knife have escaped eye of searcher one replied be afraid that nothing have escaped vigilance of who appropriated belonging a however have weapon tool next thing be to see what there be in hold can be turned to account be fortunate be on board pluto instead of being transferred to ship a already know about there be iron bolt driven in along beam at farther end have be used suppose at time other for hanging carcass of animal from let see whether there be chance of getting of out iron peg however be so firmly driven into beam that effort failed to move in slightest will give up for present francis said look round for something more available with exception of water cask closest search failed to find anything in hold know whether iron hoop of cask must be of use matteo said certainly must be of use if get off matteo there be difficulty about one of others said examining cask closely be empty one hoop seem quite loose in few minute four iron hoop be taken off cask after matteo said can not be of much use iron be rust eaten must break in hand before going into one must certainly be useless a dagger matteo think that with care will act a saw break off length of about foot now straighten tear piece off doublet wrap round round one end so that can hold now just try on edge of beam certainly cut matteo announced after trial not very fast so that cut at may be very well content francis said cheerfully have got week at least to work in if wind be not favourable may have month let therefore break hoop up into piece of right length must use carefully for may expect to have many breakage what next captain object will of course be to cut through into main hold separate from crew there will probably find plenty of weapon to use saw must first find hole in bulkhead first of then let there be strict search made for knothole other hole through bulkhead be too dark for eye to be of much use hand be run all over bulkhead hole however small be discovered be clear then francis said that first thing to do be to cut out of iron bolt pick out be nearest to lower side of beam say three of there be twelve of will give four to bolt can relieve other few minute remember be patience be required not strength work be at once begun young men have by time fully entered into spirit of attempt quiet businesslike way in leader set about convinced that at least have firm belief that work be possible there be hope even if remote one of avoiding dreaded dungeon of genoa work be slow two three of strip of iron be at first broken by too great eagerness of holder when be found that by using lightly edge gradually cut way into wood work went on regularly pluto have be hurriedly constructed timber be available in emergency be utilized consequently much soft wood at other time must never have be found in state dockyard be put into beam at be working be of soft timber fine dust fell steadily a rough iron be sawed backward forward upon two cut be made under bolt wide at base converging towards saw be kept going whole day although progress be slow be fast enough to encourage just a light came through scuttle faded away three of young men hung weight upon one of bolt wood beneath already almost severed gave suppressed cry of satisfaction announced that one bolt be free piece of iron be two foot long be intended for other purpose have be driven in when on loading ship strong peg on to hang carcass be required be driven about three inch into beam must have be cut out with ordinary saw in two three minute try others francis said a many of get hold of a can put hand on effort be made other two bolt be got out have be roughly sharpened at end be fully inch across make bad weapon matteo said be not a weapon that want matteo will be more useful to than weapon except indeed good axe will want at least three more therefore propose that continue work at once will divide into watch now will be twelve hour before get allowance of bread again therefore that will give three hour work nine hour sleep to will be just setting first watch on deck a will hear changed will give good idea how time be passing be ready to work night matteo said at first have not much faith in what be doing now that have got three of iron out be ready to go on working until drop will find matteo that arm will ache so that can not hold up before end of three hour sawing like with arm above head be most fatiguing even short spell of work have be having made arm ache however must do a much a can in three hour a be working in dark must work slowly carefully will break tool fortunately can get more hoop off now if want matteo said with iron can wrench off sound cask if necessary yes did not think of matteo see be already getting stock of tool thing be with point of iron have got off can wrench wood out a fast a saw saw will not work so stiffly a did before must not do till morning for sound like breaking of wood might be heard by watch when everything be quiet although worked best made slight progress in dark worker be forced to take frequent rest for fatigue of working with arm above head be excessive a soon however a light began to steal down movement above head told that crew be at work washing deck point of iron be used to wrench away wood between saw cut work then proceeded briskly a relieved other few minute at last to intense satisfaction three more iron be got out if anyone have told one of party said that man arm must hurt a much a mine do from working few hour must have disbelieved there be chorus of assent for none be accustomed to hard manual labour pain in arm be excessive let have hour rest francis before issue next order will want at least before feel have power in arm at will have hour rest matteo if like before time will be sending down food after have breakfasted can set to work again breakfast one of young men groaned can not call that black bread water breakfast when think of breakfast have eaten when think of dish have refused to eat because be not cooked to perfection groan over folly in day enormous stupidity in ever volunteering to come to sea must recommend francis said to spend next hour in rubbing squeezing muscle of neighbour arm shoulder be best way for taking out stiffness giuseppi used to give relief way when be stiff with fencing idea be adopted while rest be at work in manner suggested francis taking one of iron went to bulkhead one by one tried plank from floor board to beam above well captain what be report matteo asked a joined rest report be most favourable one francis said by great good luck plank be nailed from other side against beam above below what difference doe that make francisco difference in world have be nailed on side there must have be nothing for to carry out original plan be to make hole through plank with iron large enough for saw to go through then to saw wood out from hole to hole a be believe that with five minute work must wrench plank away have only to push point of iron up between beam plank use a lever nail will be strong indeed if iron with two of at must not wrench out young men leapt to foot pain ache quite forgotten in excitement of unexpected news six of seized hold of iron gently francis said must remember there may be people going down there at present getting up store before venture to disturb plank must make hole sufficiently large for to spy through will be very easy affair in comparison with making hole large enough for saw to go through still will find will take time however have better wait a agreed till have have food chapter recapture of pluto a soon a hatch have be removed bread water lowered down heard heavy weight again laid on hatch two of party took one of iron began to bore hole while others proceeded to eat food several time worker have to be relieved iron penetrated comparatively easily for short distance beyond that difficulty greatly increased be fully four hour before one of worker applying eye to hole said that must see gleam of light through in quarter of hour orifice be sufficiently enlarged to enable view to be obtained of central hold be comparatively light there for hatch be off must see two men at work opening cask for store be required must wait till get dark now francis said think that will make much noise for nail will be likely to draw quietly have better choose time between hour for crew to turn in a there will be trampling of foot on deck talking singing must prevent slight noise might make being heard difficulty will be to force end of iron down between beam plank so a to give purchase matteo said think will be able to manage francis replied beam be put in in rough if hunt carefully think will find plank where can get iron in far enough between beam to give hold after careful examination fixed upon plank to operate upon leaving one of iron there so that must find in dark lay down to sleep sat talking until be dark before glance through peephole showed that hatch have be placed over hatchway of next hold so that there be little fear of anyone coming down unless something special be required now think can begin francis said at last do paolo parucchi take one of iron will take matteo third can not possibly work more than three at foot of plank though perhaps when have fixed put on strain two three more hand may get at iron first will try with three unless nail have got wonderfully firm hold will certainly be able to draw took time to fix iron to best advantage between plank beam be ready francis asked at last then pull a francis have anticipated lever did work nail yielded little have sprung inch francis said feeling now keep iron a be while thrust mine down farther have got fresh hold do shift yours again effort be made time nail drew fully two inch effort plank be completely free at lower end now do push against a hard a can francis said while get iron in between beam above upper nail yielded even more easily than below farther francis said when have fairly started plank will be falling with crash must push from bottom now until give sufficiently far for to get iron down side to prevent closing again now said push iron higher up be right now will loosen bit farther at top then will be able to get hand in at bottom to steady prevent falling when nail be quite drawn effort plank be free being drawn in be laid down delight of who be standing in dark must only judge how matter be going on from francis low spoken order be extreme can get through francis replied will be necessary to remove plank first perhaps one of slighter among might manage to squeeze through hold plank at back will be able to work with more freedom if know that there be danger of falling in few minute second plank be laid beside first what be to be done next matteo asked must establish communication with sailor will take working party of four paolo parucchi with four others will relieve matteo will with rest take last spell when have entered next compartment will put up plank again press nail in tightly enough to prevent falling must by chance anyone descend into hold while be working will be hidden from view at other end there be number of sack piled up will be working behind francis men have chosen made way to pile of arm have observed through peephole moving with great precaution so a to avoid falling over anything here with trouble succeeded in finding dagger among heap then felt way on until reached pile of sack be packed to within foot of deck beam there be just room for to crawl in at top whatever do bump against beam francis said noise of sort from below must at once excite attention now do be quiet while find spot to begin upon commencing at junction of two plank francis began with dagger to cut hole of three four inch across tapering rapidly a went in after waiting for ten minute touched man lying next to placed hand on hole have begun then moved aside to allow to continue work in hour hole be made in two inch plank be soon enlarged until be inch in diameter lying along side of bulkhead so a to get ear to hole francis listened must hear sound within then put mouth to orifice asked be asleep there then listened again of men be speaking asking other who be that have suddenly spoken one replied of gave vent to angry threat against whoever might be who have just disturbed from going off to sleep directly voice ceased again francis said let have silence in there where be rinaldo boatswain be here voice replied who be speaking sound like voice of messer hammond be voice rinaldo have worked through from hold at other end of ship having removed of plank of bulkhead now be for to do same will pas dagger through when have made hole bit larger must choose one of plank in corner a will be le likely to be observed will not observe messer hammond never come down here at pas food down in bucket nevertheless begin at plank next to side francis said possibly someone may come down before have finished will have to remove two plank to get through will pas javelin through can set to work with bore hole through plank close to floor then with dagger cut away wood between when have done set to at top close to beam cut two plank through there there be sack of grain piled up against on side so that there be fear of being observed from here work must be carried on perfectly noiselessly men relieving other few minute when plank be cut through replace in former position wedge small piece of wood in so that there will be chance of falling ought to finish work by tomorrow when have done take farther step until get order from must not do to rise now for may be surrounded by other ship if overpowered crew must at once be attacked recaptured by will therefore remain quiet until have order whether be one day ten arm have taken from be lying piled here when time come will have difficulty in overpowering genoese will hope bring pluto safely to anchor in port of venice before long there be murmur of delight among sailor pent up in close quarter francis listened moment heard one of men say what did tell did tell that messer hammond got out of scrape before when ship be captured by genoese must be bound must do same again if have shadow of chance did pietro have turned out right be sort of fellow to have for captain be not like one of dainty young noble who know one rope end from who turn up nose at thought of dirtying hand see how looked after through winter wish must give cheer for must never do when be out of will give loudest shout ever gave yet now then rinaldo let set to work without moment delay there be chance be going to rot in dungeon of genoa after convinced that work must be carried on in accordance with order francis withdrew ear from hole crawling over sack again made way to pile of arm felt about until found two javelin taking back passed one after other through hole have done share now said to comrade paolo party will find comparatively easy task to enlarge hole sufficiently to pas dagger through party returned to other end of hold removed plank joined friend next watch have arranged to lie down close to plank so that must be aroused without waking others be soon on foot francis explained to parucchi progress have made order have be given to sailor a to what be to do when hole be large enough pas five dagger in to crew then come back again will guide to spot on return will pick out dozen more dagger in case want for further work when daylight made way into hold matteo watch woke be astonished to find that comrade be quietly asleep that have not be awakened matteo must not restrain curiosity woke francis have anything gone wrong francis be daylight parucchi party a well a yours be asleep while have not be roused everything be going on well matteo did not wake because there be nothing for to do have already passed in knife javelin to sailor be at work cutting through two plank in bulkhead after will be able to meet in next hold arm fall upon genoese when opportunity offer be excellent indeed francis wish have let do share of work did not take more than two hour matteo to make hole big enough to pas javelin through must say parucchi party enlarged sufficiently to hand in dagger in hour so see must have be useless to have aroused le movement make after get quiet at night better how long will sailor be cutting through do think must say must be ready by time matteo certainly will be finished time today then will soon be free matteo exclaimed joyfully will depend matteo must wait till there be good opportunity so that can recapture ship without alarm being given to other vessel be doubt sailing in company with now if have nothing to say will go off to sleep again for there be time for hour two feel a if have not quite finished night rest day pas so slowly here that be a well for to sleep when feel least inclination by way matteo put something into peephole made be possible that might see light through come to examine what be be better to run risk that day captive be far more restless than have be since be taken prisoner at first there have be feeling of depression too great to admit even of conversation with other defeat of fleet danger threatened venice prospect of imprisonment in gloomy dungeon of genoa combined to depress on first day of imprisonment on second success in getting out bolt have cheered have something to look forward to talk about still few of thought that there be real prospect of obtaining freedom now however that success seemed to lie ready to hand now that must that very evening remove sack effect junction with crew arm with weapon lying in sight rush up overpower genoese seemed hard to remain longer in confinement several of urged francis to make attempt night refused reckon only on foe see said danger lie not from from foe can not see must wait for opportunity opportunity may occur one of urged be quite possible francis agreed must special opportunity occur will be none worse for having waited for will always be a open to to make attempt a be tonight might succeed possibly must overpower guard on deck before must give alarm risk be too great to be run until be certain that other way be open to in daylight hatch be open even must free comrade unite for rush unobserved must hardly hope to do must find whole of genoese on deck must not possibly overpower before have time to give alarm to other vessel at night when can unite can not gain deck for hatch be not only closed must almost certainly be fastened so that men must not get down to pilfer among store if can not attack in daytime messer hammond without giving alarm can not attack at at night what be to do be next point to be seen to francis replied must cut either from hold from other way up to deck above may take day to do that matter little have plenty of time for work before reaching difficulty be not in work in doing unobserved be difficult indeed matteo said seeing that genoese sailor be quartered in forecastle above forehold while officer will be in cabin in poop over be so matteo for reason be clear that be not sailor who must cut through plank above there be division in forecastle will be therefore absolutely impossible to cut through into without being perceived long before hole be made of sufficient size to enable to get out here may succeed better for fortunately know exact plan of cabin above can choose spot where must not be likely to be noticed be so matteo agreed a will not have a many officer a have be including volunteer of cabin will not be occupied perhaps by listening to footstep above might find out be vacant thought of matteo doubt whether must be well to rely upon many on board ship wear soft shoe make little noise must be fatal to be to make mistake after thinking over have decided that have best try to cut way up into captain cabin be sure to be occupied messer hammond parucchi said yes will be certainly be occupied affords good opportunity of success a know parucchi carlo bottini have be long time at constantinople eastern port have somewhat luxurious taste do not remember that against stern window have caused to be erected low wide seat running across cabin called divan spent small proportion of time lolling upon if be right height be from ten inch to foot above deck be fully four foot wide must therefore be quite possible to cut through two plank at back without being observed by anyone in cabin there be chorus of assent of course must work most cautiously francis went on wood must be cut out with clean cut with dagger there must be sawing scraping beam be two foot apart must cut through two plank close to in way there will be nail to remove of course will not cut quite through until time arrives for to make attempt just leave enough to hold plank together hour work will get through for if be to cut through at once not only must there be risk of hole being discovered by anyone sweeping cabin must be obliged to remain absolutely silent must be heard immediately can begin at once can not matteo asked anything be better than sitting quietly here certainly matteo if wish two can work at once one on line choose two sharpest edged of dagger be sure to cut clean not to make scraping noise to try to break out piece of wood work must be done in absolute quiet indeed however careful be be possible that slight sound may be heard above if noticed will probably be taken for rat matteo of young men at once fell to work be not until evening of following day cut be made a deep a be considered prudent depth of wood remaining be tested by thrusting point of dagger through be decided that little more than quarter of inch remained upon following day ship anchored remained for two day in port provision be brought on board carried down into hold prisoner have doubt that be in harbour on coast of sicily south of italy have not set sail many hour when motion of ship told that wind be getting up by night vessel be rolling heavily noise made by dashing of water against plank being so great that below must scarcely hear other speak spirit have risen with increase of motion for opportunity for have be waiting be now at hand in gale vessel must keep well apart from other to prevent danger of collision outcry must be drowned by noise of wind water night francis have paid visit to sailor forward to enjoin patience until must give order for making attempt have long since cut through plank be only retained in place by pressure of sack behind have bade be in readiness on first occasion on rough weather might set in knew that must now be expecting signal a soon then a became dark hatch over middle hold be closed plank be removed francis party set to work shifting sack in corner where sailor have cut plank sack be taken up placed against pile further on without slightest noise until at last be removed that stood in way of plank being taken down be carried out into hold francis entered gap sailor have already be informed that occasion have come that be to remain perfectly quiet until bidden to move be prepared said a entered rinaldo do see that men come out one by one a come out weapon will be placed in hand will be then led to starboard side of hold be free from encumbrance will there stand until receives order to move further remember that not slightest noise must be made for if stumbled fell noise be heard above might be thought that of store have shifted from place men must be sent below to secure alarm must be given light other signal shown other ship before must overpower resistance after men be ranged up a have directed will have to remain there for little time while complete arrangement a soon a sailor be armed ready for action francis entered after hold where matteo have be engaged in cutting plank quite through have just completed task when reached have quietly removed two piece of plank francis have already given order to companion knew order in be to ascend dim light streamed down from hole two of comrade lifted francis so that head be above level of hole be enabled to see into cabin so far a must tell be untenanted be possible that commander might be on divan above be not however likely a in gale be now blowing must probably be on deck directing working of ship francis now gave signal others raised still further until be able to get weight upon deck above then crawled along underneath divan lay there quiet until parucchi matteo have reached deck then gave word three rolled out leaped to foot with dagger in hand in readiness to fall upon captain must be on divan a have hoped expected cabin be untenanted other volunteer now joined last giving word to rinaldo who soon passed up followed by crew until cabin be a full a must contain there be now assembled fifty men closely packed together be ample francis said a will be unarmed unprepared can issue out singly until alarm be given then that remain must rush out in body simply knock down with hilt of sword there be occasion to shed blood unless in case of armed resistance remember will have knife in girdle let anyone take by surprise opening door francis walked along passage then through outer door into waist of ship wind be blowing fiercely gale be not so violent a have appeared to when confined below night be dark after week confinement below eye be able easily to make out almost object on deck there be few sailor in waist officer must be on poop such of crew a be not required on duty in forecastle man after man joined until thirty be gathered near bulwark officer on poop caught sight of by light of lantern be suspended there a signal to other vessel what be men doing down there challenged there be occasion for to keep on deck until be summoned do move forward with men here parucchi knock down fellow on deck rush into forecastle overpower there before can get up arm will summon rest in body will overpower officer ran back to cabin door bade men follow a poured out there be scuffle on deck forward officer shouted out again what be going on there what doe mean francis sprang up ladder to poop followed by men before officer standing there understood meaning of sudden rush of men have time to draw sword be knocked down captain three other officer who be standing by helm drew sword rushed forward thinking there be mutiny among crew francis shouted out throw down weapon of have retaken ship resistance be useless will only cost life officer stood stupefied with astonishment then seeing that fully twenty armed men be opposed to threw down sword francis ordered four of sailor to conduct to captain cabin remain in guard over then with rest hurried forward to assist parucchi party work be already done genoese taken completely by surprise have at once surrendered a armed party rushed in forecastle ship be already theirs a soon a prisoner be secured after hatch be thrown off whose turn to crawl up through hole have not yet arrived came up on deck rinaldo francis said a soon a crew have fallen into place send man aloft let suddenly knock out light in lantern can lower down captain from deck of course can rinaldo want lowered down want put suddenly out rinaldo at once sent man up minute later light suddenly disappeared if be seen to lower down francis said to matteo suspicion of who noticed must be at once aroused for only motive for doing so must be concealment whereas now if be missed will be supposed that wind have blown out now have only to lower sail can drop unobserved out of fleet there be sixteen light have just be counting matteo said be probably fourteen galley captured with two galley a guard in case on way must fall in with of ship parucchi will at once muster men see that be armed in readiness for fighting matteo do of friend assist lieutenant in few minute parucchi reported that men be ready for action rinaldo brail up sail so that may drop into rear of squadron watch light of vessel behind steer so that will pas a widely a possible be order men be expecting to receive be surprised when just a last light be abreast of francis gave order for brail to be loosed again signor parucchi do tell off fifty men be going to lay ship alongside vessel recapture will not see until be close on board will suppose be accident when run alongside doubt like pluto have only complement of fifty men will overpower before be prepared to offer resistance doubt have prisoner below immediately have recaptured will return on board with rest leaving with fifty men in charge of a soon a have secured genoese free prisoner there may be in hold will keep close to can hear tell how many there be pluto be now edged away till be close to other ship crew exulting in having turned table on genoese at prospect of recovering of lost galley clustered in waist grasping arm ship be not perceived until be within own length of other then there be sudden hail where be coming to keep away will be into why show light francis shouted back indistinct answer rinaldo pushed down helm minute later pluto ran alongside other vessel dozen hand told off for work sprang into rigging lashed vessel together while francis followed by crew climbed bulwark sprang on to deck of enemy scarce blow be struck genoese astonished at sudden apparition of armed men on deck being entirely unarmed unprepared ran down below shouted surrendered in two minute venetian be master of vessel back to pluto francis shouted vessel will tear side out almost a suddenly a have invaded deck of galley venetian regained own vessel leaving lieutenant with fifty men on board prize lashing be cut pluto helm put up sheered away from prize bulwark be broken splintered where have ground against other vessel in sea rinaldo soon reported that of seam have opened water be coming in set carpenter of hand to work to caulk seam a well a can from inside set gang to work at pump at once be unfortunate that be blowing so hard if wind have gone down instead of rising must have recaptured whole fleet one by one pluto be kept within short distance of captured vessel parucchi presently shouted out that have freed two hundred prisoner arm at once francis shouted back extinguish light board vessel whose light see on starboard bow will take one to port when have captured lower sail of vessel will do same will keep little head sail set so a to keep before wind show more than can help wish rest of fleet to outrun a soon a possible pluto sheered off from prize directed course towards vessel nearest to captured a easily a have done preceding time not only be bulwark stove in chain plate be carried away mainmast no longer supported by shroud fell over side with crash vessel have hundred prisoner on board be wild with astonishment delight when found that vessel have be recaptured francis told to keep by through night a possibly might need assistance for hour gale increased pluto lay head to mast serving a floating anchor a soon a light of genoese squadron disappeared in distance francis hoisted lantern on mainmast a signal to other vessel to keep near a soon a day broke galley have last recaptured be seen mile away while two others must be made out six mile to leeward gale died out soon after daybreak francis at once set crew to work to get mast on board to ship by stump be difficult undertaking for vessel be rolling heavily be first got alongside two rope be passed over be parbuckled on board shear be made of two spar end be placed against stump projected six foot above deck by aid of shear be hoisted erect lashed to stump wedge be driven in to tighten lashing be then firmly stayed by afternoon be in readiness for sail to be hoisted again by time parucchi with vessel have captured be alongside lion of saint mark be hoisted to mainmast of pluto three similar banner be run up by other vessel crew shouting cheering with wild enthusiasm chapter ungrateful republic be glorious francis matteo said to think that must have recaptured four of ship be very good a far a go francis replied might have be great deal better if have be for storm might have picked up one by one vessel took stronger became have calculated upon capturing greater number in such sea think must possibly capture more than did must think not matteo said have never dreamt of doing more than recovering pluto when first talked about that seemed almost like madness think one of have slightest belief in possibility of thing when first proposed thought be to be managed somehow francis said must have be shame indeed if hundred fifty men be to be kept prisoner for fortnight three week by third of number well certainly one must have thought of making attempt if have not proposed francis believe even if be to propose sailing north capturing genoa there be not man on board must follow willingly with firm conviction that must succeed in case matteo francis said laughing be very lucky for be not at out of mind signal now to parucchi to lower boat come on board with men may fall in yet with genoese squadron may a well have full complement on board especially a parucchi have found two hundred men already on board vessel captured parucchi men soon transferred to pluto four vessel hoisted sail made for south have learned from captive that squadron have already passed through strait of messina that be at messina have stopped taken in provision two day before indeed when late in afternoon sky cleared sun shone out saw mountain of calabria on left learning from captive that genoese vessel have be seen in strait a passed through francis did not hesitate to order course to be shaped for strait instead of sailing round sicily a must have done have there be chance of falling in with hostile squadron in passing between island mainland must like to have seen face of commander of genoese squadron morning matteo said when discovered that four of vessel be missing can hardly have supposed that be lost for although wind be strong blew nearly dead aft there be nothing of gale to endanger well handled ship almost wonder that did not send back two fully manned galley have with to search for perhaps did francis said must have be hundred mile further north by daybreak must have taken couple of day to get back to where be lying hostile sail be seen during voyage back to venice francis remained in command of little squadron for captain many of superior officer have be transferred to galley of officer in command of squadron francis happened to be only second officer on board of four ship great care be observed when approached venice a for aught knew doria squadron might be blockading port genoese fleet however be still cruising on coast of dalmatia capturing port after port of venetian possession there four vessel passed through channel of lido with colour flying when first observed from watchtower of venice be supposed to form part of squadron of zeno a soon a cast anchor news spread that be four of pisani galley have be recaptured from genoese delight of population be immense ship be speedily surrounded by fleet of boat containing relative friend of taken prisoner at battle of polo deck be crowded with person inquiring after friend embracing with delight whom have hour before believed to be either dead immured in dungeon of genoa one of first to appear be polani who have early received news by swift boat from one of ship in port that pluto be one of vessel entering harbour what miracle be francis asked a warmly embraced young friend not miracle at messer polani genoese fancied that guard of fifty men be amply sufficient to keep hundred fifty venetian captive taught mistake be matteo put in a shook hand with kinsman have more idea of escaping than have of flying whole thing be entirely work of francisco here might have be sure genoese must not keep long francisco polani said girl might have spared pain of fretting for how did come about if will take to piazza in gondola will tell about on way francis replied for absurd a seems be senior officer of squadron must suppose report to council what have happened take too kinsman matteo said know francisco so well that be quite sure that of will never tell fact of affair will simply say that broke out avoiding mention of share in how be that under order recaptured other ship think that very good plan matteo so do come with will tell about instead of hearing from francis will take care council know truth of matter admiral got safely back hope francis asked saw that galley with five others broke through genoese fleet got safely away of course knew not whether brave admiral be hurt arrived here safely polani replied knowing venetian a do will be scarcely surprised to hear that have be sentenced to six month imprisonment for losing battle be shameful francis exclaimed indignantly heard from captain who be present at council that pisani be opposed to fighting that be only overruled by proveditors be shameful will go on shore make report then will come back to for swear that not blow will strike on behalf of republic a long a pisani be in prison be bad business lad polani said know that pisani popular a be with people have few friend among noble be jealous of fame popularity to say truth have often irritated by bluntness disregard for opinion rank consequently seized upon defeat a occasion for accusing be even question in council of taking life may be considered fortunate in getting off with sentence of six month imprisonment think will have to remain very long in confinement may expect genoese fleet here in few day for paduan army be already moving a heard last night doubt be going to cooperate with fleet once danger press populace will demand pisani release there have already be demonstration shout of 'viva pisani ' have be raised in piazza at rate francis let advise most strongly not to suffer expression of feeling concerning to escape before council need scarcely say must do good to admiral must set whole of enemy against be affair of yours if governor of venice behave ungratefully to one who deserves well at hand have made more than enough enemy by mingling in affair without drawing upon more foe by championship of pisani will of course follow counsel francis said will certainly serve state more until pisani be freed several of councillor be already assembled on hearing strange news that four of ship have be captured by genoese have entered port francis on announcing errand be at once shown in to polani accompanied explaining presence to council by saying have ventured signor to accompany young friend here in order may give much further detail of affair in have be engaged than be likely to hear from own lip have just come on shore from ship pluto have heard story from kinsman matteo giustiniani have surely seen young gentleman before messer polani one of council said have signor polani replied may remember that greatly distinguished at fight of antium be sent home by admiral with despatch have honour of receiving from thanks of republic gift of citizenship remember now councillor said murmur of assent from others showed that also recalled circumstance be again bearer of despatch from officer in command of little squadron a seems have just by miracle entered port how be that officer did not present in person before officer have presented polani said messer hammond be in command of four ship have just arrived not only be in command by virtue of senior rank be to that recapture from genoese be entirely due there be murmur of incredulity from circle of councillor polani went on quietly may seem well nigh impossible to signor what say be strictly true if messer hammond will first relate to broad fact of recapture of ship will furnish with such detail a may omit francis then briefly related event have led to capture of four galley explained that by death of captain a second officer succeeded to command of pluto afterwards being captured by genoese signor parucchi sole other surviving officer ten gentleman belonging to noble family serving a volunteer on board pluto be confined in one hold of ship on voyage a prize to genoa crew being shut up in other that by working at night have effected junction with crew choosing stormy night when noise might be made must not be heard on board ship made way up to deck above through hole have cut in plank overpowered genoese almost without resistance that have then in darkness ran alongside of ship captured with equal ease parucchi with portion of crew of pluto venetian prisoner on board that ship have retaken third while pluto have captured fourth may seem to signor francis concluded that might in same way have recaptured rest of ship be bitter disappointment to that failed to do so storm be so high sea so rough that be only with greatest danger difficulty that ship must lie alongside other bulwark of four vessel be greatly damaged pluto lost foremast while alongside last ship captured a storm be increasing rather than abating be to great chagrin obliged to let rest escape since in striving for more might have lost not only life vessel have taken be indeed most notable achievement messer hammond restoration of four ship crew at present moment be of great importance to republic threatened a be with invasion by land sea now messer polani if will give full detail of spoke will be glad polani then related to council full story of mean by crew of pluto have gained liberty showing how recapture be entirely due to initiative of francis to ingenuity with overcame difficulty ended by saying kinsman matteo said must doubt whether account be not tinged by friendship partiality for messer hammond signor parucchi gentleman who be confined with in hold can substantiate account that have given said that parucchi evidence must be more valuable since other officer be in first place much prejudiced against messer hammond deeming indignity one so young foreigner by birth must be appointed to command over head of others venetian born of good family senior in age circumstance have related to have however completely altered opinion be a enthusiastic with respect to messer hammond conduct a be kinsman on board ship remember now one of council said that have letter from admiral in spring that when describing how terribly crew have be diminished weakened by severity of winter said that sole exception be pluto whose crew be kept up to full strength in excellent health owing entirely to care attention that messer officer second in command have bestowed upon thanks messer polani president of council said for light have thrown on matter messer hammond be difficult to overestimate service that have rendered to state will at early day decide in what manner most fitly to reward in meantime will remain in command of squadron have brought in francis returned thanks for promise of president expressed desire to resign command of squadron at once be in business said with messer polani although for short time abandoned commerce in order to sail under admiral pisani now from various reason desire a soon a successor be appointed to return to work with signor polani desire to recommend warmly to excellency signor parucchi who be except sole remaining officer of pluto seconded most admirably in enterprise commanded at recapture of one of ship gentleman volunteer also worked with greatest energy spirit matteo giustiniani have be acting a third officer to also thanks of republic be due on leaving ship messer polani have despatched boat to carry to house news that francis have returned when came back from palace found giulia anxiously expecting few minute later matteo arrived with brother rufino maria latter be far more effusive in greeting of francis than giulia have be matteo have be telling about francis that everyone else owed escape from dungeon of genoa entirely to cleverness not so much to cleverness maria matteo corrected although be wonderful in inventing thing to energy determination steadfastness there be not one of regarded visit to dungeon of genoa a foregone conclusion when francis spoke of recapturing pluto a if be easiest most natural thing in world be a much a must to laugh in face however set about a quietly calmly a if be carrying on regular work of ship gradually caught of spirit when began to see that there be method in madness did best to carry out order be wonderful maria said do know francisco that when first knew after have rescued from attack on canal absolutely thought that though be brave straightforward honourable yet that by side of own people of age be rather stupid ever since then have be learning how mistaken be francis laughed think estimate of be correct enough said see people be often stupid one way sharp matteo will tell be far behind most of in seminary in learning lesson certainly when came to talking bandying joke have chance at suppose that lady have ever spoken to when have be with at entertainment have thought exceptionally stupid be sure be in most thing only suppose have got fair share of common sense habit of thinking for there be cleverness at in anything that matteo be telling of be just same here a be when be in cell near tunis wanted to get out supposed there must be way out if must discover so sat down to think how be to be done of course after trying in mind possible scheme hit upon right one there certainly be nothing clever in have heard nothing about yet giulia said everyone else seems to know how be done matteo do tell giulia maria ordered have lot of question to ask francis by way francis messer polani said will be glad to hear have succeeded in getting home man giuseppi returned two day ago have doubt be somewhere below waiting to see will go see at once francis said hurrying away be indeed glad to know that have rescued maria laughed a door closed behind francis there rufino said turning to pretend sometimes to be jealous of francisco hammond there see just when have said have lot of question to ask five minute after arrival here to greet race away without word directly hears that man giuseppi have returned be quite right maria matteo said indignantly giuseppi must give life for francisco two have be together day for last six seven year doubt faithful fellow be cry with joy now francisco be quite right not to keep waiting for minute perhaps cried for joy too master matteo maria said believe did see tear in eye maria put down to own account must naturally be delighted to know that brother in law be safe sound to say nothing of fact that family must be spared expense of sending thousand ducat so to ransom thousand ducat matteo thousand soldi must more nearly represent value if genoese did know why tell giulia adventure a ordered because giulia must very much rather hear from francisco lip have doubt will be equally glad to tell though certainly be bad hand at recounting own doings however will have pleasure of telling of can fill up detail for afterwards two day later decree be published by council stating that in consideration of very great service rendered to state by francisco hammond citizen of venice in recapturing four galley from genoese council decreed settlement upon for life of pension of three hundred ducat year will not want francisco messer polani said a brought in news for intend at end of trouble to take a partner in business told father must do so have not only proved earnest in business quick at learning full of resource have vastly added to debt of gratitude first caused to make proposition by again saving daughter from falling into hand of enemy told father must regard in light of son do so regard a son of whom have reason to be proud need thanks lad be still will always remain debtor have very much more than fulfilled expectation will be glad to place of burden of business upon shoulder there be matter have long have in mind of will not speak just at present thus then three hundred ducat will receive year from state may not be needed by still be to be congratulated upon grant because being recipient of pension for distinguished service will add to weight influence in city so long a need man can say what may occur in course of year to hinder trade of venice can bestow sum annually upon poor of city thus increase popularity will be happy to do signor francis said although seems to that popularity be of little value in venice have not saved man whom short time since people hailed a father from unmerited disgrace imprisonment have not francisco have saved life may take word for that proposal absolutely made in council for execution of pisani must have be voted have not be for fear of people may be that will yet see that voice of people will bring pisani from prison long before expiration of term of imprisonment popularity be not to be despised for be great power that power may be abused a when one having gained ear of people lead astray for own base end us popularity have gained to attack hurl from power men le eloquent le gifted in art of cajoling people more worthy than used rightly power of swaying influencing people be great one especially valuable in city like venice where private enmity private feud be carried to so great extent already name be in mouth rescue of pisani when sorely beset by enemy have be theme of talk in house feat retrieves to extent misfortune of pola will make name household word in venice immediately after battle of pola venetian have entered into negotiation with hungary to endeavour to detach power from league against demand of king louis be too extravagant to be accepted demanded cession of trieste recognition of suzerainty of crown on part of present doge successor annual tribute of one hundred thousand ducat million of ready money demand be so excessive that even in distress venetian refused to accept hastened on preparation for struggle for life death fortunately genoese continued for three month after success at pola to capture outlying possession of venice instead of striking at capital towards end of july seventeen genoese vessel appeared off pelestrina burned merchant ship lying there spent day in reconnoitring position in taking sounding of willow canal off brondolo then sailed away for dalmatia in le than week six galley again hove in sight

be soon picked up be found to be venetian citizen named savadia who have be captured by enemy have managed to escape be swimming towards land to warn countryman that whole genoese fleet of forty seven sail under pietro doria be close at hand that six ship in offing be simply decoy to tempt venetian to come out give battle giustiniani at once returned to port scarcely have done so than whole genoese fleet made appearance approached passage of lido respite have be afforded have enabled venetian to make preparation genoese found to disappointment that channel of lido malamocco be completely closed up with sunken vessel palisade chain sailed away to seek entry through must strike at venice have same precaution have proved so effective at lido malamocco passage be taken at other channel venice must have defied effort of doria fleet city be situated on group of small island rising in midst of willow basin twenty five mile long five wide separated from sea by long sandbank formed by sediment brought down by river piave adige through sandbank sea have pierced several channel treporti northern of channel contained water only for smallest craft next opening be known a port of lido separated island of san nicolo from malamocco five mile farther on be passage of malamocco between island pelestrina southwest of pelestrina lay brondolo behind stood chioggia twenty mile distant from venice southern point of brondolo be only separated by small channel called canal of lombardy from mainland unfortunately at channel have not be closed preparation have be made for doing so work have be postponed until last moment in order that trading vessel might enter leave harbour chioggians believing that there be sure to be sufficient warning of approach of enemy to enable to close entrance in

to convey giulia maria whose husband have willingly accepted polani offer to endeavour to carry off by sea with giulia in case genoese must enter city merchant made excursion to chioggia with francis to see for how thing be going returned somewhat reassured francis spent much of time at port visiting polani ship talking to sailor expressing to opinion that genoese paduans must never have dared to lay siege to chioggia have not known that pisani be longer in command of venetian force regard present state of affair said over over again a judgment upon city for base ingratitude to brave admiral be convinced that thing will never come right until have again in command of fleet giustiniani be doubt able man what have ever done in comparison to what pisani have accomplished why must place only hope of safety in hand of untried man warrant if pisani be out about must see venice a active a swarm of bee pouring out against aggressor what be being done now preparation be being made of what kind ship be sunk in channel what will be use of if chioggia fall canal to place will be blocked will not prevent genoese from passing in light boat from island to island until enter venice do think ship must be lying idly here if pisani be in command talk to comrade talk to sailor in port talk to on shore when land urge everywhere that cry must be raised for pisani release restoration to command

matter shout for vettore pisani be heard in street others took up cry soon large multitude assembled in piazza with menacing shout demanded that pisani must be freed appointed so serious did tumult become that council be summoned in haste pisani so popular with lower class that called father be viewed with corresponding dislike distrust by noble who be at once jealous of fame superiority be alarmed at popularity must have made have chosen master of state be not therefore until after hour of stormy debate that decided to give in to wish of crowd be continually growing larger more

have always be at variance a to plan of operation a usual differed now lord of padua urged necessity for following up success by instant attack upon venice while doria insisted upon carrying out original plan trusting a much to starvation a to military operation however gradually pushed forward two outpost at poreja malamocco on latter island at distance of three mile from venice erected battery many of whose shot fell at san spirito francis have borne share in event have led to installation of pisani in supreme command have at first instigated sailor of polani to raise cry in street for restoration of admiral have gone about with two three of friend mingling with knot of person urging that only hope of republic lay in energy talent of pisani even matteo have joined although taddeo giustiniani be own uncle a lad said what matter about relationship now what will become of relationship if genoese paduans land here raze city to ground scatter over face of earth when come to question of ordinary command of course must go with family when venice be in danger only one man can save must vote for whoever other may be polani have also exerted great influence possessed among

get up revolution today for have to knock down be one of best sailor venice ever turned out just man for place must rather act a general aide de camp to admiral than have separate command if will allow francis said be still too young to command must be thwarted by rivalry jealousy must therefore far rather act under immediate order if will allow so be then lad come to tomorrow have doubt will have plenty for to do at present can not say what course may adopt for in truth know what position will hold people seem content with having only government of lido for care nothing whether hold that command that of captain general be one to so that can serve republic giustiniani be able man will doubt do business well think so young man broke off when francis shook head indeed sir have erected

three day population be full of ardour enthusiasm crowded to office to register name for service woman brought jewel to be melted down into money vied with other in zeal pisani first task after seeing galley put in hand be to examine defence giustiniani have erected at once pronounced two wooden tower of francis have spoken so disrespectfully to be utterly useless ordered two tall tower of solid masonry to be erected in stead giustiniani be indignant at condemnation of work friend so worked upon mind of who be to carry out work that laid down tool refused to embark upon such useless operation news be brought to pisani by one of friend starting in gondola be soon upon spot wasted time in remonstrating with workman on conduct seizing trowel lifted heavy stone into place shouting let who love saint mark follow example success of appeal be instantaneous workman grasped tool host of volunteer seized stone carried to place when be exhausted fresh workman took place in incredibly short time of four day two castle be finished workman be next set to level paling earthwork from lido to san spirito in course of fortnight lofty massive stone wall be erected by time something like fleet be at

malamocco behind main wall be mercenary eight thousand strong under jacopo cavalli heavy boom be placed across canal by be likely that enemy fleet might advance francis found office under energetic admiral sinecure be kept constantly moving from one point to other to see that be going on well to report progress made work never ceased night day for first week neither francis commander ever went to bed contenting with such chance sleep a must snatch having wasted eight precious day enemy on th of august advanced to attack genoese force under doria brother landed upon san nicolo while paduans attacked san spirito santa marta found besieged in readiness directly alarm be given venetian flocked to threatened point repulsed enemy with slaughter latter then attempted to make junction of force cornaro with galley occupied canal drove back boat in intended to cross defeated attempt doria have felt certain that movement be attempted under cover of night must succeed disappointment be extreme lord of padua be so disgusted that withdrew troop to mainland doria remained before venice until early part of october without making attack indeed defence have long before become so formidable that attack be well nigh hopeless at end of time destroyed work fell back upon chioggia determined to wait there until venice be starved into surrender suffering in city be intense be cut off from access to mainland behind occasionally ship laden with provision from egypt syria managed to evade genoese galley precarious supply however availed little for want of starving city eked out though be by exertion of sailor who occasionally sailed across lagoon landed on mainland cut off supply sent from padua elsewhere to genoese camp price of provision be so enormous that bulk of people be famishing even in house of wealthy pressure be great nobility however did utmost for starving countryman word of pietro mocenigo speaking in name of doge to popular assembly be literally carried into effect let said who be pressed by hunger go to dwelling of patrician there will find friend brother who will divide with last crust so desperate indeed did position become that motion be made by member of council for emigrating from lagoon founding new home in candia negropont proposal be at once negatived venetian declared that sooner than abandon city must bury under ruin so october november passed carlo zeno have not yet arrived by letter have be captured with convoy of provision be learned that have be achieving most triumphant success have swept sea from genoa to constantinople have captured genoese galleon valued at three hundred thousand ducat be at candia intelligence revived hope of venice on th of november luigi moroceni be despatched to order in name of government peremptorily to hasten to rescue of venice almost at same time giovanni barberigo with light craft surprised captured three of enemy vessel killing many of sailor taking hundred fifty prisoner success be not in important raised hope of venetian a being first time have taken offensive pisani have endeavoured to reconnoitre position of enemy have time be sharply repulsed losing ten boat thirty men upon one occasion when doge nephew antonio gradenigo be also killed by enemy in spite of advised government to make great effort to recover chioggia admitted that chance of failure be great still maintained that success be possible be better that venetian must die fighting than by hunger a result of expedition have found that doria have at least thirty thousand men fifty great ship from seven to eight hundred light craft moreover troop be in high spirit well fed well cared for must therefore be man to man more than match for starving soldier of venice nevertheless there be possibility of success a zeno must doubtless arrive by time siege have fairly commenced after much debate council determined that undertaking must be attempted to stir people to utmost exertion senate on st of december published decree that thirty plebeian who must most liberally meet urgent necessity of state by proffer of person estate must after peace be made be raised to rank of nobility summoned to great council that thirty five thousand ducat of gold must be distributed annually among who be not elected heir forever that foreign merchant who must display peculiar zeal for cause of republic must be admitted to full privilege of citizenship that on other hand such venetian a might endeavour to elude participation in common burden hardship must be held by so doing to have forfeited civil right seventy five candidate came forward offered money personal service service of son relative presented galley offered to pay crew immense effort be made by st of december sixty ship four hundred boat of size thirty four war galley be equipped doge although just seventy three year old signified wish to assume supreme command of expedition pisani acting a lieutenant admiral during long week siege continued francis saw little of polanis duty keeping constantly near pisani with whom took such meal a time must afford sleeping in house in readiness for instant service maria have returned to father house for husband be in command of outpost nearest to enemy be therefore constantly away from home maria spirit be higher than ever made light of hardship in way of food bantered francis when came on business engagement affected to treat with extreme respect a trusted lieutenant of pisani giulia too kept up spirit one must have thought listening to lively talk of two girl with father francis that venice be besieged by overwhelming force reduced to direst strait by hunger greater part of polani ship be now in service of state remained be constantly engaged in running across to dalmatian coast bringing in cargo of provision through cordon of genoese galley light gondola after being repaired have be lying for two year under cover in messer polani yard have again be made useful giuseppi have returned to old work powerful oarsman made light boat fly through water a francis carried order of admiral to various post have also be in upon several of reconnoitring expedition in canal leading to chioggia although hotly chased have on occasion left pursuer behind evening before expedition be to start pisani said to think have brought more news with fast little craft of yours than have be able to obtain even at cost of hard fighting good many life wish that must make excursion for tonight find out if can whether enemy have moved position since last time reconnoitred particularly wish to learn if have strong force near outlet of channel of chioggia brondolo canal of lombardy know plan with such host of recruit a will have with be important that there must be failure at first veteran can stand defeat reverse be fatal to young troop heaven know will have enough to bear with wet cold exposure hunger success will be necessary to keep up spirit push adventure too far run risk if can help must not for much that harm befell francis at once accepted commission left admiral in order to make preparation giuseppi said a took place in boat want to find for for service tonight gondolier who be native of chioggia who know foot of country round winding of canal must be intelligent brave for risk will be slight one think know man messer francisco if happens to be away there will be difficulty in finding for there be many fisherman here who escaped before genoese captured chioggia when will see a soon a have landed at messer polani go fetch giuseppi if can find one two old fisherman of chioggia bring also with want to gain a much information a possible regarding country be true that fleet start tomorrow francisco maria asked a entered everyone say so be quite true there will be further change order have be issued may rely upon that be going to sea when will return be matter altogether francis laughed may be week may be three month thought be going to fight genoese galley doe not seem to that week be wanted to do that day to go to chioggia day to fight day to return what can want more than for think that be going to fight genoese galley francis answered certainly will not do so if can help be vastly stronger than be know that need fear for what do mean francisco mean to fight be vastly stronger than be yet fear be not given to speak in riddle have puzzled time well will explain little francis said must remember that be secret not to be whispered to anyone be right maria said love secret especially state secret giulia come sit quite close so that can whisper into ear even wall will not hear now sir explain will explain without telling francis said have not gone to see african lion who be very much stronger fiercer than yet did not fear because have be in cage maria said what have to do with explains whole matter francis said mean to fight genoese fleet if can help be going to try to put in cage then will not be afraid of trifle with sir maria said sternly how can put genoese galley in cage can not put in cage can cage up francis said pisani intention be if possible to close entrance to canal round chioggia thus not only will genoese galley be unable to sally out to attack whole of genoese army will be cooped up will then do to what have be doing to namely starve out capital capital maria said clapping hand pisani be grand man francisco if can do for there be nothing must not do to show gratitude wo find easy besides in game of starving out be likely to win contest will not be even for start on full men strong while people be half starved already regard success a certain francis replied pisani acknowledges chance be very great against still be possible a nothing else seems possible be going to attempt polani looked grave when heard of mission francis be going to undertake giulia bright colour fled at once maria said angrily have right to be always running into danger francisco be not venetian there be reason why must be always running risk greater than most venetian be likely to encounter ought to think of who care for if choose to think of did not volunteer for service francis said be asked by admiral to undertake even have wished must hardly have refused admiral selected not from merit on part because know that boat be one of fastest on lagoon can easily run away from of genoese rowboat particularly ordered to run unnecessary risk be very well maria said know very well that will run risk put in way of danger if there be chance of doing so must tell not to go father can not do maria for service have undertaken be very important one to venice everything depends upon success of pisani attempt undertaken a be against great odds be of utmost importance that there must be no mistake a to position of enemy whether francis be wise not in accepting pisani offer that must act a aide de camp may be doubted now that have undertaken must carry out order especially a be now too late to make other arrangement did draw back if will come into room francisco will give chart of passage around chioggia can study will then better understand information may receive from men be expecting hour later giuseppi arrived with gondolier have spoken of two old fisherman from explanation study of map francis gained exact idea of locality from previous expedition have learned where genoese be generally posted something of strength of force at various point in truth kept careless watch feeling convinced that venetian possessed force capable of attacking that surrender must now be matter of few day only doria took precaution troop be quartered in house of chioggia galley moored alongside quay utmost did be to post small body of men with rowboat at entrance to passage from sea up lagoon to give warning of sudden attempt on part of barberigo with light flotilla to make dash at galley endeavour to burn having obtained information must from old fisherman francis dismissed be evident said to giuseppi that can hardly hope to succeed in passing boat at entrance to canal seaward by going up lagoon only plan can see be for to land on island of pelestrina be held by to carry boat across to embark in malamocco channel in way must be within cordon of boat can row fearlessly out to entrance to chioggia be not likely to be detected if be must make race of to pelestrina gondolier agreed that scheme be practicable francis ordered giuseppi to remove burden bit of wood must be dispensed with from gondola so a to facilitate transport chapter siege of chioggia late in afternoon

just after passed through passage of lido thick mist came on pisani stamped up down deck impatiently if go on will ruin said instead of arriving in proper order at mouth of passage occupying before genoese wake up to sense of danger will get there one by one will take alarm will have whole fleet to deal with will be simply ruin to scheme fortunately however fog speedily lifted vessel closed up together in two hour after starting arrived off entrance to channel pisani anchored until daylight appeared nearly five thousand men be then landed on brondolo shore easily driving back small detachment placed there alarm be soon given genoese poured out in such overwhelming force that venetian be driven in disorder to boat leaving behind six hundred killed drowned prisoner pisani have not supposed that must be able to hold position in front of whole genoese force have succeeded in main object while fighting have be going on on shore party of sailor have managed to moor great ship laden with stone across channel a soon a genoese have driven venetian to boat took possession of vessel finding that be aground set on fire thus unconsciously aiding pisani object for when have burned to water edge sank barberigo with light galley now arrived upon spot emptied load of stone into passage around wreck genoese kept up heavy fire with artillery many of galley be sunk number of venetian drowned killed by shot nevertheless worked on unflinchingly a soon a pile of stone have risen sufficiently for men to stand upon waist deep took place upon packed in order stone comrade handed fixed heavy chain binding whole together work be terribly severe cold be bitter men be badly fed most of altogether unaccustomed to hardship in addition to fire from enemy gun be exposed to rain of arrow at end of two day night be utterly worn out exhausted protested that must do more pisani who have laboured among in thickest of danger strove to keep up spirit by pointing out importance of work requested doge to swear on sword old a be must never return to venice unless chioggia be conquered doge took oath for moment murmuring ceased on night of th channel of chioggia be entirely choked from shore to shore on day corbaro succeeded in sinking two hulk in passage of brondolo doria who have hitherto believed that venetian must attempt nothing serious now perceived for first time object of pisani despatched fourteen great galley to crush corbaro who have with four vessel pisani at once sailed to assistance with ten more ship passage be now so narrow that genoese did not venture to

officer soldier sailor united in demand that must return to venice even pisani felt that enterprise be beyond that men exhausted by cold hunger incessant exertion must no longer resist overwhelming odds brought against still maintained brave front once again cheery word unfeigned good temper example set by aged doge have effect soldier required pledge that if zeno must not be signalled in sight by new year day must raise siege if pisani doge must pledge to people agreed to maintain struggle for intervening forty eight hour pledge be given fight continued thus fate of venice hung in balance if zeno arrived not only must be saved have in power to inflict upon genoa terrible blow must zeno still tarry not only must siege be raised genoese be at liberty to remove dam venetian have placed at cost of suffering blood there must be nothing left for venice to accept term however onerous triumphant foe might dictate term must certainly strip her of possession probably involve even independence

be reduced learned from prisoner have taken that in few day at outside army besieging must cease to exist at daybreak on st men ascended mast of ship gazed over sea in hope of making out long expected sail sea be bare be terrible to see face of venetian gaunt with famine broken down by cold fatigue even most enduring began to despair men spoke more of zeno have be away for month be likely that must

pisani jumped into boat with francis rowed out to ship climbed mast yes there be ship said then after pause fifteen of who be god grant be zeno be question everyone on ship on shore be asking for be known that genoese too be expecting reinforcement wind be scarce strong enough to move through water pisani said let light boat go off to reconnoitre let know best worst if be zeno venice be saved if be genoese who agree with that be better to die fighting than to perish of hunger will go out attack in few minute several fast galley started for fleet be still so far away that vessel must scarcely be made out still le rig nationality must be time before boat must return with news pisani went ashore with doge moved among men exhorting to be steadfast above thing not to give way to panic must newcomer prove to be enemy if be done in order said can not interfere with retreat to venice know how weak be will not venture to attack so large fleet therefore when signal be made that be genoese will fall back in good order to boat take to ship then either return to venice sail out give battle a may be decided boat before starting have be told to hoist white flag must galley be venetian to show signal if be genoese boat be watched from masthead until became speck in distance hour afterwards lookout signalled to on shore that be returning go off again francisco must remain here to keep
