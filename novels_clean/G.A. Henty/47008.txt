before left at sixteen have gained both object of ambition be generally considered that might even win place in first football team in following season must be light for captain said be so fast active that must be more useful than many of fellow who be good deal heavier than be be sorry be not going to return after term time be up have be nearly four year away from people now will be glad to be at

course must not do much way then have be so much on water here that will be much jollier now suppose dont have much to do with chinese work a porter sort of thing otherwise see much of native town be quite separate from british portion be not often that european enter expect that do so even more seldom now for father last letter tell that there be general feeling of disquiet that letter from missionary up country say same thing official at pekin seem to be at uneasy father say that might a well try to drive wooden peg into stone a to get official at pekin to believe anything that dont want to believe be one reason why want to be off a soon a can for if thing look more serious father might write say have better stay here for time to see how matter turn out naturally if there be row must not like to miss must be very hard other said approvingly if there be row be kept out of of course must be soon over chinese must never stand against european troop dont suppose must milton be plucky enough in way be not bit afraid of death uncle say that hears have got end of rifle gunsgood one know not old gimcrack one used to have look how jap thrashed bateman yes be from want of pluck on part of chinese jap be well disciplined while chinese have discipline at besides what be worse have officer worth anything appointment there be given by exam a everyone who be not as know fellow who be awfully good at book may be no good whatever a soldier look at sixth form why among captain monitor how many of must make officer peebles be short sighted johnstone be lame there be not one of who be good at football cricket while many fellow who be not so high must make infinitely better officer well be like with everything in china great thing there be for man to acquire what be called classical stylesomething same know a cicero writes in demosthenes talked roman greek be pretty longheaded never thought of appointing of men a general in field why look at head be choke full of learning well if have lived in china must have be made admiral general just fancy with spectacle skull cap with peacock feather flowing robe peering vaguely about on look out for enemy how can expect fellow to fight who be officered by men of sort army be officered by men who have passed exam yes at rate exam for army be not very difficult there be time for to play a well a work still know uncle think that be about worst way must have be chosen for selection of officer in next war get into there will be end of blunder be likely enough that there will be there be one thing must remember be fortunately fellow who muz at school be not sort of fellow who go in for army examination go into church to bar a master in school thing of sort look at here lot of fellow in cricket football team be intended for army suppose be same in other school a be from that officer be drawn dont say that there maynt be few of what may call grinder still certainly bulk of be not sort of men who must ever set thames on fire if came to only brain work have ever thought of going into army bateman because have line ready cut out for think fellow be fool who want to take up fresh line for instead of taking where be certain if be steady so on to do well in next place when one be only son a be think that even putting aside question of doing well be duty to help a far a can to take burden of work off father shoulder a get on in life there be doubt that be right bateman be way to look at though isnt everyone who have sense to do a have got two elder brother be free to choose own line will if can pas go into army if not will emigrate have got grit muscle enough to do a well a most fellow in way seems to that with good health spirit must not be bad sort of life at if manage to pas may possibly meet out in china day there be row in part of world few year although from description of country campaigning there must be unpleasant work at least must be change interesting experience well milton if be out there will be very likely to meet for force going towards pekin must be sure to pas through tientsin if be case must try to go with a interpreter however hope there wont be row for though in treaty town must doubt be right troop must be certain to lick chinese missionary over country must be certain to have awful time of must be very anxious about because mother sister married missionary be settled long way up country be chinaman going back with yes must be awfully sorry to leave behind have be with a long a can remember uncle only brought over here in order might keep up chinese be sure that must go through fire water for be good thing to have man like for putting aside fact that like tremendously must trust anywhere with for be very strong a showed when attacked two fellow who upset boat soon after came here there be doubt that be plucky expect will be very glad to be home again have got accustomed to european clothes now have doubt that must prefer own then of course family be there in china family tie be very strong family always stick together even to distant relation uncle say that population must be counted by family not by individual of course did not think of such matter before came away say that be like old scotch clan state deal with family not with different member of if man commits crime get away family be held responsible for one of have to suffer penalty pay large money fine be executed must be very rough on family happens to have one scamp among son yes suppose so help to keep straight fellow who committed crime for father of near relation have to suffer must be considered not only a disgrace to family a man altogether accursed beyond pall of pity fate might befall uncle say crime be very rare in china that be very largely due to family tie there be pirate on coast a hear robber on many of river yes uncle say men be fellow who have left native village have banded together so that if be caught be never known to what family belong be beheaded there be end of family never know anything about case chinese be very peaceable lot except that sometimes get tremendously stirred up a in case of taiping insurrection people hear story that foreigner be trying to upset religion to take of land hideous story go about have killed eaten child sacrificed in terrible way then seem to go mad throw down hoe take up sword musket if have blindly fall upon white call foreign devil dont be mistake real meaning of word be ocean devil answer to word pirate european be called so because chinese coast be ravaged sacked burnt by adventurer who first sailed into chinese sea name have be applied to white ever since be same way with name of country by misunderstanding when first have diplomatic relation with word celestial be applied to empire people ever since have believed that be what call country word celestial be applied only to emperor who be viewed almost a god must never dream of applying to country because document said celestial emperor be supposed that kingdom over reigned be called celestial kingdom on contrary call terrestrial kingdom believing a did before have anything to do with foreigner that be in fact only kingdom existing on earth worthy of name can write chinese a well a can talk bateman can write ordinary chinese not language of literati class be entirely different ordinary chinaman have more knowledge of

comfort have indeed received much more than must have done have stayed at home worked for for wage have be a much a four brother must earn together have only sent from here same a did when be at tientsin although have be paid higher then will have much to spend before start in buying present for relative besides have saved half of earnings for have have occasion to spend money here with former saving added to will be richest man in village if be to go back must live comfortably life must never want to do master a long a will keep with will be a long a live ah lo think that when get back ought to take wife will think about chinaman said will think many time before do when man be married be no longer master of own house wife be always good obedient until have son after take much upon if one be to get right woman must be very good be not in china a be here where see great deal of woman before marry in china must have to say to one of old woman who act a intermediary desire wife then go about brings list of several marriageable girl praise up say that be beautiful mild tempered at last choose one on report be not until after one be married that one can find out whether report be true not altogether risk be great be happy contented now must be folly for to risk so much with so small advantage suppose have married before came over here wife must have have to stay with

one sufficiently capable to represent out there will miss lad sorely have always looked forward to being home for holiday have great interest in life doings at school still knew of course that must not last for ever in small way will be wrench losing ah lo will find difficulty in getting anyone to fill place more attentive obliging fellow have never come across will be satisfaction to to know that be with for must trouble arise regard a quite possible will find invaluable only intended when took house to stay here until returned know so many people round here now that will probably stay on found intolerably dull first year now that know neighbour be different if be to leave take house in town must have work of making friend again hope that thing will settle down in china father letter of late have taken rather gloomy view of thing be not by mean given way be more impressed by what say than by what read in paper in last letter say feel a if be living in country subject to earthquake at moment ground might open under foot doe not seem to that official at pekin have idea a to extent of danger most of here believe that be very real happily be strong enough to hold out here till aid must reach will be case in treaty port up country outlook must be terrible emma be greatly troubled a to sister up country although to extent share belief of masterton that chinese official will protect against mob if trouble must begin although dont tell emma so share in belief boxer movement a be called might be easily crushed now if chinese authority chose there be good reason for believing that have secret support of empress men by whom be surrounded if so official throughout country will naturally go with tide a life be thought so little of in china few of must bestir in earnest to protect missionary still le native convert well hope may be wrong can not feel at comfortable in mind a to future knowing father a do can not think that outlook be really serious be almost surprised that letter did not conclude by saying think that have better keep rex for year at school be very glad that did not say so uncle for many reason be sorry to be going back be very sorry to

play trick liked with have made bad mistake be evident that be uncommonly strong fellow have given what deserved must say must be wise for to leave alone in future because if be way of being very quiet gentle might be serious if lost temper with ah lo be quiet good tempered rex said a others went forward one day when couple of bargee upset boat with of fellow in ah lo took one of chucked right out into river never saw fellow so astonished even then must not have said that be out of temper for looked a placid a possible only smiled when fellow stood in river hurled bad language at have be with since be child have never once seen put out about anything from time there be more complaint of ah lo voyage passed a most voyage do pas without particular incident have one gale in china sea serious damage be done except that boat be washed away bulwark stove in rex dick have become great friend by end of voyage have promised to see good deal of other when landed be not sorry however when voyage came to end for rex be looking forward to seeing father mother after long separation dick to reviving very faint recollection of country to making acquaintance of other young fellow of establishment to entering upon serious work went ashore for few hour at hong kong at shanghai be transhipped to comparatively small steamer in made journey to taku a soon a vessel dropped anchor mr bateman came on board have known date at be due have come down by rail on previous day well be grown big fellow exclaimed after first greeting of course knew that must have grown did not expect to see big fellow a be ah ah lo so there be have heard capital account of from brother rex have never failed to give news of in letter wrote a soon a first question have be asked answered on side rex said be dick chamber father have be great chum on voyage be coming out to runcimans house oh yes of course know father very well be glad came out together must have be more pleasant for of one of clerk of house be somewhere about came down here to meet suppose have not yet identified hour later belonging be got on shore short time afterwards train started there be great deal for father son to talk about although journey across low flat country must have be considered very slow in england seemed to pas rapidly be not until next morning that rex have time to talk of anything england to ask about local matter thing be very unsettled said father there be report of massacre of missionary at several place report must be received with great deal of suspicion for be not very much inclined to believe always have to pay so heavily for indulging in freak of sort must hardly think must be so foolish a to repeat see last murder of two german missionary gave germany excuse for seizing port of kiaochow that action have be in respect unfortunate province be considered sort of holy land by chinese have consequently resented seizure of port very bitterly besides naturally seems altogether preposterous price to pay for murder of two foreigner be wholly with there suppose two chinese have be killed in germany what do think german must say if china be to demand a compensation bremerhaven only have to look at in light to see monstrosity of affair why after defeating china taking pekin expending million of money that ally demanded be that five port must be open for commerce yet germany take a own port with surrounding country for death of two missionary still even that gross act of spoliation must one might think hardly excite people to rise against missionary in general can not believe that at worst be anything more than isolated outbreak believe will be very severely punished by authority still may safely be said that there be not englishman alive not even mr hart who really understands chinese who can predict what will do in given circumstance be very like child will bear desperate oppression tyranny with passive submission will then break out furiously at fancied wrong never really get near chinese live in native city live in own settlement draw what labour require from come go again a far a people be concerned way talk manner of life know more of than if native town be situated in moon whole existence differs in almost respect from ours chinaman if be aggrieved by will go to house of man have quarrelled with will cut own throat at door public opinion demand that other man will also cut if man commits crime bolt dont trouble greatly to catch simply inflict punishment due to on nearest relative dont say that system doesnt act well for tie of family be tremendously strong few chinaman indeed must so utterly disgrace a to allow father to be executed in place a to religion can scarcely be said that have except worship of ancestor have superstition real religion look at everything in fact in light differs directly from that in regard chinaman will cheat in bargain if can only laugh if be found out for have shame whatever in conduct considers natural if not meritorious have not slightest fear of death know that have same fatalism a mohammedan practically come to same thing dont know whether have heard in england about boxer yes have heard something about not much sect have existed two hundred year doesnt seem originally to have have very positive aim member performed certain rite certain exercise in secret sort of way fancy be pretty well be known of be really only lately that have become at prominent have gone in for recruiting number to extent whole basis of association have be changed be formerly association apparently without political aim to extent resembling own freemasonry have become active militant in certain sense national movement directed principally against foreigner also against corruption of chinese court terrible condition of people in general in one of early proclamation say whole populace be sunk in wretchedness that official be spoiler of food condition of yamen be unspeakable in market in guild nothing can be done unless official be bribed sort of exaction be made be alike ill gotten wealth be one object right have disappeared from world sin be unnumbered in yamens be of avail to have clear case unless bribe will lose day be unquestionably true after reciting thing proclamation then turn to foreigner say greater calamity have overtaken nation foreigner devil come with teaching convert to christianity roman catholic protestant have become numerous be without human relation being most cunning have attracted greedy covetous a convert to unlimited degree have practised oppression great impulse be given in shan tung in north movement spread like wildfire at first authority at pekin be altogether hostile to seeing increasing power there can be little doubt that empress have secretly encouraged with object doubt of diverting from internal reform to hostility to foreigner on other hand more enlightened of chinese see danger of association several of viceroy have taken measure against general nieh be preparing to attack nine yangtze viceroy be strongly opposed to association at present there have be overt movement seems a said true enough that small mission in interior have be attacked even be unconfirmed cloud may blow over may burst hope that in case will be confined to northern china if extends over whole country there can be little doubt that missionary settlement in china will be wiped out european settlement in mission town will be attacked position become precarious in extreme a long a movement be confined to north will be manageable say that position of european inhabits of pekin will not become one of terrible peril here may get share of trouble pekin be comparatively close to sea although for time movement may have own way will be only repetition of last trouble fleet of allied power must batter down taku fort army march to pekin must have battle two to fight on way must defeat chinese with great slaughter capture pekin force empress to make term will to mind be almost assuredly way thing will go unless empress take firm ground issue proclamation denouncing boxer in strongest term order viceroy general to take prompt energetic step against may tell however that considerable number of british colony here share view believe that thing will die out at rate for present there be nothing to do go on with regular work see what come of work will not be very heavy for trade be nearly at stand still one be getting fresh good up from shanghai so will have easy breaking in to work will give opportunity of looking up few young fellow knew before left there be think only five six who have not be home there be others who being few year older than went home before have since returned there be of course pleasant family here will give opportunity of knowing by having of to dinner night week in way will speedily get to feel at home in place will of course take up to club used to do good deal of drilling with ah lo before went away a must no doubt like to keep up rowing will have plenty of opportunity of doing so on river for next three week rex have very pleasant time spent morning always in father office where be instructed in method of book keeping employed in general work of house of afternoon went with ah lo for ramble in native city for sail on river sometimes played at cricket of evening either dined at home at other house at end of three week have made acquaintance of almost british family in settlement dick chamber be generally at liberty in afternoon shared in amusement stick to amusement rex said father great thing in country be to take to outdoor exercise a much a possible to make life go pleasantly when work be done consider for next two three year will be quite sufficient for to work here from nine till one except on mail day when will find necessary to stick at day more amusement get out of life better will be pleased so rex joined in be going on dick be at once enrolled in volunteer corp have recently be formed of clerk younger member of firm there have become member a soon a there be sign of possible trouble a news from without became daily more serious cricket be given up evening be devoted to drilling shooting latter be specially attended to be evident that so small body of men must have small occasion for manuvres of kind that individual shooting might be of extreme importance dick chamber have be elected captain of corp a have learned work at marlborough be best marksman of year isnt much of place for defence said to rex of course will have troop up from ship at rate five twenty of if shoot straight can do good deal of course head will join if necessary though may not think while to do so now there be doubt that news get worse day that there be large number of boxer over country think chinese general be really a say hostile to of course what doe when time come will depend upon what order get from empress who be in sense unknown quantity in problem if fight boxer shant have to if join will have work cut out for in case of row may take a certain that population of native town will join in partly because like rest of hate partly to get share in loot hear that of trader be getting alarmed be sending good down to port to be shipped back to shanghai by first steamer come along dont think that people be going to do so be sure father will not rex said think there be doubt that will be able to defend with aid of force will send up believe expects that will send troop up from shanghai very shortly thing may hang on a be for time rather calculates that good many of cooly who have be in employ of various house for past ten twelve year will stand by dont think that strong national feeling exists among believe will stick to who have paid treated well dont mean that think that will fight will throw up barricade strengthen godown in way must be of immense use depends from what hear dick said upon whether have family in town have will be obliged to leave own feeling may be otherwise family must be massacred at once of course if man have come from distance with wife child two will probably bring in here born bred here who have lot of relation must have option in matter poor beggar more alarming report from up country continued to arrive greatest anxiety began to prevail a to fate of missionary one morning when rex went in to breakfast found mother in tear father looking very grave what be matter asked there be report in town that there have be riot at chafui mission house have be attacked certainly of missionary have be killed others be said be taken to governor yamen have be fate one know be certain that what troop there be in town did not in way interfere with boxer whether governor have power will to resist be not known robson have right to keep wife girl there wrote again again begging to send down here be one of most obstinate men ever knew if liked to risk martyrdom of course be at liberty to do so have right to expose to such fate however be useless to talk of now be maddening to think that kate two girl must be in power of fiendish scoundrel can nothing be done what can be done mr bateman said bitterly will be a much a be able to do to hold own here whole country round be in hand be very doubtful whether admiral seymour can with man that possibly can be spared fight way to pekin be two hundred mile away certainly force can be spared to rescue people who fall into hand of boxer so far away rex stood in silent consternation have not seen uncle of family since return aunt two girl have be staying week at house before went away be awful said at last uncle must have be mad not to have sent down when trouble began think so too rex a for staying be different have large number of convert there doubt hoped that presence there must be protection see one of principal cause of chinese dislike for be missionary question be religious question a much a political one chinese be in thing very superstitious worship to extent spirit of ancestor for other religion care little there be ill feeling between men of different religion here resistance be offered to spread of buddhism taoist quarrel with who be practically confucian with christianity be different convert come under protection of missionary who have behind european power consequently be to great extent independent of local official feeling have be greatly aggravated by france insisting that bishop must have rank of mandarin be judge over native convert have be great mistake for be paying now believe that own mission have striven hard to avoid giving offence missionary in up country station dress in native costume for chinese regard dress a serious matter while conversation have be going on mr bateman have left room have better sit down eat breakfast rex can give cup of tea must not eat anything now kate be very dear to so be girl be here twice while be away stayed with time for week dont remember much about girl father elder be three year younger than be quite child mabel be two year younger still be growing up very nice girl mr bateman said sadly jenny be now nearly fifteen mabel thirteen of course have not freshness of girl brought up at home spoke to mother when be up here wrote to uncle urging that must go home for couple of year offering to pay expense said that in year must take matter into consideration rex ate few mouthful then went out into courtyard ah lo be sitting there by serious face rex saw that have heard news be terrible business rex began very bad business master be there anything to be done do think chinaman knit eyebrow what must be done asked that dont know be horrible to sit here hing when aunt cousin be if be alive prisoner may be put to horrible torture before be killed ah lo be silent do think must get there try to rescue chinaman eye opened wide do really mean that young master yes see why must not get there right though dont say that must rescue must dress up a villager a boxer if like a speak chinese a well a do dont see why must not make way through must stain skin just little so a to get just right colour shave head put on pigtail many chinese wear spectacle great thing with thick rim villager often wear master though literati who wear eye out in staring at book often do must not go a one of for speak same language well must think that might paint little line in corner of eye so a to make look little up down like chinese eye ah lo have better go alone chinaman said quietly not at rex said aunt cousin be great deal to be nothing to certainly wont let go alone master must never let go ah lo said positively dont suppose must must not know anything about until have gone must leave letter behind telling why have gone be so disguised must pas for chinaman anywhere must say also that know chance of succeeding be not great consider risk of being found out be still le must of course promise to take precaution master must never forgive ah lo said oh yes must must say further have made up mind to go that told that if did not go with must go alone mean to do be month past sixteen now think can take care of though must feel great deal more comfortable having with chapter iii in disguise well what do think of ah lo if have quite made up mind young master will go with ah lo said quietly if return with master will not say much certainly if return will not thank ah lo now let settle at once how will go for hour be of importance do think must be best to go a villager a boxer think a villager master can go from village to village with tale that have be cooly working here now there be trade employment be going to visit family who live near chafui can carry with clothes such a boxer wear either red yellow so that when get to chafui can put on if like of course will take sword long knife have two revolver uncle gave when came away rex said can carry one of a will say that come from tientsin fact that have revolver must excite suspicion if be questioned must easily say that took secretly from employer house when came away from here have got good stock of cartridge of course many of boxer be armed with good rifle must villager be carrying coolie from here might do so number of boxer have be killed near tientsin there must be nothing improbable in statement that a left town have picked up two rifle good many rifle be still lying in suburb where fighting went on if go out there morning might find couple for street be quite deserted then might put in doorway where must find a went along must also have to find packet of cartridge when will start master if can be ready to start to night better there can be difficulty about know many native shop where can get clothes there be plenty of dead boxer from whom must take red suit must not get head shaved here will carry razor soap with in morning first thing will shave head can buy pigtail in town a many people who have not much hair use false pigtail have doubt that plenty of be to be found in empty shop in native town will require to take food with can take enough rice for journey master can get tea anywhere will have to do without anything else that make difference at can do very well on rice can take of condiment use with even if be searched will be a natural a rice be there anything else that can think of master can not think of anything else at present will see again later can then fix on hour for starting during time when danger be at greatest house have never be so silent face of mr bateman so grave wife be absolutely prostrated added to resolution lad have taken at risk might incur aunt cousin must be rescued if be alive when reached chafui be within limit of possibility to do so did not think that journey in really involved risk must find that have be massacred have to return knew how precious life be in eye of parent resolved to take mean possible to avoid risk even if news brought back be of worst must be better for mother than terrible anxiety that be now suffering a to fate of aunt cousin in course of day wrote letter to father ran a follows dear father when receive will be mile away a know a far a talking go can pas anywhere a native a will be thoroughly disguised feel sure that with ah lo must go right through china without being suspected seeing how terribly anxious mother be about safety of aunt girl have made up mind to go to chafui to gather news of be sure that must be better for mother to know even worst than to suffer terrible anxiety think will run risk must tell that though ah lo be going with be very much against will because thought that must blame if thing went wrong be only when told that if did not go with must go alone that consented to accompany be not that thought of danger that feared must be displeased with for undertaking journey without permission dont think must have carried out threat although know language well enough know anything of custom religion felt that must really be hazardous enterprise if ah lo did not go with now however that at last have consented to accompany have fear whatever must have asked permission to undertake expedition be afraid that must refuse felt so sure of being able to accomplish purpose without difficulty decided to go without telling of intention see father be evident that after what be going on white man in china will be in peril for long time to come a be settled that be going to stay here for at rate good many year will have to run risk risk will be greater than be likely to meet with now that be going in disguise be quite prepared for emergency so hope that will not be angry though know will be anxious until return ah los native village be only few mile from chafui story that a there be longer work to be done in tientsin be going for time to see friend be plausible indeed will probably stay there among friend learn have taken place in town so that everything will be easy sailing must not expect back for about month will take ten day to walk to chafui ten day to stay at ah los village get full information ten to return be a near a can tell at present there may be unexpected delay anyhow will not be back in le than month must find that be likely to be much longer away will if possible send one of ah los people down with message to of course father can if think best tell mother where have gone why lead to believe have gone down to coast to make arrangement with ship have arrived with good for to act a interpreter to troop a come up believe that if have never gone to england must not have thought of carrying out plan a one get to think for one when one be at school feel sure that there be scarcely fellow of age there who if have advantage in way of speaking language have must not willingly have undertaken job certainly feel that amount of risk to be run be very small compared with importance of relieving mother mind yours of course though be year since have seen aunt cousin too be very anxious that evening felt even more than before that proposed expedition be excusable for father said be terribly anxious rex mother have be delirious afternoon doctor be feeling very anxious about mind see have gone through strain of last two month blow coming on top of have have very much greater effect than must have have in ordinary circumstance think that if have known for certain that sister girl have be killed shock must have have le disastrous effect than terrible uncertainty may be week may even be month before truth can be known mind relieved of strain fear that when present paroxysm have passed away may settle down into state of fixed melancholia if bad news came then might simply deepen melancholia must in case become permanent be indeed terrible father hope that doctor view be mistaken one mr bateman shook head passed handkerchief across eye if up to time rex have have doubt that be going to act wisely felt now that even apart from own anxiety about aunt cousin be fully justified by mother state in carrying out plan at eleven oclock night crept out of house have dyed skin with mixture ah lo have brought dressed in native clothes put sword knife pistol in belt in bundle have three box of ammunition boxer clothes together with pair of light boot to put on when there be village near in case chinese shoe must gall foot ah lo be at gate of courtyard wore disguise have put on coarse coolie clothes instead of wore a trusted servant in house have got everything ah lo everything ten pound of rice box of clothes ammunition for pistol bottle of dye for skin black dye for eyebrow eyelash little brown for corner of eye have changed piece of gold gave for dollar in cash have got pigtail razor soap have bought small compass rex said may be useful to going across country for know that road be mostly track between village cross other in direction on leaving premise picked up rex rifle bag of ammunition rifle ah lo have bought during day have hidden away outside settlement then made detour to avoid native town when once fairly beyond struck out across field made long detour to avoid encampment of chinese soldier then struck into steady walk when few mile from town saw fire burning made detour to avoid knowing that marked position of party of boxer walked steadily night in morning reached village having made a calculated at least thirty mile few people be about burnt cottage showed that boxer have passed that way a usual have looted destroyed everything must lay hand on indeed not being regularly organized body be forced to depend upon what must take for subsistence be scourge of district through passed so be going to chafui said old man whom have asked if there be boxer in neighbourhood will have to be very careful who have be attacking tientsin be still in neighbourhood may come across other party marching down to join be terrible people if anyone refuse to give that ask for will kill everyone in house burn afterwards make most of young men go with to fight white in tientsin be terrible time can remember taiping rebellion seems to to be quite a bad say that empress be in favour can not believe tell terrible tale about missionary lived for time at chafui seemed to that be good peaceful people although stay so near tientsin have not till of late heard word against merchant there have indeed done much good for town pay who work for well do harm to anyone son of mine worked for for ten year came back with enough money to live comfortably life be good son helped a son must do boxer killed month ago because ventured to say that so far from doing foreigner enriched town brought much trade into will take care to keep mouth shut when get home ah lo said too have worked for found good master just people after what have told will take care not to say word in favour will be wise not to do so now say wish to sleep a have walked night can lie down in room upstairs one will disturb used to be glad to question stranger who came along for further news now own trouble be quite a much a can think of fear that will continue until last of sea pirate be killed after who can say what will happen after cooking rice have bought eating meal went upstairs slept for many hour a soon a night fell continued journey on seventh morning after starting arrived within few mile of chafui have met with adventure on way several time went into field hid among growing grain to avoid party of enemy once just a have arrived in village band of boxer came in managed to slip out of house unobserved spent night in field have agreed that must not enter chafui until have first paid visit to ah los native village where must be able to learn state of thing in town must then decide whether must be best to put on boxer dress not have scarcely entered village when ah lo be recognized a one of old friend shouted name welcome people ran out from house to greet by time reached father door be surrounded by crowd of friend neighbour rex understood for first time how very close be family bond in china be five year since ah lo have be there be greeted a wanderer returning to parent bringing doubt of proceeds of labour indeed villager have already benefited for while be in england regularly forwarded portion of wage to parent thus bore good name have never brought trouble upon village have never be called upon to pay fine for misdeed father mother be considered fortunate people in having son too have come to door attracted by loud talking outside delight at return be touching when at last have entered house closed door old man said have be uneasy about message telling of return welcome present gave at first great joy when two day later disturbance began trembled for safety have offered up many prayer to buddha to preserve for see that thing have gone wrong with last time came be well clad said truly ah lo be making fortune now clothes be of common man have so clad father in order to escape plunder on way with friend here too belongs to white merchant for whom have worked so long like wanted to escape from city where there be such fierce fighting a trade be at stand still have difficulty in getting away be welcome for sake old man said if be friend assuredly be friend also will share with have indeed owe chiefly to have come to stay with for good ah lo father have come to gather news partly on business so pay be still going on a know missionary at chafui be brother of patronat least wife be sister of patron wife news have reached that there be bad doings at chafui consequently wife be greatly disturbed so said that must come here learn truth of report that have heard be true father said boxer came to chafui stirred up people of town ran together attacked praying house people who have taken to strange religion missionary fought hard when attacked house what must handful of follower do against many hundred soldier did not move to help house be taken be killed woman of family be carried to governor yamen be reported that wife have died from grief terror can not say whether be true of daughter have not heard confirmation of worst fear be terrible blow to rex who with difficulty restrained from bursting into tear be bad news indeed ah lo said gravely will be heavy blow to patron wife be sorely grieved a be also shen companion for have seen lady child when have be staying at patron house be good people kindly assuredly never did anyone harm be well spoken of ah los father said one have harm to say of be not until boxer stirred up rabble of town against christian that there be disturbance here be always said that governor be unfavourable to christian a gave cause of complaint thing have always gone on quietly enough a order from pekin always have be that must not be molested for week past have heard report that empress have turned face against that counsellor be of opinion that foreign people must be destroyed driven from country even heard that men be being drilled in pekin people in general did not think much of thing until boxer grew numerous began to create disturbance many of be grieved for white people have shown much kindness have given good medicine to people who be ill in other way have done much good of course when empress counsellor have given word to kill one must venture to withstand boxer rabble of town governor knew will of in high place when word be sent to of what be being done remained in yamen kept soldier quiet so that one dared to lift finger to aid white many tale be told of ill doings how stole little child sacrificed to god for did not believe thing have always heard from that white be good people that treated native well assuredly if have heard of such doings a must not have remained with therefore did not believe tale to disadvantage must only have thrown away life if have ventured to express feeling even in village most people believed tale said be good that foreign devil must be destroyed so now that have come back must not speak in favour of people will assuredly lose life will hold tongue father who be must disobey order of empress nevertheless tell that white people be good have not lived among for nearly four year be good people among one be ill treated beaten put to death none carry weapon everyone respect others although be stranger foreigner one molested went came a chose a to offering sacrifice killing child thing be absurd be anxious to do good to foreigner subscribe great sum to send priest abroad that may teach other people religion story be told about be lie have be told for purpose of rousing ill feeling against be grieved that trouble have come about assuredly be business of mine except in so far a concern friend of patron lady have stayed at house have spoken kindly to have given money must do much for for own sake a well a for of patron who a have always told be best man have ever met see can hing can only grieve over misfortune have befallen of course will say nothing here a to feeling will even join in cry against foreigner have wish to throw away life to bring disgrace death upon mother be right ah lo must assuredly bring terrible misfortune upon be to say word in favour of christian there be many who share feeling dare not open lip too must hide real sentiment order have come that christian must be destroyed order must be obeyed most of young men of village have joined boxer fearing that unless did so evil must befall now tell something about country where have be living about strange people who be not content to live in own island come here to turn mind of people against god to bring trouble on land be there many of very many not so many a there be in china be brave soldier have arm altogether superior to ours that together with way in be trained give great advantage over though can fight well wish to fight be great trader be only when trade be interfered with people ill treated that go to war have enmity against people of other religion time be in england one ever tried to turn from faith one said word against buddha interfered with in way think that religion be right just a believe in ours try to convert others just a buddhist came to china converted large number of people think that be doing good spend much money in trying to do so be strange to that can not leave thing alone be way certainly have ill will towards on account when mother have got meal ready have eaten will tell much about of life led there tale be so long that dare not begin fasting for two three hour ah lo talked with parent then went out into village with rex chatted with villager learned good deal a to state of town arranged to buy vegetable saying that wanted to go in see for have taken place that did not like going in empty handed a might be ill treated by boxer be walking about idly great topic of conversation however be with regard to fighting at tientsin few particular of have be heard villager be astonished when heard that white devil have resisted attack upon have repulsed boxer with great slaughter although latter be doubt much more numerous have succeeded in destroying greater portion of town ah lo however told friend that boxer be still excited must doubt renew attack with greater success although of sailor from ship be coming up to aid white be glad to get away continued for there be always shooting going on feared that if boxer came in must kill who be in employment of white most of men managed to escape before did took opportunity of lull in fighting to escape at night be not until old people have retired for night ah lo rex sat down to talk with other have be long painful day for lad have be compelled to appear at ease to answer innumerable question to support ah lo in various statement when at last found alone with faithful servant exclaimed thank god ah lo can now talk decide what be to be done feel almost mad at news be bad enough to know that aunt have died to think of cousin in hand of fiend be enough to drive out of mind of course must try to rescue how be to be accomplished have not faintest idea at present be quite resolved that if be in way possible must be done be ready to do what can master if be in governor yamen see how can manage to release do there must be way there be always way ah lo if one can hit on suppose governor yamen will be guarded by soldier be certain to be ah lo said must be in ordinary time now watch be probably more strict than ever because although governor have sided with boxer be probable that be still afraid that may attack well to morrow must have good look at place be certain that there be time to be lost for two poor girl may at moment be murdered may take a certain that there be possibility of releasing by force people here be evidently so completely cowed by boxer that must be hopeless to get of to aid in way can hing until see place suppose know yes there be large courtyard in front of with guard house at gate wall run across courtyard just about middle of house in front part be public office in back governor private apartment behind building there be large garden be probable that prisoner be kept at back of house may be so master one can not say be possible that public may be permitted to stare at in case might be in front part of house that doesnt matter much when be in town to morrow will go into courtyard if gate be open public be admitted if not must try other mean to find now from what say must think that be by garden that must effect entrance though there may be sentry in front of house be hardly likely that will be placed in garden if sentry be there ought to have difficulty in settling once into garden ought easily to effect entrance by door window then of course must have to be guided by circumstance for there will doubtless be number of servant sleeping in passage possibly soldier be going to help arent ah lo certainly master have come here to do so life be of little consequence to if be fate to die now must die tell what want done will do thank ah lo knew must rely upon if must manage by must do so certainly will require assistance have to consider not only how to get girl out also how be to escape pursuit of course will need disguise for there be sure to be hot search whole country will be scoured well master may a well sleep now can talk matter over when go to town in morning couple of great basket of vegetable will be ready for in morning will have plenty of time to talk over plan a go along chapter iv rescue hour after dawn started early a be vegetable have be cut packed in three large basket after paying for put strap of basket across forehead started load be fairly heavy although ah lo carried without difficulty rex found strap press very heavily on forehead be thinking over in night master ah lo said when have gone short distance dont call master ah lo know that agreed that must always call shen yo will try to do so well have be thinking over consider that if succeed in getting lady away must at first go north search will be made for chiefly on road to tientsin pekin distance be about same to town will scarcely suspect that have gone north if travel night hide in rice field during day then again travel night must be beyond reach of searcher must then travel round to pekin must think be safer than tientsin where boxer will always be in number of course must have disguise for lady best plan must be to dress a boy chinese woman travel about doing so must at once give rise to suspicion must of course get stain to give proper native colour when have turned face towards pekin must state that be going to enlist in chinese army that have friend in pekin that boy be going with to get work can can account for gun by saying that have obtained from of boxer who have brought from tientsin yes must stick to if can rex agreed a be magazine rifle ought to be match for twenty of villager dozen boxer at rate if worst came to worst must be killed fighting not be put to death by slow torture have be thinking too rex added that best thing to do will be to set house on fire if take in with large can of spirit sprinkle over everything in one of room then spill lot in passage set alight sudden alarm will create such tremendous confusion panic that may be able to seize girl carry off without being noticed must be very good plan ah lo agreed will have to carry heavy sledge hammer with to break in door of prison for be sure to be locked up sentry will probably be stationed at door of course must stab if set fire to house a propose have better carry thick clothes with to throw round a in order to carry off may have to run through flame wrapping will protect besides people wont notice what be carrying will think that be rescuing valuable from flame will be well also if possible to seize porcelain jar other valuable can carry elder girl can take younger on one shoulder carry jar other valuable on other have better have cloak broad hat like of soldier there must be fear in confusion of anyone noticing face really think shen yo that may be able to succeed did not seem possible at first think now that with aid of fire may be successful certainly dont see why shouldnt rex said in such wild confusion a there must be one must notice anyone else great thing be to be quite sure where girl be kept that must find out to day if possible will get rid of vegetable a soon a can then wander about with empty basket on shoulder will then see if people go in out of yamen be most likely that will many will have petition to make complaint to lay before governor perhaps will only go in to stare about possibly little cash may induce one of soldier to point out door of room where girl be confined will be that will want when have found that out will have to buy two suit of clothes for girl two cloak hat like worn by military long length of rope for climbing wall getting down hook of sort for catching top of wall sledge hammer chisel for opening door window bottle holding couple of gallon of spirit can think of anything else must get provision leave at bottom of wall before climb up for must not go anywhere to buy food for first day two after start yes will certainly be good plan when approached chafui overtook other peasant also carrying in vegetable joining entered town together number of boxer in red jacket be in street good many of regular soldier townspeople be moving about be laughing chatting with soldier others moved quietly about evidently feeling by mean sure that boxer must not before left town plunder house rex ah lo be not long in disposing of content of basket moved nearer nearer to yamen a did so getting rid of large number of good within short distance of gate sat down for while near gate of yamen watched people go in out of courtyard then approaching gate laid blanket down short distance from soldier standing at gate entered question be asked crossing courtyard entered house saw two soldier standing at door went up to what do want one of asked can see little white devil have come long way to have look at slipped few coin into man hand cant see man said order of governor be strict wont be here much longer governor expects message from viceroy to morrow then will put end to might just a well have be done at first if have must have be saved trouble of keeping sentry over for past week be serious news have seen required there be door between private apartment public room be closed room occupied by prisoner be next to having ascertained important fact rex follower left house took up basket walked off think be a well a must expect rex said may take for certain that sentry will be placed in private part of house so that if enter on side can make preparation light fire without fear of being disturbed now have better take turn round place behind to choose spot where will climb over see if sentry be placed on side wall be about fourteen foot high there be door at back be quiet there be piece of waste ground behind garden examined door carefully think ah lo said rex will be better to cut round lock if can not force instead of climbing over wall must take time while if door must be opened at once must run straight down garden close door behind make off without moment delay must certainly be much better ah lo agreed must have plenty of time to cut through door after get dark if decide to do that will have to buy saw tool for cutting hole through to thrust must certainly be relief to get rid of rope may a well get other thing at once then can sit down in quiet place eat food talk matter over when ah lo have bought various thing required sat down with back against wall purchase be stowed in bottom of one of basket other being put into so that one might see what be carrying of course said rex when be seated wont be easy job in first place have to make entrance dont think that there will be much difficulty about then see will have to light fire in two room one on side a flame rush out of door must open door of communication probably be fastened with bar there must be sufficient blaze to cause panic among sentry for moment there will doubt be tremendous uproar anyone in passage room will rush out then must seize moment to break in door if sentry must keep place must think be very doubtful must throw upon at once door once open rest will be easy will have to wrap girl in blanket run through fire with critical moment will be at open door must make perfectly sure that two sentry be taken by surprise have hope that place will be burnt down in case be likely enough that will never give captive thought beyond concluding that have be burnt to death think must be good thing to take hanging from of room roll up into bundle soak with spirit then when have taken down bar have door ready for opening will light bundle so that when open door there will be great blaze close to men at same time will see flame from room farther down passage scare be almost certain to make bolt can then break in other door noise will merely sound to a if something on fire have fallen down will have got girl out through door before can open gate of yard call sentry from guard house think ought to go right ah lo agreed now master think will go back again must see father mother tell have to go away on urgent business for hear boxer be coming to village in morning to search for able bodied man that therefore must leave at once what will do can return to back of yamen without passing through town yes then will go with need not bring basket back with can make thing up into bundle must rather walk home with return than hang about here where might be questioned accordingly again took basket on back returned to village hiding parcel before entered hearing news brought several young men who have managed to escape last search of boxer at once made off into country ah lo rex remained with two old people until dusk old people be much distressed to hear that son have to leave so soon promised to pay longer visit a soon a be safe to do so having left sufficient supply of money to last for time took tender farewell of started once more with companion arrived without adventure at back of yamen at once set to work on lock a be now perfectly dark street be already deserted except by party of boxer in hour have cut round lock then found that door be also held by bolt did not take long however to enlarge hole sufficiently for rex to get arm through unfasten bolt now waited until light in house gradually disappeared then moved quietly up to found a hoped must be case that door of house be unfastened having ascertained waited hour until be sure that everyone be asleep then entered lamp that have bought for purpose set to work soon piled mat curtain near door of room on side of passage poured oil spirit over when be done made up roll six foot high six foot long saturating with oil carried to door then set light to great pile of inflammable material in two room flashed up instantly flame came rushing through door when saw that blaze have taken good hold of material set fire to bundle in passage a blazed up removed bar flung door open two sentry gave loud cry a saw flame rushing out at end of passage made simultaneous rush for front door running in rex companion found that door of girl prison be held by bar only undid found to satisfaction that door opened that there be occasion to break down light of flame be amply sufficient to enable to see two girl lay in others arm in one corner be all right girl rex cried be rex have come here to save then lifting girl to foot wrapped blanket round lifted one sprang through flame rising from roll then through sheet of fire at end of passage when reached open air released girl from wrapping snatching up rifle have left leaning against wall outside ran down garden once outside felt that be for present safe already babel of noise be arising from yamenshrieks of woman shout of men illustration rex rescue cousin from boxer hope woman wont be burned rex said if can not get down staircase can jump from window said ah lo thank god girl that have got out have native clothes for must run for little distance first fire will bring town out be dreaming jenny said can be really rex be dear can seize shake to make sure that be awake be strong enough to walk yes if be really awake younger sister however must scarcely stand ah lo caught up at once started jenny pouring question after question into rex ear a hurried along when be two three hundred yard away broke into walk now can go on steadily rex said be absolutely safe till morning by time hope will be good many mile away when have gone mile rex said have better stop here eat something for will want strength for journey how did come to be here rex well dear heard such terrible news of what be going on throughout country ah lo determined to come out in disguise to see if must be of assistance to of course have heard have happened so pain yourselves by talking about at present have got stain for to colour skin dress of chinese boy in must disguise yourselves must not do for to be travelling a girl will try to make way to pekin of course will have difficulty trust that will get through right intend to give out that be going to enlist in army will have to invent story to account for going with have got rifle so that if must be interfered with by small party will be able to give good account of have got out more easily than have expected one be likely to notice that have escaped will have more than enough to do if wish to save house doubt whether will succeed in putting out fire for think set place pretty well alight indeed be already evident that fire have got great hold for from point that have now gained flame must be seen leaping out of window on ground floor at back of house fugitive went almost at run for mile when stopped looked round yamen be in blaze from top to bottom ah lo now set mabel on foot two girl threw into others arm burst into tear now have better eat something rex said after allowed short time to recover did brute feed well have enough to eat till to day have given nothing to day thought that be sign that end have very nearly come doubt be so now in first place must eat drink something dont feel a if wanted anything never mind be absolutely necessary that must eat must get a far away a can before morning unless eat wont be able to walk girl ate slowly at first a appetite came back managed to eat hearty meal while did so rex told about fighting at tientsin way in have made way into yamen set on fire can only just see outline of figure rex jenny said seem to have grown tremendously since saw last yes have grown good deal four year make great difference at age have grown good deal too jenny be quite small girl when saw last how pleased father mother will be to see again did send message jenny for very good reason did not know that be coming stole off quietly in night for be not at sure that must let try if asked permission left letter for saying where have gone that a have ah lo with felt pretty sure that must come out right see speak chinese nearly a well a doe there be real reason why anyone must suspect that be not what looked now dear if have finished will go on went for ten mile before day began to break ah lo carried mabel for last five for girl be weakened by scene have gone through grief at loss of parent fear a to own fate a day approached went into large field of standing corn rose foot above head now girl go on few yard then change clothes here be stain must dye whole skin darken eyebrow eyelash hair know great deal better than do how hair must be plaited into pigtail wound up under hat think will find clothes right be just jacket buttoning up in front loose trouser can put on own boot a long a be walking in open country there be one about when be likely to meet anyone must put on chinese shoe after have dressed yourselves have better lie down have long sleep will keep look out a entered field in single file raised stalk after be not likely that even if owner come along will suspect that anyone be in hiding here before try to go off to sleep have better eat meal be on way to pekin rex have come north so far for if search be made will be in direction of pekin tientsin think at likely however that will trouble to look for will not give thought at first when do think of place will be in such blaze that wont be able to get at room will certainly conclude that have perished in flame only possible ground for suspicion will be that door at end of garden may be found open one may think of going round there for day at worst will fancy that robber broke in there while plundering room accidentally set house on fire at rate long before idea can occur to that be attempt to rescue will be hundred mile away day passed quietly ah lo rex in turn slept watched near edge of corn men must be seen working in of field one approached edge of field in be hidden late in afternoon girl joined looking character so well that even ah lo said that must not have suspected of being anything what seemed hearty meal be then eaten hour after dark started again time making towards east passed through many small village during night walked calculated over twenty mile ah lo a before carrying mabel last seven eight mile again hid during day in evening turned face towards pekin stock of provision be now exhausted next day ah lo went into village brought fresh supply met with adventure until be half way on journey when one evening a be passing through village door of one of house opened three men whose dress showed to be boxer came out hello one of said who be traveller ah lo replied what make travel so late be anxious to push on to next village come in here let have look at one of said will go in master ah lo said in whisper yes have better there be large party of go on girl stop by side of last house in village on right hand side rex lo then followed men into house inside be nine others several of smoking now where be going to demanded boxer who have before spoken who be apparently leader of party be going to enlist in army have better join see have good gun where did get from got from men who be fighting at tientsin returned home wounded well will get others there man said have better hand over to must stop here for night go on with appears to that there be something suspicious about where be two boy who be with have gone on told to two of run after fetch back man said angrily ah lo rex unslung gun from shoulder a if to hand over be still standing in doorway ah lo shoved one of boxer who tried to pas sent staggering backwards captain with exclamation of fury drew sword ah lo dropped rifle against man chest fired others at once sprang to foot dont throw away shot rex exclaimed now be begun must finish shot down man next step back outside door then only one can get at at time rifle rang out again three more of boxer fell others seizing arm rushed in mass towards fire by turn ah lo rex said a fired then drove muzzle of rifle with force into chest of next man coming at man fell a instantaneously a though have be shot two three of boxer be armed with gun attempted to press forward so a to be able to use rex thrust have cleared crowd little back ah lo shot one of men with gun a pressed forward almost at same moment one of others fired ball passed along rex arm came out in shoulder with howl man rushed forward again rex ah lo fired at same moment there be now four boxer left charged before be ready to fire again ah lo clubbed musket rex a before used gun a spear a boxer rushed at with uplifted sword caught full in chest hold door while load ah lo said took couple of second to discharge cartridge reload close breech then rex shot one assailant just when ah lo struck down last man threw down weapon ah los blood be up knowing that none of party must be allowed to get away brought butt of musket down with strength upon man head have be sharp work ah lo rex panted now must be off dont think be killed ah lo said well most of must be certainly none of others can be in position to take up pursuit have better not wait moment will have villager out on so saying started to run will run ah lo said there be fear that villager will come out when hear firing will think that boxer be quarrelling among certainly one will venture out to see about found girl waiting at appointed place gave cry of joy a rex ran up what have happened asked together boxer be nasty be sending two men off to catch so stopped have tough fight none of got away how many be there twelve killed shot eight of ah lo broke skull of two knocked wind out of other two whether killed not know be quite certain that can not be in fit condition to take up pursuit can now go on again only for rest of journey must avoid village neednt grieve for boxer said a girl uttered exclamation of horror at what have said a likely a not have come from chafui if not doubt have taken part in of massacre be making for tientsin to join fellow there oh how must do rex be not sorry for boxer bit be wonderful that two must have killed twelve of in two minute be sure firing did not last longer than that be quick work certainly jenny with breech loader one can fire shot in magazine in le than minute at such close quarter there be possibility of missing one aim if there have be few more of must probably not have succeeded so well for magazine be nearly empty when have finished still holding door a did so that only one man must really get at at once think must have given good account of ourselves even if there have be five six more made unusually long journey night girl must not hear of stopping although rex assured that there be chance of being overtaken when day dawned be more than usually careful in hiding among very high grass rex ah lo took turn to watch day to satisfaction saw one hurrying along road a if carrying message of importance did not expect to see one ah lo said villager will be frightened out of life when venture out in morning see what have happened think likely that will at once bury body for will be afraid must party of boxer come along see what have taken place must plunder burn village kill inhabitant think there be fear that alarm will be given continued journey thus till be within fifteen mile of pekin here road be no longer unfrequented during day band of armed men boxer frequently passing along next day made ten mile then lay down to sleep soon after daybreak native in cart with vegetable grain came along a soon a have passed fugitive issued out presently overtaking one of party journeyed on in company with until reached gate of city wandered about for hour before found quarter where legation be situated for did not like to ask direction a must have shown that be stranger in city came at last to building where two marine be keeping guard from heard that british legation be in next street soon be gladdened by sight of english uniform be stopped by sentry on rex saying in english that be fugitive from one of mission have be destroyed be allowed to enter legation stood in very large enclosure have at one time be palace belonging to member of imperial family garden be charmingly laid out contained several courtyard surrounded by building be conducted by one of servant of legation to house of minister sir claude macdonald upon rex sending in name be at once admitted have made escape sir rex said from chafui where mission have be destroyed save two young lady daughter of missionary in charge murdered be son of mr bateman of tientsin young lady be cousin with aid of faithful chinaman who have for many year be in father service have succeeded in rescuing from hand of boxer congratulate indeed sir considerable number of fugitive have already arrived here will hand lady over at once into charge of lady macdonald who will see that be well cared for rang bell told servant to take girl to lady macdonald then turned again to rex have heard report of massacre at chafui be afraid that have perished will be glad to know how young lady escaped rex gave brief account of incident congratulate most warmly on success of enterprise on courage displayed in undertaking carrying out certainly seemed on face of to be most mad brained attempt have be amply justified by success have attended position here be very precarious although court continue to give assurance of most friendly intention have best ground for believing that empress adviser be bent upon destruction however be making preparation for defence believe that will be able to hold out until assistance arrives what be own intention intention sir be to make way at once down to tientsin parent can not feel most lively anxiety a to safety first duty be to go back to relieve suspense if expedition be sent up here to relief will hope to accompany in capacity can speak chinese like native may be useful a interpreter will of course leave cousin here if will kindly permit to stay for although with chinese follower might make way without difficulty through body of chinese who may be on road must hardly do so if be accompanied by two girl however well might be disguised certainly not envoy said must be quite impossible there be know considerable number of chinese between tientsin have already torn up railway although messenger do get through direct communication be entirely interrupted still a have made journey from chafui here without difficulty must think that might manage to accomplish journey to tientsin safely of course will remain here day two one of member of staff will lend suit of clothes touched bell send mr sandwich here be one of student interpreter said turning again to rex be about own height have doubt that thing will fit well will be glad if will dine with afterwards give more detailed account of adventure in few minute young man made appearance mr sandwich sir claude said will hand over gentleman who have just arrived from chafui to charge will only be staying here for day two for be going to try to make way down to tientsin will be obliged if will lend suit of clothes while stay here certainly will do can to make comfortable must be obliged sir rex said if must allow surgeon to dress arm bullet entered just above wrist ran up to shoulder think wound be going on right be rather painful must be glad to have dressed properly certainly will send doctor to college at once will be there almost a soon a did not tell that have be hit be not serious wound sir bullet only just went under skin fancy that when have once be properly dressed will give more trouble be well disguised sandwich said a left room with rex be sure must not have have suspicion however closely inspected how did manage to get here from chafui speak chinese like native be born in tientsin be sent home to england four year ago a father be most anxious must keep up chinese sent with one of cooly who have always be special servant so came back speaking a well a when went heard that there have be massacre at chafui yes managed with aid of man to rescue two cousin who be daughter of missionary there be just in time for be to have be murdered on following day how be that be not murdered for simple reason be not there when massacre took place news of massacre came to at tientsin set off with man to see if of have survived if possible to rescue effected by setting fire to governor yamen where girl be confined carrying off in confusion ensued only adventure met with on road be that be interfered with by party of dozen boxer have fight with a have breech loader be jammed up in room have difficulty in disposing of by jove be plucky thing sandwich said so be going off again yes be in hurry to get back to people who must be in great anxiety about well be college young man said stopping before building of size be trained here for chinese consulate service will take to room first rig out will be having meal directly then can introduce to fellow when promise hearty reception hour later rex went down in suit of white clothes to dining room have already asked sandwich to hand over ah lo to proper quarter where must get ration lodging be introduced to eight ten young men who be studying at college after meal be over related story of rescue of cousin narrative excited great interest be warmly praised chapter v with seymour column that evening after dinner rex told envoy in full story of adventure chief of two three other legation be present expressed great surprise that mere lad must have carried out so desperate undertaking next morning doctor called to see rex be thinking of going down at once be not yes sir well have come in to tell that cousin can not possibly go with recent experience have be terrible strain on a result of reaction be completely prostrated younger one be very feverish be expect in for sharp illness be very sorry to hear that sir though can not say that be surprised have held on very well be weak when started throughout journey have have chance of picking up strength be afraid that must break down before got here at rate will run down to tientsin to see father mother who be doubt suffering great anxiety will then hope be able to arrange to come back for suppose can see before start certainly shorter visit better may be quite sure that will have attention here dont think there be reason for being uneasy about be natural reaction after strain hope that in fortnight so will be able to travel will go across with to room now rex at once went over have come to say good bye jenny said a entered shaded room in cousin be lying doctor say that wont be fit to travel for fortnight know must run down to see father mother who will by time be in great state of alarm about will be back for hope if come at end of fortnight will find in fit state to go if be not will wait till be good bye dear good bye rex of course ought to go to tientsin will look forward to return thank thousand time for that have done for thank ah lo too mabel be lying with eye half closed cheek flushed with fever rex seeing that be of use trying to rouse to say good bye kissed jenny went quietly out of room will keep clothes until come back again sandwich rex said when be taking leave of friend be perfectly welcome to if dont bring back other laughed have number of suit if trouble come on will not be particular about washing expect will be back before long for if there be row here must like to be in rex ah lo went to railway station in time for train started at ten oclock several merchant others be going down also journey be tedious one for train travelled slowly stopped frequently be just breakfast time next morning when arrived rex walked in unannounced just a father mother be sitting down to breakfast leapt to foot with cry of surprise delight can not blow up now rex father said after first joy of meeting have passed be maddest thing that ever heard of be too glad however at safe return to scold be beginning to lose hope of return thought might get to chafui of course be great satisfaction that have ah lo with when found that everyone have be massacred what prevented from returning at once fact father found that be not all massacred uncle aunt have fallen girl be prisoner in governor yamen be close affair for be to have be given to boxer to be massacred very next day got out however took safely to pekin be at present staying at legation have saved dear girl mother exclaimed be indeed good news where be be at pekin mother bore up splendidly until got there then broke down doctor said that must need careful treatment rest before must be moved so ran down here to tell of safety be going back again in few day to bring home will give full particular when have got into own clothes have breakfast brought good stock of provision with finished last morsel yesterday afternoon have be tremendously long journey a may imagine be pretty peckish before sitting down however will run upstairs change for must have wash before eating will be down again in ten minute soon returned father mother asked question until have finished breakfast except mother asked how have left girl think will be better for rest mother said look fagged be not to be wondered at considering have come through be good deal better than when first saw a soon a breakfast be over before questioned rex further mr bateman sent for ah lo ah lo said when chinaman came in did wrong to aid son to carry out enterprise however a succeeded so well can not blame indeed must thank heartily for having carried rex safely through matter chinaman smiled think be other way mr rex carried through affair always told what to do did just so came out all right well will not forget great service have rendered ah lo bowed went off now then rex give account of doings for at present can not imagine how managed to get girl out from governor yamen took rex more than hour to relate adventure for be very frequently interrupted by exclamation question from father mother be wonderful rescue father said when have brought that part of story to close seems simple enough a tell really can hardly imagine how plan occurred to there girl be shut up in strong house of governor with sentry over guard few yard away be problem might have puzzled sharpest brain be carried out without slightest hitch doe extreme credit rex feel proud of well go on with story there be fresh outburst of surprise when rex related fight with twelve boxer well boy mr bateman said when rex brought story to end after that can be trusted to go anywhere dont think mother will in future feel anything like same anxiety concerning a have experienced time now father how do matter stand here at present thing be quiet good many sailor have come up although large number of rebel be still round town have fear that will be able to take place think fighting will be pretty hard work father if a think there be little doubt boxer attack in earnest be regular chinese troop going to do think envoy still hope that will stand aloof a far a have learned general opinion be just other way empress minister profess that boxer be peaceable people who only desire well for empire have issued few shilly willying edict can be read way be generally believed that boxer have be put in foreground because empress think be more than sufficiently strong to destroy legation kill white native christian in country doesnt want responsibility before european can if chooses disavow action while at same time professing inability to control declaring that a will of people be that white men will henceforth live trade in china must bow to wish many think therefore if boxer can do work alone will be allowed to do if not imperial troop will join be quite certain that enormous number of native christian have be massacred in various part of china have heard that have be murdered in pekin hope that enough troop will be collected to go up before long troop have come in from direction be afraid will be at least couple of month before anything like army can be moved forward from ship now here probably only two thousand men must be spared for purpose doubt whether must be enough father there be horde of chinese between pekin large number of be armed with best rifle have breech loader of sort know must do justice to say that fought bravely enough round here fancy will fight even better to prevent from getting to pekin be by mean certain rex that in first place will not have to fight on for own existence great number of boxer other ruffian throng town if know own business will not be fool enough to allow army to gather here at all a to taku fort believe will be taken just a easily a be last time still larger vessel can not come up river smaller one will probably have to be escorted up by troop will doubtless be opposed fiercely not improbably will be attacked here at same time in case may have to fight hard right father must like better knowing a do how have massacred hundred of missionary family many thousand of native christian will feel real satisfaction in fighting fiend yet rex good deal of allowance must be made for must remember that china have always be exclusive country that chinese appear to have ingrained hatred of foreigner to begin with come here because dont want to buy opium fight compel to open chinese port to trade well chinese be not fool a long a be only question of trade might put up with seeing that obtained a much advantage from trade a do however be not enough invade with vast crowd of missionary who settle in part of country build house church set to work to convert chinese naturally chinese dont like certainly must not like if hundred of chinaman be to settle down in town open joss house hold out sort of advantage to proselyte convert lowest most ignorant class of population to confucianism buddhism be not missionary take convert under protection set up little imperium demand right to judge punish own people generally to set local authority pretty well at defiance catholic bishop have actually insisted upon having title rank power of chinese viceroy thing be odious to mass of people when a at present find whole of european power engaged in general grab of fresh port say thing must stop need not say that hold massacre in abhorrence if have simply brought down missionary to treaty port said to if come outside wall will be at once put to death must say that be acting just a most european power must act in similar circumstance that from own point of view be acting wisely must be necessary of course for to retain ambassador at pekin to protect treaty right to settle dispute might arise beyond must if be emperor of china forbid foreigner from going beyond treaty port must be so strongly fortified that must defy attack of course foreigner might be allowed to enter chinese service if invited to do so drill troop manage dockyard build railway conduct mine to mind game of grab have be going on of late have be shocking russian who stepped in to prevent japanese from obtaining benefit from defeat of china be first to begin by enormous appropriation of territory seized port opposite to german italian french seized port territory can one wonder that china be moved to core that sect of boxer have existed for very long time suddenly became violent political association that empress have gladly availed herself of assistance must be strange indeed if be not so must remember that chinese a race be extremely intelligent owing to denseness of population poverty of people weakly die off in childhood struggle for life be so severe that wit of people become sharpened be cleverest bargainer in world transaction be battle in purchaser seller try to get better of one physically be fine men life being for most part hard have little fear of death when take thing into consideration can see that there be great deal to be said for action of chinese have perpetrated horrible cruelty upon missionary native christian have lived under cruel rgime capital punishment under most atrocious condition be very frequent among have become habituated hardened to must remember that at home a late a reign of queen elizabeth person found begging be executed a mild punishment for first offence have hand ear cut off of course if be attacked will aid in defence although have lost sister in law husband will feel personal animosity towards chinese for consider that have from point of view given ample ground for endeavouring to get rid of well dont think that ever thought of in light father certainly doe seem rough on that must seize port after port on smallest pretext send people interfering with custom religion over country certainly at ordinary time have always seemed to inoffensive set of people placid good tempered make more extraordinary that must go in for such hideous massacre however father whatever excuse have be quite certain that must not let take tientsin if can keep out of will certainly do best mr bateman laughed have doubt that will succeed still may have tough work before have received despatch from macdonald urgently asking that troop must be sent up at once mr bateman said to rex two day after return well father if thing really do look bad must like to go back again told girl must certainly must like to be there on own account if there be fighting probably there will be fighting here also rex yes father there be doubt that will be able to beat off here marine blue jacket will be sent up from ship to take place of who be going forward now besides doubt attack will be made on taku fort know be not formidable dont think however that be anything like so certain that will be able to hold out in pekin legation cover big extent of ground what with boxer lower class of city chinese army there will be tremendous pressure upon now a ah lo managed to get girl away from chafui seems to possible that if worst come to worst may manage to rescue again at rate know must be big comfort to if be there dont know rex father said gravely must be justified in letting go still got so wonderfully out of last business be disposed to let have own way in besides if there be fighting here think probable will of course want to take part in be a likely to be killed here a at pekin a will certainly be comfort to girl to have there will not say no there will however be occasion for to go up with troop possibly on arrival there thing will calm down in case trouble be more likely to begin here by sea think there be scarcely shadow of doubt that taku fort will be bombarded that ship will open passage for gun boat up river have better therefore wait for week at rate by time will hear whether matter have settled down in pekin very well father think there be chance of there be doubt that empress favourite be secretly urging on boxer although will probably begin attack will be joined in end by imperial troop have doubt however that will be able to get there in time see father if take part in defence of pekin legation will be something to talk about life be afraid rex father said with smile although say that be not anxious to be at hand if cousin be in danger must be just a eager to go if be not at pekin at begin to think have made mistake in education must have done better if have kept by sent to college of student interpreter at pekin seems to that be more fitted for profession of knight errant than sober trader oh dont think so father when thing be quiet will be quite content to be quiet to work hard day to take ride sail in evening well will see when matter do settle down rex a have doubt will after time will be quite content if resume trade at treaty port a before hope that result of war will not be further breaking up of china next morning glad news be heard that strong detachment from ship of war be coming up be going to march on pekin admiral seymour be to be in command force must amount to about two thousand be splendid isnt father said rex be capital news boy two thousand men be small body to go through bitterly hostile country defended by army including boxer can not be put at much le than forty thousand men there be doubt that railway will have be greatly damaged by boxer if men trust to will have mean of transport when come to point where line be destroyed will probably be about way between pekin at same time be undoubtedly right that effort must be made countryman can not be allowed to perish if be possible to save know so far be unhurt for telegraph wire be still open to shanghai get message from there contradictory one be true still in spite of varying nature of report there be little doubt up to present time legation be safe be probable indeed that four hundred men who went up to pekin six week ago a guard to legation have so far saved situation chinese a know did in power to prevent from coming fortunately ambassador have by time so fully recognized danger of situation that brought up in spite of chinese minister be small force to resist well armed army vast crowd of boxer rabble of town there must be good number of white men there missionary of city many who have made way in from country station european shopkeeper too such merchant a have not left will between considerably raise fighting force besides told that at rate slight defence have be thrown up when came away doubt have since be increased be fortunate that legation be fairly close to other can probably be connected with other without much difficulty german french japanese pekin hotel make practically one block spanish be short distance away british legation be separated from palace of prince su only by street russian legation lie close to british united state legation russian bank face must fancy that line of defence will include dutch legation be isolated on one side italian on other austrian belgian legation also lie apart close to former be post office custom however be be outside probable line must hope that tartar wall overlook whole be close to united state german legation will also be held be big area for seven eight hundred men to defend be not much larger force held lucknow what can be done in one place can be done in do hope father that will allow to go up with troop if a think be not able to reach pekin must push on in disguise get into town a easily a left dont think there will be least difficulty about be very anxious about girl might if worst came to worst escape with in disguise a did before even if admiral seymour force must fight way into town must think that will be in similar position to in general havelock found when fought way into cawnpore must certainly be able to defend legation against whole chinese force might not be able to cut way out encumbered a must be with mass of native christian who certainly must not be left there to be murdered even putting girl aside must like above thing to take part in defence dont know that must be able to go with troop even if gave leave rex well see must become interpreter will be sure to want men with who know language to question prisoner buy store so on well will think over must speak to mother before settle on question a of course there will be good deal of danger have very little doubt that a soon a troop go up chinese will attack here large number of be in neighbourhood if find can not resist advance of force will close in behind march upon town certainly must not hope to hold native quarter feel sure that must defend settlement still might lose many men there will of course be fear of having to stand long siege for fleet be sure to batter down taku fort gun boat will shortly be sent up river besides troop from india port arthur japanese will soon arrive will doubt come up to succour can quite understand desire to take part in siege to say nothing of idea of getting girl away going up with two thousand men also be very different affair from starting off on own account next morning at breakfast mr bateman said have talked matter over with mother though be very reluctant to part with have given consent a have pointed out to naturally at age want to take part in defence be likely to be historical that must certainly be comfort to cousin might be of vital service have already shown great presence of mind resource have doubt must do so again in case of necessity must promise mr bateman said that will take care of not expose needlessly must remember boy fond a be of cousin be in to be only child for sake must promise not to thrust needlessly into danger will not run risk more than can help mother of course if do get into pekin must take part in defence yes rex of course understand that only beg of not to expose recklessly promise not to do so mother of course will take ah lo with be awfully obliged to for giving consent must be splendid thing to go through siege be not like ordinary siege in ordinary war have attacked perpetrated most horrible massacre over country have lied through thick thin be treacherous cruel brute who will certainly show mercy if capture place so that will feel that be fighting in good cause that men deserve will get tientsin presented busy appearance troop arrived fast by train from coast became known that expedition of two thousand men be going to advance to pekin under command of admiral seymour do think father that must get leave for to accompany expedition must make useful a interpreter be introduced to admiral seymour morning rex idea did occur to then thought well to wait until talked matter over with again must certainly be far le risky to go with troop than to make way up in disguise for by account boxer rough who have joined be clearing out village putting number of people to death so see disguise must not be great protection however will see admiral seymour again afternoon for be supplying good many article require if go with will introduce to will hear what say about admiral seymour be at railway station seeing to detrainment of strong body of marine blue jacket to unloading of store mr bateman waited until be disengaged a be leaving station went up to have sent thing wanted to depot will be willing to send further supply that may require everything in store be entirely at disposal will allow to present son to have only lately returned from most hazardous journey accomplished in disguise went to save two girl cousin of who be sole survivor of mission station at chafui succeeded in rescuing taking to pekin where be obliged to leave a be prostrated by what have gone through be very anxious to return there a speaks chinese perfectly thought perhaps that must be kind enough to allow to accompany expedition in character of interpreter might be useful in questioning prisoner villager must carry arm also for native servant annihilated party of twelve boxer who attacked while be bringing cousin down have already got two three interpreter mr bateman have doubt must do very well with will attach to company of marine blue jacket from centurion thank very much indeed admiral ah here be major johnston who command marine said admiral will put under charge at once major johnston will be glad if will take charge of young gentleman speaks chinese fluently doubt will find very useful a interpreter be most anxious to get up to pekin because two of young lady there be cousin will probably have yarn to tell of how rescued from boxer at chafui will of course attach to mess very well sir will be very glad to have someone with who speaks chinese be pretty sure to get hold of wounded boxer may get valuable information from again thanking admiral rex went off with major whose men be quartered in custom house be soon busy translating order to cooly who be assisting in bringing up case of ammunition other store in couple of hour be quiet father will be very glad sir said to major if will take up abode at house have doubt that officer will be quartered among resident think that can very well house four if dont mind squeezing six seven thank mr bateman dont know whether have be told off to quarter if not will very gladly accept offer rex hurried home father returned with assured officer that must be great pleasure to to have a many officer a house must hold that must very well contrive to take in ten of thank very much mr bateman will take little time to see men properly quartered notice that quantity of straw have be provided for what time do dine will fix dinner hour to suit generally dine at seven will suit very well command two company have six officer whom will bring with will have to take in rough for have only uniform that stand in will dine in shirt sleeve if like major rex returned with father there be for short time bustle in house getting bedroom ready making arrangement for dinner at seven oclock officer arrived be introduced by major johnston to mr mr bateman be merry party for officer be in high spirit at being selected to take part in expedition when heard that rex have only returned from pekin week before asked innumerable question a to country strength of force must be likely to oppose think that will have harder work than expect said considerable portion of railway be certainly pulled up judging by number of fire saw a came down at night enemy must be in very strong force have doubt that will fight hard for boxer believe that be invulnerable will fight with fanatical fury will soon teach that be mistaken a to invulnerability one of officer laughed dont think that number of armed peasant for be what be will stop hope not indeed rex said only say that think will be harder work than expect now mr bateman major said hope that will tell story of rescue of cousin of admiral told have have to tell so many time since came back rex said that really hope will excuse oh be mistaken modesty on part will tell for father said be good story doe boy great credit then will go see if everything be ready outside said rex be hour before returned by time father have finished story officer warmly congratulated when re entered room wish have done one of young lieutenant said must have given anything to have carried out such plan suppose have not be in england at major said for if have be must scarcely have be able to speak chinese so well yes have be four year there mr bateman said sent over with chinese boy who have always be companion rex have two day off school week to go about with so keep up knowledge of language intend to go home in few year time a will then be left in charge be of utmost importance that must keep up chinese latin greek must be of value here so arranged that must only take up english subject english game capital plan mr bateman knowledge of language have already stood in good stead what be latest news have telegram to say that american mission building at tung chau twelve mile from pekin have be abandoned by missionary have be looted burned by chinese soldier sent to protect further that seventy five native christian who have be trained for year by american missionary be massacred there british legation summer residence in hill near pekin have also be burned telegram from shanghai say that there have be fight between general nel hsi chong with three thousand men boxer be reported that general have be superseded for trouble when do leave rest of force will be up to morrow will start on following morning altogether will have nine hundred fifteen british three hundred fifteen german three hundred russian one hundred fifty eight french one hundred four american fifty two japanese forty italian twenty five austrian rather mixed lot mr bateman said be a well that contingent be so strong have not be so admiral seymour might have found difficulty with commander of so many nationality yes be certainly well that constitute nearly forcemore than force if count in american jap on of whom can rely however dont think that there will be trouble with russian german french who wont be able to understand other a be so short march will have opportunity of coming to mutual understanding might even count in two small party of austrian italian a going with chapter vi in pekin be hard at work on following day making preparation for advance rex acted a interpreter to major got on quite familiar term with officer start be made early next morning in four troop train men cheered lustily a started resident of town gathered to give hearty send off rex managed to get place in train for ah lo took with in small bundle disguise have worn at chafui be perhaps only person in train who did not feel absolutely confident of triumphant march to pekin have made up mind must have to fall back must pursue journey with ah lo for time train passed through cultivated ground work of enemy be very soon visible portion of line be torn up in many place attempt have evidently be made to destroy bridge several time train have to stop in order to make repair owing to large number of hand available work be performed so rapidly that there be only short delay at point at lo fa for first time boxer be seen actively engaged plate layer cabin be in flame telegraph pole have be cut down men be engaged in destroying village bordering line be also in flame inscription kill foreigner be posted up everywhere chinese troop alighted fired several volley at party of boxer apparently without doing execution ineffectual effort exciting much merriment among allied troop mile farther smoke be seen rising from several village general nieh refused absolutely to continue journey declaring that whole country be evidently swarming with boxer that be highly dangerous to advance insisted on returning to lo fa admiral seymour strongly urged to remain there with men without success soldier be firmly convinced that be useless to try to fight boxer who believed be invulnerable to shot after chinese have left troop be detrained work of repairing line have for last few mile be very heavy a be already late halted there for night so far work have be altogether unimpeded by enemy who have apparently fallen back a soon a laden train be seen approaching in distance troop have grumbled good deal at cowardice of enemy consoled with idea that have not yet gone half way that doubt boxer must make stand later on there be plenty of material for making camp fire be soon blazing a night closed in song in various language rose from bivouac of different nationality officer gathered round own fire chatted on prospect before anticipation have not be fulfilled thus far bateman one of lieutenant said to rex be not yet time for to be fulfilled be only during first half of journey down saw boxer fire over country will become thicker thicker a near pekin in end expect that whole chinese army will come out to meet swollen by rabble of town expedition moved forward again in morning be soon evident that in country through be now advancing boxer have carried out operation more thoroughly than in through have already passed in many place railroad have be taken up for hundred of yard sleeper carried off burned while whole of telegraph pole have be cut down wire carried away troop be very soon detrained again employed in work of restoring line operation be only carried on with great difficulty in meantime lieutenant smith of aurora went forward with party of three officer forty four men to try to reach neting thirteen mile ahead to prevent more damage being done to line to hold railway station there be attacked soon after started at three village in succession drove enemy out with ease at half past ten determined attack be made on by about four hundred fifty boxer who charged in line with great courage little force however repulsed with heavy loss a ammunition be then beginning to run short enemy be still increasing in strength lieutenant smith retired a great band of boxer must be seen in distance major johnston be sent forward with sixty men to examine line ahead may a well come on with bateman will very likely fall in with villager perhaps capture boxer so get information a to position of enemy in front of state of line will be very glad to come sir ah lo without receiving specific order fell in a matter of course in rear of marine went steadily on keeping two mile ahead of leading train when eight mile above lo fa saw body of boxer reckoned about three thousand strong streaming out from village on left force did not make directly for little party bore towards rear with evident intention of cutting off have with good many mounted men who dashing forward crossed railway behind while men on foot made for partially burned bridge village commanding line fall back at double major johnston called not too fast be certain that will have to fight do to put out of breath keep up quick fire a go halt when fire take steady aim wont like long range of bullet dont suppose will do much harm fellow will hear firing at wagon will soon have party up to assistance rex ah lo unslung rifle joined marine in steady fire return of enemy be not effective only few be armed with gun be not of long range for mile running fight be kept up twenty thirty of enemy being killed nevertheless persisted in endeavour to cut off party when however saw body of marine blue jacket coming up at double major at once halted men now lad can give independent fire a quick a like there be fear of closing with now boxer who have crossed line began to move back join companion approaching blue jacket at once opened fire upon with rifle maxim reinforcement soon joined major johnston party under lead attacked village drove boxer from following hotly upon heel forced also to retire from village with loss of forty killed wounded rex service be at once called into requisition slung rifle behind set to work to interrogate seven wounded boxer who have fallen into hand from learned that farther back line have be almost entirely pulled up that force there be very numerous strength have just be increased by addition of ten thousand regular troop who have be nominally disbanded in order that must join boxer while government might be able still to affirm that boxer be acting in defiance of order that imperial troop have joined said too that considerable proportion of troop in pekin have be brought to southern gate to oppose relieving army if broke through force opposed to rex learned that two day previously there have be fighting in pekin that be expected that legation must be taken in course of few day army advanced farther night next day pushed on to lang fang be way to pekin found station building destroyed three hundred yard of track torn up boxer be seen busy in work of destruction when shell be dropped among fled patrol went out reported that mile quarter of track have be destroyed illustration rex interrogates wounded boxer news that have learned from wounded boxer on previous day have excited in rex burning desire to push forward position in pekin seemed to be precarious became so impatient to get to principal scene of action that determined to leave army make way up in disguise be evident that if line be a seemed almost totally destroyed beyond point progress of relief column must be extremely slow a troop must hold to railway for have other mean of carriage seemed to rex highly improbable that must be able to fight way into pekin having made up mind went to major johnston be most anxious to go forward said know that legation be attacked not seriously perhaps at present may be so day appears to very doubtful whether expedition will be able to fight way into town if do so must be considerable time before get there know that if place be taken must be able to get cousin off at least must try at rate have brought native disguise with have doubt can make way into pekin how will get into legation dont know think that by mixing with boxer will be able to make way in at night be there occasion sir for to inform admiral seymour of intention none at bateman will probably have opportunity of speaking to in morning will mention to that have started to make way in alone be risky business know wish well through begin to think that be quite right when said that opposition must be greater than expected only reckoned upon boxer did not think that must tear up railway be now evident that difficulty will increase with foot that advance trust however that if do have to fall back legation will be able to hold out people may be driven from of outlying place must think that if whole of defender be concentrated at legation ought to be able to defend a long a food water hold out did not hear suppose when be there how be provided in respect did not hear anything about see when be there ambassador still clung to belief that empress be favourably disposed towards foreigner a far a must hear one else thought so be afraid that did not believe necessary at time to lay in provision for siege if native christian take refuge with will want very large supply very well sir then a soon a be dark will make off will make straight for river follow course be certain that greater portion of enemy will be gathered close to line of railway dont anticipate difficulty in making way up pekin be only forty forty five mile from here will enter to morrow will of course make circuit of city go in at northern gate in way will probably have difficulty until get near legation afternoon rex said good bye to other officer of acquaintance a soon a be dusk coloured skin touched up eyebrow eyelash painted line from corner of eye so a to give upward inclination fastened on pigtail again set out with ah lo a have anticipated experienced difficulty in making way up occasionally saw party of boxer on bank of river have to make detour to avoid by morning saw tower of pekin ahead turning aside into field of standing grain lay down slept for hour when awoke made detour round city entered by northern gate a troop be stationed here went on unquestioned into city a advanced came upon many ruined house at one point large tract have be cleared by fire many dead lay in street for most part horribly slashed mutilated band of rough be still searching ruined house for loot in part business be still going on better class of shop be closed supplied poor be open inhabitant be going about usual avocation a if nothing have happened a neared legation must hear occasional firing in part shop be closed there be traffic whatever in street at point large number of boxer be gathered avoiding turned into narrow lane led towards british legation went nearly to end of here rex entered doorway took off chinese clothes under have own wrapped up pigtail put over scotch cap have carried with then ah lo started out at run for legation here there men be grouped on wall on seeing european coming along shouted word of welcome to dozen shot be fired from neighbouring house arrived at entrance untouched dozen soldier be stationed here have managed well sir sergeant in command said a entered have come far have come on from relieving force be at lang fang will be here soon sir very much doubt whether will get through at line be torn up will be opposed by immense force fear that will have to wait till much bigger force be gathered that be bad news sir expect will hold out right dont seem very anxious to come to close quarter rex went straight to ambassador quarter sent in name be at once admitted so be back again mr bateman yes sir came up with relieving force two thousand strong under admiral seymour have reached lang fang have great doubt whether will get much farther a railway have be completely destroyed be without mean of carriage there be doubt that will be met by ever increasing resistance a move forward twenty thousand regular troop have moved round to south gate to oppose if get a far a that communication be already cut behind so large force be concentrated near tientsin that town will probably be attacked taku fort will be attacked very shortly troop be on way from india port arthur japan have doubt that before long army will be gathered sufficiently strong to fight way up fear that must be week before be in position to do so do bring despatch for sir be afraid that if mentioned to admiral be coming on must object so came off of own account have learned that legation be being attacked be most anxious to be here to cheer cousin up to endeavour to do what must for if thing went badly very well mr bateman be glad of news that have brought though be not satisfactory own have have own doubt whether force be coming up be strong enough to make way here be better however to know worst will be glad of assistance of rifle that of man for be very short handed even aid of two rifle be not to be despised have better take up quarter a before at college rex withdrew at once went to doctor house be glad to be able to tell said doctor that young lady have now pretty well recovered if railway be working must say that must very safely be taken down to tientsin a be however will have to wait until reinforcement come up then can see sir certainly elder girl be quite recovered younger one be convalescent be still weak will do good rather than harm to see for have necessarily be somewhat lonely a everyone here be busy lady have be occupied in making sack to hold earth for fortification girl have therefore be left more to than otherwise must have be rex at once went across to house girl leapt up with cry of delight a entered oh rex cried jenny be glad to see when did return about hour ago have to come up in disguise wore before know suppose that be quite cut off from tientsin now so have heard say that there be going to be fighting here yes there be doubt that will beat off need not be uneasy oh be sure of feel quite different from what did before for past three four day have be helping to make sack even mabel have done little how be uncle aunt be right believe father will have share of fighting for great force of chinese have gathered outside town expect to be attacked be hoped however that ship will destroy taku fort in case light craft will make way up to tientsin then of course man can be spared from ship will join relief column thought that be on way up now that be expecting here to day be sorry to say dear that think there be very little chance of coming at at present came up with ah lo girl looked at other in dismay then how long do think will be before really come up be afraid will be many week large reinforcement of british troop be coming from india russian have be despatched from port arthur number of japanese french german be being sent forward must be time before be here must make up mind that be going to hold own then changed subject so be getting stronger mabel be looking ever so much better oh yes be feeling ever so much better doctor say will soon be strong well again be getting quite full here now for number of native christian be coming in for shelter everyone be told off to do something jenny be to help serve out food to woman child expect that will soon be able to assist also yes expect will be made useful said rex ah lo have come up too suppose yes came with a matter of course will aid in defence wish be boy jenny said must like to help kill of boxer dare say good many of who be at chafui have come here will be among who be going to attack will be just a useful in own way jenny a if be boy must carry gun must give pistol rex so that if must take place can shoot have made up mind that will do that rather than fall into hand again dont think must be wicked to kill do certainly not jenny in first place dont think that there be much chance of capturing legation in next place hope that if did so ah lo must be able to get out again in disguise at rate dont think need have fear there be four hundred soldier here employee of legation must certainly make hundred more besides there be merchant other people expect will form corp out of christian who have come in most of legation be strong building will be hard if can not beat off attack be lucky that legation lie within short distance of other can be defended together when leave will go round see have be done to fortify stayed chatting with for half hour then went down to college have turned up again like bad penny sandwich said a met friend be quartered here will be heartily glad to have with regard man a valuable reinforcement have heard that morning boxer have begun to massacre native christian believe that great number have be killed ought to have come in here rex said doubt must have done best must for sandwich said must have have lot of difficulty in feeding ten thousand of though be awfully sorry for poor beggar presence here must scarcely be advantage for must hamper terribly in defence will have to put up with bad cooking unless of christian be coming in turn out to be decent cook for servant cooly be leaving must see sergeant herring talking to a go out rex laughed have already made acquaintance of sergeant who have be twenty year at legation who be in general control of arrangement be big man with powerful voice authoritative manner ruled cooly with rod of iron be well known figure in city be regarded by populace a being only le important than ambassador can quite fancy rex said how cooly must sneak off under thunder of voice well must say that be just a well rid of cooly dont suppose must have be relied upon be not like native christian who knowing that life be forfeited if boxer get in will certainly be faithful even if be not very useful by way have not brought clothes back came up in suit of own under disguise be afraid of carrying bundle will come up then washed ironed when be over sandwich laughed right bateman shant be able to get much washing done now will hail arrival of clean suit whenthat be very vague wordwhen come up there be good deal of excuse to be made for cooly servant be almost drawn from population of pekin family according to chinese law must assuredly suffer be to remain at legation must account for difference between conduct that of native servant in indian mutiny for in great majority of case remained true to master chapter vii fortifying legation now sandwich tell have be event here so far well thing have be gradually getting worse since went away be difficult to say what be first act of violence on ninth boxer burst into pavilion on race course threatened of student one of whom in order to get away have to shoot man with revolver on tenth summer palace of legation on hill be burnt since then have be impossible to go beyond town by evening of eleventh white in city be gathered at various legation street be still crowded with people business went on a usual within quarter chinese teacher in british legation however struck cooly began to desert property belonging to roman catholic be looted morning outlook be still more threatening mysterious mark appeared on door party of german italian raided temple where boxer be said to be drilling only captured few weapon quantity of red cord boxer use a girdle afternoon thing looked still more serious two of legation servant be cut down while shopping order be given to clear street in short time shop be shut crowd cleared out if have arrived yesterday must have witnessed usual bustle instead of empty street later on there be fire in street marine turned out proved to be french clearing street near legation at night there be fire in many partsthe american mission eastern roman catholic cathedral presbyterian mission be in flame to east there must have be square mile of shop in flame through evening heard firing in city still later large party of boxer carrying torch moved down towards austrian legation machine gun mounted on wall be in readiness for when came within hundred fifty yard opened fire torch be immediately dropped boxer bolted austrian turned out to pick up dead whom expected to find strewn in street not single one be seen be discovered next morning that bullet have cut telegraph wire where crossed street nearly thirty foot above level of course have good deal of laughing about morning be very unlucky affair have machine gun be well aimed must have done great execution for boxer be crowded together must have be very valuable lesson a be however only confirmed boxer in belief in invulnerability morning heard that south cathedral be on fire that take up to present time oh by way hear that tower over one of gate have be burnt what be actual line hold well at present go from tartar wall to imperial wall by side of french legation custom house run from north bridge along by side of legation across house to russian legation then by side of across legation street to tartar american russian defend west corner german french southeast austrian northeast british north west of course thing be only beginning yet there have be organized attack doubt will have plenty of before long be chinese authority doing occupy principally in encouraging boxer in way in next place in sending in assurance to ambassador that everything be perfectly peaceful that need be under uneasiness at same time prince tuan head patron of boxer have be appointed to head of tsung li yamen be equivalent know to ministry several of moderate member have be turned out of place filled by creature of tuan really wonder that think worth while to keep up farce of friendliness ah there be dinner bell at rate can for present enjoy meal may not have much to enjoy in way presently have scarcely sat down when there be outbreak of musketry fire call for reinforcement have brought rifle into room with catching up ran out fight be over however before got to scene be upon north bridge that sentry have be firing party of boxer have come down from direction after volley have be poured into have charged have fallen back on receiving leaving two of number dead upon ground two wounded also be taken prisoner during night be several time aroused by sound of volley firing a be not followed up one stirred learned in morning however that boxer have come down from various road leading to legation have retired on finding that be strongly guarded next morning boxer started number of large fire in west a report came in of massacre of christian in quarter dr time correspondent got together relief party who went out brought in large convoy of refugee terrible tale of scene of slaughter that have witnessed so far minister have done nothing to save unfortunate people being apparently afraid of giving chinese government excuse for declaring war against for interference between different class of subject for present though be protected be given ration be dependent entirely on what small supply brought in with charity of merchant trader later in siege however rendered invaluable service be to zealous labour that safety of legation be finally due be housed in prince sus palace be generally called fu occupation of be in of immense service a artificial hill in ground commanded east wall of british legation covered japanese french legation from artillery fire in rear after breakfast rex sandwich several other student interpreter went round whole line of defence barricade be extremely weak only calculated to check for moment rush of enemy consisted merely of chinese cart turned on side across road beyond however quiet deserted street spoke eloquently of threatened danger sentry be thrown out well along within range few of european shop kept door open officer servant of legation went out bought provision great effort have be made to gather in store a general conviction be that admiral seymour column must soon be up next day fire be started near tower known a chien mn great gate leading into chinese city began in shop did great sale in foreign medicine spread rapidly people worked hard to carry off property to place of safety for most part conveyed through gate stowed away in moat be at time dry whole quarter be soon in flame frequent explosion be heard a flame reached shop stored with petroleum firework conflagration raged day towards five oclock fire spread to two small arcade running through gate wooden shop blazed up furiously flame ultimately reached beam supporting roof of tower in short time whole edifice be in flame presenting splendid spectacle rex spent greater part of day watching fire brought cousin out to look at why must chinese wish to burn own town mabel asked simply because be savage brute be perfectly astounding that quiet patient shopkeeper fall upon boxer smash up must say that million of pound worth of damage have be done already for principal trading quarter have be destroyed one can understand people looking on placidly while european building be burnt when come to own house one must have thought that most peaceful quiet people must be excited to madness must attack with fury scoundrel who be doing damage think must anywhere else in world can not see what boxer expect to gain by at present be practically doing nothing against be simply destroying property of own people in one respect be absolutely benefiting for be making great clearance round line be thereby adding to power of defence for however brave boxer may be will hardly face rifle across open space time attitude of chinese soldier be friendly on guard at chien mn did not interfere with party of sight seer who went out there occasionally be seen to fire at boxer although there be one two affray with be brought on by recklessness of russian german who fired upon without reason next morning rex saw party of marine with few civilian going out of gate hearing that be to attack temple in boxer be torturing christian called to ah lo followed building lay little to north of austrian legation surrounded place effected entrance when found that boxer having fastened captive to wall be performing incantation preparatory to murdering opened fire at once boxer made desperate attempt to escape a be hemmed in on side one of be shot captive be then released brought into legation russian be that day busy in pulling down house lay near legation at present british authority be still in doubt although there be many house near must have constituted great danger to defence have be fired attempt be made to imitate example of russian apathy that people display be perfectly astounding rex said that evening a student be chatting together everyone else a far a see be conscious of tremendous danger yet minister allow to be continually humbugged by empress adviser really seem to be inviting disaster certainly be remarkable sandwich said will be lucky indeed if dont suffer for even in matter of provision negligence be astonishing if have set to work at once when danger began must have brought in store within quarter of mile round must have be in position to carry on siege for three month a be be little more than living from hand to mouth if street round be burned a by chien mn gate be must not have ten day provision left in place do hope that boxer will make so earnest attack that big wig can no longer close eye to danger of situation of course be heresy for to say so be what man here outside official circle think yes said have objection to amount of fighting do object to fight on empty stomach when there be reason why must be fasting suppose cousin be right bateman yes be quite recovered be ready for anythingto load a fire to exist on dry crust know how have suffered at hand of boxer will go through anything to see routed well there be one comfort put in when boxer do attack in force there can be more shilly willying ambassador must see then that have to stand siege will have to make effort to get provision in have not shadow of fear that will not be able to beat off boxer regular troop too be afraid of hunger so be rex agreed two ounce of bread drink of water be very poor regime to fight on thank goodness have plenty of well in legation will not have thirst to fight against water pure simple be pretty poor diet sunday seventeenth passed quietly except that there be fight between german chinese regular troop for former be to blame next day courier arrived from tientsin with news that roman catholic cathedral there have be burnt down news have come of relief force there be general feeling of disquietude concerning on tuesday man who have be sent off with letter to tientsin returned saying that have be unable to make way through day passed tranquilly everyone be still discussing expected arrival of admiral fear began to be entertained for first time that might fail to reach pekin that even if did might not be able to fight way out again cumbered a must be by non combatant from legation barricade however be being gradually strengthened supply must still be bought from shop round a evening approached be reported that minister be about to hold council leaked out that ultimatum have be received from tsung li yamen calling upon to leave city next day a ally have threatened to take taku fort question be discussed at gathering feeling be unanimously against going felt that confidence must be placed in undertaking chinese might give to protect convoy on way down if be to decide on retiring must require large number of cart to carry food for must not possibly now desert native christian with only six seven hundred men to protect long line be morally certain that whole must be massacred on way down council agreed therefore that be better for european to stay defend to last than to place smallest confidence in sincerity of chinese promise of escort there be general feeling of relief throughout legation when became known that minister have answered guardedly reply indeed be simply enquiry a to what amount of transport must be supplied what must be strength of escort be not aware that admiral seymour be retreating at time that taku fort have be already captured next morning minister met again message have be received from yamen german minister set out with only secretary couple of chinese servant to go to yamen ask for reply on way be attacked killed secretary be wounded although loss of life be to be regretted affair be in one respect most fortunate one for showed minister how critical position be be clear now that if life of one of minister on way to court be not respected even most timid must no longer place smallest confidence in promise of empress counsellor situation be at once changed there be longer hesitation no longer feeble hope in promise of chinese minister there be nothing to do to fight at once apathy have come over legation be at end nothing be thought of defence whole strength of legation be now employed in building strong barricade in collecting store first be important second even more so searching for store met with unexpected good luck two of three foreign store lay within line of defence provision in third be speedily brought in searcher came upon large wheat shop crammed with grain large store of fodder be found within line in many other shop large small store of provision eatable be discovered secured store of coal be also discovered through day provision be brought in in cart by hand from other legation people began to pour in a be decided that british legation be most defensible must be rallying place building presented wonderful scene of confusion minister secretary servant civilian sister from mission few european trader merchant mingled together talking in dozen language american mission brought in with one thousand seven hundred christian who be placed in fu seventy missionary be encamped in little chapel legation student moved bed into mess room gave up quarter to visitor second secretary house be given up to russian doctor to american room in legation be closely packed many took up quarter under numerous veranda four american lady be lodged in room hitherto occupied by rex cousin girl be greatly interested in crowd bustle be novel strange to after quiet life in mission house at chafui ball room of minister house be given up to lady bed be so closely packed that resembled great hospital military official be encamped in tent while many others be prepared to sleep in open air box bundle bale be piled scattered everywhere people while working actively laughed joked others sat disconsolate miserable unemployed men at legation worked hard helping immigrant trying to effect semblance of order four oclock be hour at ultimatum expired exactly at hour firing began one man be killed wounded artillery available for defence be absurdly small italian have one pounder american colt austrian machine gun british old nordenfeldt must not be relied upon to fire half dozen shot without jamming supply of rifle ammunition be also exceedingly meagre japanese have one hundred round apiece italian one hundred twenty russian one hundred forty five while french german british have from up to three hundred in course of afternoon marine have captured driven in small flock of sheep three four cow garrison have however to depend for meat principally upon pony mule belonging to officer of various legation merchant missionary of upwards of one hundred fifty be tied up in various part of legation in other respect provision have be collectedwheat rice grocery of sort wine spiritswere sufficient to supply whole occupant of legation for considerable time now that suspense be at end knew what be before went about work with brightened face air of energy determination have for week be wanting if stranger have looked in upon must hardly have guessed that die have just be cast that issue be battle battle against overpowering odds be ready to meet worst directly after first outburst of firing be reported that austrian have for apparent reason abandoned legation without attempt at defence though within line of defence austrian legation be separate outpost abandonment necessitated withdrawal of men from custom house lay behind be strong well constructed building custom staff be therefore ordered to retire to british legation at same time british advance post on north bridge across canal between legation fu have to be called in caused day have be so bright hopeful to end with feeling of depression rex have be busy day bringing in piling store turning hand to work of kind in evening went in have chat with girl be glad said that have be settled at last that be to stay here fight murder of german minister be very best thing must happen to for opened eye of others showed that chinese be a everyone else knew wholly untrustworthy really be afraid yesterday that minister must accept chinese offer to send escort down with if have done so be absolutely certain that none of must ever have reached tientsin a be believe that can hold out for month at least perhaps good bit longer may be sure that nation will spare effort to gather force sufficient for relief be pity that have not better stock of ammunition if there be fighting day three hundred round be most fully supplied have got will not go very far ammunition be thing can not manufacture doubt however whether chinese will attack in earnest be certain that if do will repulse a long a ammunition hold out even after that will make pretty stiff fight with bayonet other weapon at rate girl will be long while before have to tell to put on native dress again before begin to look out for quiet spot on wall where can let down when defence be finally over if worst come to worst said jenny have doubt will rescue somehow have absolute faith in ah lo will do tell without hesitation may be sure that will leave nothing undone to secure safety wont think of for long time yet next day be found that belgian embassy have be burnt down in night a be distance from rest however destruction be of consequence be now decided that semicircular barricade in front of entrance to legation must be strengthened nordenfeldt placed upon in position a to command road by side of canal to north bridge to enable gun to do work properly however be necessary that line of young tree by side of canal must be cut down be particularly dangerous operation for party of boxer have established behind bridge be ready to pick off anyone who approached tree japanese however have built brick bar across road on side of canal guard there managed to extent to keep down fire of boxer while man who have volunteered to cut down tree bravely proceeded to carry out work be powerful man refused assistance accomplished task without being hit though several time have marvellous escape unfortunately two day later be killed while engaged on similar service at point by time thing be settling down little in british legation where nearly whole of fugitive from outside member of other legation be assembled general committee be organized at head of be several very energetic civilian be divided into several sub committee charged with particular class of work attended to sanitary arrangement others to more equitable distribution of available space undertook commissariat arrangement others maintaining of barricade lady in legation be now employed in sewing sand bag available canvas be speedily used up other material have to be impressed sheet curtain hanging of kind table linen old dress pillow case in fact article must possibly be applied for such purpose party of cooly opened road through south wall of british legation intervening house into lane at back of russian legation so that american russian must have easy access to british legation must retire into if unable to maintain party of volunteer set to work built brick wall in place of wooden balustrade on upper veranda of first secretary house be large building offered fine mark to chinese on tartar wall who have indeed rendered quite uninhabitable bell tower of legation be now made head quarter of municipal government here name of member of committee be posted therefore knew to whom must apply for sort of work for be fitted notice be also posted containing scrap of news translation of edict etc spot therefore became general rendezvous tower stood at junction of four road shaded with tree be only once struck during siege rex be at work from morning till night now carrying sand bag building entrenchment now distributing food taking place with ah lo at point chinese be attacking endeavouring to drive off whatever did ah lo be by side chinaman great strength be invariably of considerable value one of greatest privation besieged suffered at first be want of water legation be amply supplied for ordinary want be feared that immense extra demand must cause well to run short happily rain be very heavy when be found that level of water be maintained regulation a to supply became le stringent though little must be have for washing there be lack of drinking water hospital be one of first thing organized at present number of wounded sick be small be certain to increase rapidly at head be dr poole of british legation dr velde of german there be two three lady doctor who have come in with missionary few regular nurse number of volunteer at present however there be small need for service a there be five six invalid to be attended to on twenty second there be terrible alarm for guard of other legation poured in suddenly a attack have not seemed to be specially severe for time be unaccountable appeared that retiral have be made by order of captain thomann senior officer minister hastily met sir claude macdonald be appointed to chief command order be at once issued for guard to return immediately to post have chinese known that legation have be abandoned must have occupied without resistance result must have be terrible disaster on day besieged learned that one of greatest danger be fire at three point british legation be particularly exposed to danger on north hanlin academy contained magnificent collection of chinese manuscript many of great age be separated from wall of legation where stable be situated out building of minister house by narrow lane only few foot wide behind chinese secretary house adjoined wall be several native building while southeast corner of legation be threatened in similar way house be built in quadrangular form central courtyard be covered in summer by mat roof at five oclock in afternoon boxer fired one of shed flame leapt up fiercely secretary house became at once involved there be general rush to spot men dashed into kitchen outhouse adjoining wall began to strip down woodwork to carry out everything portable chinese meanwhile keeping upon harassing fire from available point moment work be done danger over volunteer hurried off to demolish building adjoining south stable working far into night succeeded in doing so be not thought that real danger must arise from hanlin be considered sacred by chinese a be full of memorial literary tablet contained finest library in empire be repository of state record at same time be thought prudent to open passage through lane into building in order to prevent being occupied by chinese captain poole called upon rex few others to join in work have only just begun when someone ran up to with news that smoke be issuing from building worked desperately danger be great for strong wind be blowing body of marine be at once called up hole having be knocked through wall of building poured in fighting sharply drove boxer from building then endeavoured to extinguish fire in vain then set to work to prevent fire from spreading to building of legation water be brought up building demolished tree cut down fortunately wind at moment fell although back of outhouse stable be charred blackened did not catch fire great hall be occupied a soon a fire burnt down wall having be built to cut off from ruin be held till end of siege thus effort of chinese to bring about destruction of besieged only left stronger than before while inmate of british legation have be thus occupied other fire be raging one near french near american legation at latter russo chinese bank be fired american aided by chinese christian have desperate work to save legation house in legation street from point to chien mn be destroyed next day firing be maintained heavily from possible point boxer kept up continuous fire to men replied slowly a order against waste of ammunition be very stringent everyone being forbidden to fire unless must clearly see man on day chinese began shell fire with gun that have mounted at chien mn american legation be struck once german several time for most part shell flew overhead a be evident that if chinese planted gun on tartar wall must command whole of legation american german who be nearest to wall went out to seize be very stoutly opposed advanced steadily firing volley effected terrible destruction among chinese gathered there pushed on until came to barricade on two gun be mounted in position too strong to be attacked by so small force occupied wall however along whole line fronting two legation erected barricade on behind american legation beyond german legation in order to accomplish made demand for sand bag that bell be ringing for service for be sunday be stopped everyone set to work to make just a work began alarm bell rang out fire have broken out near south stable of house at point have be destroyed two day before many be still standing there be large house in stable yard have originally be built for use of escort have be handed over to consular student who having grown too numerous for accommodation be in turn superseded by missionary missionary however have occupied short time a upper story have be handed over to marine guard be dangerous position for near be situated market known a mongol market from house on opposite side of enemy kept up constant fire to left of escort house be gate in wall leading to market be principally used for sale of firewood fodder from gate house extended along wall a far a temple have be pulled down few day before enemy set fire to house be round wall that battle be serious enemy have advanced close to wall setting up flag there poured continuous stream of bullet into burning house especially against door have fallen must have be able to fire straight into yard volunteer rushed up began to pull down stable nearest to door to build up wall eight foot thick behind door be already on fire deluged with water others worked in smoke to build wall captain halliday party of marine went out by breach in wall on north charged through burning house to clear out enemy succeeded in doing although be seriously wounded in three hour danger be past attack however have be of great advantage to besieged for chinese have destroyed building adjoining legation have in few day accomplished what must otherwise have be done by defender at cost of enormous labour from time forward although be exposed to great danger at time garrison be free from anxiety about fire next day be comparatively quiet lower veranda of first secretary house needed barricading for several bullet have made way in morning two of pony have be shot there during night be cut up distributed be first experience besieged have of pony meat at first tasted with considerable doubt henceforth however became regular fare be received with general approval made excellent soup though when cooked in joint be apt to be hard be very good with curry rissole in afternoon firing suddenly ceased man bearing white flag took place on north bridge with board on be written in chinese imperial command to protect minister stop firing despatch will be sent to bridge of canal caused great excitement suggested that reinforcement might be at last at hand others thought that be trap to throw off guard experienced be of opinion that be merely sign of vacillation existed among empress adviser prince ching jung lu have for moment got upper hand persuaded empress of madness of course be being taken day went on however despatch be sent in time be employed in strengthening barricade chinese too made good use of interval by erecting barricade across legation street facing that adjoining russian american legation at midnight tremendous fire be opened on legation from side shell frequently passed overhead legation be swept by hail of bullet everyone be up ready to repel attack none be made after hour fire ceased a suddenly a have begun be evident that war party be again in ascendant sort of report be current next day besieged have learned that taku fort be captured on eighteenth began to calculate that relieving force might arrive on twenty eighth everywhere native christian worked unremittingly at barricade be now so strengthened a to be very formidable obstacle to attack order be issued that bomb proof shelter must be formed that inmate of house must construct for pit be dug out to depth of four foot be roofed in with timber on earth be piled to depth of foot many of shelter be completed lady almost unanimously agreed that must prefer to run risk of shell rather than bury in such hole for tremendous rain came on occasionally almost flooded ground running in at entrance to pit converted floor into sheet of liquid mud rex managed day to get hour chat with cousin be employed a assistant in hospital kitchen carrying soup other food to patient of whom there be now thirty forty thanks to excellent medical attention nursing cooking be almost without exception doing well during whole siege there be single death due to disease generated by foul air septic condition girl be cheerful enjoyed work being assistant of lady who superintended for most part carried out cooking occasionally got share of dainty dish be sent back untasted so fared better than majority work allowed little time for thought anxiety only fear be that rex might be wounded a saw coming in day fresh cheerful even fear gradually died out story of siege amused especially account of different way in different people took misfortune being always cheerful ready to make fun of everything while others grumbled at petty hardship seemed to consider a specially injured by whole proceeding rex have only have to fight on two three occasion for barrier be held by marine guard of various legation while civilian although formed into corp ready in case of attack to rush to threatened point have so far not be called upon for service at night however took turn to keep watch at exposed position during day worked at might be most required student be formed into corp by rex acted with occupied crowded quarter be full of life spirit made light of work at night formed quite merry party be afraid be very hard worked rex jenny said one day not bit of replied hand be very much blistered first two three day have got hard now back have quite forgotten how to ache a far a be concerned quite enjoy must not be living among better set of fellow suppose will get harder work shortly up to present time there have be very few casualty be quite certain now that have regular troop fighting against be shown by new method of attack instead of making onset on one point at time now assail from point simultaneously fire took place on same day tremendous bombardment two night ago began round at same moment cant be work of boxer then will be more serious dont know that will be much more serious except doubt will bring up cannon plant closer than be now development show that prince tung party have not got entire control over empress proclamation have be stuck up at tower to day appointing several chinese general to command of boxer be certain now that have got to depend entirely upon ourselves be also certain that seymour have either be annihilated obliged to fall back consider absurd to calculate now that taku fort have fallen army will come up from coast arrive here in few day after now certain failure of seymour expedition be evident that much stronger column must be employed such force can hardly have be gathered yet then railway have doubt be destroyed between tientsin sea will have to be repaired a know that cathedral at place have be burnt there can be doubt that settlement have be besieged boxer there be probably in great force will have to be cleared out before attempt can be made to relieve certainly must not say so to anyone else own opinion be that will be lucky if see head of relieving party before month month dont mean to say that why will be starved out long before that be wonderful how one can hold on if necessary rex said doubt will be put upon half allowance number of mouth to be fed be tremendous still keep on discovering store in house shop within line have never be methodically searched yet have also got pony to eat fortunately native christian be not accustomed to meat diet so pony will last european good long time dont know whether there be rat in legation said with laugh according to account of most siege when garrison be reduced to extremity always seem to have maintained on rat dare say be not bad eating if one be driven to havent seen rat jenny said with little shudder hope shant see one alive cooked be sure must manage very well with little rice flour tea be afraid that tea must not sustain long agree with that a long a rice flour hold out can do so have believe pretty good stock of tinned food sugar tea cocoa so on pressure will come more upon unfortunate cooly than upon be only fair to to say that be working splendidly if hold out will be largely due to for almost barricade work have fallen on fighting men be of course always on guard rest of be told off to work of sort other sanitary work distribution of food seeing to want of everyone during past two three day erection of shell proof shelter hard work fall to chinese be wonderfully patient obedient hard working expose fearlessly everywhere be coming to have great respect for there be giving way at among have lost everything have in world show sign of despondency take everything come a matter of course sometimes when go among when fire be heavy hear praying out aloud well must be off again chapter viii perilous adventure a went along rex saw chinaman sitting down weeping bitterly hillo said what be matter with man stood up only got in at twilight morning sir said came in by north bridge managed to make way there lay down underneath just a be getting light made run to come in many shot be fired at be not hit then what be cry about be cry sir for left behind there be twelve of altogether have be lying hidden since people first rose be in cellar house be burnt over cellar be in back yard though house be destroyed be nearly smothered managed to live through part of wall fell across entrance saved there be food stored in cellar have lived upon up to now be nearly gone when left have known nothing be passing outside yesterday cleared away of brick crawled out must hear firing going on continuously knew that people in legation must be fighting boxer be agreed that must try to make way here ask to send out rescue party now find that legation be so surrounded attacked so fiercely that be impossible for to save comrade have be speaking to one of chief officer tell that be quite impossible for to do so friend must perish have old father mother there wife three sister rest be friend how far be away more than mile sir will think over rex said be afraid nothing can be done will see if be here at seven oclock evening will tell a usual ah lo be not far off rex went to told what have heard be bad ah lo said what can be done master many have be massacred be twelve more yes must hing for others indeed most of be massacred before got in here mean to save people if can how can be done master be what be thinking about want to think too ah lo be ready to die with master if tell to will try to get out do can for people if will remain here ah lo can not hear of know have done well together before must be easier to get people out of cellar than be out of governor yamen might not be so difficult to get out master question be how to get away quite see that of course be christian people can know christian directly by dress other thing though be not so much by dress a by something in manner everyone can tell christian well must say dont see anything different between people working here meet everywhere else will take word for however if there be anything different must do best to change seems to that if get out must hide in empty house near one of gate if possible so that will be handy for wall there be not likely to be guard on wall at other side of town might at night get up there lower into ditch believe at most place there be water in then must get round side haul up that part of wall hold where must of course make way out doesnt seem to that there be anything very difficult about said ah lo of course must put on boxer clothes other day got hold of lot of cord wear several boxer have fallen near north bridge lie there still so can take coat can carry sword pistol rifle if must be discovered sword of course must be no good only want to make look like boxer well dont see why shouldnt be able to do of course there be risk in if must manage in way say ought not to be very great of course must take with man who brought news in to show place may a well get boxer coat sword for too in fact if can get dozen will take more can dress a boxer better rex went to room wrote letter gave to sandwich when met at six oclock look here sandwich said want to take care of letter have heard of party who be shut up in cellar in city there be twelve of believe have exhausted provision must come out if not relieved in course of day so mean to go out try to bring in here eh what be out of mind bateman dont think there be much risk in will get american to let down over part of wall hold of course ah lo who will go with will dress in boxer clothes will go round wall get in again by one of gate at other end dont suppose guard will be posted there at rate if there be guard wont interfere with then will go get people out will let down over wall at once hide till to morrow night in empty house close to will depend on time really seems very simple thing may seem very simple thing bateman strike a being mightily dangerous one still if spoke chinese a do must volunteer to go with must be of advantage sandwich if be detected will make difference whether there be twelve of hundred twenty must certainly be killed be simply question of being found out therefore fewer of there be better of course if only solitary man detected must cut down without hesitation at time of night be not likely that there will be anyone about to see be so busy day that fancy who be not engaged in worrying at night must be glad enough to sleep good many dead boxer be lying near north gate be thinking of sending man to get clothes of of now think of remember that american german when captured wall yesterday threw body of men that have killed over parapet into moat so can get thing when go out without running risk must not have said anything about to only have written letter to cousin father mother so that can hand one to girl in two three day if get back send other down to father after be relieved do a measure of precaution really think that there be great chance of coming to grief of course if worst come to worst be surprised will bolt for with ah lo be ready to run risk to get poor people out dont mean to throw away life a say will make bolt for if be found out in deserted street with end of empty house fancy must soon throw off scent must then be able to find way back again quietly to foot of wall well hope will do so bateman tell fairly that think be running very foolish risk still be noble thing to attempt oh bosh said rex seems to very simple affair be certainly well worth running certain risk to save life of poor people when do start a soon a get dark enough for to move along near wall without being seen want to go a soon a can because must like to pas out through gate of china town before doing so must excite attention dont think be likely that will have guard there if find that there be see that be watchful will hide up till morning when people be sure to go out to cultivate field rex now found ah lo told that need not go out to get boxer clothes a there be plenty to be have in moat outside wall will certainly be better master a be getting dusk started with chinaman who have brought in report made way through russian legation into american then climbed wall rex be well known to officer who commanded party there good evening mr bateman officer said have message for be going out on own account chinaman with be one of party who have be hidden in cellar since massacre knew nothing of what have be going on came to ask if party must go out to assistance that of course be impossible seems to that there will be difficulty in man managing have got rope for letting down from wall here at other side of town where fugitive be hidden hope to arrive at foot of wall here not later than to morrow night seems very wild scheme bateman dont think so when get down to wall be going to dress up in clothes of boxer threw over after recent fight will take four five extra suit for use of fugitive in way be likely to pas along without being questioned street will probably be nearly deserted by eleven twelve oclock if have luck will be able to get over wall without much loss of time if there be guard at gate of china wall may possibly be here before daylight to morrow morning well wish luck cant help thinking that be acting very rashly must remember that man have already travelled hundred mile in disguise by mean have already got in here twice out of tientsin once really dont see that there be appreciable risk in thing if be after daylight when arrive here men will be able to keep people in chinese town from attacking while be coming up think can promise to do that officer said never see soul pas along road very well will be here in hour time rex went to storekeeper obtained from length of rope sufficient for climbing wall then with ah lo chinaman set out be dark when got to wall again be without delay lowered down one after other by american marine will keep sharp look out for towards morning officer said do want to take rope away with have length with first step be to strip garment from nine of dead boxer three of put on rest fastened in bundle chinaman took for quarter of mile followed road by moat then turned into town saw few light went without attracting observation through gate a rex have expected be unguarded crossed moat beyond then walked on quickly hour brisk walking took to gate in tartar wall be open passed through unquestioned then dived into lane in quarter of hour reached space covered with ruin through chinaman led way presently stopped by side of fallen wall be place said advancing cleared away brick suddenly disappeared into bowel of earth be said white officer servant have come out to rescue exclamation of thankfulness followed word rex descended with ah lo at heel striking light saw seven men five woman people gave cry of terror a saw boxer garment be afraid rex said be only disguise have brought more with men must put on struck match after match while be being done now said woman must make little change in dress so a to resemble ordinary native woman then will sally out five minute later started have gone fifty yard beyond burnt area when three men came from house accosted who be said be brother ah lo answered give sign that may know be boxer one of men said give sign ah lo replied called for first man said very well be only sign that will get from ah lo struck tremendous blow with sword rex cut down third took to heel shouting way chinaman said running down narrow alley can get out at other end where there be net work of lane hurried at full speed down lane then turned again in five minute be quarter of mile from scene of fray now rex said let make for wall that man may have given alarm will not be safe to try gate kept on until wall rose before then followed till came to step leading to top when reached summit ah lo unwound rope from waist now said to one of men go down first if find that water be too deep to wade across stop where be one by one men woman be lowered down by ah lo rex be last to descend just a reached water step be heard running along wall keep quiet rex said let go by before try to cross wont notice rope in dark fifty men ran along top of wall leaving one here there to watch one be halted immediately above rex companion now rex asked in whisper how many of can swim three of men said must do so very well said rex must carry across who can not woman first swim a noiselessly a can that fellow above will hear least noise first party crossed without noise a second lot be being taken over one of chinaman made splash there be immediate shout from above man leaning over parapet fired musket swimmer burden however reached other side of moat without mishap illustration be lowered down one after other will be five minute before gather again here said rex then will have to get to gate must take nearly ten minute let get well out into country then make for china town let man help woman along fortunately woman have on becoming christian given up absurd practice of deforming foot be now able to walk with comparative freedom nevertheless must have made slow progress for assistance of men after time changed course hearing number of men running shouting took refuge in high grain until have passed when pursuer be well out of sight hearing continued till reached gate in chinese wall here waited for quarter of hour then ah lo approached gate see guard have be placed here since passed out so can enter without fear passing through turned at once to right kept without interruption along bank of canal at foot of tartar woman be for most part drooping now have be on short ration for many day be doubt worn out by anxiety terror progress therefore became much slower more difficult luckily there be further alarm before dawn succeeded in reaching that part of wall held by american be here captain rex called have got please let down rope haul up bravo officer said hardly expected to see again will soon have up minute later rope fell beside one by one woman be hoisted to top of wall men be next taken up finally ah lo rex so got through safely officer said shaking rex by hand did meet with trouble be only stopped by three boxer a must not give pas word tried to arrest man cut down one polished off third bolted gave alarm have difficulty however in eluding making way to wall fellow came along above a have to carry woman over moat heard got well away before must come out through gate hid up till have passed in dark have difficulty in coming through chinese town well congratulate upon exploit have be mean of saving twelve of poor beggar now will be going on at once rex said be drenched to skin though have dried bit on way for one will be glad to get into fresh clothes will thank to give left here before starting must put on now otherwise must never get through russian legation rapidly changed clothes then went with companion down step from wall passed through american legation entered that of russian here sentry stopped rex refused to let pas until officer came out with lantern questioned officer however recognized rex at once allowed party to proceed rex then went on through house separated legation from british quarter here be again questioned by two marine having satisfied men entered british legation now be safe rex said to friend must lie down sleep here to night to morrow will see that have clothes ration chinese have scarcely spoken word since started now a with one accord fell on knee showered blessing thanks upon rex for saving from terrible death be all right said be very pleased to have be mean of saving thank god have be able to do so have expected to meet with many difficulty everything have turned out well now must go will see that get allowance of food in morning then went over to quarter sandwich two three of companion be still sitting up gave shout of satisfaction a saw rex enter be heartily glad to see back bateman one of said found of course impossible have have to give up felt sure that must have to do so waited up to see what time be now asked rex about one oclock well be back sooner than expected be happy to say have succeeded without difficulty on way back with refugee have one encounter have to kill couple of boxer rest be easy dont say so bateman well congratulate most heartily have indeed done good night work tell about rex gave short account of adventure thought said that there must be no great difficulty about be sorry that be not accomplished without bloodshed must not help ourselves in respect be glad indeed brought poor creature in woman be desperately done up by time got within line be not to be wondered at after have gone through well will lie down now for have have very long day must be up early to morrow to see that people get ration for fancy be pretty nearly starved in few minute be asleep rex be up before six oclock in morning at once ran down to gentleman whose duty be to see to provisioning of native christian want to put down thirteen more name said how be that mr bateman one of party came in yesterday afternoon told that there be twelve of in hiding in cellar near burnt area so went out with man last night brought in did mr bateman astonish did without opposition without opposition to speak of sir have to kill couple of boxer be pursued hotly after got over wall one of men made splash in water sentry heard with two slight exception everything went off well how on earth did get in here got over wall close by american be hauled up by on return well sir must at once report what have done oh must rather say nothing about at rex said will only be questioned about have sort of bother nevertheless must be reported mr bateman will have to account for issue of thirteen more ration than before will have to explain in report that be people who be brought in by during night well only hope that nobody will take trouble to read report sir hate being talked about a likely a not must be blown up for going out without order perhaps something will be said about mr bateman certainly will get more praise than blame rex shrugged shoulder must much rather get sir affair be very simple straightforward one there be occasion can see for anything to be said about one way nevertheless to disgust saw hour later notice stuck up among in tower that mr bateman with man have gone out succeeded in bringing in thirteen native christian from hiding place among ruin chapter ix in enemy camp a rex be returning to breakfast in state of exceeding bad temper met sandwich who said sir claudes secretary have be round wish to see rex swung round with grunt of dissatisfaction made way to residency sir claude with four other gentleman have just sat down to breakfast when be shown in have breakfasted mr bateman asked sir not yet sit down take with then can talk while eat rex must much rather have gone through examination made off to breakfast with chum a must not refuse invitation sat down in very good temper sir claude smiled little can understand said after minute two by what said last time have conversation with that dont like having good deed talked about dont like being talked about in way sir in case mr bateman must not do thing necessitate being talked about rex after little struggle to maintain serious face laughed well sir can assure that if have own way must prefer to go about do what like to keep entirely to well now see thing have come out mr bateman certainly not from what said about from report made by mr graham when applied to for thirteen chinaman to be put on ration have just be telling gentleman of manner in rescued cousin a well a want to hear second chapter of adventure please tell about there be very little to tell sir excuse mr bateman there must be good deal to tell a must be perfectly well aware that ought not to have left legation without permission least can do be to give full account of reason for doing so of manner in carried out adventure now please begin at beginning tell how learned that people be in hiding beginning therefore with meeting with chinaman rex told story ending with there sir said at beginning that there be really nothing to tell that be simplest thing in world quite agree with mr bateman think friend here will join with in saying that be admirably planned well carried out scheme can not be sure be otherwise than matter of intense gratification to yourself that have saved twelve poor people from terrible death doe very great credit sir hope that will not undertake more enterprise of kind without speaking to beforehand be commander in chief of force here before of officer undertake enterprise might deprive of service must have consent a soon a meal be over rex ran back to quarter be there anything left to eat sandwich asked yes put by for be comfort governor asked to breakfast with have scarcely got down two three mouthful when asked to tell about affair last night a fellow can not talk eat at once fared very badly what have got there be pot of jam boiled rice will do first rate where be going to work to day be going over to fu be just starting well will come across when be done so get out of way of being jawed at suppose shant come back till dusk will suit admirably for there be sure to be something else fresh during day by to morrow business of mine will be forgotten on way down to fu rex be captured by party on search for volunteer to drive hole through south wall in order that watch must be placed there to see that chinese be not mining in direction day be tremendously hot a wall be well built labour be extremely exhausting be therefore relief when be called off to take measure might be necessary at stable house chinese have mounted gun at barricade on side of mongol market opened fire on stable house four shell crashed one after into stable house marine have to evacuate upper story whole building be so damaged that be in danger of falling several shell also burst over hospital one entered killed pony just outside marine kept up steady musketry fire on chinese who be working gun soon managed to drive off in evening gun again began firing time aiming at door of stable yard a however newly built wall behind be ten foot thick effected serious damage next morning gun be removed be not again brought into play cessation of fire be singular a though have failed to breach wall behind door must certainly have destroyed with few shot old wall beside door dozen gun placed here must have brought whole wall down in very short time laid defence open sort of explanation be suggested general idea be that chinese officer commanding at point must have be secretly in favour of defender of legation anxious that total destruction must not be effected either because be favourable to christian doctrine feared vengeance must follow by united power of europe while fire on stable house be continuing strong attack have be directed against barricade of french legation chinese line have be pushed up so close that fighting be almost hand to hand m von rosthorn austrian charg daffaires be fighting here with brave wife lady who have taken more than share in defence endeavoured to destroy chinese barrier by throwing upon straw dipped in petroleum chinese retorted with shower of stone by one of m rosthorn be somewhat severely wounded throughout siege lady evinced amount of courage be astonishment of troop when rex went back in evening from fu looked into hospital to see girl ran up to eagerly cry breathlessly oh rex everyone be talking about going out bringing in party of men woman well then wish to goodness must find something better to talk about there be nothing in thing at chinaman who have come in told that party be in hiding guided ah lo to place of course be glad enough to come out have adventure at on way except three boxer came up interfered with have to cut two of down other bolted then got over wall made circuit through field climbed back over wall behind american legation be quite sick of hearing about a if there be nothing else to talk about be quite ridiculous well people must have thought be something out of way because notice about be posted up on tower early in morning report that sir claude be praising action very much lot of people have come in to tell about be pity hadnt something better to do rex grumbled be quite sick of subject let talk about something else be first time have seen cross rex said jenny well be enough to make one cross having such fuss made about nothing now how be getting on here be right though shell burst over house afternoon made fairly jump yes know gave quite start must see that great harm have be done heat have be awful have knocked out pane of upper window to try get little air in have be feeling very much of course must have felt more really dont know how must get on if be not allowed off duty for two hour evening when can go out enjoy cool air yes must be terribly trying rex said must be worse for in stifling room inside than be for even working in sun night small party of marine volunteer went out endeavoured to capture gun on other side of market place chinese stood firm be obliged to retire without having effected anything be very well satisfied in morning however when found that gun have be removed during night next day last of june fight raged round french legation although men not otherwise employed who must use rifle went to assistance of defender thing went badly considerable portion of legation be burned defender be driven back step by step when chinese be distinctly getting best of fire ceased without apparent reason wearied defender chinese cooly have time to put up fresh barricade at nine oclock very heavy thunderstorm burst over city at same time firing be renewed with fresh vigour cannon machine gun rifle added roar to rumble of thunder puny flash to vivid sheet of lightning firing ceased by daylight day passed without serious disturbance next day however began badly chinese concentrated attempt against german american barricade on wall have advanced work to within hundred yard of german mounted gun there from maintained constant fire be difficult to send up reinforcement for there be shelter between legation foot of wall several be killed a tried to cross american barricade on west be very open a chinese gun at chien mn gate commanded on night of th of june enemy threw up new barricade within two foot of american one on nd of july at daybreak chinese stormed german barricade drove defender from wall american seeing own rear open to attack hurriedly left defence ran down to legation be grievous misfortune minister met at british legation decided that wall must be retaken at cost a chinese be placing gun upon must sweep whole position time be lost body of marine american british russian be collected led by colonel myers dashed boldly forward drove chinese back along wall enemy have taken no step whatever to strengthen position even to mass body of troop capable of holding against determined attack moment position be regained everyone who must work sewing machine needle be called upon to make sand bag sort of stuff be called into requisition for purpose lady cut up silk cotton dress men contributed spare pair of trouserswhich only required sewing up at bottom of leg again at top after being filled with barricade be strengthened nevertheless although position be re established general feeling of depression be felt german have not worked well resistance to attack have be feeble none of marine have joined in recovering wall feeling be deepened by event at french legation here mr wagner officer of custom house be killed french guard be driven back later however recovered position returned to barricade in afternoon there be misfortune italian officer captain paolina proposed to attempt capture of gun in northeast facing fu have caused considerable annoyance suggested that japanese must proceed along side of canal then working round large block of house come down upon gun from north while with mixed party must make way between two of block of house against gun be directed own party of italian be small one be supported by few italian marine austrian british volunteer among latter be student of consular college seems to be rather hare brained scheme sandwich said know whether italian officer have particular mean of finding out lie of land certainly seem going at in rather headlong way without taking precaution however a have not be called upon for much work be turn for fight suppose be coming bateman of course be regard a consular student at present be certainly game to take part in be going on though a say seems wiser to gather in part of fu remains in hand go straight from to gun started along side of canal when japanese have gone on ahead rest of force rushed up little lane at corner of fu here found suddenly face to face with barricade eight foot high loopholed be impossible to assault italian who be ahead made mad rush for hole leading into wall to fu almost fought way in for be wide enough for one man to pas at time officer be wounded two of marine be killed while struggle be going on volunteer stood with back against wall be little out of general line of fire when italian be out of way made dash for door one by one first four got across in safety last be hit in shoulder leg japanese meanwhile have forced way distance north after having one man killed two wounded finding unsupported fell back failure of affair excited much indignation in legation have be attempted without knowledge of ground without pain being taken to ascertain enemy position in hasty haphazard manner success however gave great encouragement to enemy next day chinese gun again opened fire against fu under cover furious attack be made on building japanese who have already suffered heavily be forced back fighting stoutly must have be driven out of building have not be for company of christian chinese whom colonel have assiduously drilled who now fought a bravely a japanese with aid jap recovered lost ground by end of day chinese have shown particular animosity towards company of convert hurling curse against hitting with stone be result of imperial proclamation have be issued on previous day ordering that missionary convert who did not repent of former error must be slain position at american barricade be becoming more more dangerous chinese attack have increased in vigour have built barricade diagonally across bastion almost touching that of american consequence be that must at moment from barricade pour into bastion then make rush over american barrier be evident that if be not driven out wall must be abandoned at daybreak therefore american strengthened by reinforcement of british russian gathered noiselessly behind barricade with first gleam of light dashed over found most of chinese behind new barricade asleep bayoneting drove enemy also from barrier on other side of wall chinaman rallied however behind barricade farther along wall again opened fire killing two of american marine wounding corporal gregory of british marine colonel myers who have along be in command be serious loss to defence by time life in british legation have become smooth regular with exception that number of chinese men woman for whom houseroom must be found have to be accommodated in rude shelter in square in front of british envoy house be settled down crevice through musket ball must enter have be closed up chapel have be divided into compartment fifty people be lodged in library have be thrown open to use of within legation well be fortunately full health of whole company be excellent communication be opened with fu a sloping passage have be driven down into canal strong barrier erected at lower end so that be possible to pas along without risk of suffering from fire kept up from north bridge from quarter however enemy be giving great deal of trouble owing to burning of museum space between outpost imperial wall be clear chinese have now built behind wall strong platform mounted several cannon upon only one of however be of foreign make parapet of wall heightened loopholed served a breastwork a put iron shutter before larger gun must with perfect safety bombard legation below only three hundred yard away besieged must make reply to fire wall must not be breached unless by heavy cannon have chinese placed upon wall of modern cannon of have abundance added to number must easily have destroyed legation strange to say contented with only firing occasional shot did certain amount of damage doubt nothing serious why boxer must not have utilized commanding position be mystery a inexplicable a failure to use gun on opposite side of market question be too fertile cause of argument in many respect chinese showed good deal of intelligence in attack be simply astounding that must almost entirely neglect two point from must have done more harm than from others together asserted that must be due to officer in chings force men who like absolutely disapproved of attack upon legation whatever reason agreed have enemy utilized two position defence of legation must sooner later have broken down be curious mixture sandwich said sometimes seem to fight very pluckily then when have really got best of seem to hesitate in unaccountable manner twice see have really be open to if have made push to take possession of american german legation might also have captured french then of sudden attack ceased without apparent reason again when have captured wall really placed almost at mercy let be driven off by le than hundred men considering force that have at disposal ought to have repulsed attack with ease then did actually repel attack on other side of market moment have done so withdrew gun ceased to harass have number of gun at disposal might have planted score of there in case must have battered down whole length of wall on side in few hour now have stuck gun up there play right down into residency yet leave unworked one formidable piece have at point almost look sandwich a if be divided into two party one using sort of activity in order to take place other thwarting at turn be only explanation can think of be pity one cant get at of leader dont mean of course prince tung must be bribed there must be smaller prince mandarin who must be amenable to handsome offer who must go round to side of prince ching who do know be dead against tung party best plan though dont for moment suggest that be possible must be to kidnap empress bring in here in sedan chair sandwich laughed that certainly must be grand move short of power of making invisible empress chair bearer be afraid there be way of doing be afraid not certainly must only be done by someone who know palace way perfectly may take for granted that approach be guarded that must be absolutely impossible for anyone who be not perfectly familiar with place to make way in be difficulty suppose that if man must once make entrance hide up must be able to get at empress must be alone sometimes if must get at at time put pistol to head might be able to get out dont suppose must be le amenable to persuasion of sort than other woman sandwich burst into fit of laughter be curious fellow bateman do believe must be mad enough to try if must see slightest possibility of success rex joined in laugh be not sure that wouldnt must be well worth risking one life to save occupant of legation confess see possibility of carrying out idea at rate without assistance of someone who know in out of place where guard be placed be habit of empress how occupies minute of day sort of thing if man have learnt have got such guide must say that must be possible in case of failure however must have to be prepared to put end to so a to avoid very much more unpleasant form of death be useless to think of a have idea of geography of forbidden city routine of life there be pity for must really be worth trying be pity sandwich laughed cant suggest other plan for instance might make balloon anchor over palace keep up rain of greek fire till have destroyed palace occupant be afraid must not be done rex said there be many reason against be thousand pity that have not good stock of iron here smelting furnace what must do with well might make big mortar say two foot mortar must not need to be very strong because small charge of powder must be sufficient for purpose if must drop half dozen shell into imperial palace must think empress must be inclined to come to term speedily if did not want palace content burned be more feasible idea than last sandwich said gravely a say havent got iron smelting furnace powder skill if have thing might manage try again old man if keep on inventing thing may hit upon something good day other opinion be rex said sturdily that where there be will there be way have doubt that when certain ingenious fellow suggested making wooden horse to capture troy be tremendously chaffed at first nevertheless see succeeded so did rex therefore clearly there be chance for be afraid not rex said shaking head gravely well must go on thinking bateman if be for own that see way at do think that must be more likely to invent way than anyone else considering manner in rescued cousin from boxer success in getting in out of place to say nothing of convoying of native christian into legation believe that if plan must be hit upon must be fellow to do to carry out be afraid that be beyond be afraid so still will keep on thinking matter over be great believer in saying where there be will there be way next morning there be quite stir chinese have discovered old iron cannon in one of shop of legation street be old chinese gun be question whether must be fired without bursting russian have brought up shell with gun after cleaning out gun found that shell must fit moderately well with trouble gun be mounted on wheel of hand carriage of charge be then removed from one of russian shell onlooker having retired to safe distance be pushed home fired result be grand gun turned over over wheel went into fragment a spectator ran up cheer broke from for found that contrary to expectation gun have not burst one pounder italian gun be then brought up chinese gun mounted upon suggested happy idea of utilizing italian gun be without shell quantity of leaden candlestick be therefore brought in by cooly melted down cast into shot thus legation received addition of two gun to armament proved very useful be brought up to assist in defence of point seriously threatened evidently created considerable impression upon assailant on sunday july th chinese made heavier attack than usual british french legation fu be subject to attack on spot from have set fire to building behind chinese secretary house enemy now planted gun proceeded to shell house fort on roof did considerable damage caused much excitement after firing for time stopped in same unaccountable way a have done at other point defender have begun to make slide for purpose of hauling new gun up to roof be abandoned a soon a chinese fire ceased a gun be urgently wanted to aid japanese to repel serious attack upon fu attack there be very sharp one chinese keeping up heavy fire of shell setting more of building in flame jap however be in end successful in driving enemy off defender of french legation be very hardly pressed for time attack be finally repulsed at point austrian captain who have fortnight before ordered troop out of russian french german american legation be killed fighting bravely german american have also to fight hard to repel attack made upon rex always looked forward greatly to hour chat with girl evening have early in siege introduced sandwich three four of other consular student to one more of generally accompanied on visit so that made quite merry party a there be generally many amusing incident of day to be related a rule however chatted upon general topicslife in tientsin prospect of relief other matter sandwich have caused great amusement evening after rex have discussed latter project by gravely detailing to girl who however at first seemed little alarmed lest rex must endeavour to carry into effect need not be afraid girl rex said one must think of something while one be standing on sentry for hour can assure that helped very much through long hour to imagine various way in one might do service intend to take sandwich into confidence in future consider that retailing idea to be nothing short of gross treachery in future will not hear of matter until have be accomplished when bring empress into legation tied on back in sack will be obliged to own there be method in madness really rex have idea of carrying out of mad scheme have idea of carrying out mad scheme jenny scheme be only considered mad when be not carried out when be accomplished everyone say how simple easy be however whether mad simple have idea of attempting to execute of at present possibly day may require assistance say that will because have not at present fixed upon plan when do may put devotion to test will do anything can do rex jenny said seriously after rescue of from yamen at chafui dont think must consider anything that might suggest a impossible very well be afraid however shant be able to ask for assistance jenny for brain really doesnt seem capable of inventing anything be always thinking of thing when on sentry have never managed to hit on satisfactory scheme be horribly annoying came back into place on purpose to be of good yet dont seem to be doing good at why dear bateman be doing a much good a anyone else sandwich laughed nobody else performs out of way feat why must be called upon to do so do a much a anyone else yes know about see day position get little worse french american german be hard pressed japanese italian austrian be gradually losing ground in fu feel that something ought to be done if must find out what that something be if have have inventive sort of chap up herea man like edison for instancehe must have hit upon fifty plan for annoying enemy must have invented special electrical machine for startling must have contrived substitute for cannon must have peppered with pneumatic machine in fact there be saying what must not have done even edison must have required workshop havent machine of kind not even simple lathe well must have done without rex said positively vexes very much that one here seems to have inventive genius look at archimedes what wonderful dodge invented for defence of syracuse sandwich two companion laughed loudly be afraid there be archimedes here bateman must put up with ordinary mean of defence after succeed so badly have held out for month now at end of month will still be in possession of good deal of ground by time must think relief must be at hand even allowing for fact that there will be troop of dozen nationality in relieving column consequent delay for be not to be expected that different section will work well together besides be evident from desultory manner in attack that chinese be very much divided among look at way get gun into good position to annoy then fail to use if be to plant cannon round keep up steady fire must knock legation to piece in course of week must be due to dispute among leader for know that chinese soldier be obedient a well a brave that if gun be not used can be from fault on part feel very confident therefore even without assistance of edison archimedes will manage to hold out till relief come day two after sandwich rex be chatting together in own quarter when former said cannon will soon bring whole place about ear have already done terrible damage to day three men have be killed house be little better than ruin be impossible for men to stay in upper floor rex sat silent for little time then without making remark got up went to find ah lo ah lo said know damage gun across market have be doing yes master very serious other gun not do so much harm very bad well be thinking that might go out silence ah lo looked at rex by light of lantern be hanging overhead to see if be speaking in earnest master must get killed said shaking head dont think so ah lo of course there be danger in think that might be managed ah lo be ready to go with master if chooses to kill chinaman said killed must be for sure dont think so rex said anyhow be worth risk will have house down wall behind if be allowed to go on much longer then there will be fierce rush will be over how will master do well will take hammer long spike with if go with mebut mind ah lo dont ask to go must take too very well then a only two gun be worrying take one take other can do in minute of course must manage to get native disguise for will have to mix with enemy to extent be sure to be sitting talking round gun then must run for cant run across market know that there be lot of in house on side of quite see that ah lo must run other way think can run faster than most chinaman if get start of few yard be likely a will not at first realize what have be done ought to be able to escape find secure hiding place then next day can work way back at point enemy be not watching very well master ah lo said in more hopeful tone when do go sir will go to morrow night a will require time to make preparation mind be not to say word to anyone of what be going to do for if heard of be possible that sir claude macdonald must stop ah lo will tell nobody master be same to whether be killed outside starved inside rex went to bed lay awake for time thinking how affair have best be managed came to conclusion that only way must be to lower by rope from end of burnt library then make way round come up to gun from behind struck that must perhaps be advisable to tie knot in rope a help to when be climbing back again in end decided to make rope ladder for have strong idea that ah lo must be able to swarm up rope when morning broke went down to store unlocked after rummaging about for time found long rope two hammer long spike nail hid hammer spike in bed then retiring to unfrequented corner of residency soon manufactured rope ladder cutting bough to form rung ladder concealed near spot where intended to get over wall later in day ah lo brought chinese dress take gun with sir ah lo must only be in way when wanted to run can however hide sword under clothes will get revolver ammunition for can borrow from mr sandwich telling that be going on guard that own weapon have somehow got out of order day passed off quietly except that gun across market still continued to batter house to make breach in wall behind soon after midnight ah lo joined master rex disguise have be laid down by rope ladder a soon a got there changed prepared for start got safely over wall then struck off in direction opposite to market for time saw one in street a got farther away here there met people hurrying along evidently fearful of being within range of firing from wall when have gone distance turned made sweep towards market now came upon group of soldier firing have ceased for day must not begin again until two three hour before daybreak occasional bullet whistled overhead showing that garrison be on alert for although firing generally ended with day yet fierce attack be often made during night rex ah lo sauntered quietly about among soldier gradually getting nearer nearer to spot where gun be placed suppose can look at said ah lo who with several others be standing near certainly can man said be doing good work in couple of day will have wall down then will finish off with white devil be good ah lo said have be here too long a be ought to be cleared off without delay when have got rid of last of will be own master again be always meddling in affair just a if be master instead of only living here by permission of empress even venture to tell must do bishop get made mandarin then if people commit crime will not have punished have put up with too long now be going to make end of once for quite right ah lo said a lounged up to gun for at moment rex moved towards other while pretended to be examining gun quietly inserted point of spike into touch hole then rex looked round moment seemed favourable eight ten soldier be standing close to talking over fighting of day prospect of making breach in morning farther back other soldier be laughing talking cooking rice waited minute then signalled to ah lo on instant two heavy hammer fell on head of spike with three quick stroke drove up to head in touch hole then throwing down hammer started off at full speed soldier shouted a saw spike being driven in striker have gone thirty forty yard before have sufficiently recovered from surprise to think of pursuit rex ah lo increased lead to fifty yard before pursuer have fairly got up pace turned down first lane came to then down glancing back rex saw so far be holding own except two boxer swifter than rest be yard ahead of main body of pursuer chinaman a ran set up perpetual shouting did not improve speed must get rid of two men said rex speaking for first time since started slacken speed little let come up to then suddenly turn round upon right sir ah lo said will use revolver ah lo can use revolver sword whichever like illustration rex revolver cracked out minute later two foremost of pursuer came rushing upon sudden pause of fugitive have left time to draw sword rex revolver cracked out laying one of low ah lo using sword struck other with such force that nearly decapitated there be shout of rage from party behind rex companion needle to say did not stop to listen at once turned continued flight ran down till be brought up suddenly at end of lane where house rose straight in front of be too late to retrace step what be to be done master ah lo asked must break in door if be not open first door tried however be unfastened entered bolt to ran to back of house be disappointed however for there be opening through must escape without wasting time turned ran upstairs to terrace on top of house here number of clothes flapped in wind be evidently family drying ground can defend ladder for bit ah lo must beat in end let scramble up to other end of street looking down saw that lane be now full of soldier of whom carried lantern be easy matter getting along on roof a house be irregular in height sometimes have to jump down ten twelve foot at others to help other up wall of equal height be distance along when heard sudden shout knew that pursuer have broken down door of house have entered told that enemy have gained roof found that be deserted in short time lantern appeared on roof of of house fugitive be already within house two of end of lane street be full of people rex said peering over cant get down here must jump upon house behind be four five foot lower than so will have difficulty without hesitation stood upon parapet behind leapt ah lo followed example now said rex let run down house will probably be empty a family be sure to run out to see what row be about there be indeed woman standing in lower room gave cry of astonishment when two fugitive rushed past through open door joined people who be hurrying up to other end of lane now that be mixed up in crowd rex felt that there be little fear of being detected only soldier have be talking to must know face a have be among first to take up pursuit must now be down at farther end of next lane more probably on roof of house have entered a crowd be already very dense must not possibly make way back suddenly flame broke out from one of house have crossed soon be seen that other house be on fire also cry of dismay broke from chinese standing near be accustomed to high handed proceeding for many house have be burnt by boxer in pursuit of plunder in indignation at failing to find have now evidently fired house a easiest way of destroying fugitive who have shown that must sell life dearly gradually rex ah lo withdrew to edge of excited crowd many of people be already moving off to carry good from house in adjoining lane for wind be blowing strong there be saying how far conflagration must spread a house be flimsy erection being composed chiefly of bamboo mud must catch like tinder when attacked by flame moved away from scene gradually without appearance of haste alarm have evidently spread distance for met fire brigade of men carrying tub of water slung on pole hurrying towards spot people be standing at door watching blaze calculating whether if spread must come way well ah lo rex said see have not be very dangerous business after if two soldier killed have not be so fast might have got away without being pressed at be very unfortunate for ah lo said quietly dont suppose knew what be running for very few of must have known that have spiked gun be lucky that two house be so close to other that be able to leap across otherwise might have have dont think must even in case ah lo might really have gone down through last house joined crowd there might master dont think must everyone have run to street by time doubtless many be standing at door must have noticed two strange men running behind at rate be well out of ah lo can now walk quietly round go up ladder mind say word to anyone about affair why not master ah lo asked in surprise for two three reason in first place governor might blame for undertaking business of sort without asking permission see although did not think so at time chinaman coming along there seeing ladder might have gone reported fact by mean large number of enemy might have crossed wall before be discovered safety of garrison must then have be endangered be one reason next be that dont want everyone to be making fuss now that be over might blame for recklessness while others might pat on back because of success be thing must specially hate did not do for praise to be of service to garrison for reason want to hold tongue not whisper word to anyone be quite content that have rendered good service to legation saved many life put garrison in position to repair damage unmolested that ought to be satisfaction enough for anyone very good master ah lo will keep mouth shut if master wish be not talker now that know what master wish will do hour walking brought to foot of ladder having climbed over wall coiled up rope again rex took to magazine put where have found then satisfied that have done good piece of work went lay down until be turn to go on sentry next morning there be considerable surprise when be found that two troublesome gun be silent be time before there be thought of making good damage a hour went by there be still firing strong body of men be put on to repair defence a fast a possible many be surmise conjecture circulated through residency a to cause of change said that peace party have again got upper hand that fresh term have be offered others asserted that fresh cannon have be planted round residency that others be to hold fire till be ready for action when overwhelming fire must be poured in again be of opinion that soldier have mutinied on account of heavy loss have sustained without making appreciable progress while few maintained that relieving army must be near at hand that fighting man have be sent out to oppose next morning sandwich came into room where rex be eating breakfast after being relieved from guard know rex said excitedly about two gun being silenced yes suppose everyone in residency know about rex replied quietly have just heard report that servant asserts that be doing rex jumped up with angry exclamation rascal will break bone in body promised faithfully that not word about must pas lip then be really true sandwich said in surprise true yes be particularly anxious that must not be known so must escape fuss that people be always ready to make about little thing will go out talk to master ah lo cant think how can have spoken about after promise to for have always proved most faithful fellow cant believe did to get reward dont see other motive that can have have so saying hurried out of room followed by sandwich who in vain attempted to get of particular from found ah lo standing with provost marshal hand on shoulder servant have be making row latter said thrashing servant of belgian embassy yes sir must thrash again ah lo blurted out what have done rex asked calming down instantly on seeing man in predicament be like sir belgian man came up to three four of who be standing together said do know who did so said said a loud a of then said did stood astonished one a much a other went on crept out of russian legation made way through market got up to gun silenced then sir be furious shouted be liar master did seized by throat beat know be wrong master to say anything about rage be too great for to think what be saying then others ran in of course provost marshal came having once said of course repeated be wrong ah lo at same time can make allowance for indignation now that thing have begun must be gone through with provost will take man before sir claude macdonald will go too think between will get at truth of matter be ready belgian said wish to win honour reward from after risking life sir claude macdonald will soon see story be true have doubt will rex said have better go at once provost will have whole of legation here for crowd be rapidly gathering round when reached ambassador quarter provost went in first to acquaint with cause of dispute then others entered sir claude acknowledged rex salute then turning to belgian said a seem to have made first claim to honour will be obliged if will give account of how managed went out through back of russian embassy man said there be little tower close to corner be known to be full of chinese be full man said be asleep then passed through market place unobserved how be that sir claude asked only night before made sortie found place held in great force must have gone out man said saw none of then creeping very cautiously got to gun continued soldier there be also asleep silenced gun without difficulty how did do sir claude asked man hesitated poured water into touch hole from pitcher have brought with then returned way have come sir claude waved hand with gesture of contempt water must only have silenced gun for five minute said know of better way of silencing man hesitated might have thrown off carriage said be afraid of doing a might have awakened men must think must sir claude said quietly if have have strength of ten men must not have got over mr bateman will kindly give account of affair be sorry sir to give account at for have particularly ordered servant not to open lip on subject enraged at fellow preposterous claim however lost temper blurted out truth be very simple affair sir though not so simple own a gentleman exploit for did not find whole of chinese army asleep then related step have taken pursuit escape agree in particular with what master have said sir claude asked ah lo tell right just so that just how happen provost marshal sir claude said quietly take man out give three dozen well laid on for infamous attempt to gain credit reward at expense of others provost bowed left room with prisoner who began to howl for mercy now mr bateman sir claude said turning to rex hardly know whether to praise blame be third dangerous expedition have made on own account like others have be successful still a told on last occasion while shut up here although civilian be subject to military rule be strictly forbidden for anyone to leave circle of defence without permission for doing can not speak severely on other hand advantage have be attained by silencing gun be quite inestimable fire menaced defence most seriously if have continued many hour longer must have be exposed to desperate attack by half frenzied mob that attack might have repulsed might not assuredly must have taxed strength to utmost even if first have be unsuccessful second might not have be thank sir in name of whole of garrison foreign a well a british for service have rendered already defence have be so far repaired a to enable to withstand sudden attack very soon will be still stronger if succeed in winning deliverance holding out till relieving column arrives will be to small extent due to courage pluck must add considerably to pleasure to know that cousin be among who will benefit by bravery be greatly pleased honoured by approval sir rex said must very much rather that affair have not be known at carried out assuredly without wish of gaining credit simply for good of garrison must very greatly have preferred escaping talk congratulation that will now have to submit to sir claude smiled dear lad said be only right that great deed men do must be known if only a example to others if shrank from danger there must be few great deed know old saying to victor be wreath be only right that must be so be one thing to glorify to be glorified by others ah lo here be fifty guinea from a mark of approbation of manner in assisted master in carrying out undertaking in very short time story be known throughout residency rex received so many congratulation so much praise that determined to leave pekin a soon a possible try to join relieving column chapter x mission next morning there be serious alarm italian austrian fell back suddenly under strong violent attack have chinese pressed advantage fu must have fallen british legation have be laid open to attack on side fortunately on previous occasion japanese have made sham retreat having induced enemy to follow have then inflicted heavy loss upon fearing renewal of strategy chinese fell back italian commander be able to rally force reoccupy abandoned position result showed however that italian must not be trusted to hold ground without support consequently small body of british marine be added to garrison event caused almost a much excitement a return of native messenger sent out in morning by mr squiers of united state legation man reported that have gone out by one gate have come in by said there be soldier in chinese city that business be being carried on a usual inside chien mn gate by rex have entered city to prove statement brought in with couple of chicken few peach also reported that emperor empress be still in city that french native convert still held out at north cathedral while discussing matter afterwards rex said to sandwich report quite bear out what have said there be difficulty in going out of getting into city from north side seems to be so that doe not show that be at easy to enter forbidden city still le to reach empress question be where be prince ching seems to that be chap that want to get hold of be certain that disapproves altogether of proceeding of empress prince tung sound of firing have heard several time in city can only be accounted for by supposition that troop be fighting tung of course ching life somewhere in imperial city a northern cathedral stand in part there must be way of getting in be not thinking of carrying off be must like to carry tung off so that must stick up in prominent position send word that must cut head off if troop attacking did not withdraw have intention of doing carrying off be thinking that must be possible to take out message to ching of friendly character of course from sir claude be not quite such impossible business sandwich admitted though betting must be hundred to one against being able to see well of course must be difficult one must not say how difficult till one tried nevertheless a messenger went out morning came in again be evident that thing be going on pretty well a usual in town except round here that people walk about without being questioned interfered with rex thought matter over day while be at work after duty be over went into residency asked to see minister after waiting hour be shown in how be mr bateman sir claude said have not seen for past fortnight can do anything for well sir know that morning one of native under mr squiers went into town came out again safely minister nodded well sir what one man have done might do have thought that might like to communicate with prince ching must certainly like to do so if be possible in case sir must be glad to try to take communication to have passed out several time a chinaman without exciting slightest suspicion seems to that must at rate reach chings palace without special danger how must obtain audience with must of course depend upon circumstance must guide by when got there at say must succeed seems to that must be well worth trying if be desirous of communicating with be bold proposal mr bateman very bold proposal certainly must like to communicate with ching to learn from how really stand affected towards what empress intention be to what extent tung partisan influence of course must be joint letter signed by of usbut must be fearfully dangerous service a be at enmity with tung probably in bad repute with empress must be sure to be surrounded with guard soldier even if be to reach might not be safe at beginning of trouble certainly assured of regard did best to prevent tung boxer from attacking there be saying what opinion may be now seeing how far others have gone may have ceased to oppose might either have put to death hand over to empress be perfectly well aware that there be danger sir if there be chance of mission succeeding of conferring benefit upon here must be ready to undertake engage to deliver communication will at least do in power to do so everyone here be risking life half hour think must be risking mine to greater extent than officer in fu indeed at of barricade at rate mr bateman thank for offer will have a usual council evening of minister will discus offer with colleague have thought what character will go in must say chinese bonze buddhist priest seems to that in of must find easier to obtain access to than in other character except perhaps in of high class mandarin must be in several respect best must have to be attended by at least four men of course own man must be one others must be native got up in suitable attire must certainly be most appropriate perhaps a second third class mandarin with two attendant might succeed a well if went a first class mandarin might easily be recognized whereas a third class mandarin might have arrived from province so be unknown well will think over mr bateman must certainly be very glad to learn what chings real opinion be how far will be inclined to aid will look in again to night at ten oclock yes sir hope will have decided to make useful rex said nothing either to cousin to sandwich of offer have made have long talk with ah lo about dont think there will be difficulty in getting to king palace master can not say whether must get into palace ching will doubt always have people with if have what must say must not declare who be before others agree that must be difficulty must be afraid that must always have people with yes rather reckon upon there being crowd expect ante room must be full idea be that if possible must slip away from crowd gain private apartment so might meet after have given audience for day if found that impossible must have to pray when time to speak to came for private audience if demurred to must hand card on must be written in chinese that have come from sir claude macdonald implored private interview of course be possible that might order to be arrested be more likely that must see be just toss up if be really friendly to must be safe if on other hand have only be playing a so many of do play double part might send to tung empress for instant execution in case of course only chance must be that three men with must effect rescue that of course must depend on how many guard be sent with at appointed hour rex again went to quarter of british ambassador have talked matter over mr bateman be not mission that must think of asking anyone to undertake undoubtedly good might come of at rate will gather much valuable information therefore like to decline offer have made so to morrow morning will have letter to ching written what disguise have settled upon think sir mandarin of third fourth class must be most suitable only thing against be that have appropriate clothes mean of obtaining be afraid that might be so sir in case might either be buddhist priest whose garment must be made out of anything respectable land owner who might reasonably wish to hand in petition complaint of bad conduct on part of chings troop to ask for order of protection against must be certainly much easier so far a costume go land owner might very well have couple of armed retainer must must think have a good chance of obtaining audience a mandarin of low rank must be glad to have map of town sir in order may see exact position of prince palace be easy enough sir claude opened bureau drew out large map be chings palace said be a see by side of lake about way between northern cathedral bridge across lake

farmer ah lo have obtained similar weapon from heap of have be taken from enemy who have fallen in attack upon barricade rex directed chinaman to join ah lo in evening to keep by side passed evening a usual with friend next morning at four oclock put on disguise after others have gone to sleep have got up shaved head with exception of top knot to before starting fastened pigtail curled up under broad native hat placed pistol out of sight under girdle put on native sword then made way out to spot where ah lo other man be lying of be awake at once rose followed russian officer in charge of barricade made little demur at allowing to go out in spite of pas when rex made known to changed attitude officer looked at in surprise be well disguised indeed mr bateman said even knowing a well a do must not recognize be going on mission suppose yes be going to see what state of thing be in town keeping carefully in shadow of such house a be still standing rex followed by two men made way along noiselessly reaching tung pien mn passed out without interruption walked on till be near next gate when day have fairly broken country people have begun to arrive entered with then moved quietly along street looking into shop one paid slightest attention to there be many soldier about few boxer who appeared to have fallen quite into background since regular troop took siege in hand be supposed that have be sent out of city to be drilled disciplined by regular officer a men be far more turbulent than regular soldier whose conduct be orderly who in way interfered with populace disappearance greatly diminished danger of passage through street took little party two three hour to make circuit of wall of imperial city when arrived at gate near northern cathedral rex be glad to find that french priest christian convert be still holding out gallantly nevertheless must not help feeling great anxiety for position be certainly strong one seemed hardly possible that sufficient food must have be collected to enable to support during prolonged siege from point went round towards prince chings palace many soldier be loitering about in front of palace people of sortsofficers peasant merchant otherswere going in out leaving follower entered large hall question be asked after waiting short time went up to one of official desire audience with prince said well man said see how many there be before there be little chance that will get audience to day be urgent matter rex said slipped four tael into man hand official nodded significantly hour later showed into apartment where ching be sitting with two three secretary rex bowed to ground servant must request private audience said have letter of importance to submit to excellency pray that will receive in private after moment hesitation prince signed to secretary to withdraw highness rex continued a soon a be alone be not what seem have come a messenger from british minister a must not make way through street in own costume have be obliged to adopt disguise disguise be good prince said must certainly have taken for what pretend to be rex handed to minister letter prince read carefully be anxious said to bring about peace have kept soldier from joining in attack on legation unfortunately can do little more empress listens to advice of prince tung prince tuan hitherto at time have inclined towards advice unfortunately sympathy be other way at present however begin to doubt whether have be wise in incurring enmity of european power together have interview with last night pointed out that japan alone have in last war proved victorious over since then army have undoubtedly increased in strength have obtained large quantity of modern weapon have gained in discipline at same time be now opposed not by japanese alone by russian european power might be true overcome legation of what real benefit must be to before three month have passed army of overwhelming strength must advance against pekin force that must raise must have chance of victory against must be consequence must have to submit a have done in previous war to great loss of territory to payment of vast sum of money possibly even dynasty must be endangered empress listened to argument said that have gone too far now to draw back however said that must turn matter over in mind have seen considerable change in demeanour in last four five day up to time must not even listen to although have always shown great friendship for have expected day to be relieved from function failure of attempt of troop to capture legation a have be assured by adviser must do have preyed upon be restless irritable believe begin to doubt british minister begs to try to intervene again bring about truce until at rate course of event at tientsin be seen at present there be hard fighting going on round that place be difficult even for to know what be passing for naturally commander get best of matter be certain however that be not gaining ground that in very short time many troop will come up from ship be to see empress again evening will use effort to get to order that hostility will cease for present can point out that can not lose by so doing provision must be running short people if find that relief can come to will be forced to surrender without further fighting will urge upon that continued repulse of attack can dishearten troop in respect will benefit by cessation of fighting think that be more more coming to doubt whether have acted wisely in allowing prince tung others of party to influence week ago have lost influence over now although be by mean restored to favour listens to with more patience well will tell minister like to write to because may be detected seized on way back that be still friendly to will do best evening to bring about cessation of hostility say that although may fail time feel sure that attack will cease in course of day two for know that there be considerable discontent amongst troop at loss that be suffering failure to make headway be also greatly dissatisfied with leader say that if be ordered to attack at once instead of merely firing from distance must certainly succeed will say to british minister that most cordially reciprocate assurance of good will trust in future may again have pleasure of meeting personally if be successful evening will take mean to inform that serious attack will cease say that there may be more firing for troop be very much out of hand can not leave boxer out of account there may therefore be desultory firing real attack unless indeed army be advancing against in case fear there will be renewal of hard fighting in first place because troop will be worked up to state of fury in second because prince tung others will desire above thing to get occupant of legation into power to use a hostage for obtaining good term for be indeed greatly obliged to highness said rex may ask if will place signature to petition of mine that farm be to be respected by body of troop boxer will secure passage out of town if must be interrogated wise precaution prince said a attached signature to paper be brave young man what be name name be bateman rex replied be not resident of pekin be only here because brought two young lady relation of mine from chafui where be in danger of being slain father mother other member of missionary settlement having be already murdered flash of amusement passed over usually impassive face of prince heard said that governor yamen be burned report of affair stated that two female captive who be to have be executed on following day perished be possible that have hand in rex smiled have little to do with highness can assure that two captive did not perish there will ask question prince said be clear that be brave young man trust happens here will escape rex now took leave people in ante room looked at with curiosity not without hostility because of time that interview have lasted passed out quietly however without looking to right left made way towards cathedral where be joined by follower have vague hope that might be able to communicate with besieged in cathedral learn state of supply found that investment of place be complete cathedral adjoining building however be very strong felt sure that must repel attack that if yielded must be to famine making way through town be more than once stopped questioned by body of soldier story supported a be by prince chings signature to petition at once removed suspicion sallied out through si chi mn without hindrance remained in field until after dark then entered by tung pien mn made way along foot of wall in chinese city till reached end of legation street shot be being exchanged with such frequency that did not dare to go farther so follower lay down in ruin of american methodist building towards morning firing having ceased crawled forward to within fifty yard of barrier then standing up ran forward rex shouting dont fire be englishman who be asked sergeant at post name be bateman said rex have be to town on mission from british minister well have better climb over whoever be sergeant said can question when get inside will be shot in le than time if stop there a spoke rifle cracked out ball struck stone within inch two of rex head follower scrambled over barricade with alacrity having satisfied guard of identity passed on through russian legation to british head quarter went straight to room occupied by student half of comrade be away on guard sandwich be in so be back again bateman sandwich exclaimed have a many life a cat well have run risk time have scarce have question asked since left there be really reason why native from here shouldnt go regularly into city providing can get rid of whatever be that show that be christian mean to say that really have interview with prince ching yes have really done so found very civil old chinaman very well disposed towards be going to try to bring about armistice a soon a rex have changed clothes went to minister related to interview have have with prince ching be greatly obliged to mr bateman what tell confirms view that have along held that ching of other chinese official be altogether opposed to proceeding of prince tung can only hope that influence will time prevail that chinese will grant armistice dont suppose that agreement will be well kept at least will have easier time of be probable that stirring event be going on at tientsin know that taku fort have be taken chinese may be willing to hold hand until see result must know that provision here will run short soon a lose heavily in fight must be easier for to wait let famine do work two hour later bugle be blown man came in with letter from prince ching saying that heard with gratification that foreign minister be well that now requested to take family member of staff leave legation in detachment officer must be waiting to give strict protection temporary accommodation must be found for in tsung li yamen pending future arrangement for return home in order that friendly relation might be preserved minister be agreed that although invitation must certainly not be accepted be proof that chinese considered impossible to capture legation for time at least further serious attack must be made directly meeting of minister be over decision known rex went to see sir claude macdonald have come to ask for permission to make way out be convinced from what ching have said that there will be no more very serious fighting until perhaps relief force move forward when may make last desperate attempt to capture place father mother be at tientsin where be anxious to rejoin have fear whatever of being unable to get down report of situation here may have much influence upon starting of relief force be most essential that must not be made in inadequate force be certain that advance must be met with whole strength of chinese army be not contemptible failure of attempt must be most disastrous for here yes be most important minister said a must defend here for little time be better that column must not advance until be strong enough to overcome opposition after have already done have doubt that will be able to get into tientsin without difficulty when do propose to start a soon a be dark sir will make way out by tung pien gate follow canal for distance then strike for river will walk night lie up during next day get near tientsin by following morning will then see best way to enter will hardly do in two night walking man be good walker sir must be about five forty mile night think that can do be most anxious to get home after leaving minister rex went to girl be going away again said can leave now without anxiety for be convinced that chinese can never take place will come up with next relief column be very sorry that be going rex really do such rash thing here that think will be safer away if remain will have volunteering next to carry empress off there be rashness in going into city jenny be dressed just like everyone else attracted attention whatever there be little danger in going down to tientsin though there may be risk perhaps in getting into town at rate can leave here with confidence if thought that there be doubt about must take down with now must be at least five day instead of two risk must therefore be much greater if place must be besieged might find quite impossible to get in must much rather stay here be very busy be happy to be of use everyone be very kind to get on much better now than before came to hospital for have time to think grieve over past so be going to night yes will start directly coast be clear will go out a came in of course if there be heavy firing must wait rex ah lo succeeded in slipping out of pekin without attracting attention set out in direction of tientsin with possible speed have not gone far however before be compelled to hide from band of boxer happened several time within very short period rex at last decided that must be safer for if be to proceed by different route at first ah lo must not consent to course in end rex argument prevailed having arranged to meet at point near tientsin shook hand separated hour later rex be lying among bush near river where have thrown down to rest when suddenly stillness be broken by deep roar rex started cold shudder ran through be not acquainted with roar of tiger have doubt what be while be chatting together one day father have told that tiger be by mean uncommon especially in jungle country near river although occasionally carried off cattle be seldom that meddled with native felt doubt however that animal have heard be tiger have probably be disturbed by firing movement of number of armed men thought that be probably unusually hungry came across mind listened eagerly when presently heard stealthy footfall drew pistol from belt threw down for remembered having heard that tiger prefer living quarry to carrion have not lain thus long before heard animal breathing heavily came closer closer must hear snuffing from head to foot then placed paw upon weight be great rex who be lying on face still kept perfectly quiet held breath for a long a possible then took breath a gently a silently a must then felt animal remove paw begin to walk round round remembered now that river be ten yard away that if must get start might possibly escape while be considering advisability of making dash for tiger returned seized by shoulder fortunately rex have on thick cloak though pain be considerable animal be apparently only endeavouring to find out whether be dead strain however be too great to be borne long felt that at moment animal might bite in earnest that movement on part must certainly cause to do so quietly gradually moved arm upwards tiger gave angry growl a did so felt pressure of teeth increasing there be time for hesitation now raised arm gradually to level of tiger eye fired with sudden roar tiger leapt back rex be on foot in instant making dash for river threw in moment later tiger be on bank fell in close to swam about confusedly until at last regained bank there stood roaring be evident to rex that have partially wholly blinded struck out down stream few stroke showed that be so completely shaken by ordeal have gone through that must not long support at moment saw that there be junk lying ahead of number of chinaman on board be shouting gesticulating a watched began to fire in direction of tiger roar rex swam round to other side of junk unseen by excited native then feeling too exhausted to go farther climbed up by mean of oar have be left in position by rower diving down open hatchway threw on something hard below a lay there must hear tiger roar terribly a sound decreased knew that animal be moving away firing presently ceased talking of chinese continued rex guessed that be discussing who have fired shot heard boat row ashore after time returned having found sign of tiger supposed victim when returned din gradually subsided became quiet again by time rex have recovered shoulder be almost powerless managed to crawl back to hatchway raising looked out chinaman be sitting about on deck cooking others smoking little pipe thought probable that after excitement of night must remain up till morning in case risk of discovery be great doubtless might hide in cargo until be discharged might not be for day be anxious in extreme to reach tientsin a soon a possible therefore resolved to escape at once guessed that with exception of who have gone ashore in boat men must not have reloaded firearm once ashore must be able to distance several chinaman be sitting between hatch bulwark climbing cautiously on deck reached side of vessel in couple of stride sprang overboard before anyone noticed there be lull of surprise among chinese then confused jabbering followed by several musket shot rex have dived having swum under water a long a must hold breath felt sure when came up that must no longer be distinctly seen in darkness then heard of men try to move boat again instead of making direct for shore swam along parallel to knowing that boat must go great deal faster than must swim heard shout of men a landed then turning swam for other side when reached bank crawled among bush lay down for time remained without moving suddenly sprang to foot tiger have begun to howl again be short distance from knew that even if brute sight be entirely destroyed scent must bring towards having much more fear of tiger than of men again jumped into river must hear shout of chinese judged by number that have be joined by many of companion on junk remained in water till morning dawned when savage yell told that have be discovered by chinese on other side roar of tiger have ceased must hear low moanings not far off nevertheless felt that if be to escape must risk encounter with animal therefore made for shore again climbed up on bank looking back a did so saw that chinese be leaping into boat then without further delay dashed in among tree when reached other side of jungle saw to dismay large number of chinese soldier in village three hundred yard away crept back again therefore among bush keeping just inside moved cautiously along taking utmost pain not to show sign of presence after proceeding hundred yard so in way approached edge looked out number of chinese be just issuing from bush one of at once ran across towards village rex moved forward again time leaving edge plunging into heart of jungle illustration there be lull of surprise then confused jabbering followed by several musket shot chinese must not knew have recognized a white man extraordinary conduct in hiding in junk unusual method adopted of leaving must have shown that at rate be not one of must perhaps have suggested to that be going down with message from pekin be presently aware by loud shouting at least of soldier have joined in pursuit strip of jungle be of great width a must not therefore hope to escape by keeping to made way back towards river when made bank again saw to satisfaction that boat in pursuer have crossed be lying only fifty yard away with one chinaman sitting in man decided must be silenced at cost for must give alarm moment be in water therefore approached a quietly a possible keeping among bush until be opposite to boat chinaman be evidently listening for be standing up in boat attention probably attracted by slight rustle rex have made in coming along rex gathered together sprang suddenly into boat grasping chinaman by throat rolling with upon floorboard must have shot easily enough knew that sound must draw pursuer to spot so defeat purpose chinaman be powerful man rex have taken grip of throat that be unable to shake off desperate conflict continued for minute two then chinaman struggle grew more feeble colour became almost black little eye began to stare indeed seemed at point of death rex be reluctant to kill man so bound arm tightly to side with rope found in boat stuffed mouth be piece of cloth cut from man own coat then leaving lying senseless in bottom seized one of oar a channel be willow be able to punt across a did so noted with satisfaction that junk be so far away that on board must take for native on reaching other side jumped ashore pushed boat out into stream with strength then turning made off a fast a must go after covering two mile reached edge of jungle here halted for felt that must not continue journey by day without danger of discovery threw down on ground event of last few hour have completely exhausted now discovered that have lost bag of provision probably have left where tiger have attacked be great misfortune for have still calculated at least thirty mile to pas before reached tientsin might be kept time outside place before must enter waited until late in afternoon then felt that must have food therefore started again on journey at last after hesitating several time determined to risk everything recharged revolver waiting till night have quite fallen made way into nearest village congratulated more than ever that be able to speak chinese knew that dialect differed so much in various part of country although peasant might see that be not native of district must not guess that be other than chinaman therefore entered house where light be burning said be sorely in need of feed will sell occupant of cottage be old man old woman at word looked up in surprise where do come from woman asked come from north said be bearer of message to general at tientsin have travelled long way be hungry be boxer old man asked replied letter be from empress well well old man said make difference to did see boxer on side of river a came along said rex be on other side old man heaved sigh of relief be terrible people said though fight against white devil plunder kill poor villager who have nothing to do with affair act badly rex said be because know that kill before questioning be travelling on side of river do well peasant said be true that have mercy have now in village several who have barely escaped with life from by swimming across river have told terrible tale of doings be hungry wife will cook rice do mind shutting door rex asked there might be someone in village who wishing to curry favour with boxer might go bring of over if saw stranger here will do so old man said suiting action to word for although think that there be none in village who must do so treacherous act yet be a well to take precaution old woman set rice to boil over small fire while old man chatted with rex in twenty minute rice be ready sitting down made hearty meal congratulating that during journey with girl have learned to eat with chopstick have just finished when door opened man wearing badge of boxer entered room bring out what food have fellow said roughly of there be many of in village be of use making resistance want to eat ourselves to carry there be here back to comrade who be son of yours old man said be stranger bear message from empress for general at tientsin let see man demanded be strange that must come round way instead of going straight message be to general rex said give to one else how be to know that story be true boxer said be not way that messenger from empress must come if sent one must not be by fellow like empress entrust message to peasant believe be spy from white devil at pekin cant help what believe rex said quietly do mean to quarrel with will therefore say to leave alone will leave alone message message boxer said will soon satisfy drew sword rex listened moment through open door must hear great din commotion musket be being discharged flame be bursting out from among cottage feeling therefore that sound of pistol must hardly attract attention raised weapon a boxer rushed at shot man through head old peasant wrung hand will kill cried will show mercy quick help to carry body out at back door to lay down by wall body will not be noticed there then advise wife to fly at once hide in jungle few hundred yard away there be fear of finding in morning can come out again if a be most likely have gone old man seized dead boxer by leg while rex took by head together removed from house then old couple hurried away after rex have money into man hand will go far to build up cottage again said be hardly likely that will burn when find empty so saying turned away continued journey have gone couple of mile when came suddenly upon group of peasant who be anxiously watching light in sky who be shouted a seized be stranger in part be on way down from pekin said have come to warn that boxer be near at hand be pretty tale one of said derisively there be doubt that be spy of boxer come on in advance to know whether village be worth plundering besides know that boxer have not yet crossed river can assure that have light see there come from village three mile away have plundered set on fire nice story spokesman of party said how then did get away to give word if be not sent forward a spy be staying there overnight said while be eating supper village be attacked fled will not do fine fellow there be doubt that be boxer spy at least one of cursed band will die haul along fellow men dragged rex to village be hundred yard away there be tied to post while villager debated what death must die be not pleasant to rex to hear detail of execution discussed one more horrible than finally decided to burn alive be bringing faggot out of house for purpose when sound of shouting clashing of weapon be borne towards on quiet night air listen shouted boxer be coming everyone stood for moment a still a statue then wild cry arose of boxer boxer in instant rex persecutor have fled to snatch prized valuable in house to fly before boxer arrived a soon a have left rex struggled to free from bond fortunately cord have not be tightly fastened after prolonged desperate effort freed one hand rest be comparatively easy just a boxer be entering village tore free ran at top of speed till felt that be safe then threw down exhausted have have hard day of indeed said once mauled by tiger three time nearly taken by boxer if get through safely be not likely to leave tientsin again until come up with relieving army have have more narrow escape to day than have have in life have wish for repetition of be not sure if prefer tiger to fanatical boxer after lying for fully hour got up continued way towards tientsin rest of journey be uneventful at appointed spot met ah lo who have managed to get down without adventure after mutual congratulation made hearty meal off provision ah lo have be fortunate enough to get at house of old friend rex while recounting experience when have finished cautiously approached town working down to east saw that heavy firing be going on from large building have be chinese military college in other part of town military college showed sign of having be heavily cannonaded be evident said rex that fellow have taken that place that chinese be attacking must wait till night then try make way in hope that place be held by british troop for if be occupied by troop who dont understand english be likely to be shot a approach accordingly lay down at edge of patch of high corn at present said rex men be taking offensive firing on other side of river be on outside of settlement admiral seymour force cant have retired beyond tientsin must be holding place for certainly local european must not have be strong enough to make sortie to have captured that chinese college be that else troop must have come up from taku truth be that fifteen hundred russian have arrived after admiral seymour force have started be fortunate indeed that have not arrived in time to join for if have tientsin must not have made successful resistance day firing went on where lay must see that not only boxer regular chinese troop be taking part in attack several time enemy made rush almost up to college time quailed before heavy fire turned back at fighting ceased rex companion left hiding place made way round to river below military college on side attack have be made group of men be sitting about talking together by exercising great caution succeeded in avoiding at last approached college when got nearer rex shouted be englishman with message from pekin dont fire right mate came back in hearty voice must just stop where be until officer minute later voice shouted how many be there of only one servant right come on a englishman must be friend couple of minute later rex ah lo entered college officer with two men lantern met may be englishman officer said look very unlike one if hadnt disguised must not have got down here rex said with laugh name be bateman be son of merchant here went up with admiral seymour expedition left when came to stand still made way into pekin where have relation be holding out all right officer asked eagerly news have come down for past ten day isnt seymour there be sorry to say be not hasnt got back here have not heard of since started be bad news indeed be getting very short of provision when left heard firing a came down to day ten mile out know that there be big chinese arsenal out there only hope have taken be defending pekin be safe still yes have be fighting hard for past three week garrison can hold out for time longer chinese be gradually gaining ground french legation be nearly destroyed so be american russian be good deal damaged hope however that fighting have stopped for present if go on again will have to take to british settlement now how can get across well cant get to bridge now only plan be to take native boatseveral of be lying on shoreand row across be going to blow up place to night level to ground men be at work mining only took because command more le street running from water when have levelled will probably return again to other side of course before going will also burn down chinese house on side of river chapter xi fight at tientsin rex crossed river with ah lo made way to mr batemans be received with delight father mother showered question upon a to state of thing in pekin there have be lot of miscellaneous fighting said chinese have not made many determined assault in case have be readily beaten off attack be slackening off now think chinese be getting pretty sick of when left garrison girl be quite well be working a assistant to lady who undertakes cooking for hospital therefore get think rather better food than most people at rate look very well do think that siege have be good for for have not have time to mope over death of father mother a must have done have brought down here when be over horrible business will seem to age back indeed seems so to already can hardly believe that be not much more than three week since got out now father how have be getting on here well fighting only began two day ago have be pretty hot since then everyone who can carry gun have be taking part in defence have barricaded end of street dont think must have held out long if hadnt be for russian who came up after seymour left by way what be news of expected to hear ten day ago of arrival at pekin never got up there father told that thought wouldnt when started only took with provision for six day a railway be everywhere pulled up have difficulty in taking even that with dont know how far got be certainly nowhere near pekin believe be now besieged at arsenal eight mile out heard heavy firing in direction when came along last night of course have idea then a to what be have doubt now must go at once tell whoever be in command russian colonel be at head of affair in virtue of seniority of rank of being in command of strongest force here dont think know english speaks french will ask thompson who know speaks that language fluently to accompany to house with act a interpreter expect more troop up to morrow have doubt that a soon a have given assailant here good thrashing will send out relief party to seymour mr thompson readily agreed to accompany proceeded together to house of colonel wogack senior officer in tientsin when sent in word that messenger have arrived from pekin be at once admitted colonel have just finished dinner have with colonel anisimoff lieutenant colonel shirinsky rex have changed clothes before starting mr thompson introduced to general a gentleman who have just made way down from pekin what be news sir colonel asked in french rex related state of affair in legation be much better than have hoped colonel said warmly have be in greatest anxiety about position several rumour have reached that legation have fallen be bearer of message for from minister sir came down in disguise have be seized searched paper of kind must have ensured death sir claude macdonald however bade give full account of position of fighting so far assure that although provision be beginning to run short must maintain for time yet have heard anything sir about relieving force went up with left at fantail made way into pekin bringing only news that have received of column sir on way down heard heavy firing in direction of hsi ku arsenal only explanation of occurs to be that arsenal have be captured by admiral seymour that be besieged there why do not think that may be besieging colonel said sharply because sir only have three day provision when left must have be in state of starvation when arrived at arsenal admiral seymour must therefore attack for sake of store contained a must no doubt lose heavily must not be in position to cut way down here very well reasoned sir a soon a can spare force from here will go out to relieve now will kindly give full detailed account of fighting at pekin state of resource there may ask if speak chinese colonel certainly have resided for year in pekin then in case sir rex said will tell in language a story be long one will be tedious to translate sentence by sentence must certainly be more convenient colonel said rex then told story at length be saved much time in explaining nature of defence from colonel knowledge of ground russian officer made several comment here there why did not hold custom house asked be strong building short distance from fu yes sir believe that be considered that force be barely sufficient to hold legation indeed occupation of fu be to extent afterthought be necessitated by great number of christian chinese who came in for shelter for whom be absolutely impossible to provide in legation be for same reason that austrian italian dutch legation pekin club be abandoned portion of french legation have be destroyed also part of fu then related incident of day fighting be bank held a well a legation russian asked yes line of defence went round back side of legation russian bank to tartar wall on other side did not reach tartar narration occupied more than hour at end colonel wogack thanked rex very warmly for information be most valuable especially that part relating to admiral seymour expedition hope will get more messenger through to pekin for be clear that up to time left chinese be gradually gaining ground have abundance of artillery if be to bring into play must breach wall defence in dozen place in course of twelve hour what tell of visit to prince ching affords certain amount of hope there be never depending on chinaman to morrow other party may get upper hand again fighting go on more earnestly than ever matter here have become much more serious in course of past day so until taku fort be taken chinese regular troop held aloof from boxer now chinese regular troop have joined boxer be likely to have hot work of on way home rex told father what colonel have said yes said in opinion of good many men summons to fortress to surrender be mistake up till that time affair might have be considered a insurrection indeed chinese troop several time fought boxer attack on taku fort be considered by chinese a declaration of war on part of power dont say that there be not great deal to be said way there be always danger that chinese must unite against especially a empress openly upheld boxer in case be certain that available force on board ship must not have sufficed to fight way up here consequently tientsin must have fallen pekin also be therefore most difficult question to decide attack on taku fort certainly have effect of uniting chinese against have attack not be made have be delayed must probably have have chinese against with inadequate force to oppose tientsin pekin must have be lost life of european in sacrificed come in mr thompson must get rex to go over narrative for benefit need not be so full a gave to colonel in first place because dont know position of legation so detail must be lost on in next place because be getting late rex have already have long day of be not however till past midnight rex finished turned into bed be awakened hour later by series of loud explosion told that sailor be engaged in blowing up military college in morning rex learned more of what have taken place boxer have set fire to several place in native city to railway station be beaten off train be despatched to tong ku filled with woman child rest be ordered to take shelter in gordon large municipal building in british section next night boxer renewed attack on railway station be again repulsed on following day be joined by chinese troop from time communication with taku be cut off day military college be taken incessant fusillade be going on when rex awoke somewhat late next morning dressed hastily hurried downstairs what be up father be attacking again have occupied college that blew up last night be now keeping up heavy fire from shelter when get dark be going to barricade end of street a must be impossible for to move out of house during day municipality have already met morning have be decided that good in store house with exception of valuable one will be given up for purpose fortunately there be great quantity of sack of wool rice of will do admirably for purpose greater part of volunteer be occupied in house at end of street where answer fire of enemy chinese never show did notice state of river a crossed last night father be just a well that didnt boy for be full of corps thousand of chinese must have be massacred in native city of doubt people who be supposed to be favourable to uscoolies employed here relation shopkeeper who have supplied with small necessary perhaps of better class who have ventured opinion hostile to boxer be horrible business lad troop be so furious at sight that may give little quarter when table be turned take town be worst of war in country chinese never give quarter a result little be given on side men may possibly be kept in hand doubt whether russian german french will be restrained rex at once put on uniform took rifle joined party who behind hastily thrown up barricade be trying to keep down chinese fire with exception day be comparatively quiet european not engaged in combating chinese fire be employed with sailor marine in erecting barricade while russian held outpost next morning chinese opened fire with two field gun posted on railway embankment opposite to british section commander beattie of barfleur with three company of sailor be sent across river to try to silence chinese sheltered behind mud wall intersected ground in direction poured in so heavy fire that attempt have to be abandoned commander beattie three of officer being wounded nine pounder gun be then brought up to river bank front under command of lieutenant wright of orlando opened fire upon two chinese gun maintained so rapidly with such excellent aim that chinese gun be withdrawn lieutenant wright however be mortally wounded by bursting shell most of chinese gun be placed in yamen fort forty five of being in position there there be also battery of seven gun in canal two mile from railway station couple of gun within thousand yard of couple behind ruin of military college besides there be several sand bag battery along bank of river between french settlement native city in city wall in arsenal now opened fire from different position be able to cannonade settlement from direction din be incessant many of house speedily became ruin unfortunately besieged have few gun to meet having only seven twelve pounder russian gun of obsolete pattern new fifteen pounder maxim nordenfeldt have just arrived be of little use a there be very few round of ammunition to fit for week position be grave in extreme defending force be constantly engaged enemy swarmed round though made numerous demonstration never attempted anything like determined attack in one attack enemy set fire to building in fourteen place burnt down roman catholic cathedral greater portion of french station nearly succeeded in capturing railway station be held by russian day by day situation became more serious there have be communication with coast for nearly ten day enemy daily became more daring attack be repulsed with ever increasing difficulty then one of volunteer mr watt offered to ride through chinese line by night knew country well believed must get through service be desperate one russian general gave two cossack a escort might be of use if fell in with very small party of enemy a must not speak language must be of little other service comrade gave hearty farewell when left never expecting to see again nevertheless almost by miracle succeeded in getting through carrying news to fleet that position at tientsin be becoming desperate that maintained with greatest difficulty that ammunition be fast giving out time be lost two thousand menbritish american russiansbringing with two russian battery of six fifteen pounder krupp be at once landed russian be commanded by general stssel american by major waller naval brigade by commander craddock captain mullins force also included four hundred welsh fusilier under major morris portion of chinese regiment from wei hai wei under lieutenant colonel bowyer be terrible journey railway have be completely destroyed heat be overpowering enemy though did not venture to make open attack kept up constant fire upon nevertheless toiled on unflinchingly at last reached tientsin to delight of inhabitant who now found in position to defy attack rex have be continually at one of barricade fire from two gun concealed among house have be particularly galling accurate rex with two of comrade have often talked over possibility of silencing on twenty second rex said well mean to go out to night see if can not stop fire of gun be two fellow disposed to go with certainly if think there be shadow of chance think that there be very good chance see chinese gun always stop fire between ten at night four in morning be true that sniping go on night showing that there be skirmisher out that time if must pas through be safe for there be doubt that artilleryman serving gun lie down go to sleep have chinese disguise talking language a do feel sure can get through will take man ah lo with two might be quite enough if be not that gunner probably lie down close to piece if woke up before have driven spike in made rush might fail in object for reason must like to have two more if be willing to come young men expressed willingness to go one of saying however that neither of spoke chinese well enough to pas doe not matter rex replied must of course be better for to go through in two party join when have passed skirmishing line ah lo can go with one of can go with other so that if be stopped questioned can do talking yes will make right other said there be difficulty about disguise there be still cooly here now what ought to take must take heavy hammer spike also thick felt wad to put on top of nail when strike so that can practically spike gun without making noise in addition have better take brace of revolver sword so that can make pretty tough fight must be attacked still if be discovered after have finished work must take to heel rather than to arm in case think must be wise instead of making at once for camp to run to one of house night will be dark in confusion chinese will not at first realize what have happened before recover will probably be out of sight if get good start there be little fear that will be overtaken even if must come upon skirmisher be sure to be very scattered can shoot down before realize who be what have be up to then there will only be short run risk of chance bullet before be safe behind barricade well seems plain enough really dont see why must not be managed have doubt in least that must be managed rex said confidently there be only two real difficulty one be to make way through skirmisher without being detected other be to find gun in dark yes will be serious difficulty one of chinese house be just like a gun be good thousand yard away chance be that must not find can manage rex said after moment thought to day will put lantern on barricade ask middy in charge to let remain there telling what want for then will go back fifty hundred yard place lantern in window in position that when be going in direct line for gun light of first will cover that of second be splendid idea bateman will certainly get over difficulty be wonderful chap to plan thing well feel sure now that will succeed if only can make way through sniping beggar lantern be obtained rex went with to barricade officer in command there be midshipman of orlando rex have have several chat with during past few day hello bateman said what be up to with lantern at hour going to look for subterranean mine will tell what be going to do must keep secret sort of objection might be raised enemy must get to know what be up to can trust well then be going out to night to spike two gun over there have be doing so much mischief for past two day be by jove must like to go with of course cant have got to stick here happens till thing be over how be going to do four of be going out there be doubt fellow who work gun go to sleep between ten four so have fair chance to go up spike gun before wake of course difficulty will be to get through fellow who keep watch night for have to trust to chance will carry pistol if come across one two men can use without attracting attention a anyone who heard shot must naturally think that of own men be sniping that seems good enough middy said what on earth have got lantern for do mean to march out with to show way not exactly rex laughed then explained plan to middy first rate jolly good idea said friend gun be somewhere along ruin over there fire three four minute just at present a far a can make out be pounding french settlement must think line must be somewhere about house fifty yard behind will go stand there rex said watch for next shot be most important to get lantern in exact line because if once got among house in dark might search for hour before found position likely enough might fall over of sleeping boxer be not boxer midshipman said be regular troop gun be krupp boxer have gun of sort will go back with two eye be better than one there be only flash to guide for be using smokeless powder went back to point that have suggested stood looking earnestly till saw flash agreed that be five six yard too much to left accordingly moved little in direction five minute after saw flash be just about right rex said there be window just overhead house look to a if be empty at rate will go in see turned out to be a thought all right will leave lantern in house light a come along will be about twelve oclock will be glad if will keep eye upon light see that burn steadily probably will not require attention at same time a success of job depends upon keeping alight be a well to run risk there be perhaps more fear of one on barricade coming to grief than of one of sailor might topple over neednt be afraid of will put man to sit by side of rather to sit down behind in shelter for bullet whistle pretty close over point sometimes must be very good plan rex said if must get to put hat in front of take away again about quarter of minute so a to make light twinkle see there be good many light in house at night at distance might easily make mistake if one be to be kept flashing must hardly go wrong good idea again bateman will see that be done be there anything else well think that after have be gone five minute must be advantage if must make men fire dozen shot sniper must be sure to answer at once must then get idea of situation probably be able to avoid that will be done said middy danger will of course be in spiking gun be so will be in disguise so that if stumble over of in dark will only be taken for of own fellow will carry hammer spike felt wad inch thick so that when find gun will be able to spike without making noise do know mechanism of krupp gun well then must only be going out on fool errand must not be able to spike if did must have difficulty in cutting spike off by taking breech block out best plan must be to get breech block out carry away must probably be too heavy to carry far if be to get out take short distance away might hide among ruin cover over with rubbish must effectually put out of action until go out capture place look here have got pocket book with yes well then can show roughly action of gun how to open breech get block out when grasp that will find difficulty in doing if coach fellow who be going with how be done see action must be quite noiseless though must take good bit longer than spiking must not be very important if find fellow asleep thank be very much obliged to must have be horrible sell to find when got there that after must hing went together to barricade sat down in a comfortable spot a must find then midshipman drew plan of breech action explained minutely to rex how worked how must proceed to get out wedge stopper in evening when others came off duty rex brought home taking up into room explained to what be to be done knew that be useless to attempt to get ah lo to understand must only have to put hand on part to be operated upon get ah lo to apply strength to even if cant get out breech block find too heavy to carry away must be sufficient must say to take out wedge stopper carry off for doubt whether must be able to replace part at rate must only do so after several day delay must be good deal gained at quarter to twelve rex ah lo set out on arriving at barricade found two companion already there lantern be lighted at once set out advanced until judged that be near line of sniper then lay down have scarcely done so when defender of barrier opened fire directly afterwards a rex have expected chinese ahead replied shot be pretty close together seemed to show that chinese there be in group rex companion immediately set off again after proceeding about hundred yard to right again went forward have muffled shoe with strip of blanket before starting treading very cautiously to avoid stumbling against stone other obstacle went quietly forward holding pistol in readiness for action stooping low met with interruption party on left be still firing found one ahead of gradually moved towards left until chinese sniper be behind have two lantern in line went on faster now till knew that must be near house for night be so dark that must not even see outline looking frequently back to be sure that be keeping exact line proceeded steadily at last came upon wall evidently remains of house from point moved forward foot by foot until felt that be far enough among ruin then scattered little until to delight came upon gun listening intently must hear sound of heavy breathing snoring short distance ahead judged that chinese must be lying fifteen yard away drew together round one of gun felt breech here be handle of lever rex whispered opening breech took out wedge stopper then moved to other gun completed operation have finished be moving off when one of stumbled fell chinaman startled by sound exclaimed who be there what be doing making reply however hurried on making two three turn among ruin be soon in open again keep along still farther to left rex said a there be sudden shout behind evidently wakeful chinaman have got up to investigate cause of disturbance have discovered that gun have be tampered with a spoke chorus of yell came from direction of gun look here rex said here be pile of earth where wall have fallen let shove thing in here cover up be precious heavy cant do fighting until have got rid of suggestion be sooner made than be carried out kneeling down rapidly scraped hole in debris carefully hid portion of gun have carried off a did so must hear rush of shouting men behind have better follow rex said doubt will scatter along line will then have good chance of getting through accordingly retraced step joined pursuer mob of chinaman scattered a advanced halted to make enquiry when reached sniping line a men here declared that one have passed great bulk went on to right left rex whispered to ah lo who exclaimed may have run on will see if cant overtake with companion passed on at run be straight sailing now guiding lantern be in front of at top of speed ran down towards be challenged a approached barricade for chinese have opened heavy random fire right rex shouted dont fire do minute later companion climbed barricade well have succeeded midshipman asked yes thanks to advice have disabled gun have not brought piece with have buried in ruin where be certainly not likely to be discovered fighting have not have to draw trigger well done heard terrible din right out in direction feared that have be captured have done business before got alarm be able to make off without being seen then joined rushed in pursuit of ourselves when scattered in direction kept straight on shouting that must overtake fugitive well have done first rate job a result will have comparatively quiet time to morrow for shot generally struck near will report affair rex said have agreed that will say nothing about might get blowing up for acting without order dont want praise be well satisfied to have silenced troublesome gun went quietly back to home next day have pleasure of hearing remark of surprise satisfaction at silence of two gun have be so troublesome that morning relief force under command of lieutenant colonel shirinsky sallied out to assistance of admiral seymour day passed in comparative quietness at tientsin time being employed by troop inhabitant in strengthening barricade chinese who be of course aware of large reinforcement have arrived on previous day be probably anticipating attack remained inactive only few shot be fired into settlement during day having nothing else to do rex wandered over settlement be surprised to see enormous damage have be effected by chinese gun french settlement have be almost entirely destroyed by fire shot damage greatly exceeding that have be inflicted on british settlement many of house have suffered terribly municipal building have be struck many time being solidly built have suffered only from heavier missile house facing river be riddled with musket ball many have be badly knocked about by chinese gun on opposite side loss of life however have be particularly small inhabitant feeling that worst be over congratulated that have not be more serious rex learned that heaviest fighting have taken place round railway station point be guarded jointly by force of japanese french british japanese french being stationed on platform in station building while british with maxim held engine house fighting lasted day night for several day in succession enemy making engine house special object of attack endeavouring to silence maxim by planting two nine pounder in clump of tree le than twelve hundred yard away fire be so accurate that men who be not working gun have to lie down in ash pit between rail plank being placed across opening to give protection one day chinese put eight shell into wall within space of twenty foot killing wounding seventeen of welsh fusilier who be at time on guard french japanese erected sand bag barricade along platform lying down on rail behind fired through loophole once twice fighting be so close a to be nearly hand to hand between station russian camp be undefended gap of quarter of mile studded thickly with chinese graf afforded excellent cover enabled boxer to advance to within short distance of station one night indeed number of boxer managed to creep up unseen getting behind empty truck standing by siding cut off french in station british in engine house be moment of great peril fortunately sikh of hong kong regiment who be coming out to relieve blue jacket marine saw situation attacked enemy fierce fight lasting three hour ensued sikh showing greatest courage presence of mind assailant be in end driven off with heavy loss ally however also suffered heavily casualty occurred chiefly among french japanese amounting to nearly hundred fifty boxer who have be armed with rifle from arsenal also showed great courage many time sallying out from between truck charging with fixed bayonet weapon of whose use knew so little that on number of rifle picked up after fight be still fixed in scabbard british club have be turned into hospital at first be found to be great deal too exposed in position wounded be removed into gordon hall where be comparatively safe hospital be excellently managed wounded bore suffering without complaint although terribly harassed by fly afflicted by great heat continual bursting of shell also troubled greatly explosion be serious enough to men in sound health be of course much more trying to who be shaken by loss of blood have nerve much le under control french priest behaved with great courage humanity feeding protecting christian chinese who came to catholic protestant alike many of chinese woman be housed in mission private firm sheltered number of in warehouse nevertheless chinese christian suffered heavily a house stood for most part in exposed position when rex be off duty a volunteer spent greater part of time in visiting poor people carrying rice other necessity from father store house be surprised at patience resignation evinced most touching gratitude for welcome supply that brought rice be generally cooked for in house ah lo always accompanied rex with two pail full of food while rex carried smaller comfort in basket chapter xii delay on thirteenth ally began heavy bombardment of native city gun being placed on mud wall enclosing native city foreign settlement british have sixteen gun of various size four maxim american three gun three machine gun japanese twelve mountain gun french six mountain gun austrian two maxim nordenfeldt russian german who be encamped two mile away on other side of river did not share in bombardment cannonade be kept up with tremendous vigour british gun alone pouring in fifteen hundred shell in course of morning so terrific be fire that chinese battery soon ceased to play meanwhile allied army of five thousand men under command of japanese brigadier general fukushima senior officer present advanced under cover of darkness on western side of peiho to little arsenal about two mile to north west of settlement force be composed of fifteen hundred japanese with two battery of artillery british contingent under brigadier general dorward comprising one hundred fifty blue jacket one hundred fifty marine one hundred sixty men of welsh fusilier one hundred of chinese regiment one hundred fifty of hong kong regiment hong kong artillery naval gun also forty five austrian marine nine hundred american under colonel meade nine hundred french under colonel de pelacot remainder of welsh fusilier number of blue jacket be despatched at same time to hold enemy in check at railway station while from camp russian german advanced in force on east bank of river to attack battery on lutai canal best point of attack be south west angle of city a in way must have avoided concentrated fire from whole of crenellated wall canal intervened there be mean of bridging chinese having opened sluice flooded country on side of advancing force moreover must have be exposed to fire of chinese fort two thousand yard away on be mounted several modern gun have be decided therefore to attack at south gate to narrow paved pathway ran in straight line from arsenal troop be drawn up french on right american on left japanese british austrian in centre canal be formerly crossed at arsenal by small wooden bridge have be burnt in order to keep chinese gun from going from city to race course from have for day maintained galling fire arsenal be not held in strength being too much exposed to chinese fire maxim have be stationed in one of house by bridge to prevent chinese from repairing french be first to reach remains of bridge in order to take up place on right of attacking force when found that there be mean of crossing have to halt under cover of very heavy fire from japanese sapper until have made passable french japanese troop then crossed together proceeded along pathway until reached ditch six foot wide running at right angle to pathway filled with stagnant water ditch be about nine hundred yard from wall crossing troop took shelter in number of small house short distance beyond forty men be left to hold two hundred more advanced along causeway until got under shelter of chinese house situated couple of hundred yard outside city wall japanese sapper threw up entrenchment with great rapidity placed bridge across one two ditch obstructed advance attack be then developed a have be arranged welsh fusilier american on extreme left proceeded towards western angle of city wall advance company taking cover in creek three hundred yard from wall remainder settling little to rear behind mud wall inequality in ground position be unpleasant one for in addition to being exposed to fire from wall have to keep eye upon large body of chinese horse have drawn up just out of range in readiness to charge if opportunity offered unfortunately two hundred of american infantry under colonel liscum instead of continuing forward turned almost at right angle marched directly across front of attack until reached position near french settlement be in formation of section of four be exposed to terrific rifle fire from whole line of city wall also from chinese house lying between wall settlement changed line of advance did not better position be obliged to take shelter behind chinese graf with plain be studded graf be only small mound of earth though found protection behind from direct fire from wall be still exposed to flanking fire from house colonel liscum while gallantly steadying men be killed four officer seventy two men be wounded attempt be made to send fresh ammunition captain ollivant of chinese regiment be killed in gallant attempt to draw off line of fire with ammunition mule american be forced to lie where be until when fell back to arsenal with wounded dead amounted to just one half of whole number in course of day lieutenant phillimore of barfleur have managed to get out to with few blue jacket have assisted materially in holding position in carrying back to arsenal who have fallen major pereira of st chinese regiment who be next to went out to twice to bring in wounded be hit in so doing regiment have nineteen casualty including two officer when bombardment have somewhat weakened chinese fire general fukushima ordered general advance unfortunately received word that men have effected lodgment on city wall have actually got inside town therefore requested general dorward to stop fire of british gun be of course instantly done have be kept in action hour longer loss to japanese must have be considerably le for gunner have exact range be causing great destruction however whole line of attack pushed forward took shelter in house outside wall a soon a be discovered that japanese be not in city gun again opened fire be maintained steadily afternoon fire of large naval gun being particularly accurate while american be being retired from advanced position in evening gun be ordered to sweep chinese barricade line of defended house from colonel liscums force have be so much harried day american be lying about three hundred yard from fringe if attempted to move be in great danger of being hit fire of british gun be so accurate that retiral be carried out without one casualty early in afternoon company of marine be ordered to reinforce japanese french austrian marine went with fire be so heavy accurate that number of blue jacket under captain beattie hurried forward to support heavy cross fire be poured upon several of men fell among being able seaman named mcarthy basil guy one of barfleurs midshipman ran back bound up wound then tried to lift disabled man carry in finding weight too heavy for ran forward again got stretcher returned with seaman to assist a rest of party be now under shelter whole fire of enemy be concentrated upon ground be literally ploughed up with shot mcarthy be placed on stretcher a be being carried in be again hit time killed for gallant action guy be awarded victoria cross being only midshipman who have ever gained that honour illustration basil guy ran back bound up wound troop then advanced across causeway suffering heavily from incessant rifle fire from shell shrapnel fire of two gun chinese have posted near water mill at right of road causeway be not more than thirty foot in width so that troop be unable to extend being therefore in close order afforded excellent mark to enemy unfortunately by time japanese british gun have expended ammunition one of hong kong gun have still few round left directing fire upon chinese gun be doing so much mischief brought fire on so succeeded in enabling column to pas along causeway with far le damage than must otherwise have suffered chinese fire be on whole surprisingly good showed that artilleryman have be well instructed while own gun be for most part using black powder chinese be using smokeless consequently be very difficult for artilleryman to locate exact position troop be glad enough when night came on day have be hot though heavy shower have fallen in early part of morning water bottle be soon exhausted be compelled to drink green stagnant water in ditch with result that great number of afterwards suffered from dysentery loss have be very heavy question of retirement be mooted only however to be at once rejected to retire must be to add enormously to prestige of chinese to lower spirit of troop be therefore resolved that ground won must be held at hazard attack recommenced in morning through night enemy kept up desultory fire be trying ordeal for troop fatigued a be by long day fight during have be exposed for hour to blazing sun with very small supply of food japanese suffered most severely a ground be holding on side of causeway be two foot deep in water have therefore to remain standing night just before sunrise japanese sapper stole forward to attempt to blow in outer city gate be met with tremendous volley of musketry one ball cut electric wire be to have be used for firing charge lieutenant inawe however pluckily rushed forward with lighted fuse escaped almost miraculously unhurt meanwhile one of japanese soldier have pluckily climbed inner wall unbarred inner gate japanese poured into city chinese flying before in direction japanese be followed by welsh fusilier rest of troop marching round on broad city wall to keep a many of enemy from escaping a possible there be good deal of fighting in street firing from house greater part of chinese troop have retired during night having lost heart when found that assailant maintained position must recommence attack in morning chinese loss be estimated at about five thousand of ally be under eight hundred of five hundred occurred in rank of japanese street be littered with chinese uniform red sash badge of boxer of have divested a ran number of body of people killed by shell lay about only two woman be found among seemed to show that greater portion of inhabitant have fled before attack began leaving city to be defended by boxer imperial troop effect of lyddite shell from heavy gun have be terrible indeed chinese looked upon lyddite a sort of death dealing tactic of attacking troop have not be good owing probably to divided command have be marched during darkness must have gained position in house under wall with comparatively slight loss must have blown in gate assaulted city at once instead of be halted long way in front of wall then marched in broad daylight across open plain devoid of cover halted for couple of hour under fire while bridge over canal be being repaired moreover almost troop be engaged in operation only handful being left to guard settlement while large body of chinese cavalry kept hovering about little distance away have be under competent leader might have effected entrance into settlement swept from end to end still capture of tientsin be worth risk opened road to pekin relieved peiho shanghai from danger be day increasing also conduced to safety of foreigner in interior of china while fighting have be going on russian german on other side of river circled round stormed battery on lupi canal taking with comparatively little opposition during advance one of chinese shell fell into building inside russian line in unknown to occupant dynamite be stored explosion be terrific window of most of house in settlement be shattered by although occurred way off on other side of river russian general who with staff be close by at moment have hand damaged by falling building trumpeter be killed number of men be knocked down by force of concussion total german russian loss be about one hundred fifty killed wounded russian be aided by four inch gun from algerine twelve pounder from terrible rendered most valuable aid a russian have with only seven twelve pounder of old pattern british gun be not very satisfactory until arrival of terribles pounder hong kong gun be obsolete british troop have none others with exception of very old fashioned naval six pounder indeed scandalous fact be brought to light that none of british ship on china station be equipped with modern quick firing gun welsh fusilier after joining japanese pushed through city up to north gate advanced beyond to grand canal where captured two hundred junk small steamer japanese captured also number of gun of proved very useful in march to pekin after city be captured chinese have still strong defensive position have fallen back to railway to fort near viceroy yamen have heart left in in afternoon japanese entered fort without fight took possession of yamen forty five gun be found in former among big krupp have done such harm to settlement in early day of bombardment several fifteen pounder gun of recent pattern first thing to be done be to extinguish fire be raging in several part of city be difficult matter be not accomplished until considerable part of city have be consumed amount of property destroyed being enormous rest of city be systematically looted russian have not entered town remained on other side of river have at once demanded that military governor must be appointed a japanese be much superior in force to other nationality be evident that intended that russian must be nominated matter be discussed with considerable acerbity at council of commanding officer proposal be finally rejected three commissioner colonel wogack lieutenant colonel bower lieutenant colonel aoki be appointed to govern city of tientsin be divided into four sectionsbritish american french japanese number of chinese be enlisted to act a police under captain mockler of indian army though be drilled by madras sepoy who must not understand word of language became very serviceable body yu lu viceroy managed to effect escape from yamen few day later whole of family committed suicide fate be certainly hard one up to outbreak of hostility have done best to suppress boxer protect foreigner on june have tendered resignation effort in direction be thwarted by governor be ordered to remain where be hostility of enemy at pekin be carried beyond grave for order be made for posthumous degradation very terrible thing for chinese family simply because have failed to hold tientsin against assailant many small fort round town be captured without resistance mounted many gun fact that garrison abandoned without resistance showed complete demoralization of chinese if only assailing force have be in position to follow up work there be little doubt that must have arrived at pekin almost without striking blow after extinguishing fire troop set to work to render town habitable great number of dead be removed from house have be destroyed by shell fire from street in very short time town be brought into satisfactory sanitary condition there be now long pause while british american be eager to advance towards pekin at earliest opportunity russian fell back there be two of people in pekin be evident that be far more desirous of getting political advantage out of situation than of reaching legation maintained that must need army of sixty thousand to force way up difference between other nationality became more more acute matter dragged on painfully be true that there be still immense deal to be done before force of even twenty thousand men must be ready to advance in spite of disagreement between commander work be carried on vigorously junk cart be collected gun great store of provision ammunition be brought from coast troop poured in still day be named for advance anger discontent among merchant trader who have friend in pekin increased daily men talked angrily despairingly at corner of street cursed hesitation bickering on part of military rex went about with hand deep in pocket head bent down raging pouring out abuse against general father in vain tried to calm dear boy said may be convinced that five thousand six thousand men that have here be sufficient for advance even anxious a be to see expedition set out can not agree with quite believe that if on day after have taken tientsin have be ready to start five thousand men might have done news taken by flying chinese must have sufficed to demoralize enemy over country be not ready delay have occurred having be sufficient to allow chinese to get over scare expedition of only five thousand men must inevitably terminate in fiasco a did that under seymour think that at least ten thousand men will be necessary to relieve pekin that force will require large transport train besides though have taken great number of chinese gun few of be field gun a know be at present terribly deficient in artillery even for gun have there be ammunition for nearly round have be fired away other day have provision for troop must wait till sufficient supply be collected brought up here together with gun ample supply of ammunition can not be done in day grant that seem to be pushing on matter a quickly a must wish already five train day run down to taku immense deal of work have be quietly carried on besides military commander be convinced that pekin have already fallen that there be occasion whatever for haste troopship be expected in day with reinforcement from india japan germany france when in week may have twenty thousand troop here military authority may be well excused for not deciding upon making attempt with quarter of force well father hope that when do go will get attached to force a interpreter certainly rex have fear that when force doe go on there will be hitch time section must like to be attached to well think father if have choice must like to go with jap be awfully good little fellow a plucky a lion fancy that a be so strong be certain to be well in front must really like to go with very well have be supplying with great many good have spoken to general several time talk english very well when tell that have be twice into pekin since be besieged brought down last message got through from british minister must think must be glad to take two day later rex learned that have obtained appointment a interpreter with japanese troop that general requested that must begin duty at once be great relief to to be employed again a took thought off friend at pekin there be not however much to do japanese arrangement be so perfect men so quick handy that there be occasion for service except in making small purchase in arranging with chinese cooly to man junk with country people for cart there be difficulty in obtaining provision for russian have carried fire sword among village to considerable distance on side of river burning house generally killing inhabitant consequence be that supply must be got on side of river villager however began to come in from north side very timidly at first more boldly when found that be unmolested by soldier for american british japanese treated well after sack of city be over resumed ordinary discipline store be now accumulating fast train from taku brought up troop gun ammunition provision greatest difficulty be disembarkment of from ship thirteen mile away of merchant ship of light draught be able to come in unload at wharf blue jacket marine in men of war aided in loading up truck work went on with great rapidity many of japanese officer spoke english rex be soon at home among found very cheery pleasant companion general be very agreeable man with charming manner immensely popular among troop greater portion of be stationed in tientsin where maintained perfect order in district assigned to rex found that native returned more fearlessly to district than to occupied by other nationality on july th letter came down from mr conger united state minister at pekin saying that have be besieged for month under continuous shot shell from chinese troop quick relief only must prevent general massacre woke up military commander general gaselee who commanded british contingent general chaffee who commanded american insisted that attempt at relief must be made at hazard to wait until sixty thousand men be assembled must be simply to sacrifice legation informed other commander that be determined to start even if have to go alone there be still much to be done before arrangement be completed work went on with increased life spirit now that be certain that legation be still holding out be not however until august that be ready even then jealousy have arisen russian japanese wished to lead advance none wished to accept position behind others general gaselee then said that british must take rear guard a only wished to get to pekin did not care in least of column got there first so long a reached in time to relieve legation after act of abnegation be very satisfactory that british force be first to enter legation force be made up a followseight thousand japanese under lieutenant general baron yamaguchi with major general fukushima a chief of staff four thousand five hundred russian under general linievitch three thousand british under lieutenant general sir gaselee major general barrow being chief of staff two thousand five hundred american under general chaffee eight hundred french under general frey total force amounted to eighteen thousand eight hundred german took part in expedition be generally supposed that preferred taking care of own possession at shantung to rescuing legation total japanese force if have arrived must have be twenty two thousand russian have three thousand men at camp between tientsin chefou few british troop be left in tientsin have be originally intended that sir gaselee must have force of over seven thousand troop brought with have stopped at shanghai by telegraphic instruction from home though doubt presence of so large force at shanghai be useful in preventing trouble in south of china caused to assume very subordinate position in expedition to pekin japanese with large force doing principal work of campaign a time advanced rex whose despair at long delay have driven almost distracted began to fear that expedition must arrive too late be of course ignorant that capture of tientsin have have powerful effect on position at pekin chinese have believed that place be impregnable so long a be there to menace rear of invading army felt perfectly safe be tremendous blow to therefore to learn that city with fort gun supply of ammunition have be captured after single day fighting consequence be that indecision increased war party be confused peace party headed by prince ching gained vastly greater influence in council of empress consequence be that for twenty day after arrival of news something like truce prevailed besieged be even able to purchase small supply of provision fruit condition became much more tolerable be probable that empress must have thrown altogether into hand of peace party have not be that delay on part of ally have enabled panic stricken chinese soldier to recover morale discipline have be very strongly reinforced be confidently hoped that must be able to defeat ally when advanced thus miserable delay caused by jealousy of allied commander be not a prejudicial to legation a otherwise must have be when hostility be renewed have chinese attacked a actively a have done before fall of tientsin be morally certain that defender of legation must have found impossible to continue resistance that must have be massacred russian be at bottom of hateful delay said rex be convinced that jap though strongest in number must give in willingly be not that russian be always making fresh demand american only want to get there french be in such small number that doe not matter rap what think of be russian who be to blame there be doubt about rex father said believe be playing double game want to pose a friend of china thus obtain concession overwhelming influence at pekin must seem try to do by sort of delay by advancing petty claim by generally putting spoke into wheel have already got manchuria under thumb will certainly stick to unless china be backed up by other power unite in insisting that china will not suffer further loss of territory at hand of russian anyone else there be question that be best policy be to interest that china will remain whole united capable of holding own against russia britain japan can have desire for territory after war be over alliance offensive defensive between two nation must be worth loss of life property have incurred must be grand father there be doubt that jap be beggar to fight way smashed china showed that other day certainly did at least a well a other nationality with fleet ours combined must hold own with greatest ease against russia france even if germany be to join be showing now in south africa what army can put in field with indian army that of jap must if pressed drive russian out of asia must be big order father laughed must certainly effectually prevent from meddling with china make keep within own boundary besides must have china to count with also china have wakened up since war with japan have gone in for best modern gun rifle if have let two more year pas before beginning row must have found very formidable opponent troop must then have become a well disciplined a ours well then be very glad father that did not wait for two year found pretty hard work a be to take tientsin if greater part of army have not moved out during night doubt very much whether must have captured be lucky indeed that stuck to during night be only that turned scale know old story father of chinaman who excused defeat by saying two men can not be in one place if one must come other must go father laughed well have doubt be something like rex when chinese saw that be quite determined to get into tientsin obstinacy fixedness of purpose told upon began to say people have made up mind to come therefore have better go certainly showed great deal of pluck during first day fighting even tremendous cannonade to be exposed did not seem to shake courage at for fought a stoutly at end of day a did at beginning can hardly say that gained advantage whatever certainly have reason to congratulate ourselves on fact that lost courage when came to think over after nightfall well have not least fear that force be starting to morrow will fail if chinese did not stand when fighting behind strong wall supported by circle of strong fort mounting prodigious number of cannon be hardly likely that will make anything like determined resistance in open anticipate that difficulty will rather be in getting to pekin than in defeating enemy know that bank of peiho have be cut large stretch of country inundated consequently river be so sunk that be very doubtful whether even lighter craft among junk will be able to get up if can not expedition will be in nearly same position a of admiral seymour cant march without provision ammunition gun certainly amount of land transport have collected be nothing like sufficient for must chiefly depend upon junk if river fails be brought to stand still be afraid be so father rex said at rate must hope for best chapter xiii capturing taku fort one afternoon rex went to see friend midshipman at barricade wish must tell rex said about capture of taku fort beyond fact that be captured have heard next to nothing well be rather long story middy said a everything be quiet dont mind telling about if like must be very much obliged if must rex said well then here go have not seen place suppose well mouth of river be strongly fortified especially on north side where there be big casemated fort with earthwork mounting altogether fifty gun of different size third of mile farther up river be inner fort be very strong smaller than other mount about thirty gun earthwork covered way connects two fort parapet be pierced for many small gun on south side extending mile along shore be number of casemated battery mounting about one hundred twenty gun be good gun for most part modern there be also inner fort mile inland built for defence of main magazine fortification consist of earthwork with cement concrete gallery be wonderfully well built certainly a good a have ever seen see mud be usual substance with build house in china be wonderfully clever with at many point of fortification there be high very powerful redoubt carry at angle very big modern gun mostly krupp quick firers fort seem to have be designed by foreigner dont think chinese must ever have be up to such work if hadnt have foreign instructor apparently however sacked fellow when have finished battery carried out rest of work there hasnt be regular garrison in fort for year official hanger on have resided there when row began however troop came marching in calculated that at time of bombardment be occupied by eight thousand men fancy be good soldier for came from hunan province be considered to turn out best soldier in china general liu came from same place unfortunately water near fort be very shoal war vessel drew twenty foot of water be obliged to heave to five mile off bar be to say ten mile off fort by fifteenth there be twenty five foreign men of war herebritish french german austrian russian italian japanese american ship came up day two before battle be difficult getting news so far out so admiral light draught yacht anchored close outside bar ran wire into destroyer fame be anchored just outside fort by mean despatch be wired out to yacht flashed semaphored to fleet mile above fort be imperial naval yard dock lying moored to wharf be four very fine thirty two knot german built destroyer with full chinese crew on board during day before battle everyone be on qui vive for be known that summons to surrender next day have be sent in to fort only two train be despatched for tientsin have to be worked by engineer from fleet for chinese have disappeared large japanese force be landed from ship encamped by side of railway at tongku two mile from fort later in day shifted camp to other side of railway to make room for large russian infantry force have just come in from port arthur two hundred blue jacket from ship encamped near in evening at head of road to fort train came down from tientsin in afternoon containing number of foreigner principally woman child who at once took shelter on merchant steamer lying off wharf during day fame dropped end of wire steaming up river took up station by four chinese destroyer in middle yard algerine have be lying between north south fort also moved up river to berth about third of mile off inner north fort quarter of mile higher three russian gun boat be moored in line higher still lay german gun boat moored to one of wharf little lower down be french lion at wharf higher up lay japanese atago higher up united state paddle wheel steamer monocacy hope be not boring with too many particular not at be much obliged to for giving such good account seem to be able to see whole thing well must tell that monocacy have be ordered to take share in business did useful work in giving shelter to number of woman child although knew that ultimatum have be sent in nobody dreamed that rumpus be going to begin so soon thought that a usual message must be exchanged that thing must drag on little before anything serious came of algerine have ventilator up mast standing yard crossed german on iltis have landed boat ventilator day before lion have housed ventilator still have yard crossed at nine oclock long searchlight train went out under command of lieutenant kirkpatrick riley with twelve pounder hotchkiss two maxim hundred mengerman british french be stoked by british blue jacket be driven by german engineer from iltis watched glare of searchlight for about three hour till disappeared across plain in direction of tientsin then who be on port watch turned in have scarcely got into hammock when there be boom of heavy gun can imagine how quickly jumped into clothes again ran on deck must see that inner north fort be firing guessed that algerine be lying nearest to be target return shot came from be evident that be taken a much by surprise a be bom bom bom went big gun be about five minute before algerine replied shortly afterwards three russian gun boat returned fire iltis lion also joined in of course part of business be telling from hearsay for be necessarily only spectator of affray can imagine bateman that be hopping mad with being altogether out of be enough to make one tear one hair however great part of blue jacket marine be ashore must soon be having look in there be a much out of a if be off spithead well of course now have have turn ashore here be satisfied at time be maddening nevertheless be splendid sight can tell fort have now joined in flash burst from from gun boat be almost incessant in few minute iltis steamed down at full speed from wharf joined three russian algerine crew of cheered enthusiastically a went into action shortly afterwards french lion also came down have be lying with head up river so have taken longer than iltis too be warmly welcomed whole of fort be now pouring in heavy cannonade gun must be brought to bear from six gun boat replied at range of hardly mile iltis with eight quick firers algerine with inch gun engaged north fort lion with two inch gun joined while three russian directed fire on south fort be heavily armed bobr have inch gun in bow inch in stern corkoretch have two inch gun one inch gilyak have one inch gun in bow two inch gun four inch gun in military top ship kept up heavy methodical fire from machine gun in top so searched out bastion while heavy gun made impossible for gunner to stick to work be however difficult to keep up accurate fire against gun in shade of fort many of chinese soldier left fort taking cover among mud house maintained heavy fire on men on deck in top gilyak be closest to village suffered heavily meanwhile fame whiting have be ordered to attack four chinese destroyer lying in dock a approached however chinese crew jumped ashore bolted fame grappled one towed down river to tongku two tow boat belonging to mercantile company took two others in charge whiting brought out fourth four splendid destroyer if have be manned with resolute crew must have sunk six gun boat without difficulty battle raged till morning gun boat be doing utmost to keep down fire of fort although practice be excellent quite failed to do so owing to fact that be impossible to get exact range fortunately fire of chinese be extremely inaccurate gunner be evidently unaccustomed to work heavy gun such a be now handling although stuck gallantly to work in spite of large number of casualty did little damage sometimes powder charge be altogether too heavy sometimes so light that shot never reached ship shell almost failed to burst sometimes shot must fall close alongside next must go clean overhead a daylight approached boat got up anchor with exception of gilyak have received heavy projectile on water line made water fast still maintained heavy fire remained at mooring while damage be being temporarily repaired though suffered severely in consequence may imagine what state of mind be in on board larger ship there be six little boat fighting against whole chain of huge fort ought to have sunk at first round meanwhile of course fellow russian jap who have landed day before be not idle naturally got under arm a soon a first gun be fired must really hing until daylight for be ignorant of country be cut up with dyke ditch if force have tried to cross there in dark must speedily have be broken up half of must have be mired chafed very much however at delay though recognized necessity of set out eagerly at first gleam of daylight when got up anchor gun boat moved backwards forward engaging fort here plumping shell into somewhere else seeming to care nothing at for rain of shot shell to be exposed be difficult for to keep count of moving about a did more than once good many of thought that one of be gone presently be in boat making for shore day began to break just a approached fort at moment chinese gunner doubled fire now thought gun boat must never live under storm of shot shell fire be a regular a ever fact that be in motion seemed to bother chinese gunner a much a darkness have done inch gun isnt easily managed by men who have never used toy before so that although fire from smaller gun be more accurate than have be seemed to that big one fired le frequently iltis be hit by heavy shot at same moment magazine at northern end of south fort blew up chinese fire slackened little in short time action be a hot a ever jap be making for north fort russian for other side tell bateman thing looked nasty by six oclock storming party be near north fort heavy fire be already opened upon pushed steadily forward until at eighteen minute past six main magazine of south fort blew up concussion be terrible dense black column of smoke fragment of sort rose thousand foot in air firing stopped instantly for minute dead silence reigned then tremendous cheer rose from gun boat storming party latter raced forward to assault firing be renewed more briskly than ever on side at half past six resistance have almost ceased british flag be hoisted on north fort followed minute later by of japanese garrison of southern fort appalled by destruction have be made by explosion be already in full flight across plain now on north side be endeavouring to follow example number of casualty among storming party have not be large that of british japanese amounting to only twenty six killed wounded casualty in gun boat be remarkably few almost miraculously so considering fire to have be exposed russian have suffered most having sixteen men killed three officer fifty two men wounded german have six killed fifteen wounded french one officer killed one man wounded british three men killed one officer wounded chinese actually in fort consisted of three thousand men rest be in support behind near line of railway took part in affair nearly one thousand killed be found in fort prisoner who be nearly a many be set to throw body into river communication ceased with tientsin from time of capture of fort be not till day afterwards that learned from man who rode through chinese line that place be besieged that garrison be hardly able to hold own there be doubt that be fine action who have be left on board ship be very sore at being out of of course even if have be ashore must only have be with assaulting column share in business be very small one gun boat have fighting glory dare say however that will get share presently dont think chinese be much good in open fancy can stick to wall in narrow street may have very sharp work must have be grand affair rex said fancy six little gun boat fighting for so many hour against fort mounting nearly three hundred gun of course of couldnt be brought to bear upon there must have be enough to blow out of water in quarter of hour one must certainly think so must remember that gun have to be very much depressed gunner must not very well make out boat in dark of course flash of gun showed position expect chinese who be new hand at work did not understand how to sling heavy piece about give right elevation there be doubt that stick to gun manfully be talking to of algerine fellow told that several time when have managed to send shell after shell close to gun have be annoying be silent for half minute so then when thought that have finished with beggar began to fire again a regularly a before though be probable that three fourth of detachment before working have be blown into smithereens listen do hear shouting relief party must be coming in oh bother middy said cant be there to see well can rex said will come back tell about dont suppose will hear much till evening will be off duty then wont yes well then come dine at place will get hold of two three of men went up with if can went off at run soon joined number of resident men off duty who be awaiting arrival of force head of column be just coming in portion of relief force led then admiral seymour men many of carrying sick wounded on stretcher door other make shift rest of force brought up rear seeing major johnston coming along with marine rex pressed forward to shake hand with ah got through then bateman be glad to see have wondered many time whether got safely into pekin certainly did not expect to see here though thought might meet when marched into pekin yes got in right stopped there till about week ago then came back here if have nothing better to do will dine with evening bring trimmer lawson with with pleasure will scarcely have time to make mess arrangement for ourselves have have heavy fighting have indeed have lost good many men began to think at one time that must not get back believe if have not taken arsenal very few of must have survived to tell tale however will tell about that evening thank will run home at once tell people that be coming rex hurried home told mother that four officer be coming to dinner did not say anything about sleeping here mother if can manage be sure must be blessing to for have only just got in will certainly not be able to make other arrangement will have to be content with very simple fare mr bateman said of course fresh meat can be have so will have to manage on tinned meat vegetable of fortunately have abundant varied supply may be sure that will not be particular mother for expect have be on very short ration for time give capital dinner day be sure can turn out a good one for mr bateman smiled well dare say will manage something will be good enough for hungry men rex then went down to friend middy have nothing to tell robinson said johnston two of chum be going to dine with so will hear then mother say can give bed for night thanks be luxury indeed bateman only will be awful getting up so a to be here on duty again at six in morning oh nonsense one want to sleep after five in weather be generally up soon after four yes must remember have have sleep to speak of for past three day chance be that shant turn in until midnight a will have to hear about expedition however will put in a much sleep a can between hour five have good four hour morning at half past seven three marine middy arrived at mr batemans rex have hour before gone to major johnston told that have be arranged that friend be to sleep in house will be great comfort bateman said have not have clothes off for three week will be delicious to lie down between sheet to have bath in morning warn though that will want bath before dinner for cant sit down to table a be right major if come round in hour will find one ready for accordingly on arrival be shown at once to room can not tell bateman major said a came downstairs again how much be obliged to good dinner be not thing to be despised bath be even greater luxury be sure must not have enjoyed dinner unless have have bath for have have few opportunity for washing since left here excellent dinner be served be greatly enjoyed by four guest can assure mr bateman major said that while eating good fare be difficult to believe that past three week have not be very uncomfortable dream how have be getting on mr robinson since came here mr bateman asked nothing to grumble at sir have pretty hard work first two day thanks to son now have quiet day of rex uttered sharp warning ejaculation a robinson spoke have not thought of telling that companion wished nothing to be said about adventure thanks to son mr bateman repeated in surprise what can rex have have to do with midshipman who have too late heard rex ejaculation hesitated did not know that have not told sir said else may be sure must have said nothing about well what be asked midshipman looked appealingly at rex latter said well father be little enterprise that watson laurence carried out on own account nothing worth talking about well what be rex father persisted mr robinson say that have given better time well father fact be three ah lo went out silenced two gun be so annoying for day well how did do rex now know so much of course want to know rest what do know about mr robinson well sir really know about be that son came to asked to allow lantern to stand on barricade of course said that there be objection to then went back fifty sixty yard placed lantern on window so that two lantern together be in exact line with gun at midnight rex two friend with chinaman went out be practically know about matter certainly have idea that rex have kept affair secret be certainly thing of have right to feel very proud for be plucky business one be very much tempted to take part in now then bateman major johnston said see light can not be hid under bushel so have better make clean breast of affair rex saw that be of use making further mystery of so briefly explained how idea have come into mind how watson laurence have agreed to join step have taken for placing lantern to enable to find gun in dark how robinson have explained working of various part of gun to how have carried plan into successful execution ought not have done father said when have finished major johnston said dont think mr bateman that son be to be blamed be splendidly plucky action for everyone in settlement must thank for appears that gun be doing immense amount of damage be act other officer in majesty service must have be proud to perform admit mr bateman said rex be always running into danger grant so far have got through safely know result of taking pitcher to well too often dont think be likely to come to harm major said for be not a if undertook thing without thoroughly working plan out so that failure be almost impossibility on way up gave brief account of how have got cousin out of rascally governor yamen must not get full detail out of judging from what told be certainly admirably managed affair think mr bateman that have right to be very proud of if have be in army must certainly have earned v c for way in silenced gun yes admit mr bateman said wont scold keep mother in state of great anxiety dont think father rex said that in affair of sort risk be anything compared with one run in regular fight little excursion have made have have very little risk in thempractically none when come to think of can pas anywhere a chinaman a have always travelled at night have be exposed to practically danger so have sharp fighting here mr bateman major said changing subject not actually severe fighting be chinese have never got up really close to although have made good many rush bombardment have be very heavy french settlement be practically destroyed large number of house will have to be rebuilt worse than artillery fire have be sniping have be continuous round more especially on other side of river where have be absolutely incessant where have be dangerous in extreme to show one nose outside one door have done best to keep down can not say that success have attended effort for chinese have lain hid among house ruin never show except to fire have casualty be heavy very slight indeed added with smile speaks well either for prudence for bad marksmanship of enemy have brought cannon to bear upon stick there with great tenacity fancy will find very hard work to drive out from tientsin there be fort yamen several other strong building wall too defence be strong if stick there a stubbornly a have done across river city will certainly not be taken without considerable loss of life do know when be going to begin mr bateman believe russian be going to turn out to morrow morning have only be waiting for return now fancy will consider that have strength enough for anything must think have major said be sorry to say that must not put seymour force above strength at started there have be lot of illness have suffered much from hunger privation lost good many men in attack on fort many of still in rank will not be fit for service until have have few day rest if put thousand in line to morrow must be a much a must be fairly calculated upon still many of who must not be fit to take part in attack must be useful for defence of town if chinese must make counter attack while best part of force be away now major be burning with curiosity to know what have happened to while have be away have heard score of rumour not one authentic fact heard that have entered pekin that have be massacred that have disappeared a effectually off face of earth a if have opened swallowed up very first news got of existence be from son who reported that on way down from pekin heard heavy continuous firing in arsenal of hsi ku concluded that force must be engaged thought that must be attacking place others that have taken be now besieged latter certainly seemed most reasonable unless indeed be fight between boxer regular chinese troop for if have not got possession of arsenal be impossible to imagine how have obtained sufficient provision to keep alive so long yes that supposition be correct one be quite on last leg before took place well will please tell whole story be not nine oclock yet so that unless be so dead tired that can not go through with will get done in reasonable time will be very happy to do so major said if have asked afternoon when came in must have said frankly that did not feel equal to bath excellent dinner have given have quite set on leg again will already have heard from son what happened on way up from lang fang of little fight have on th of june well next day outpost ran in reported that boxer be at hand in great number enemy arrived close on heel made determined rush at fore part of leading train be drawn up beside well where men be engaged in watering be met by withering fire pushed on with extreme bravery did not fall back until of actually reached train then must do more retreated leaving about hundred dead certainly gave better idea of courage difficulty must be likely to encounter than anything have yet happened at half past five in afternoon messenger arrived on trolley from rear to say that lofa station be attacked by very strong force of enemy number two train have steam up admiral at once took strong force down in on arrival at station found that fight be over enemy having fallen back discomfited reinforcement started in pursuit harried retreat for distance accounting for about hundred of capturing few small cannon next day remained at lang fang strong body being employed in repairing line under protection of guard train went back to lofa on return learned that repair have affected on line beyond place have be good deal broken up later officer of guard at lofa came in reported that three large body of boxer be moving about in distance that expected attack must be made on station however moved off quietly be probably on way to destroy line for train left at four next morning for tientsin came back in afternoon with news that line be so completely broken up round lofa that must not be repaired with material men on board admiral left hour later to see for state of line pushed on for distance men repairing line a went till reached yangstun only to find beyond point line be entirely destroyed be now evident to admiral to of that if continued to stop at lang fang must ere long have to stop there permanently for provision be almost entirely exhausted admiral have seen day before have sent off several messenger to tientsin to ask that junk must be sent up river ammunition provision forwarded by train to yangtsun intention being to establish base there never heard more of messenger fact stared in face that be absolutely cut off from tientsin chapter xiv surrounded on seventeenth message be sent to lofa lang fang to recall three train there be evident that must be impossible to utilize for retreat a might be suddenly cut off by boxer one came in on afternoon of next day others arrived in evening have have very sharp fighting german naval officer who be in charge of two train reported that have be attacked early that afternoon by force of fully five thousand men including cavalry great proportion of whom be armed with magazine rifle of latest pattern attack be made in front on flank troop marched out against although exposed to heavy fire forced to retreat nevertheless when men retired towards train enemy rallied advanced again with evident determination to gain object being beaten off with more loss than before finally retreated loss be over four hundred killed while have six killed forty eight wounded in course of fight banner be captured belonged to army of tung fu hsiang be first indication have that imperial chinese troop have taken field against conference of commanding officer of various nationality be held next day be decided that a railway be completely destroyed on side of must not use for advance retreat must be better to endeavour to withdraw to tientsin preparation be at once made wounded few remaining store be carried down placed on board junk have be captured on previous day at three oclock in afternoon start be made progress however be not destined to be rapid for junk have not gone far before grounded in willow reach of river three of be got off pretty easily six pounder quick firing gun of centurion have to be thrown overboard to lighten fourth before must float in consequence of delay have only made two half mile when night fell started early next morning be fighting day progress be very much retarded by necessity for keeping abreast of junk management of lubberly craft be beyond european sailor a chinaman must be got to navigate be continually running across river getting stuck so that from four oclock in morning till six in evening force only advanced eight mile fighting began at quarter past nine chinese occupied village near bank when be driven out fell back to next village here be reinforced village after village have to be carried by rifle fire in case where resistance be too obstinate by bayonet charge chinese stood splendidly against rifle fire must not bring to face bayonet cheer of men seemed to take spirit out of in afternoon chinese opened fire with one pounder quick firing gun did not do great damage harassed troop in advance especially when have to cross open ground enemy be using smokeless powder consequently a gun be frequently shifted found impossible to locate position so to keep down fire with musketry be very trying day heat be great water in water bottle be soon exhausted men be too busily engaged to go down to river to refill next day be even worse start be made at half past seven have not gone far when saw two hundred cavalry on left flank of advance guard hoped at first that be detachment of cossack who have come to aid hope be doomed to disappointment for a drew dress showed that be chinese troop for rest of day hovered about on left flank firing when saw opportunity few well directed shrapnel shell from nine pounder sufficed to keep at distance a soon a have retired after reconnoitring position opened fire with field gun one pounder quick firing gun replied with nine pounder machine gun a enemy be using ordinary powder smoke of showed position be soon obliged to shift be quiet for time began again in course of day always however with same result fighting went on continuously a village after village town of peitsang be chief place between yangtsun tientsin have to be carried at six oclock in evening halted having arrived opposite very strong position held by enemy from be unable to dislodge commanding officer held council of war decided that after have have refreshment few hour rest must make night march a best chance of getting through have made only six mile during day owing to stubborn resistance of enemy increased gun power in course of evening field machine gun be placed on board junk have be taken on previous day at one oclock in morning march recommenced fire be soon seen at little distance from river bank be obvious that enemy be by mean signalling approach heavy fire opened on force from village hundred yard ahead shell from field piece struck junk be carrying gun filled have to be abandoned gun unfortunately must not be got off maxim be saved village be carried by marine with fixed bayonet at four oclock arrived opposite great building turned out to be imperial arsenal of hsi ku two unarmed soldier came out from house hundred yard from bank with evident intention of communicating with advance halted men when came up made simple enquiry a to who be where be going having got what information wanted sauntered back to house from a soon a reached heavy fire be opened with rifle gun fortunately there be good cover close at hand of fellow occupied neighbouring village others took shelter behind river embankment be then decided to take arsenal resistance be becoming more severe with yard force advanced provision be almost exhausted troop who have be for time on half ration be exhausted with heat continual exertion attack be begun with heavy rifle fire against hotchkiss gun in north corner of arsenal two gun on river front be soon silenced body of marine seaman be then directed to cross river higher up if possible to rush enemy position at north corner fortunately there be village only hundred fifty yard from point sailor having crawled up there unobserved dashed out of cover at double with cheer in troop on other side of river joined chinese at corner be making for bolted at once lower down river german detachment have crossed captured gun in front subsequently several others between two body cleared out armoury in afternoon chinese made most determined attempt to retake arsenal advancing boldly under very heavy shell fire a however have captured gun drove enemy back with heavy loss not before have suffered considerably ourselves main body of troop wounded be in meantime crossing late in afternoon whole force be safe in arsenal thing looked better now than have done since have left tientsin of course have knowledge at of what be going on there thought that must only have to maintain till force be sent out to assistance several messenger have be sent on during march during night three officer with hundred marine set out to try to make way down to tientsin have scarcely started however when encountered determined resistance bugle sounded in direction finding that whole force of enemy be upon having lost four of number have option to fall back at daylight chinese made desperate attempt to retake armoury maintained until eight oclock when be beaten off have now time to make thorough investigation of content of various building to delight found store of fifteen ton of rice placed for time beyond risk of starvation discovered too immense supply of gun arm ammunition war material of latest pattern so that felt capable of holding out for long time at council of war be considered to be impossible to force way down for have now no fewer than two hundred thirty wounded to carry first move be to mount number of gun on various front of arsenal with opened fire upon boxer stronghold situated near arsenal chinese fort lower down river effect be excellent chinese retired made fresh attempt to retake place on twenty fifth european troop be reported in sight at seven oclock relief column under colonel shirinsky arrived at fort preparation be at once made for evacuation of armoury for destruction of arsenal wounded be transported across river in afternoon whole force followed later at three oclock on following morning started two officer remaining behind to set fire to ammunition store house fire be lit in five separate place from volume of smoke rose from building explosion heard from direction destruction seemed fairly complete officer crossed river after lighting fire mounted pony be waiting for then rejoined main body met with further resistance country through passed be flat along river bank village of mud hut generally surrounded with enclosure of dried reed be scattered at frequent interval near village high reed grew plentifully in patch tree be numerous with entrenchment for irrigation against flood graf everywhere scattered about afforded excellent cover to enemy seldom exposed always withdrawing a advanced fire be generally very high have be otherwise must have suffered very severely altogether think that although failed in object affair have be very creditable considering difficulty to be exposed none of who took part in have reason to be ashamed of what have done at beginning opponent be largely armed only with sword spear in latter part have to encounter trained troop excellently armed provided with gun there can be doubt that belonged to regular army thank very much major johnston for interesting account mr bateman said have be fighting nearly a hard here for past ten day hope now that in short time will begin to turn table upon expect will have hard work before to take tientsin for there will probably be opposed by troop with whom have hitherto be engaged have doubt that have followed down to day anticipating that will now take offensive yes expect will have stiff fighting major johnston said may be sure that shant shirk well think now with permission that will turn in have sleep to speak of last night may be wanted again early in morning three officer be up early went down to see after marine rex went out with to hear what be going to be done town presented very different appearance from have shown for past ten day street be no longer deserted swarmed everywhere with troop bugle be blowing be life bustle house have be closed be open again men congratulated other that strain be over rex went down to shed be head quarter of volunteer here twenty thirty have already assembled rex be of course in simple uniform of corp have brought rifle with what be going to be done asked dont know yet said one of friend russian be certainly going to march out suppose mixed column will also go in case will accompany expect will get order before long tientsin be one of most important town in china standing a doe at junction of peiho grand canal lupi canal five smaller stream canal be not only port of pekin practically sole outlet of trade of whole of north western province of china population amount to nearly million trade be considerably better than of canton be exceeded only by of native city be enclosed in sombre wall lie two mile farther up river than foreign settlement import of tientsin include not only european manufacture also sugar salt tribute rice of southern province from interior there be vast export trade in wood fur of manchuria mongolia tea of hang chow ground nut bristle of chih li foreign trade be growing rapidly must have increased still more for want of water in peiho river be about size of thames at richmond used to be deep with rapid current large ocean going steamer be able to come up to settlement to unload extensive canal irrigation work however have of late year greatly diminished flow of water so now vessel of considerable draught have to remain outside bar thirteen mile out at sea even small vessel can only come a far a tonku three mile up river mouth a soon a be known that allied general have decided upon bombardment of city earnest protestation be made by leading merchant of nationality military necessity overruled wish until town be captured settlement must be practically beleaguered must be impossible to make advance to pekin leave large chinese force in city behind moreover if advance did not take place not only must legation at pekin inevitably fall life of european in china must be in jeopardy consequently allied general arrived unanimously at conclusion that bombardment assault of tientsin be absolute vital necessity already there have be enormous loss of life there thousand if not ten of thousand of chinese suspected of being favourable to ally have be sacrificed in perpetration of outrage whole street have be destroyed by fire be therefore necessary if for other reason to inflict terrible lesson upon chinese troop who occupied city chinese be convinced that must be impossible for european to capture city held a be by greatly superior force of regular chinese troop protected by very large number of gun bombardment be to be greatly deplored for enormous injury inflicted upon tientsin must not cripple trade there for many year probably divert to other channel still necessity must not be denied grievous though effect might be russian have already started from camp be on opposite side of river in foreign settlement marched against peiyang arsenal be on same side about mile half up be defended by several thousand chinese with six nine pounder krupp attack have to be made across open plain be swept by incessant rifle fire while chinese artillery made excellent practice casualty mounted up quickly before long halt be called messenger be sent to tientsin to ask for reinforcement when messenger arrived bugle sounded troop hastily assembled whole of naval brigade under captain bourke of orlando be called out including battalion of marine under major johnston with went twelve pounder gun from terrible american marine artillery also went out together with detachment of tientsin volunteer when got to scene of action found russian shelling arsenal under cover of railway embankment movement be made till eleven oclock when russian shell exploded in principal chinese magazine contained le than eighty ton of powder explosion be terrific for minute great cloud of smoke hung over arsenal shock be so severe that soldier who be standing up at time be thrown off foot by sound be heard distinctly at taku thirty mile away british have increased fire shortly afterwards terrible twelve pounder put shell into smaller magazine also blew up explosion be hailed by troop with tremendous cheer few minute later be redoubled when chinese be seen leaving fort british american who be nearer than russian at once advanced at double chinese composed of sterner stuff than comrade still kept up fire causing casualty also retreated in good time to secure own safety when storming party be close to arsenal what seemed to be tremendous musketry fire broke out from building supposing that there be still very large force there troop halted presently however fire ceased altogether again advanced when entered place discovered that fire have checked be not musketry long string of cracker chinese have prepared to check storming party thus secure own retreat angry a troop be at being deceived laughed heartily at trick have be played upon after arsenal be occupied large mixed force of chinese regular boxer came out from tientsin city at back of railway station placed between arsenal river on very ground british american have occupied first act be to massacre wounded who have be left there one poor fellow alone be saved for although have be very seriously wounded in leg managed to run british chinese regiment coming up at moment be able to reach arsenal in safety murder of wounded exasperated troop to last degree palliated if did not excuse general refusal of quarter to chinese during campaign in tientsin document be found showing that reward have be paid to several chinese who have brought in head of british american soldier capture of arsenal enabled woman child to be sent away within next few day be fortunate occurrence for large reinforcement of chinese troop entered city day after settlement be again exposed to vigorous fire reinforcement be coming up even yet force be not considered sufficiently strong to attack tientsin destruction caused by chinese fire be very great number of house be burnt many containing store of great value in one of alone twenty thousand pound worth of fur other chinese produce be consumed rex be maddened by delay occurred after arsenal have be taken be fixed idea among military men that pekin have fallen occupant have be massacred many rumour to effect have indeed be received rex found assertion that legation be well able to hold out received with absolute incredulity repeatedly urged opinion on major johnston officer said that officer in command be so firmly convinced that be quite useless for to bring matter before see said be now fortnight since left place may very well have fallen by time reported state of thing on arrival so much have occurred since then chinese have fought so pluckily that one can not imagine possible that mere handful of men in legation can have resisted determined attack at time left news of fighting here must not have arrived fear that when fierce fighting here became known anger of chinese must be raised to such point that must make general furious attack on legation in case acknowledge that must have fallen besides however anxious everyone may be for advance nothing can be done until tientsin be taken rex must not acknowledge justice of reasoning be strongly tempted to make journey to pekin so many of admiral seymour messenger have failed that felt that must not ask father permission to undertake spent day whether on off duty at barricade keeping up vengeful fire on chinese love of fun have entirely left face be a stern a of oldest soldier be horrible father said to think that girl others in legation may be massacred before get there wont believe that have be captured yet in spite of numerous report that reach if keep on delaying a be doing now legation may very well have fallen before get there bitterly regret that came down for might have remained at pekin have succeeded somehow in saving girl dont think must have done so must only have thrown away own life must remember dear a girl be to be naturally far dearer be very serious business attacking tientsin repulse must be telegraphed over china turn waverer against must be awful affair eagerly a long for relieving force to set out feel that can not be attempted until have force sufficient to ensure capture of tientsin to be able to fight way up against opposition will certainly meet with possibly opposition will not be serious father when have once turned out of tientsin be possible rex fear that even then there will be delay be great pity that force be not under one head composed of men of one nation a be step to be taken have to be discussed decided upon by officer in command of various nationality there be be well known sort of bickering jealousy between russian want to have everything own way general opinion be that be fighting only for own advantage that be bent upon destruction of tientsin practical annihilation of trade of place in order to divert whole of trade of north west to port japanese interest lie exactly other way here japan be acquiring good share of trade if be turned to manchurian port must lose altogether naturally therefore a force here be about a strong a of russia general be not disposed to let latter entirely have own way a for interest be a large a others put together have have more than share of fighting unfortunately have officer of sufficient rank command to hold russian in check however at present preparation have be made for advance upon pekin nothing be thought talked of tientsin yet after city be taken there will be great deal to arrange before can move forward be certain that advancing force must move by river in other way must army be provisioned for railway be wrecked from end to end must say that even with hard work without opposition must take at least month to restore to order well will be necessary to collect great number of junksriver junk for sea going craft must draw far too much water then great quantity of store must be got together seems to that while troop be waiting here for reinforcement ought to be making preparation for advance of course be judge whatever of military matter doe seem to a seems to civilian here at least something ought to be done that with force have here be disgraceful that must be doing nothing while countryman be fighting for life at pekin however suppose present state of thing can not last indefinitely have doubt that telegram have be sent by nation in europe to military representative here urging to make effort to relieve legation though unfortunately a learn from shanghai appears to be almost settled conviction in europe a be among military men here that legation have already fallen within perished empress of china be one person responsible for mischief if have set face firmly against boxer from first issued stringent instruction to general to stamp out must never have be formidable encouragement that gave punishment inflicted upon few general who did duty attacked have caused be because be allowed to attack legation destroy railway that ally be forced to capture taku fort capture of taku fort at once caused chinese army to make common cause with boxer one step have be necessitated by be not that viceroy of yangtse valley have declined to obey command have maintained order in district under whole of china must be in blaze european outside treaty port must have be massacred a soon a affair be over will return to europe remain there for at least couple of year for certainly there will be renewal of trade within time may be sure that merchant in chinese city who carried on dealing with be therefore suspected of being well disposed towards be among vast number who have be massacred know that quarter inhabited by have be almost destroyed before can be rebuilt fresh body of men take place very considerable time must elapse chapter xv relief in sight on afternoon of th of british american troop marched out from tientsin to hsi ku route led through almost deserted ruined city through village straggled away for mile on northern road weather be threatening when start be made heavy rain began to fall when be half way out road soon became soft slippery felt that must have bad time of if weather continued to be wet rain ceased however when reached destination halted at village near fort here general gaselee took up head quarter while british troop bivouacked to left american to right of road order be issued for early start troop lay down on wet miry ground to get what sleep must enemy be known to be entrenched in position extending across river railway right resting on embankment running from hsi ku in westerly direction left being five mile away on other side of river at camp near railway bridge beyond country be inundated main body of force be in centre where line crossed river here position be covered by series of rifle pit trench being partly concealed by high crop must have be very difficult to capture from hand of determined enemy grove of tree on left bank of river within loop made by double bend marked centre of position battery of artillery be posted on embankment line of entrenchment across plain on left bank of river position be protected by canal running along whole length have be arranged that japanese british american be to advance against enemy position on right bank of river that japanese be to lead attack with british in support american in reserve while russian french assisted by gun of british naval brigade be to operate on left bank british american troop have not very long period of rest for before night have passed jap arrived having started after dark marched straight through village troop there by mean sorry to leave uncomfortable quarter at once got under arm followed moved forward to westward under cover of embankment upon chinese battery stood be necessary to capture before advancing against main position when order be issued for jap to leave at eight oclock rex have be rather disposed to sleep comfortably at home join in morning for knew that service must not be required a thunderstorm be coming on just a formed up that feeling increased finally however made up mind to march with troop when found that be not to halt be going straight forward to attack rejoiced that have not given way to first impulse have brought with waterproof sheet carried rifle ah lo who of course accompanied have large bag of provision slung over shoulder waterproof wrapped round kept dry during thunder shower brisk march japanese kept up prevented from feeling cold be not going forward to attack be master ah lo asked a approached scene of action father only allowed to come with force on condition must not take part in fighting unless position became so critical must not help really have desire to fight want to be able to see what be going on round if be to go forward must only see little happened near presently bright flash broke out ahead on embankment speedily grew into storm of musketry a be still dark japanese did not suffer heavily majority of bullet going overhead rex climbed up on embankment from there must see by fire that japanese advanced steadily till be close to gun then suddenly stopped firing two three minute later volley flashed out evidently few yard from chinese line for moment two line became mixed then even above roar of musketry rex must hear cheer of jap knew that gun be won for distance fire drifted away along embankment showing that hot pursuit be being kept up be now three in morning there be cessation of hostility for hour half then when chinese position must be made out japanese british gun opened fire upon from behind embankment chinese replied energetically in hour fire began to relax soon ceased altogether be evident that be already withdrawing gun meanwhile japanese have be advancing supported by mountain battery on right taking cover in high maize worked up close to position held by enemy on river bank little after five oclock burst out from cover with cheer dashed at outlying trench a crossed open suffered heavily from flanking fire poured in upon from grove of tree on other side of river chinese in front also stood sufficiently long to inflict severe loss upon for have left maize in too close formation without halt however held on sweeping chinese before carrying entrenchment after entrenchment cavalry cut up flying chinese whenever opportunity offered british american have now come up with japanese on right american on left combined force worked way along river bank occasionally chinese offered slight resistance at long range be expected that must make stand at peitsang where have number of strong position a at tientsin panic of first fugitive speedily communicated to behind position after position be evacuated without effort to retain before steady advance of ally troop moved along river clearing out village quickening pace of fugitive at nine oclock occupied nangsung a firing ceased pushed on to peitsang found deserted halted there on left bank of river russian french have failed to turn chinese right in early morning a found that whole country be flooded there defeat of chinese left involved of course retirement of right at nine oclock russian be able to occupy position on railway almost whole of casualty involved in battle be among japanese who lost sixty killed two hundred forty wounded british have four killed twenty one wounded while american being in reserve have not suffered at loss of chinese be very small at one point have lost fifty killed very few have fallen in rest of entrenchment owing to hurried flight have be defeated simply because have lost heart fact promised well for success of expedition for in flight have probably communicated fear to troop behind that in army of twenty five thousand men there must have be only hundred killed be proof that courage have evaporated after first day sturdy defence of tientsin have be by mean restored during interval have since elapsed russian french joined rest of force at ten oclock day baggage came up be of most miscellaneous description there be pack animal of sortshorses mule pony donkey there be cart of shape size from great american wagon drawn by four mule down to little vehicle like costers barrow drawn by little japanese pony even japanese whose arrangement be far better than of rest of ally be poorly provided have only intended originally to take brigade to pekin have brought transport sufficient for when so large portion of british force be detained for work in south be obliged to take division consequently double strain be thrown upon transport illustration cavalry cut up flying chinese on following morning main body of japanese advanced along right bank of river repairing breach have be made in british american with two battalion of jap battery of field artillery be to advance upon russian french be also to march upon bank early start be made russian french going on ahead of british followed line of river general gaselee marched by more direct road getting ahead of came into touch with enemy at half past nine position be strong one right resting on bridge close to river in angle made between railway embankment near bridge be ruin of nangsung railway station formed centre of position left extended far to eastward where town of nangsung lay hidden behind number of village general gaselee chaffee took up position on high sand hill two mile away from railway station from be able to direct operation enemy fire be first drawn by company of cossack who have be sent on ahead of russian force to reconnoitre main body of russian have not arrived have japanese detached to co operate with british american nevertheless general decided to attack at once th field battery be brought up on left opened fire on village near railway station under cover of infantry attack developed british advancing in extended order through high maize american on left of railway embankment covered by fire of rally battery while preparation be being made general linivitch came up explained to general gaselee that russian be advancing on enemy right along road running parallel with river japanese detachment also came up advance now became general british in centre american on right russian on left british led direct assault upon enemy entrenchment st sikh who be at head of line moved steadily forward in face of very heavy rifle fire be maintained until arrived at short distance from railway station a usual however chinese lost heart when saw that be about to be charged with bayonet retreated to top of railway embankment from for short time kept up fire upon american regiment next to sikh front entrenchment be carried just about eleven oclock quarter of hour later fire ceased enemy retiring towards russian passed out to rear of captured village seized railway station erected battery bombarded village round yangtsun town meanwhile force on right be engaged in clearing out village in direction bengal lancer scattering demoralized enemy in direction yangtsun be occupied without resistance during afternoon loss have be comparatively slight british casualty be under fifty of twenty four be among sikh american lost seventy four russian twenty seven proportionately large number be accounted for by fact that detachment advanced in somewhat closer order than british who keeping line well extended suffered comparatively little loss though be exposed to heavier fire than others japanese have taken part in engagement a have be on other bank of river troop be very much exhausted after two day marching fighting in great heat next day remained at yangtsun partly for rest partly to give time to junk to come up council of war be held be decided that road must now be left that whole force must proceed on right bank of river jap be to lead advance russian be to follow american to come next british to bring up rear during day rex went out to look at of captured village be so horrified by number of peasant whom found lying dead that soon returned to yangtsun russian appeared to have killed everyone met whether soldier quiet peasant american in village have taken have acted very differently in place found that peasant have not be molested have be with detachment of japanese joined british have therefore be witness of fighting can not say much for countryman ah lo said if be not going to fight better than have done have much better have cleared off road altogether left open for to go quietly to pekin chinaman good to fight ah lo said contemptuously fight well enough at distance good when see that european always come on in spite of firing very good to kill missionary good to fight soldier do think will find legation safe ah lo hope so master if go on fighting time instead of same a when be there chinese must have taken nearly legation expect people be crowded up into british legation make great fight there be so ah lo le space have to defend stronger become will have terrible experience if be crowded into british legation place be full enough when left still can hardly hope that if chinese have gone on attacking time must hold more than own legation french legation be almost destroyed before came away russian legation must only be held with difficulty more than fu have already be captured try to think that be all right be horribly anxious time be wasted after have taken tientsin be regretting that have not stopped at pekin two rifle might not have be of much good must certainly have be of use above all wanted to be there in case legation be captured cousin have chinese dress ready can not help thinking that there must have be point be not attacked where must have lowered down from wall so escaped into city once away from fighting ought to have be able to find place of concealment among so many ruined deserted house perhaps stand out right said ah lo hope so ah lo hope so with heart be terribly anxious grudge even day halt knowing that hour be of importance that even while be staying here to day massacre may be going on ah lo have consolation to offer felt that what master said be true at moment catastrophe might occur japanese started early on following day be already in advance for reason have be chosen to lead halt be made at tung chow ten mile distant resistance having be encountered on way japanese arrived long before rest of ally be very fast marcher transport be light handy able to keep up with infantry column russian on other hand be very slow marcher slouched along a if half asleep made very frequent halt average pace rarely exceeded mile hour consequently american who followed be frequently blocked russian too always stopped at village thus compelling american to halt on hot sandy road accounted for great number of casualty from sun stroke among american troop for very slow progress made by american british for great amount of marching have to do during hottest hour of day instead of completing journey before sun have attained full strength japanese generally completed march before sun be high american seemed to suffer most from sun marched fast in early morning when heat of day be over british marching be good indian troop carried well marched in good order even in hottest part of day though many fell out a regard uniform british be better off than others jap wore white consequently be visible for mile while british khaki must scarcely be seen at hundred yard russian be also in white uniform being always extremely dirty disadvantage be not so apparent american like british have khaki seldom wore coat blue shirt rendered visible for considerable distance on following day mixed body of lancer cossack japanese cavalry scouted country ahead came in contact with enemy half way to ho hsi wu where be expected that chinese must make stand main body halted encamped jap threw out outpost during day two squadron of bengal lancer came upon force of four hundred chinese cavalry whom charged killing forty fifty capturing standard british always came in long time after rest of force followed winding of river to protect junk be carrying up heavy gun intended for siege of pekin be fortunate that forage be plentiful for cavalry animal of artillery transport millet be standing high a frequently large extent of grain have to be cut down to make clearance for camping ground there be abundant fodder to supply demand junk came up very slowly towed by line of cooly on bank late arrival frequently excited great exasperation among troop who be dependent upon for supply ho hsi wu be small village near be situated arsenal stored with enormous quantity of gunpowder a well a supply of gun of latest pattern chinese have made attempt to divert course of river by digging enormous trench in direction of lowlying ground fortunately have not have time to complete work for not only must have still further lowered river must have rendered attack on village difficult a trench be twenty foot deep from twenty to thirty foot wide a be left be still above level of water must be crossed easily village be therefore captured after only slight resistance scene on board long line of junk be interesting to looker on amusing two three time rex handed horse to ah lo took passage in one of junk of course be guarded by soldier of various nationality whose supply be on board did best to urge on cooly a collision be frequent boat now again ran ashore hubbub of shouting in five six language be appalling rudder be smashed bulwark crashed in damage done in way crowd of lubberly craft pushed on in spite of confusion that everywhere reigned japanese have unquestionably best of be comfortably settled down with hospital erected before russian lumbered up everything did be a well arranged a if have be at home rex must not admit that little soldier be far ahead of of european country in point of organization discipline quickness cheeriness of movement looting be allowed among very few outrage indeed be committed by on unfortunate peasantry in respect compared very favourably with troop of other nationality even including own although general gaselee set strongly against such act severely punishing such offender a must be brought to justice on tenth japanese again pressed on outpost getting to within mile of retreating enemy general fukushima moving spirit of pursuit be asked in evening if troop be not very tired yes said grimly so be enemy be spirit in carried on movement enemy be to be kept on run time be to be given to recover spirit be even worse off than pursuing enemy for have commissariat carried provision with have to feed upon what must gather at halting place be seldom more than melon millet from field japanese cavalry infantry halted about three mile in advance of main body when rest of infantry came up be extended searched village near line of march done cavalry again went on ahead for distance process be then repeated in way army marched down to matou be long march troop suffered terribly from heat with exception of british who be wisely kept at last halting place until late in afternoon came on in cool of evening main body of force bivouacked at japanese camp being three mile farther ahead next morning japanese arrived at chan chia wan day be cooler than preceding one rain fell affording great relief from heat japanese reached place at eleven oclock sent on strong detachment of cavalry infantry artillery to reconnoitre discovered enemy in position south of chungtaw at about two oclock japanese brought up more artillery shelled place whereupon enemy retired into tung chow large very wealthy city only thirteen mile from pekin next morning japanese entered tung chow without meeting with resistance took possession of half of city rest of allied army arrived somewhat later at once began to loot portion of town river trade down to tientsin pass through tung chow contains even richer pawn shop than pekin be very important institution in china not only because of richness of security on money be advanced because be used a storing place for valuable by general public contain immense quantity of jewellery costly fur jade work of art of sort description greater part of lower class of population have remained in city joined in general looting be carried on everywhere whenever saw chance officer in vain tried to keep men in control in narrow street in russian section soldier be allowed to do just a pleased gave entirely to looting rapine crime of kind report of flying chinese soldier have aroused in people intense fear of foreign devil so when troop arrived at town village many of inhabitant made away with to avoid outrage of licensed soldiery woman threw out of window drowned in well indeed whole family often committed suicide in order to avoid worse fate thus although very many terrible outrage be committed accounted for small proportion of death among chinese people british camp be at edge of river soldier be not allowed inside town stringent order have be given against looting have other general taken same view of matter campaign must not have be disgraced by plundering murder of innocent people british general be proud of troop justly so rex have secured room in quarter held by japanese enjoyed good sleep be greatly grieved at awful destruction went on in town must not wonder at cowardice of chinese in evacuating without striking blow place whose wall be at least a strong a at tientsin leaving enormous wealth to enemy got up early in morning rode out sun have not yet risen narrow street be filled with scum of town who invisible day before have now returned in number bent on looting house of more wealthy countryman who have forsaken filthy beggar cooly staggered along under weight of fur roll of silk front of nearly house be broken in content turned topsy turvy ally have taken pick of good vast quantity remained for who chose to carry away change of fortune that twenty four hour have wrought be extraordinary rich men have become beggar beggar have acquired that made wealthy rex let horse help at grain shop day be likely to be heavy one ration served out be scanty now ah lo said a joined japanese troop who a usual started before daylight be last day of march by to night suspense will be over will know what have happened japanese have reason to be proud of general yamaguchi on entering town issued proclamation promising protection to non combatant telling people to remain in house be unfortunate indeed that japanese have not occupied whole of city if have scene have disgraced nation must have be avoided japanese advanced by old stone causeway leading to eastern gate of tartar city russian by road more to south north of canal leading to northern gate of chinese city south of canal be american still farther to south british have be arranged on previous evening at meeting of general that column must halt short distance from city arrangement however be broken by russian who marched close up to city wall meeting with opposition thinking that surprise might be effected advanced up to gate here however be met by heavy rifle fire killed wounded many men must not well retire message begging for reinforcement be first intimation of what have occurred subsequent rumour stated that have succeeded in entering city other general annoyed at trick by russian hoped to have glory of being first to get into city at once marched forward with haste without consultation jap have a agreed halted at village three mile from eastern gate in one of dwelling attached to joss house temple rex few japanese took shelter a night came on drizzling rain began to fall at nine oclock desultory firing be heard to east hour after few shot somewhat nearer came from direction of eastern gate later fire increased jap got under arm a night be very dark be impossible to tell what be going on mindful of arrangement have be made must not attempt to advance just before daylight started again then rex learned of trick russian have played that messenger have arrived begging fukushima to send reinforcement officer who brought message said that if japanese joined russian combined force must succeed in making entrance through wall into city fukushima replied what about american british russian officer shrugged shoulder said why must trouble about when can do without fukushima replied angrily that have undertaken to attack at certain time that must stick to undertaking be pretty bad beginning to day work rex said to japanese officer who be marching alongside wish have come without russian at officer replied have brought disgrace upon by infamous doings have worked on own account since started be surly brute must infinitely rather fight against a have doubt will have to do day than against poor beggar of chinese be perfectly scandalous that after making agreement only last night that be to hold council morning arrange for attack in unison must sneak forward try to get glory chapter capture of pekin day be just breaking a japanese moved forward rex rode with advance guard be moving along on road with flanking party in wood close by suddenly there be sound of rifle shot in wood bullet whizzed through air overhead column at once broke up taking shelter among bush began to advance in direction of firing became heavier moment be complete surprise for idea have be entertained that chinese must advance beyond protection of wall main body behind have halted wounded men be carried out of wood must give particular a to force have attacked presently mounted russian officer dashed out from wood rode up to head quarter staff where shouted to fukushima that russian jap be firing upon other order be at once given to cease firing investigation showed that affair have be caused by few chinese lurking in wood who have fired upon jap russian whose movement be unknown to jap be advancing on other side of wood japanese bullet flying over head led to believe that be attacked by chinese so two allied force skirmished briskly with other until mistake be discovered unfortunately several men be wounded on side two russian killed a soon a matter be cleared up japanese resumed forward march in short time on rounding base of small eminence saw great wall of pekin massive gate house for quarter of mile outside town extended labyrinth of narrow street road ran straight through to first gate leading through great tower to reach wide moat crossed by great stone bridge have to be traversed gate must not be seen a road made sharp angle at tower therefore gun must not be brought to play upon until be close up beyond gate be large yard from opened inner gate of wall not soul be to be seen in street japanese moved forward with general feeling of expectation wonderment why did not chinese open fire be within short range yet there be sign of foe began to think that a at tung chow entry be not going to be opposed when suddenly a rounded bend tremendous fire broke out from wall storm of bullet smote column pending order there be nothing for to rush for shelter dispersal of solid battalion resembled that of crowd when thunder shower break suddenly overhead for time nothing must be done crowded in little house troop waited for engineer who be to blow up gate to complete work rex by stooping low made way forward until reached point where must watch what be going on in front here must see little japanese soldier cheering a advanced running forward towards gate under tremendous fire of musketry of first detachment more than half fell before have gone many yard others pushed on until almost last man have fallen attempt after attempt be made brave fellow going forward a cheerfully to almost certain death a if to fte soon became evident however that success must not be attained even at greatest sacrifice of life twenty minute after commencement attack be given up nothing must now be done until night fell afforded screen for forlorn hope to get up to gate japanese artillery be brought up placed on elevated ground beyond suburb outside wall opened fire on gate surroundings meanwhile troop be withdrawn from house near wall scattering among at safer distance from lay down waited for further order rex went out with fukushima to hill on japanese gun be preparing to open fire there be fewer than sixty four of for most part quite small be soon at work pounding great tower wall be not long however before became evident that massively built structure be not to be seriously injured by such puny missile while larger gun be still kept at work smaller one be turned upon city wall a result enemy musketry fire diminished soon only occasional shot rang out from wall chinese fired few shell in reply strangely enough did little in way although outlying suburb might very speedily have be set on fire jap driven out from shelter japanese fire continued for six hour even at end of time gate tower although face be closely pock marked by ball have not be seriously damaged day passed slowly be relief indeed when a darkness came on men again moved up into house on main road in lane branching from after be ready be still kept waiting at last two loud explosion be heard engineer have done work in few second japanese be swarming out of house going forward at double keeping time a went to cheerful cry of one two one two with always advanced chinese be not taken unprepared storm of fire broke out from great tower battlement on wall a heavy a have encountered in morning happily be to certain extent random one for although moon have just risen light be not sufficiently strong to enable defender of wall to make out advancing enemy with accuracy nevertheless middle of road be so swept with fire that jap a advanced have to take what shelter must in house on side a got to last broad open space halted at corner then went forward in batch cheering singing many fell many also reached gate once under wall be in shelter from fire leading party dashing through gate have be blown down speedily drove back of defender gathered there gate house be soon captured troop a entered be marched up to top of wall following to right left drove chinese before latter however offering obstinate resistance at bastion from wall city appeared mass of ruin continuous fire of japanese gun have created immense destruction large space have be swept by shot shell at point heavy fire be opened from ruin upon white clad column showed up very clear in moonlight on top of wall form of opposition presently ceased great fire must be seen burning in direction of legation column pressed on anxious to be among first to arrive there just at midnight however came upon russian picket on wall to disappointment learned that legation have be relieved in afternoon pressed on however at two oclock entered legation general staff stopped at japanese legation rex ah lo pushed on over barricade ruin to of british here found almost square foot of ground occupied made way among sleeper until reached hospital here alone there be sign of life light shone in window rex knowing way well moved quietly into kitchen fire be still burning kettle pot be boiling on floor with head resting on chair mabel be sitting fast asleep feeling sure that jenny be assisting in ward remained quiet for minute two until head nurse entered with can for water ah mr bateman exclaimed a saw be indeed glad to see cousin have be very anxious about have nearly finished in hospital now will get hour two sleep hope will send cousin out to at once thank said rex now that know be well be quite content to wait till morning must be obliged if must let jenny know have be here will be very glad to do so have be practically two night without sleep said rex now know that girl be well feel have only to find room enough to lie down somewhere will be off to sleep almost before head touch ground can not ask to stop here mr bateman for regulation be very strict thank be not thinking of indeed must much prefer open air joined ah lo again lying down on ground close to entrance of hospital fell asleep almost immediately although japanese have done by far heaviest fighting suffered greatest loss other ally have in case have serious fighting russian attack although have be made in defiance of agreement entered into advance must be made against city until ally have arrived at position assigned to be gallant affair to certain extent accident reconnoitring party consisting of four hundred infantry three gun have pushed forward meeting with sign of enemy until to surprise found close up to outer wall at angle where wall of chinese tartar city join be pitch dark when arrived with sudden rush disposed of chinese guard on duty on bridge immediately outside tung pien gate then blew hole in gate with gun then mounted on tartar wall up to time opposition have encountered have be very slight may be accounted for by fact that chinese be so briskly engaged at time in attack upon legation that proceeding of russian have really be unnoticed about time however moon rose bringing into relief russian moving on wall immediately desperate fire be opened upon nearly horse with gun be at once killed infantry taking place dragged gun back to shelter near point where have entered city urgent demand for reinforcement be then sent to main body of russian force refusal of japanese to take part in affair on ground that be result of breach of arrangement arrived at by allied commander paralyzed action of russian general be not until ten oclock on following morning that reinforcement arrived in meantime detachment have be exposed to continuous heavy fire have be obliged to sally out to defeat force advanced with intention of taking in rear attack although made contrary to agreement be of great advantage to legation for furious onslaught have be made upon with evident intention of destroying before ally attacked city therefore releasing whole of chinese force for purpose of defence a soon however a chinese learned that russian have entered gate considerable portion of force round legation be withdrawn to oppose advance from moment fury of assault abated considerably british have met with slight resistance main body have left tung chow at two oclock on morning of fourteenth when within mile of southeast gate bombarded village drove enemy holding into town then advancing entered chinese city pushed on until reached chien gate of tartar wall here be welcomed by allied troop holding wall near gate must not however let in for short time british force be exposed to galling fire from chinese city from other part of wall british however knew of water gate open into canal running up between russian british legation fu having received news that be likely to be unguarded by messenger sent out by sir claude macdonald general gaselee therefore taking with th rajput party of st sikh made dash for gate got through without much trouble chinese never dreaming that attack must be made on side of city have not placed strong force there a soon a general gaselee have entered by water gate party of american russian be able without much difficulty to seize chien mn so admit main body of british force who be waiting there to enter loss sustained altogether by ally be small in comparison with what might have be anticipated in capturing town very strongly fortified defended by garrison of courageous men japanese lost about two hundred killed wounded russian hundred twenty eight killed wounded american who with french entered city immediately after russian twenty four killed wounded while british have dozen casualty rex slept soundly for three hour be then aroused by din going on around when started up found that in addition to crowd who have occupied place during siege number of soldierssikhs rajput welsh fusilier royal marine infantry sailor be moving about scattered among be few men of other nationality who have missed column during night have straggled in officer men alike be endeavouring with scanty amount of water at disposal to get rid of dust gathered during two preceding day be talking laughing in highest glee at satisfactory conclusion of work most of like rex have slept on ground for be impossible to find quarter in already crowded house giving shake a substitute for wash went across to hospital one of nurse came to door be too early mr bateman said cousin did not go to bed till half past two can not think of waking till eight

appetite just at present well can eat a much a like eat quickly for want to know about everything have only heard that there be very little fighting on way up that jap did principal part of yes be fortunate enough to see for came up a interpreter to head quarter staff can tell in very few word about march up here principal event be fighting yesterday must finish eating before begin talking about after have made good meal rex gave full account of storming of gate by japanese when finished sandwich said now tell how be that have be tremendous time in relieving also what have happened at tientsin first question be easy enough to answer general made up mind that legation have be captured whole lot of massacred be not until despatch came down from conger about ten day before started that really woke up in earnest nothing have worked smoothly since day when came up to relieve tientsin jap american got on capitally together others be always raising difficulty especially russian general opinion among be that be playing double game in what way bateman well that really can not tell certainly general altogether opposed march up be only when gaselee chaffee declared that must go alone if none of others must accompany that russian have to give way be generally believed that wanted in way to pose a friend of china on strength of to get concession sort of thing especially to obtain from china concession of whole of manchuria have doubt will try on game now when thing settle down again unless other power back up china be rum state of thing altogether sandwich said well tell about tientsin to begin with then tientsin settlement have to large extent ceased to exist what be fighting so severe a that have heard nothing about yes be very severe a far a actual fighting went be not in here at for eight nine day be bombarded by number of gun french settlement be nearest to enemy may be said to have be completely destroyed cathedral mission house burned rest of house practically knocked to piece quarter be pounded pretty heavily not to same extent be exposed to continuous fire from ruin of chinese college on other side of river from house remained on side of course have barricade erected at end of street nevertheless be not altogether pleasant to walk about in shower of bullet shot shell came practically from direction hottest fighting be at railway station where went on night day well when large reinforcement came up took offensive russian french did not do much jap american fellow have very hard work at end of first day thing looked pretty bad be established in suburb outside town farther than must not get indeed there be question whether must not fall back after dark however be negatived that must have be even proposed showed that be really in tight place fortunately during night same question be discussed by chinese concluded that a be evident that did not intend to go have better do so greater portion of accordingly marched away in morning carried gate between jap doing most of fighting a soon a be in chinese bolted like sheep found that artillery fire have be most destructive in town that large portion of place be in ruin however be principally work of chinese who during first stage of affair acted like madman one know how many of people suspected of being friendly to be massacred put at ten of thousand at rate be great many thousand river be literally full of corps besides killing people sacked set fire to house way enormous amount of damage be done ally must be confessed did lot of looting jap agreed behaved best american very fairly russian who have done practically nothing towards taking of town acted in most brutal way moreover actually wanted one of number appointed governor fortunately other power must not agree to in end commission of threea russian jap englishmanwere appointed to manage thing lot of chinese be enlisted a policeman in day two place be littered with dead be got into sort of order if have not be done there certainly must have be pestilence what about seymour force have to fight way back be getting into great strait for provision when luckily enough by sudden attack captured arsenal of hsi ku five mile north of native town here found tremendous quantity of weapon store big supply of rice although chinese tried to recapture place be able to hold without much difficulty until when reinforcement came up from sea strong body went out relieved must hardly have fought way down without aid for have hundred of wounded large number of fighting men must have be required to carry how about capture of taku fort well will tell about later of course did not see that be cut off from sea for day what be doing time joined volunteersevery able bodied man did soand helped in beating off several attack on barrier also have part in of fighting at railway station be about hottest thing in whole affair indeed be only saved by fortunate arrival of party of sikh who came out to take place of garrison even with aid be close thing for boxer fought with greatest pluck even crossed bayonet with there have given now rough account of detail will follow later here be breakfast coming in want to take turn round see how matter stood up to time when arrived after be going to see cousin be going to say suppose will be off duty now hear that firing have broken out again that show that although have got in chinese have not got out may give more trouble before have done with by way what have become of empress bolted three day ago when heard fancy that have taken tung chow dont know whether must be wise to send force in pursuit of considering that town be still full of chinese troop that there be so much to be done here besides though have tremendous train of baggage with must take day march for infantry to catch must be risky thing for small force of cavalry to go alone a of course have taken considerable body of troop with yes dont think will pursue rex said there must be someone for to treat with if be to take prisoner be pretty certain that directly have gone must repudiate treaty might make on ground that be obtained from by force chinese never hold to treaty must afford so excellent excuse for breaking one that agreement must hardly be worth paper be written on well will come back about ten oclock then before give detail of what have seen will expect to give full account of have taken place here since went away rex now went to hospital again nurse went to inform girl of arrival almost immediately came flying out be glad to see again rex jenny said have be in dreadful anxiety about when went away have idea that must be so dreadfully long before came back did not think must be said have certainly not be fault did not get back sooner can assure have be quite a anxious about a can have be about be so dreadfully disappointed yesterday when troop came in to find that be not with asked good many officer only one knew anything about said that be with japanese yes be so must have be very difficult for to get leave to come with own people japanese be glad of extra interpreter now how have be time have be very well on whole of course be thinner for recently ration have have to be reduced very much have have meat for past fortnight not great deal of anything else at same time have be kept very busy for number of wounded have be large be very glad to be fully employed for be much better to be working here than to have nothing to do make bag to hold earth sand can quite understand that student be telling that be terribly tedious when have nothing to do certainly be called out to aid guard at barrier when be heavily attacked often two three day passed without being summoned how be uncle aunt rex asked jenny be well have be besieged just a be here there be very hard fighting settlement indeed be very much knocked about fortunately in spite of severe shelling hardly life be lost can come out with now for hour said jenny then can tell about what prevented army from coming up to help girl put on hat three sallied forth a walked about rex gave graphic account of fighting at tientsin have ah lo come up with rex certainly have must a soon have thought of coming without hat a without be splendid fellow have got so accustomed to company really dont know what must do without be time for to go back jenny said at last will be off duty afternoon at three to morrow next day will leave hospital for most of wounded be convalescent unless there be tough fighting hospital will empty fast especially now that can get fresh fruit meat other thing for patient rex returned to room occupied by student there found sandwich waiting for be feeling like fish out of water bateman friend said after being in readiness for past two month to snatch up rifle at moment run out to repel attack seems strange indeed that can ramble about without fixed duty that military work be over now then will give account of what have happened here since left have kept journal ever since siege began so that can tell how everything be done in right order nothing came of letter sent in by prince ching be soon evident that war party be supreme again fighting went on a usual one prisoner who be taken day after left said that empress have issued edict explaining that firing of large gun be dangerous practice liable to do much mischief therefore ordered troop to confine to use of rifle only there can be doubt that curious edict be issued be supposed to have be result of representation by inhabitant of damage inflicted by gun fire doubt be very extensive for fire be always high shot flew over legation must have fallen in city inflicted damage there at rate there be much le firing afterwards although shell did not inflict very great damage here be relief to be free of gun however be being worked against defender of fu distant only about fifty yard continued to do great damage one night attack of chinese be so fierce that italian guard posted between british japanese retired have chinese taken advantage of movement jap must have be cut off fu altogether lost next day attack be renewed with great vigour on defender of fu on french legation at latter place two explosion took place enemy having driven mine under french be forced to retire from main building held entrenchment that have prepared behind at same time chinese made desperate attempt to force way into german legation did actually break into club set on fire be driven back at point of bayonet fire however spread there be great danger that defence must be forced alarm bell be rung here gate be shut everyone stood at post attack be maintained with fury till eight in evening then gradually ceased when enemy retired left french german still holding remains of legation night french legation continued to burn cooly in fu worked unceasingly to extinguish flame next day letter be received from ching urging that european must leave legation go to yamen proposition be so absurd that refusal of course in polite term be sent a even have european be inclined to trust to mercy of chinese must have be obliged to abandon native christian under protection on sixteenth communication arrived from ching night passed quietly in morning two chinese presented at german legation said have come to enquire what meant to do to ask if foreign chinese secretary must go out to discus matter with general explained that order have come to cease firing on legation bugler said that general nieh have be defeated between taku tientsin have committed suicide answer be sent that did not propose to fire without cause that must not allow chinese to continue to build barricade a have be doing ever since first message from prince ching reached while letter be being exchanged chinese soldier kept coming up to barricade unarmed professing friendship french volunteer be foolish enough to get over barricade go out have better luck than deserved for be taken to jung lu head quarter where be well treated be closely questioned a to state of thing in legation said in reply that be having first rate time enjoying greatly wanted nothing fresh fruit chinese thereupon gave melon peach sent back now think must stop for ten minute wet whistle have not have a much experience a in relating adventure find continuous talking somewhat trying chapter xvii story of siege after short rest sandwich continued story day chinese kept coming up to barricade many of got upon roof of house near called out to professing friendship be obliged to put up sign board warning in chinese against approaching too near to outpost evidently soldier believed that there be end to fighting for of actually sold rifle ammunition to japanese at fifteen dollar apiece letter again passed between chinese mr conger be allowed to send out message in cypher said that have be besieged over month that unless strong measure be taken at once be in danger of being massacred well that message really did get through rex said be first positive information be received in tientsin that legation still held out so convinced be military authority that legation have fallen that there be talk of sending relief party be proposed to wait till army forty thousand fifty thousand strong be collected however receipt of conger message made great stir a told gaselee chaffee said that english american must go on whether others did not with result thing be really pushed on in earnest from moment general have idea of stuff be made of said sandwich however to continue story chinese now requested that foreign troop must stop hostility abandon tartar wall to sir claude macdonald replied by recital of event of past month said that must not retire from wall a chinese have repeatedly used a vantage ground from to attack repeated assurance that chinese must not be fired upon unless first attacked added request that vendor of fruit ice must be granted leave to sell ware to have still very great doubt a to whether state of thing must continue next morning there be general expectation that fighting must again begin chinese soldier however fearlessly approached barricade showing absolute confidence that must observe truce one of wounded soldier actually came in have wound dressed by foreign doctor during day secretary arrived from yamen to interview minister be received outside gate said that government wished to protect foreigner that german minister body have be recovered from hand of people who have murdered enclosed in valuable coffin on day chinaman who have be sent into city returned with news that general nieh be dead on july th foreign troop took native city at tientsin news be duly posted doubt be felt that armistice be result of capture of tientsin completely explained matter have evidently be regarded a certain that chinese troop at tientsin must be able to hold city against attack prevent foreign troop from moving up towards pekin must have be frightful blow to to learn that place considered impregnable have be captured after one day fighting must have be awful facer for prince tung war party ching moderate have evidently again come to front armistice continued few chinese came in day with egg to sell generally brought hidden in clothes declaring that people have be beheaded for dealing with a however continued to come be considered only a device for raising price egg be great boon to besieged for many of child suffered greatly from want of proper nourishment twice yamen sent in present of fruit vegetable be immense treat be divided with scrupulous fairness time two melon fell to share be eaten with solemn almost religious state be something like what have heard take place when party of connoisseur assemble to discus two three bottle of imperial tokay of famous year while curious interlude lasted occasional shot be fired at several men be wounded chinese moreover though apparently so friendly continued to strengthen enlarge barricade be unsafe to move across open space in defended quarter now that anxiety on own account have lessened have time to think of defender of french cathedral be evident that armistice that be enjoying be not shared by for from time to time must hear outburst of distant firing french minister have endeavoured in vain to communicate with countryman beyond fact that still held out knew nothing meanwhile letter be constantly received from yamen urging to leave city to retire to tientsin at least to give up christian refugee to request answer be returned in language of greatest moderation explaining difficulty of course pointing out that attack on french cathedral continued that shot be frequently fired on legation never positively refusing to do a chinese wished always making excuse for not doing so method be in so far successful that negotiation be kept up until allied army be within day march of city on july yamen tried to induce minister to send chinese convert out of legation pekin said be perfectly peaceful a so large number of convert crowded into so small space in hot weather must be causing considerable inconvenience advised that must now return to home in peace resume usual occupation a cooly however have rendered invaluable service during siege exposing frequently to danger labouring with unwavering zeal until evidently exhausted be of course out of question that must be abandoned chief replied that a shot be still fired into legation north cathedral be still being attacked must not understand assertion of yamen that must be safe for christian to leave legation asked for further information time passed very slowly with colonel shiba have bribed one of imperial guard supplied daily with news afterwards turned out to be pack of lie on july th reported that allied troop have reached yang tsun on eighteenth that on twenty fourth have fought battle ten mile south of tsai tsun in boxer be defeated on twenty fifth force be at ho hsi wu have fought battle lasting five hour chinese losing in killed wounded twelve hundred men report on twenty seventh confirmed that news said that there be panic at tung chow of course caused lot of excitement on twenty eighth rumour spread through legation that messenger have arrived with letter from british consul at tientsin of course everyone went to bell tower to hear content of letter said that twenty four thousand troop have landed that there be nineteen thousand at tientsin that boxer power have exploded there that there be plenty of troop on way if must keep in food never saw such mad crowd a be assembled on tower here be expecting to be relieved in two three day now one must say when relief must arrive abuse poured on british consul be absolutely unbounded afterwards learned that have reason to be grateful rather than reverse have told truth that officer at tientsin be at moment actually discussing whether be possible to make advance until rainy season be over have sent news there be saying what must have happened disappointment must have be so great that must probably have attempted desperate action with result that european must have be massacred also christian chinese to whom handful of fighting men available must have be absolutely unable to afford protection fortunately however did not know spent indignation upon unfortunate consul who hope be none worse for objurgation heaped upon head though disappointment be great news woke up order be at once issued for household to send in list of store in possession of tea sugar white rice other luxury up to time a know only rice flour meat have be supplied from general store household having used what have collected at beginning of siege on same day chinese government issued edict condemning two of progressive member of yamen to death there be fighting also chinese persisting in erecting barricade across north bridge enabled to enfilade canal did not succeed in preventing from doing sort of rumour came in what meant one must tell of report be of wildest nature only certain news got be that portion of regular army have left to aid in repulsing relief column effort be made by chinese to get sir robert hart to telegraph to reassure foreign minister a to situation in pekin refused to do a such reassuring news might induce to pause before sending out relief force on st of august colonel shiba received letter from tientsin changed whole aspect of affair be dated tientsin said that advance of troop be delayed by difficulty of transport that start must be made in two three day during time have not be idle have strengthened wall round legation have dug deep trench inside west wall to cut mine that chinese might attempt to drive from quarter omitted one spot howeverthe kitchen of student messand be precisely at spot that chinese afterwards drove mine one of custom staff declared that heard men digging in quarter one believed defensive measure be occupying barricading of ruin of house on legation side of market mail came in with several letter on nd of august report be contradictory really seemed that column be at last starting supply have be stopped now be beginning to feel famine especially christian chinese who be fed on mixture of little grain chopped straw other fodder be very bad time except building of new defence there be nothing to be done good deal of sharp shooting be kept up want of work made delay hard to bear nurse be now suffering from sickness brought on from overwork at five oclock on august th messenger arrived bearing letter from general gaselee to sir claude from general fukushima for colonel shiba letter be very brief be dated august strong force of ally be advancing one said twice defeated enemy keep up spirit other confirmed news mentioned thirteenth fourteenth a probable date of arrival at pekin may imagine enthusiasm that news excited be first intimation have received that column have left tientsin attack now became much more vigorous on eleventh attack on french german legation be more severe than anything have experienced attack on mongol market be also very warm time be going on chinese government be writing letter complaining of attack made upon by defender towards evening firing became even more furious there be general call to arm man turned out fusillade died away little at midnight at half past two boom of heavy gun rattle of musketry be heard man woman in legation got up to hear welcome sound told that relief force have arrived outside city enemy then made last desperate attack everyone rushed to post again although firing be tremendous must hear chinese officer shouting to men to charge nothing came of towards morning fire died away to usual desultory sniping everyone remained in state of expectancy until a know at two oclock troop made entry there think bateman have given very full account will expect a detailed one from certainly deserve rex said with laugh then told in full detail story of entry into tientsin situation there account have received of taking of taku fort defence of city capture of tientsin march of relief column there said when concluded think have pretty good idea of what have taken place since last met now must go out see for point where fighting have be fiercest wandering about rex learned more of fighting of past two day fire kept up be something tremendous chinese troop must not be persuaded to leave shelter officer in vain shouted be many be mere handful come on soldier shouted back in return no good word must be plainly heard for barricade held by custom volunteer in mongol market be only ten fifteen yard from chinese in fu same thing be going on position held by italian jap be of only twenty yard extreme outpost held by custom volunteer be ten yard from chinese barricade in fu have hit on happy expedient got huge supply of empty petroleum tin when chinese attack be at hottest set christian chinese to hammer on with stick din be something tremendous italian added to with wild shout astounded at terrible uproar ignorant of what new weapon of destruction be being brought against chinese fire dropped at once did not reopen for time in mongol market five custom volunteer stood behind loophole close up to chinese position a watched chinese officer trying in vain to urge men forward chaffed with invitation to come in see place then when did not come advised to go home nurse baby nevertheless fighting with enemy in fu in mongol market be matter of grim earnest if barricade there have be carried position must also have be abandoned communication between british russian legation must have be cut off morning after troop entered two mine heavily charged be fired if troop have be one day later there be saying what consequence might have be with whom rex have chatted be of opinion that chinese be deterred from attacking not by rifle fire by superstitious fear that be keeping secret mean of destruction in reserve whether be that have mined ground everywhere must blow into air a soon a crossed barricade whether feared unknown even more terrible form of death must not be said men who be ready to endure deadly fire of rifle must not be got to make rush against position where only fifteen twenty men faced chinese kept up straggling fire day among others one english lady be hit in arm being first time that woman have be struck since siege began rex learned that out of total strength of nineteen officer three hundred eighty eight men including volunteer thirteen officer be killed wounded sixty seven men killed hundred sixty seven wounded fighting still went on great surprise be expressed that french did not make attempt to go to relief of countryman in north cathedral in evening rex went into fu where japanese be for most part quartered enquired of general fukushima if there be anything that must do think there be anything at present when once get out into city will be very glad of service again can if like go with force be sending out in morning to relieve french missionary know must be in extreme danger must be scandal if allowed to be massacred after have entered city accordingly next morning rex started with japanese made long detour approached cathedral from other side attacked drove off chinese on side really raised siege at same time heard heavy firing on other side found that french russian have arrived there fukushima therefore halted men being willing to give french opportunity of being first to relieve countryman garrison have have indeed terrible time in spite of entry of allied force attack have be maintained up to very moment of relief japanese have met with resistance on coming through gate separated cathedral quarter from palace of empress here came upon number of boxer who be so occupied by attack upon cathedral that have scarcely noticed arrival of relieving force taken by surprise good many of be hemmed in machine gun be trained upon with terrible effect fighting be kept up through various street continued until reached cathedral garrison at first refused to admit unknown band of swarthy warrior explanation have to be exchanged before must be brought to understand that have be relieved catholic must never have remained in possession of cathedral have not chinese municipal officer assured that must be altogether undisturbed when boxer first appeared near cathedral governor asserted that have special order to protect cathedral regular troop there consisted only of thirty french twelve italian marine who at last moment when danger of situation must no longer be winked at have be spared from slender garrison of legation to aid in defence be force be called upon to defend circuit of wall of great french establishment whose circumference amounted to nearly mile within circle there be fewer than three thousand five hundred people larger portion of whom consisted of child from orphanage adult be formed by father into body armed with spear made by fastening knife to end of long pole eight musket be firearm have be distributed among different section chinese authority threw off mask on th of june on day chinese regular boxer surrounded place cut telegraph wire completely isolated at head of defence be mgr favier heroic bishop who by courage self devotion zeal kept up spirit of defender through darkest day of siege be soul of resistance under be six priest who organized work of defence set noble example to others convert be set to work with pick spade to assist in defence whole defensible area be quickly surrounded with trench barricade ammunition be unfortunately very short priest set of convert to manufacture powder bullet shot be not difficult to make a lead pewter must be obtained from roof vessel sulphur charcoal be very scarce after many failure however thousand of round be manufactured must have be of use for distant fighting be sufficient for what at time be almost hand to hand work boxer burnt house in neighbourhood threw inflammable pot into convent upon roof of cathedral maintained continuous fire of musketry artillery fortunately fire be principally directed against cathedral though building be sorely battered little harm be done to defender continual message be shouted to convert calling upon to come out one note be thrown into trench on arrow ran a follows christian shut up in peitang reduced to die in misery eating leaf of tree why do so obstinately resist have cannon mine can blow up in time be deceived by devil of europe return to ancient religion of fu hand over mgr favier rest life will be saved will supply with food if do woman child will be cut to piece although attempt continued throughout siege not one of convert evinced slightest desire to give in worst form of attack be that of mining enemy successfully exploded one huge mine blowing up several building killing fewer than eighty child injuring still greater number four ton of gunpowder be said to have be used result be huge round hole like crater of small volcano measuring in diameter from bank to bank fully ninety foot even did not shake courage of defender warned of what have to expect available hand be at once set to work digging very deep trench to prevent chinese from mining under building in spite of effort however four mine be exploded inside compound must have be almost a formidable a first be prevented from doing damage that must otherwise have done by one of other trench though over seventy people be injured by explosion several other mine besides exploded be met by countermine driven by besieged one mine however have escaped observation be driven under foundation of cathedral have relief be delayed day two longer must have be fired must probably have caused death of vast number of people for building be throughout siege used a hospital towards end of siege garrison be greatly annoyed by rocket be fired by ingenious gun directed by chinese rendered passage across enclosure dangerous set fire to many building once brilliant sortie be organized carried out by handful of marine number of spear armed convert succeeded in capturing field piece ammunition latter being invaluable during siege greatest enemy with whom garrison have to contend be hunger gradually ration of rice served out to convert be reduced at end although two ounce of rice be must be allowed to chinese convert even must have failed in course of two three day miserable ration be eked out in way green thing blade of grass be pulled up cooked eaten last few starving animal before be killed have stripped bark off tree a high a must reach little party of marine have lost heavily captain have be killed early in siege lieutenant fell on th of july be twenty three cheerfulness devotion have done much to maintain spirit of besieged have worked night day death caused deepest regret among garrison eleven of soldier be also killed most of others be wounded mgr favier wrote wept once during siege be on day so terrible be pinch of hunger that half wild dog fell upon dead boxer lying round entrenchment be killed eaten suffering be so great that one have to go back to siege of leyden for parallel defender when relief arrived be almost skeleton living spectre scarce able to drag along rescuer on viewing shattered defence numerous pit made by exploded mine worn pallid form of defender be astonished that have be able to hold out so long against horde of well armed determined assailant gallant a be defence of legation there must be doubt that be a nothing compared with of cathedral a thing began to settle down little pressure in legation be relaxed chinese convert in fu in british legation moved out established in deserted house near supply began to come in especially to british legation where native quickly learned that must be fairly treated japanese be also well supplied native must enter russian quarter attempt of russia to pose now a friend of china be wholly fruitless putting aside atrocity russian have committed there native have become well aware of horrible massacre have perpetrated in manchuria occupation of province have excited so deep feeling of animosity that even have behaviour be good at pekin must still have be regarded with greatest mistrust chapter xviii conclusion fighting went on for day at last opposition ceased chinese soldier left city altogether changing clothes appeared a peaceable citizen rex went round town be horrified at destruction everywhere met eye portion of town held by russian be infinitely worst there looting have be universal atrocity committed upon unfortunate inhabitant beyond description in part of city rex scarcely saw native in street in german quarter thing be little better in french quite a bad in portion of city occupied by british american many native be moving about in many of street fruit other thing be exposed for sale on stall in japanese quarter be order regularity looting have be prohibited from first stringent order given for good treatment of inhabitant have such good effect that shop be already opening stall lined street indeed greater portion of inhabitant from other quarter have migrated to part where alone found must be safe from pillage outrage be humiliating sight for englishman that swarthy little soldier whom european regarded almost a barbarian must be so infinitely in advance of western troop in discipline order good conduct american on day following relief of legation fought way to entrance of forbidden city there halted a agreement have be made that none must enter palace ground until formal entrance be made by whole force jealousy bickering of various general have broken out afresh now that purpose be achieved russian who have from first signalized by brutal treatment of native be now posing a friend be already advocating retirement french owing perhaps to supposed alliance with russian though from beginning have be conspicuous for doing nothing followed lead in a in thing italian be inclined in same direction japanese british american be wholly against movement of retirement until term have be definitely settled after fortnight consideration decided to march through imperial palace on twenty sixth troop paraded arrangement being ten per cent of nationality must take part in demonstration drew up outside inner gateway russian took up position in centre close to great stone bridge japanese little to left british be to right of russian remainder behind have one band russian one there be also piper belonging to one of indian regiment in there be eight hundred russian eight hundred japanese four hundred british four hundred american two hundred french two hundred german one hundred italian austrian soon after eight oclock salute of twenty one gun be fired by one of field artillery battery then led by russian force marched through central archway of tien mn imperial hall of audience a be called hall of great harmony be magnificent building be here that emperor sat enthroned receiving homage of court on great occasion notably new year day own birthday various other time prescribed by rigid ceremony of court here conferred literary degree distributed robe of honour promotion in rank hall be over two hundred foot long one hundred foot wide same height stood on noble terrace of white stone twenty foot above level of courtyard be reached by five flight of step be flanked terrace surrounded by white marble balustrade step balustrade being excellently carved number of huge bronze urn of very handsome design two great bronze tortoise added to brilliancy of approach externally hall be in fair repair ornamentation under eaves be dirty pillar outside woodwork round wall be sadly needing paint so that in spite of fine approach general aspect be that of shabbiness why must be so under rule of powerful empress with whole resource of empire at command be quite unaccountable one must have expected that everything within wall of palace be centre of empire must have be kept in most perfect order same want of repair be evident in hall of central harmony hall of precious harmony various pavilion in courtyard through troop marched in fact aspect of room hall pavilion be disappointing in extreme waiting room be gloomy everything be covered with dust grass grew thickly in courtyard indeed whole place have aspect of neglect privation in imperial apartment there be superb vas ornament of kind bearing same mark of neglect general feeling among troop be one of disappointment after stay of hour two troop marched out again small article be carried off there be nothing like general looting mandarin who have remained behind in charge have reason to complain of conduct of troop rex accompanied japanese in march a being officially in service like who have formed procession be greatly disappointed be really rotten old place said to girl on turn look a if hadnt be inhabited for hundred year be grimy dusty dark doubt there be sort of good thing in way of vas even be so dirty dull that one must think of looking at if be not in palace certainly did not see anything must have cared to carry off if have be permitted to do so except upon supposition that a be in palace must be valuable have seen much better thing in loot taken in city well be glad to hear say so rex jenny said for doe seem rather hard that woman who have taken part in siege must not have be allowed to go to look at wonder well have lost nothing can assure said rex of thing bought be certainly better worth looking at than anything in palace at least till have be cleaned up bit pekin having be conquered proof of conquest having be given to chinese by march through temple general topic of conversation be what be next to be done empress be be known making way to shansi hundred of mile away agreed that must be impossible to pursue there for even if journey must be accomplished must simply make move so evade capture be considered probable that must make offer to treat doubt considerable time week perhaps even month must pas before must bring to do so be considered certain that sooner later must take such step for credulous a chinese be must be impossible to get to believe that be staying at shansi from choice that pekin be occupied by ally by gracious permission question be what must be end a matter of course huge sum must have to be paid for expense of war on point opinion be unanimous question on there be strong difference of opinion be what else must happen must of power demand slice of chinese territory undertake civilization of huge empire one objection to be that must sooner later lead to general outbreak of hostility between power be probable that mere work of fixing respective frontier must bring matter to crisis at once russia must assuredly demand far greater share than others on condition that france must back must see that country also benefited very largely austria italy must certainly be unable to manage concession of size moreover have so little interest in east that must probably put in claim germany with sudden greed for colonizing must certainly expect large slice on other hand japan great britain america might be expected to oppose step in direction none of have wish to acquire territory a trader desired that door must be kept open that trade must be free to interest therefore be that china must remain intact must be allowed to advance gradually in path of reform war with japan have already given vast impulse to life in many respect short a intervening time have be have accumulated great store of modern weapon have made considerable progress in work of turning peasantry into soldier be probable that second disastrous defeat must show still more vividly necessity for adopting european method must assuredly strengthen enormously hand of progressive party prince ching others of same view must gain power influence obstinate imperious a empress might be fact that have be driven fugitive from capital a result of following advice of war party must not impress strongly although allowed that must be time before china recovered from shock most of in british legation at rate be of opinion that must finally be of immense benefit to argument be sometimes quite heated until calm listener suggested that month might elapse before preliminary of peace be agreed upon be scarcely worth while to get excited over future really one at present must in slightest degree foretell before starting rex have be furnished by father with considerable amount of money there be sure to be great deal of looting mr bateman said a be always case in such circumstance soldier be altogether ignorant of value of thing

treatment of private person forcible entry into house taking of good ally considered that chinese by massacre of thousand of christian of number of missionary together with attack upon settlement have so broken treaty a to put quite out of court must be admitted however that conduct of troop especially of russian german french can not have greatly heightened hatred felt by chinese for foreign devil rex have difficulty in hiring cooly to bring home purchase girl be astonished at mass of valuable brought to little room now occupied be of course ignorant of real worth of thing must not know that silk satin mantle lined with lovely fur must be of considerable value however be going to get down rex asked jenny well intend to buy couple of cart of course will hire cooly to drive when have got

of cart there be buying here will ride out with ah lo to of village round where have doubt will be able to get what want there will of course be infantry escort with convoy will therefore travel at

intending to do plundering on own account to fall in again a force return village be two hundred yard from suddenly heard loud piercing scream coming from direction come on ah lo villain be up to rascality of villager have fallen into hand setting horse to gallop dashed into village scream be coming from house of somewhat superior appearance leaping from horse ran in discovered four five woman struggling wildly against russian leave woman alone scoundrel rex shouted with savage oath russian turned round seeing that be civilian with native who accosted caught up musket rex have not time to unsling rifle drew revolver a one of russian raised musket to shoulder fired ball struck man in forehead fell back one of others fired at once a did not raise musket to shoulder aim be not true shot

fired again a opponent rushed at be snap shot bullet went through one of russian wrist caused thrust to swerve bayonet ripped open rex clothes inflicting slight wound along chest a passed force of blow however threw rex upon back russian standing over raised musket to strike a looked down rex again fired bullet struck man between eye fell lifeless mass completely knocking breath out of rex body needed lad strength to roll body off to gain foot combat between ah lo russian have just terminated latter be big powerful man be match for chinaman who having gripped adversary by throat held on until have choked life out of to make sure however at once picked up rifle put ball into man head perhaps be dead master perhaps not good leave to get round again woman a soon a russian have released have fled upstairs rex called out to in chinese to come down be not until have called three four time one timidly descended seeing four russian lying dead fell on knee poured out thanks others perceiving that be well at once came down look here rex said dont want thanks have only done duty a man now must at once hide body somewhere there be ruined house next door will carry body there at once topple one of mud wall over then must come back here clean up floor afterwards take refuge in place where be hiding when column came along be hardly likely that will miss fellow if do will be sure to search village pas through on way back quarter of hour work sufficed to obliterate trace of conflict rex ah lo rode off amid blessing of woman have rescued be lucky for poor creature that came along ah lo cant say feel slightest regret at having to kill russian scoundrel be very bad men russian ah lo said rob everyone do very bad thing wherever go well need not say ah lo that must keep affair strict secret if be discovered there must be frightful row over think before go farther will dismount bayonet have certainly cut gash across chest have be too busy to think about feel now that be bleeding wound be in way serious be bandaged up resumed ride after going for two three mile farther came upon village where of cultivator still remained be well pleased to sell three cart six mule cart be primitive vehicle consisting of pair of great wooden wheel pair of shaft long framework on be what resembled great box must either be used for conveyance of two passenger filled with good in former case jolting over rough road be so unbearable indeed dangerous that side roof have to be padded with thick mattress framework projected beyond body of cart good must be lashed there when box be used a carriage rex decided that mattress must be placed here for girl to sit on because must be infinitely more comfortable than being boxed up because interior must be filled with purchase after bargaining succeeded in persuading three of villager to go with cart promising in addition to pay gift of conveyance mule on arrival at girl went into scream of laughter when arrived late in afternoon with conveyance three week have elapsed since relief have done wonder for be now full of fun life dont mean to pack away in big box without window opening of sort certainly rex said will put mattress on projection behind will ride there quite comfortably to morrow morning will buy thick cloth canvas can sew together make little tent will only require to be high enough to allow to crawl into wide enough to enable to ride side by side next morning rex purchase be packed in three cart be done with great care when be finished have nothing more to attend to have practically personal baggage for girl have only clothes stood in change most of have made for on arrival at pekin in interval before starting therefore went round bidding good bye to friend have made during siege what be going to do rex asked friend sandwich have not least idea dont suppose anyone else have can hardly expect to begin work again until everything be settled in short time however suppose will get so accustomed to sort of thing that will really prefer being at work again to doing nothing possibly may move college down to tientsin even to shanghai must think must be better to keep here may feel pretty certain of one thing when peace be once established guard for legation will be much stronger than before in case dont see why college must not remain here of course will be rather hard at first to settle down to grinding away at language after excitement of past three month if a result of negotiation more port be thrown open must be good thing for for of course more official will be required a one of senior must be pretty sure to get berth whereas might have to wait for two three year in ordinary course of thing well if do come down to tientsin for run expect that will find there sandwich in case must make place home of course have idea of what father will do be quite on card that may decide to go home for bit business will certainly be at stand still for long time may take advantage of lull to run home for year two whether will stay at tientsin not be of course equally uncertain row have so completely turned everything topsy turvy have idea what will come of in evening rex called upon minister to tell that be going down with convoy be quite right to do so mr bateman there be chance of further fighting here will naturally wish to be with family at tientsin if will sit down for few minute will write sort of testimonial saying how valuable have be service here dont say that testimonial will be of value to a merchant still may be of use in case will be something to be proud of record of doings during trouble sir claude went into inner room dictated letter to secretary on return handed document to rex who thanked very heartily saying that be testimonial that must be proud of to end of life at early hour next morning convoy of wounded sick woman child left pekin girl be seated on mattress behind first of three cart rex have bought two great umbrella shaded from sun ray have with basket containing fruit meat bread swinging under body of cart be hamper containing charcoal tea pot plate cup saucer tea slung beside be little tent that girl made with stick for support to girl journey be most enjoyable there be practically fear of trouble for after capture of pekin strong party have be sent down have dispersed boxer along line of railway still there be risk that might fall in with isolated band to add interest to march at time got down walked joining one other of friend have made during siege of evening made tea generally have little party a friend in turn looked in upon still be not sorry when on fifth day after starting tientsin came in sight arrival excited liveliest pleasure on part of mr mr bateman aunt cried good deal over two girl whom at one time believed must never see again after first excitement be over while girl be giving aunt lively account of adventure rex father discussed question of business mother have be talking matter over mr bateman said be absolutely certain that many month at rate must pas before there be revival of trade have come to conclusion that must be useless for to remain here must leave thompson two clerk to keep place open look after thing until uncle agree that business can be started again will of course take girl with really dont see that there will be use in remaining have gone through very exciting time rest will do good what do say be ready to do think best father dont feel worse for three month excitement think must certainly be slow here if be gone suppose will come out again when thing begin again certainly will dont think mother will of course that will chat over with uncle own idea be that will come out with for couple of year by time ought to know enough of business to take charge of especially a thompson be fairly well up in a have said be matter for after consideration feel have certainly earned rest having be out here ten year without break a for will certainly be dreary place for at least year for will be two three year before entirely recovers from blow will not be without something to do in england because will go into uncle office will learn good deal of detail of business price of good so on well in case father certainly think must much rather go home with if must be of use here must willingly stop there can be return of trade until treaty have be made troop have left country will be at least year perhaps good deal more very well then be settled just at present there be plenty of steamer going down to shanghai see reason why must not be off in week for many reason think sooner leave better girl have gone through terrible time for past three four month although look better than must have be expected must have be terribly shaken quiet long sea voyage will hope set up again shattered a settlement be good may still be obtained have doubt that can get everything requisite for voyage in course of week accordingly ten day later mr mr bateman with niece
