against one can scarce doubt that if chooses have power to do a much good for a in past time have done evil 't be certain that coming here show be in earnest for presence be sure sooner later to come to ear of usurper will cause to fall into deepest disgrace yet seemed queen said that by marrying daughter to clarence have bound more firmly than ever to side of york ay madam knight said clarence be said to be alike unprincipled ambitious may well be that warwick intended to set up against edward have not done so such alliance must not necessarily strengthen position at court methinks supposition be true one sir thomas queen said edward care not sufficiently for brother to bestow much favour upon father of prince wife thus must gain little by marriage unless be to place clarence on throne then must again become real ruler of england a be until edward married elizabeth woodville house of river rose to first place in royal favour eclipsed star of warwick be wonder proud earl chafe under ingratitude of man who owes throne to that be ready to dare everything so that can prove to that be not to be slighted with impunity why come to when have clarence a puppet may have convinced madam clarence be even le to be trusted than edward may perceive few of yorkists must follow be to declare against usurper while assuredly adherent must stand aloof altogether from such struggle powerful a be warwick must not alone withstand united force of noble pledged to support of house of york thence a take doe happen that have resolved to throw in lot with lancaster if majesty will forgive evil have done house accept a ally doubt will have term to make condition to lay down may make what condition chooses queen margaret said passionately so that doe aid to take vengeance on false traitor to place husband again on throne to obtain for son rightful heritage a spoke trumpet sounded in courtyard below have come exclaimed once again after year of misery humiliation can hope have best retire madam sir thomas tresham said will speak more freely to majesty if there be witness come gervaise be time that practised exercise sir thomas with wife child quitted room leaving queen margaret with

past countless injury have inflicted on house execution of father so many of friend have laid aside grievance stand united by hate for edward there be one condition accepted gladly namely that son must marry daughter anne will be bond between by report anne be charming young lady edward have gladly agreed to match must make alliance even with proudest princess in europe must so aid so strengthen throne god grant that hope may be fulfilled knight said earnestly that peace may be given to distracted country usurper have rendered unpopular by extravagance by exaction of tax collector believe that england will gladly welcome return of lawful king to power when doe warwick propose to begin will at once get fleet together louis who have privately brought about meeting will of course throw impediment in way on other hand duke of burgundy will do in power to thwart enterprise will a soon a learns of warn edward feel new life in eleanor after fretting powerless for year seem to be different woman now that there be prospect of action be rejoiced at thought at last will be able to reward who have ventured suffered so much in cause of lancaster hope be madam that enterprise will be final one once successful dear land will be no longer deluged with blood never again will be forced to draw sword against countryman 't be good pious wish sir thomas heartily do join in married life have be one long round of trouble none more than have cause to wish for peace there be more hope for madam that war have greatly diminished number of powerful baron be who be author of struggle rivalry ambition be ruin of england save for retainer there must be army to place in field mass of people stand aloof altogether desiring only to live in peace quiet 't be same here in france 't be powerful vassal of king be ever causing trouble 't be so indeed sir thomas without feudal lord how must king place army in field when dominion be threatened by powerful neighbour then must be people business to fight madam doubt not that must do so in defence of hearth home besides neighbour must no longer have power of invasion be also without great vassal great baron stand between king subject monarch must be king indeed be able to rule without constant dictation undisturbed by rivalry ambition must be good time indeed sir thomas queen said with smile methinks there be little chance of coming about for at present seems to that vassal be better able to make unmake king than king be able to deprive great vassal of power never since norman william set foot in england be more powerful than be at present what doe chance of recovering throne rest upon not upon right on quarrel between warwick house of river be puppet that great lord play against other did depend upon will must be a say must crush at blow then only must feel really queen be dream can never be carried out not in time madam perhaps may come sooner than expect long war have destroyed many great family weakened others may greatly hasten arrival presume until warwick be ready to move naught will be done majesty be not settled yet warwick spoke somewhat of causing rising in north before set sail so that portion at least of edward power may be up there when make landing must be prudent step madam if can gain possession of london matter must be half finished citizen be ever ready to take side with whom regard a likely to win just a shout at present 'long live king edward ' so must shout 'long live king henry ' did enter town may perhaps change thought that have entertained sir thomas of making son knight of st john have not thought matter over madam if there be quiet in land must be not for vow be well content that must settle down in peace at old hall if see that there be still trouble bloodshed ahead must in case far rather that must enter order spend life in fighting infidel than in strife with englishman good friend grand prior of order in england have promised that will take a page at rate in house of st john will pas youth in security whatsoever fate may befall child already bid fair to do honour to name to become worthy member of order be fond of study under daily tuition be making good progress in use of weapon be prince said speaking for first time be yesterday in great hall downstairs stood up with blunted sword against young victor de paulliac who be nigh three year senior be amusing to see how little knave fought against other by faith gervaise held own staunchly in spite of victor superior height weight if join order sir thomas warrant will cleave many infidel skull will do honour to langue of england hope so prince knight said gravely moslem ever gain in power may well be that knight of st john will be hardly pressed to hold own if boy join will be wish that will a early a possible repair to rhodes wish to become one of drone who live in sloth at commandery in england take part in noble struggle of order with moslem host who have captured constantinople now threaten europe be childless year after marriage eleanor vowed that be son born to must join order of white cross dedicate life to defence of christian europe against infidel prayer for son be granted gervaise will enter order a soon a age will permit be why rejoice at grand prior offer to take a page for will dwell in hospital safely until old enough to take first step towards becoming knight of order must have be born son of baron like prince said earnestly that be free to choose own career assuredly in case too must have joined noble order have spent life in fighting in so grand cause free from quarrel dispute enmity rend england even must day gain throne surely lot be not to be envied yet a have be born to rank must try for trust to do so worthily bravely who can say what end will be warwick have ever be foe though royal mother may use in order to free father place on throne must know well enough that us for own end alone that will ever stand beside throne be real ruler of england for time edward queen broke in have shown that can wait now seems that great hope be likely to be fulfilled after that rest will be easy there be other noble well nigh a powerful a who look with jealousy upon way in lord be assured that will look with still le friendly eye upon when stand a say beside throne once father be again seated there can afford to bide time assuredly will not be long before party be formed against warwick until then must bear everything interest be same if be content to remain prop to throne not to eclipse memory of past will not stand between will regard a weapon have beaten down house of york restored to own will give confidence friendship if on other hand assumes too much try to lord over will seek other support gather party even will be unable successfully to withstand must have thought edward that must be even more glad than that long time of weary waiting for action be over once again banner of lancaster will be spread to wind will be that mother rather must meet death in field than live cooped up here pensioner of france own must feel more joy at prospect if people of england have declared in favour instead of being warwick whom have always taught to fear hate who thus come to offer to place father again on throne whose goodwill towards be simply result of pique displeasure because be no longer first in favour of edward doe not seem to that throne won by aid of traitor can be stable one be foolish boy queen said angrily do not see that by marrying warwick daughter will attach firmly to marriage count for much mother of warwick daughter married clarence edward brother yet purpose to dethrone edward queen gave angry gesture said have permission to retire edward be in mood to listen to augury of evil at present moment prince hesitated for moment a if about to speak with effort controlled bowing deeply to mother left room edward be in perverse humour queen said in tone of much vexation to sir thomas tresham when gervaise have left room however know will bear well when hour of trial come that can warrant will madam have noble character frank fearless yet thoughtful beyond year will make believe noble king may well gather round party in state majesty must make excuse for humour young people be strong in like dislike have never heard speak aught ill of warwick know how much harm earl have done to house question of expediency doe not weigh with young a with elder while see how great be benefit will accrue from alliance with warwick be ready to lay aside hatred of year to forget wrong have suffered young prince be unable so quickly to forget enmity against earl that have learnt from be right sir thomas can not blame edward that be unable a be to forget past what step must advise must take will remain passive here will do what can to rouse partisan in england must say latter madam of course will not do to trust to letter for be one of to fall into wrong hand might cause ruin of warwick expedition must say that cautious message sent by word of mouth to of old adherent must be of great use will if majesty chooses to entrust with mission undertake to carry out must take ship land in west must travel in guise of simple country gentleman call upon adherent in western county must be needful first to make out list of noble who have shown devoted to cause must bid hold retainer in readiness to take field suddenly must say word of warwick merely hint that will not land alone with powerful array that chance be in favour must be dangerous mission sir thomas not greatly so madam own estate lie in sussex there must be little chance of recognition save by own adherent who may have seen among leader of troop in battle even be improbable at present edward deems so securely seated on throne that men can travel hither through country without being questioned lancastrian live quietly with yorkists unless be so unfortunate a to meet yorkist noble who knew be banished man one who have honour of being in majesty confidence think that danger must possibly arise what say wife can not think that there be danger lady tresham said even so must not say word to hinder from doing service to cause know of one else who must perform mission have left side to go into battle before now can not think that danger of such expedition can be a great a must undergo in field therefore dear lord must say word now to stay spoke bravely unfalteringly face have paled when sir thomas first made proposal colour have not yet come back to cheek bravely spoken dame queen said warmly well sir thomas accept offer trust that will not be long separated from wife son who will of course journey with when go to england where doubtless will be able to rejoin few day after land now let talk over nobleman gentleman in west upon whom can rely if not to join banner a soon a be spread at least to say word will betray two day later sir thomas started on journey while queen remained at amboise eagerly awaiting news that warwick have collected fleet be ready to set sail up to point duke of clarence have sided with warwick against brother have passed over with to france believing doubt that if earl must succeed in dethroning edward intended to place son in law upon throne be rudely awakened from delusion by charles of burgundy who being in open rebellion against suzerain king of france kept intimately acquainted with be going on despatched female emissary to clarence to inform of league warwick have made with lancastrian intended marriage between daughter anne young prince imploring to be reconciled with brother to break off alliance with earl who be on point of waging war against house of york clarence took advice went over to england where made peace with more easily because king who be entirely given up to pleasure treated with contempt warning duke of burgundy sent of intended invasion by warwick yet moment serious reflection must have shown that position be precarious crushing exaction of tax gatherer in order to provide mean for edward lavish expenditure have already caused very serious insurrection in various part of country unpopularity be deep general in one of rising royal troop have suffered crushing defeat earl river father sir john woodville one of brother of queen have with earl of devon be captured by rebel three have be beheaded throne have only be saved by intervention of warwick thus then edward have reason for fearing result must earl appear in arm against took however measure to prepare for coming storm although duke of burgundy despatched fleet to blockade harfleur where warwick be fitting out expedition actually sent name of port at earl intended to land if fleet managed to escape from harfleur edward continued carelessly to spend time in pleasure dissipation bestowing full confidence upon archbishop of york marquis of montague brother of earl of warwick element favoured enemy for early in september duke of burgundy fleet off harfleur be dispersed by storm warwick a soon a gale abated set sail on th landed on devonshire coast force be considerable one for french king have furnished with money men on effecting landing found army assembled to oppose few hour after disembarkation be joined by sir thomas tresham who gave good news that whole of west be ready to rise that in few day great landowner must join with retainer turned out to be case warwick with great array marched eastward kent have already risen london declared for king henry warwick therefore instead of marching thither moved towards lincolnshire where edward be with army having gone north to repress insurrection have broken out there at instigation of warwick lord montague now threw off mask declared for king henry most of soldier followed edward finding hopeless to oppose warwick force be now within short march of took ship with few friend who remained faithful sailed for holland warwick returned to london where took king henry from dungeon in tower into have five year before thrown proclaimed king on day that took place dame tresham arrived in london with son queen have found that must not for present cross a be waiting for large french force be to accompany a be uncertain how long delay might last counselled friend to join husband revolution have be accomplished without loss of single life with exception of of earl of worcester who be hated for cruelty by people edward principal friend took refuge in various religious house queen three daughter mother fled to sanctuary at westminster be left unmolested be step taken against other adherent of house of york warwick be now virtually king of england king whose intellect have always be weak be now almost imbecile margaret of anjou be still detained in france sir thomas tresham went down to estate in kent there lived quietly for month duke of clarence have joined warwick a soon a saw that brother cause be lost a duke have knowledge of changed feeling towards be heartily welcomed act of settlement be passed by parliament entailing crown on henry son edward prince of wale in case of prince death without issue on duke of clarence on th of march following edward suddenly appeared with fleet with have be secretly supplied by duke of burgundy sailing north landed in humber found northern population by mean disposed to aid upon taking solemn oath that have design upon throne simply claimed to be restored to right dignity a duke of york be joined by sufficient force to enable to cross trent a marched south army speedily swelled be joined by many great lord warwick have summoned henry adherent to field marched north to meet when army approached other duke of clarence who commanded portion of henry army went over with whole force to edward warwick being longer in position to give battle be obliged to draw off allow edward to march unopposed towards london citizen with usual fickleness received with same outburst of enthusiasm with five month before have greeted entry of warwick unfortunate king henry be again thrown into dungeon in tower edward found once more king of england sir thomas tresham a soon a heard of landing of edward have hastened up to london in uncertainty how matter must go brought wife son up with left in lodging while marched north with warwick a soon a defection of clarence opened road to london left earl promising to return in few day rode to town arriving there two day before edward entry purchasing horse took wife son down to st albans where leaving rejoined warwick in few day latter have gathered sufficient force to enable to risk fortune of battle marching south encamped with army on common north of barnet edward have come out to meet two army slept on easter eve within two mile of other late in evening clarence sent messenger to earl offering to mediate offer be indignantly refused by warwick in darkness party be aware of other precise position warwick be much stronger than king in artillery have placed on right wing king in ignorance of enemy position have placed troop considerably more to right than of warwick army latter believing that edward line be facing kept up heavy cannonade night upon where supposed edward left to be cannonade be thus entirely futile in morning april th heavy mist covered country prevented force from seeing other disposition warwick took command of left wing having with duke of exeter somerset be in command of centre montague oxford of right edward placed in centre of array duke of gloucester commanded on right lord hastings on left desirous from inferiority in artillery to fight out battle hand to hand edward at six o'clock in morning ordered trumpet to blow after firing few shot advanced through mist to attack enemy misconception a to warwick position have saved troop from effect of cannonade during night be now disadvantageous to for earl right so greatly outflanked left that when came into contact hastings found nearly surrounded by vastly superior force wing fought valiantly be at length broken by oxford superior number driven out of field mist prevented rest of army from knowing what have happened on king left edward led charge on warwick centre having best troop under command pressed forward with such force vehemence that pierced somerset line threw into confusion just a warwick right have outflanked king left so own left be outflanked by gloucester warwick troop fought with great bravery in spite of disaster to centre be holding ground until oxford returning from pursuit of king left came back through mist king emblem be sun that of oxford star with streaming ray in dim light be mistaken by warwick men for king device believing that oxford be far away on right received with discharge of arrow be at once returned conflict took place at last mistake be discovered confusion caused be irreparable warwick oxford suspected other of treachery king right still pressing on confusion increased battle have be so nearly won by earl soon became complete defeat by ten in morning warwick army be in full flight account differ a to strength of force engaged be probable that there be great inequality that party brought fifteen thousand men into field number of slain be also very uncertain historian placing total at ten thousand others a low a one thousand from number of noble who fell former computation be probably nearest to truth warwick brother montague many other noble gentleman be killed only great noble on side who escaped being earl of somerset oxford many be also killed on edward side slaughter among ordinary fighting men be greater than usual hitherto in battle have be fought during civil war while leader taken on field be frequently executed common soldier be permitted to return to home a have only be acting under order of feudal superior be not considered responsible for act at barnet however edward smarting from humiliation have suffered by enforced flight from england owing to whole country declaring for rival gave order that quarter be to be granted be anxious day at st albans where many lady whose husband be with warwick army have like dame tresham taken up quarter be few mile from field of battle in event of victory must at once join husband while in case of defeat must take refuge in sanctuary of abbey messenger night before have brought news that battle must begin at dawn of day with intense anxiety waited for news dame tresham son attended early mass at abbey have returned to lodging when sir thomas rode up at full speed armour be dinted plume shorn away from helmet a entered house be met by wife who have run downstairs a heard horse stop at door glance at face be sufficient to tell news have lost day said warwick montague be killed be lost here for present will do love ride with to west where queen margaret will speedily land if indeed have not landed already take sanctuary here with boy will go with said must vastly rather do so will tell more on road said there be time to be lost now woman of house be called at once set son to saddle other horse to give feed to of knight dame tresham busied with packing saddlebag while husband partook of hasty meal ten minute after arrival set off gervaise riding behind father while latter led horse on wife be mounted thick mist hung over country mist told against in battle wife for a advanced force fell into confusion more than once friend attacked friend believing that be enemy however have proved advantage to now for have enabled great number to escape who might otherwise have be followed cut down be very fortunate have left horse at little farmhouse two mile in rear of camp in fog have small hope of finding soon after leaving battlefield came upon rustic hurrying in same direction a myself upon questioning turned out that be hand on very farm at have left horse have with two three others stolen out after midnight to see battle be now making way home again having seen indeed little having learned from fugitive that have be defeated guided to farmhouse otherwise must assuredly never have reached master be favourable to party let man take one of cart horse on rode a guide until have placed upon high road to st albans be then able to gallop on at full speed warwick brother montague be killed great earl will make unmake more king have be curse to england with boundless ambition vast possession readiness to change side to embroil country in civil war for purely personal end great noble be curse to country wife be be true check upon kingly ill doing oppression be with great array of retainer feudal follower out of way methinks that citizen yeoman must be able to hold own against king be battle hard fought one know little of what passed except near standard of warwick there fighting be fierce indeed for be against earl that king finally directed chief onslaught doubtless be actuated by deep personal resentment against earl for part have played humiliation have inflicted upon also by knowledge that defeat of warwick personally must be heaviest blow that must inflict upon cause of lancaster then do think cause be lost say not pembroke have strong force in wale if west rise queen margaret on landing can join may yet prevail fear that news of field of barnet will deter many from joining men may risk land life for cause seems to offer fair prospect of success can hardly be blamed for holding back when see that chance be against moreover a frenchwoman can not be denied that margaret have never be popular in england arrival here aided by french gold surrounded by frenchman will tell against with country people went a far a must on day before left amboise urging on account to come hither until matter be settled must have be infinitely better have young prince come alone landed in west without single follower people must have admired trust in must be sure have gathered strongly round banner however must still hope for best fortune be against today may be with next time give battle with party so equally divided throughout country signal victory must bring such vast number to banner that edward must again find necessary to cross sea chapter ii battle of tewkesbury riding fast sir thomas tresham crossed thames at reading before news of battle of barnet have arrived there on third day after leaving st albans reached westbury there heard that news have be received of queen landing at plymouth on very day on friend have be defeated at barnet that have already be joined by duke of somerset earl of devon others that exeter have be named a point of rendezvous for friend a lancastrian be in majority in wiltshire somerset there be longer fear of arrest by partisan of york after resting for day sir thomas tresham rode quietly on to exeter where queen have already arrived battle of barnet have not in reality greatly weakened lancastrian cause earl of warwick be so detested by adherent of red rose that comparatively few of have joined fight be rather between two section of yorkists than between york lancaster earl death have broken up party york lancaster be now face to face with other without disturbing influence on side among who have joined queen be tresham great friend grand prior of st john sir thomas took up lodging in house where have established queen be greatly pleased at arrival of dame tresham at earnest request latter shared apartment while gervaise remained with father so be young knight of st john prior said on evening of arrival of sir thomas must tresham be at present at rhodes doing battle with infidel rather than engaged in warfare against englishman fellow christian can well understand sir thomas said must not hold aloof here tresham vow of order by mean hinder from taking part in affair of own country rule of order be indeed against rule be constantly broken be otherwise there must be commandery in other country must have on entering order to abandon nationality to form part of one community in east order be true to oath can not defend holy sepulchre for for present be hopelessly lost can do wage war with infidel for fund be necessary a well a sword commandery throughout europe supply fund by struggle be maintained when be needed send out contingent to help fighting in east be from neglect of cardinal point that templar fell commandery amassed wealth wide possession unlike knight abstained altogether from fulfilling vow ceased to resist infidel therefore be suppressed with general approval of europe portion of possession be handed over to knight of st john however a understand be wish that a soon a boy come of age to wield arm will go to rhodes become active member of order be indeed rule with neophyte having served certain time be then permitted to return join one of commandery in native country wish that for gervaise father said at least wish to remain at rhodes until civil trouble be absolutely at end here life have be ruined by loving retirement quiet longing for nothing so much a life among tenantry have almost from boy be actively engaged in warfare have be away a exile here one of gentle blood have be more le mixed up in civil broil to few of doe personally matter whether member of house of york lancaster sits on throne yet have be almost compelled to take side with one other now in middle age be on eve of battle in risk life fortune if win gain naught satisfaction of seeing young edward made king of england if lose be going into exile again may leave wife widow child penniless be too true tresham a be a likely to fall a be child might be left without protector a well a fatherless however against will provide will write letter to peter d'aubusson who be real governor of rhodes for grand master orsini be so old that rule be little more than nominal at death d'aubusson be certain to be elected grand master be dear friend of mine entered order same year be comrade in many fight with moslem be quite sure that when tell that be last request of will in memory of long friendship appoint son a one of grand master page a know one however high rank be accepted a novice before age of sixteen after year probation be received into body of order a professed knight must go out serve for time in rhodes after three year of active service must reside two more at convent can then be made commander there be one exception to rule namely that page of grand master be entitled to privilege of admission at age of twelve so that become professed knight at thirteen son be now nine say must remember that d'aubusson be not yet grand master orsini may live for year yet d'aubusson however can doubtless get to appoint boy a one of page in case there be three year yet to be passed before can go out doubtless will spend under mother care a be a well to provide against everything will furnish dame with letter to knight who will probably succeed a grand prior of english langue asking to see to care education of boy up to time when can proceed to rhodes may hope dear tresham that there will be occasion to use such document that may be able personally to watch over career still be a well to take precaution will of course give d'aubusson full particular about vow wish thank greatly old friend sir thomas said have taken load off mind will leave here with mother when march forward bid if ill befalls cross again to france then to keep gervaise with until can bring to part with have jewel considerable sum of money accepted from man who have be enjoying estate for last five year in lieu of monies that have received during time therefore will not lack mean for year to come besides queen margaret have real affection for will doubtless be glad to have with again in exile when be old enough gervaise said suddenly looking up from missal of grand prior have be examining will chop off head of duke of york bring mother back to england will be valiant champion doubt boy prior said laughing be just what father doe not want chop off head of a many infidel a will leave englishman alone be duke commoner be far more glorious career to be aiding to defend europe against moslem than to be engaged in war with own countryman if great lord will fight let fight out without aid hope that long before become man even will be tired of perpetual broil that agreement may be arrived at peace reign in unhappy land besides gervaise father added must bear in mind always that earnest wish hope be that will become champion of cross took solemn vow before be born that if son be granted to must dedicate to service of cross if be taken from must still try to carry oath into effect trust at rate for year after attain manhood will expend whole strength power in defence of christianity a worthy knight of order of st john too many of knight after serving for three year against infidel return to native country pas rest of life in slothful ease at commandery save perhaps when at great crisis go out for while join in struggle such be not life must wish to lead at death of mother will have family tie in england nothing to recall here if house of york succeeds in establishing firmly on throne estate will be forfeited therefore regard rhodes a permanent home devote life to order beginning so young may hope to distinguish to gain high rank in remember that though be wish be not order that career must be in own hand will be brave knight father boy said firmly be right boy now go upstairs to bed be already late regret vow went on after gervaise have left room though regret that be only son be singular that men must care about what come after suppose be human nature must have liked to think that descendant must sit in old house that men of race name must long own estate doubtless be for best for at least can view permanent loss of estate in case yorkists triumph without poignant regret doubtless be for best tresham must remember that thing may not even now turn out a think knight who have done brave service doe not find much difficulty in obtaining from pope dispensation from vow number of knight have so left order have married perpetuated name be almost necessity that must be so for otherwise many prince baron must object to son entering order object be to keep back irruption of moslem when men have done share of hard work regret need be felt if desire to leave order founder have thought of covering europe with monastery beyond fact that be necessary there must be men to administer manor estate see reason why must not freely leave when reach age of thirty thirty five indeed believe that must strengthen rather than weaken be vow taken at age of seventeen to be for fifteen year only there be something in knight said thoughtfully however be far in distance concern little still agree with for see advantage in men after time of usefulness to order be past being bound to settle down to monastic life if by nature habit unsuited for there be spirit who after long year of warfare be well content so to do there be assuredly others to whom life of forced inactivity after youth manhood spent in action must be well nigh unendurable now tell frankly what think of chance here everything depends upon time promise of aid have come in from quarter if edward delay will soon be at head of overwhelming force edward with fault vice be able energetic leader must be well aware that if be to strike successfully must strike soon must hope that will not be able to do can not tell whether intend to march direct to london to join pembroke in wale to march north until divine purpose will hardly dare to move lest must by rapid movement interpose between london if give month success be certain if can give battle in fortnight one can say how matter will end edward indeed be losing time stayed few day in london after victory at barnet on th of april left for windsor ordering force to join there lancastrian have endeavoured to puzzle a to intended movement by sending party out in various direction a soon a have gathered force numerically small composed of veteran soldier hurried west determined to bring on battle at earliest opportunity queen adviser determined to move first to well a from point must either go north march upon london edward entered abingdon on th then finding lancastrian still at well marched to northwest by mean hoped to intercept if moved north while must be able to fall back bar road to london if advanced in direction therefore moved to cirencester waited there for news until learned that have visited bristol there obtained reinforcement of men supply of money cannon have then started on high road to gloucester at once sent off messenger to son of lord beauchamp who held castle of gloucester for assuring that be following at full speed must come to aid forthwith messenger arrived in time when queen after long march arrived before gloucester found gate shut in face governor have taken step to prevent numerous adherent in town from rising on behalf manning wall refused to surrender knowing that edward be coming up rapidly be evident that there be time to spare in attempt to take town queen army therefore pressed on without waiting to tewkesbury once across river must speedily be joined by earl of pembroke edward must be forced to fall back at once by time reached river however be thoroughly exhausted have marched thirty six mile without rest along bad road through wood be unable to go farther queen urged that river must be crossed leader of force be of opinion that be better to halt edward must be able to follow across river be to attack when in disorder still further wearied by operation of making passage must certainly crush moreover further retreat must discourage soldier a battle must now be fought be better to fight where be especially a must choose strong position queen gave way army encamped on large field in front of town position be well calculated for defence for country around be so broken intercepted with lane deep hedge ditch that be extremely difficult of approach in evening edward came up men having also marched six thirty mile encamped for night within three mile of lancastrian position queen troop felt confident of victory in point of number be superior to antagonist have advantage of strong position sir thomas tresham have a proposed left wife son at exeter

sufficient in way of actual instruction rule of order have to be committed to memory beyond reading consisted largely of life of saint especially of who distinguished by charity devotion to vow of poverty to of member of order be pledged gervaise however must see around sign of poverty on part be true that lived fed together in auberge of respective langues that possessed house establishment of own magnificence of armour attire lavish expenditure of upon pleasure contrasted strangely with poverty to have vowed be true that in many case mean to support expenditure be derived from share knight received of plunder acquired in capture of moslem ship undoubtedly many must have possessed large private mean bailiff for example although only required by rule to place before knight at auberge ration received for with such luxury a must be purchased by yearly allowance for purpose expended annually very large sum in addition supplied table with dainty in order to gain popularity goodwill

satisfaction saw one side of picture other be hidden from although told that after slaving in turkish galley must feel satisfaction at seeing who have be tyrant suffering same fate be well aware that must not be case that own suffering must only make sympathise more deeply with of others have found soon after arrival on island that be best to keep feeling on subject to while knight be bound in accordance with vow to relieve suffering of kind among christian seemed to regard captive rather in light of brute beast than human being slave be struck on smallest provocation even killing of slave be considered very venial offence punished only because slave be of value to order be true that edict be from time to time published by council enjoining fair treatment of slave be specially ordered that employed a servant in auberge be not to be struck lot of servant be indeed very much easier than of engaged on public work such occupation be therefore considered privilege servant being for most part selected from among captive of superior rank for next six month gervaise worked at various duty in town be employed for fortnight in infirmary then for while be transferred to galley for most

to attack that be forced to use labour in strengthening fortification have naught to complain of in way of food still must myself gladly see lot alleviated must not afford to keep so great number of captive in idleness must work for living have not be for labour must never have built fortified city after be little worse off than serf at home build castle till land may be so sir with in england

faith though be can understand feeling too felt somewhat same when first came here nevertheless there be work must be done if order be not to be crushed by infidel here be captive for most part

that be to cruise between mainland island of be in hand of turk while others be still occupied by greek except when there be formal actual state of war moslem christian island remained in state of

quarrel with neighbour did small share of work only sending fleet to sea when danger threatened of possession in levant be delightful ralph gervaise said a stood together on poop looking back at receding city what pleasant change be from standing in broiling sun watching poor wretch toiling at fortification there be only one drawback to pleasure wish that carried sail be moved along by breeze instead of by exertion of slave much chance must have of catching pirate under such circumstance ralph said laughing might a well set tortoise to catch hare say that must not be obliged to carry rower ralph prize have be brought in since have be at rhodes carry mast sail a well a oar a understand for most part cruise about under sail only use oar when chasing fleeing be so because see in most case crew have to row have doubt if have slave to do work must soon take to mast sail also for speed rowing galley be best for unless brisk wind be blowing mast sail must check progress when oar be out at rate constrain to travel only before wind know weakness about slave gervaise a must neither build fortification row galley without can not go a far a do in matter though own be sometimes sorry for must remember that be fault of people not of ours that be here be true enough ralph can not gainsay still must rather that be gliding along with sail instead of being rowed by slave at rate gervaise

boswell companion now formed semicircle flank resting on bulwark pirate in vain endeavoured to break line again again flung upon knight only to be beaten off with heavy loss at length loud cheer arose from galley sir louis ricord with knight of auvergne spain having cleared galley of foe carried pirate have grappled with sprang on to deck of ship fell upon throng be attacking knight there oblivious of what be going on elsewhere at once english knight comrade took offensive fell upon assailant who at sight of reinforcement for moment stood irresolute for short time there be fierce struggle then pirate sprang back to two ship endeavoured to cast off grapnel knight followed hotly upon panic stricken now pirate sprang overboard many be drowned greater part managed to swim to shore chapter v scourge of sea breathless faint from tremendous exertion knight removed helmet by st mary sir louis said have be a hard fight a have ever be engaged in well may be content with victory well fought

knight asked there be very many who must not get off to ship during fight score must have swum ashore must say that there must be full two hundred will be grievous thing for islander if leave there be certain commander said that be not strong enough to attack for be to land party must have to be left on board pirate might elude search seize fishing boat regain possession certainly be in position to divide force methinks sir john boswell said that best plan must be to send boat manned with ten galley slave taking two three of to rendezvous to fetch other two galley with aid might take four ship safe into port after first clearing island of pirate be forty mile away eight hour rowing must take there there be general murmur of assent for wished that trophy of bravery must if possible be carried to rhodes will certainly be best plan sir john though may detain here for two three day even more for be quite uncertain when other two galley may put in at rendezvous will undertake mission

joined in hearty commendation of two young knight indeed one said be greatly surprised to see how tresham bore be lad with scarce one must think strength to hold own in such fray chanced that be next to in circle for time kept eye on thinking might require aid soon saw that need not trouble on account for wielded weapon a doughtily a best knight of order must have done one of proof be that while most of bear mark of conflict have escaped without scratch trust sir louis that when give account of fighting will specially mention that youngest knight of order bore a stoutly a of say sir john

galley slave bent to oar boat flew along at greatly increased speed there be small chance of getting away sir john said quietly at present must be rowing a fast a sail wind never tire while there be limit to power of muscle bone if fellow follow doubt not that will for must be thirsting for vengeance will overtake long before get to rendezvous even did reach chance be that must not find either of galley there must hold on a long a can a last resource must run ashore unfortunately there be large island on way have hope of assistance from friend behind inlet look east will know nothing of danger if did must help galley be short handed now there be captured ship to look after captive rescued have only ourselves to depend on at end of hour rowing boat astern have gained little exertion of rower be telling severely upon be still doing best breath came in short gasp rowing be getting short unsteady there be sensible decrease in speed of boat three mile ahead of be islet about mile in diameter

into long steady stroke will buckle on armour again sir ralph harcourt asked for have not put on when left ship a heat be very great think have better don mail shirt only in climbing about rock ahead

armour will come to same in end if be not that have mission to fulfil that be of thing important to send galley to aid friend must say let choose spot at foot of rock there where can not attack in rear there fight out a becomes knight of cross a be duty above thing to carry message must strive to preserve life must if can conceal from paynim what be going to do sir john asked slave when be within quarter of mile of islet must think after have left boat will be best for to sit quietly on bench till pursuer arrive must cut throat at once sir knight will be furious at having given so long chase hassan ali men care little whom slay irritated by misfortune will be naught to whether be moslem christian for one will take to wood hide there be chorus of assent among other rower trust that may escape knight said be for will be hunting if catch slay will not trouble to search island further seems to sir john gervaise said that with aid of good fellow may yet have chance of escape what be plan sir gervaise think sir john that if when land climb straight up hill in full sight of shore pirate when see will follow at once slave must therefore be safe for time if hide in wood to left of spot be making for will tell to keep down by water edge among bush after crossing that crest will try to make dash round so a to join there 't be probable that most of pirate will start in pursuit of if slave make rush for shore may seize boat push off capture craft if there be few left on board knock out plank scuttle then row away by st george plan be good one tresham right good scheme will try at once translated what gervaise have said to rower by whom be received with short exclamation of approval for be too breathless exhausted for talk already must hear yell of pirate who a boat ran up on beach be quarter of mile behind now away for wood sir john cried a leapt ashore now comrade for climb up hill be steep ascent more than once one have to be helped up by others then in turn to assist to get up beside louder louder rose shout of pirate knight did not glance back until reached top of hill then turned looked round swarm of men be climbing after be already halfway up cliff heave down sir john exclaimed pointing to loose rock set example by lifting great stone hurling over edge harcourt gervaise at once did same twenty thirty rock be speedily sent rolling down steep ascent yell shout cry be heard below will check bit now let be off sir john boswell said at once started after crossing hundred yard of bare rock stood at edge of slope into deep valley beyond rose central hill of island valley ran right across be filled with tree extending to sea at end running rapidly down knight be within shelter of wood before moslem have reached brow behind minute later heard shout of enemy once in wood turned to left in few minute stood on sea shore be little bay two hundred yard across at point cliff rose abruptly from water will have to swim round point sir john said take off mail shirt will make way along rock a far a can then drop into sea otherwise will know that have taken to water hurried along rock be able to make way to within fifty yard of point then throwing mail shirt into sea plunged in knew importance of getting round before of pirate who must be searching valley came down on shore swam hardest until rounded corner wood rang with shout of pursuer yell have risen from water edge hundred yard farther be able to land be in short time in shelter of tree fringed water to point where have left boat there be longer occasion for speed made way through thick bush undergrowth quietly until recovered breath after exertion have gone few hundred yard when from bush slave suddenly rose up have gone well sir john said to in own language pirate be searching for on other side of hill there be not likely to be many of left here will soon be in possession of boat again followed by slave made way forward until stood at edge of wood five six pirate be standing on shore expect have be left there harcourt said to prevent slave from carrying off boat must have seen run into wood wo reckon on being with drawing sword three knight rushed out followed by slave have hundred yard to run pirate on seeing raised yell drew scimitar sight of knight rushing upon when have expected few unarmed rower be too much for courage when assailant be still fifty yard away turned fled fishing craft have be run ashore few yard from boat get afloat harcourt bring to stern of fisherman now tresham follow sir john boswell climbed up on to fishing boat be craft of fifteen ton burden be entirely deserted sail still hung from yard fire be burning on stone hearth raised on log of wood in centre of deck look for something to stave in plank tresham gervaise leapt down into hold there be net spare sail lying there nothing must answer purpose examined plank boat be very strongly roughly built there be nothing here sir john will do nothing short of heavy sledge hammer must suffice to smash one of plank there be lot of coming down hill tresham have not many minute to spare must disable craft will soon be after again have run hard fast here when come back will soon get off let try one of sweep lifted one of heavy oar holding upright gervaise together tried to drive handle through bottom again again raised drove down plank be too strong too securely fastened to timber must give up knight said with sigh fortune have befriended so far tresham have deserted at last three minute will have thirty forty of upon at moment lad eye fell upon fire will manage yet exclaimed seizing blazing brand jumped below set fire to sail stowed there be a dry a tinder flame shot up at once be good tresham knight said will put out before have caught boat not before have burnt sail gervaise replied now for one applied brand to lower edge of great sail without word sir john seized brand fired sail on other side of deck flame flashed up wild yell of rage alarm broke from pirate who be now rushing down towards beach now to boat tresham have time to lose if must avoid being pounded with stone dropped over stern into boat galley slave dipped oar into water shot away just a foremost of pirate reached edge of water few stone be thrown pirate be so anxious about craft by alone must escape from island that majority at once climbed on board at word from knight slave stopped rowing hundred yard from shore sail be already consumed yard upper part of mast be in flame dense smoke be rising from hold pirate be throwing bucket of water down into in few minute smoke decreased thought that must be able to put out a far a be concerned matter little have lost sail a saw four sweep can travel five mile to one if find galley will look in here on way back if have not left will fire craft more effectually then pirate will be trapped can leave till have fetched off sir louis prize then have grand hunt here took prisoner before hundred slave will be useful addition to wall builder now tresham have to thank warmly for harcourt doubly owe life to be thanks to quickness of wit that regained boat for must not have given ducat for chance have not thought of scheme in second place must assuredly have be overtaken again have not be for happy thought of crippling by burning sail by st george harcourt young countryman of ours be a quick a ready of wit a have shown brave gallant fighter have lack of sturdy fighter wit to devise to seize upon right thing in moment of danger be vastly more rare a for have shame that lad who be young enough to be son must have thus twice in single hour pointed out way to safety with sword battleaxe can trust hold own with man brain be dull when come to hatching scheme if live will see sir gervaise one of most distinguished knight of order while feel gratified indeed a may well be by commendation sir john must under favour say that have given far greater degree of credit than be due there be fire there be sail thought that one must destroy other be simply natural one might have occurred to child a to plan about boat seeing that there be hill wood flashed upon at once that might make circuit come back to just so lad thought did not flash upon mind upon of harcourt be just because sort of idea do flash upon mind of men not of others that first rise to rank of distinguished commander while others remain simple knight who must play part in charge in defence of breach must be of account a leader now row along steadily men went on speaking to slave be still in good time for be not hour from moment touched

piccolomini warmly never heard more welcome shout piccolomini than gave when fell upon moslem for in truth issue of conflict be doubtful be delighted when morning at daybreak santoval galley rowed in have kept watch during night thinking pirate might obtain boat make attack upon with twenty of fit to wield sword position must have be bad one at rate might have recaptured prize agreed that santoval knight must land at once did sir john boswell have of course told how boat have be chased by fishing craft manned by large number of pirate that feared rest might similarly have escaped might have gone to bring more of hassan ali ship upon a soon a santoval landed of native came down told that there be not pirate remaining there rest having started in boat few minute after one have chased boswell santoval left two of men with order to ascend to highest spot on island to keep watch then brought rest off to galley first step be of course to send woman child ashore then consulted a to what have best be done if pirate must come back in force hoped at rate that must not happen until arrived expected that must be here before noon decided must get here before from galley must embark on santoval a be better to fight in one strongly manned boat than to divide force be scarce hour after santoval came down before men left on lookout appeared on beach on fetching off told that a soon a reached top of hill saw five vessel approaching with sail oar that must be here in hour at outside at once abandoned galley brought rower wounded here prepared for fight a saw ran two biggest ship alongside for two hour fight went on be crowded with men who in vain strove to get footing on deck have only have two to deal with must have have nothing to fear heavily manned though be other three kept sailing backwards forward discharging gun into a passed firing not only shot bag of bullet gunner be skilful a see have completely riddled poop twenty knight have be killed eleven others be sorely wounded scarce one have escaped unscathed may guess then how welcome be aid have not expected for three hour be on point of abandoning waist gathering on poop must still have defended for considerable time when a if dropped from sky fell upon pirate turned table how be that be here so early started at three o'clock instead of waiting for daybreak seemed from story of two young knight that be possible might be attacked early crippled a command be with four prize on hand deemed best to come on a soon a rower have have few hour rest be well that did so must have be grievous affair have two of galley be captured by pirate must have be blow to prestige of order must have brought such strength to hassan ali other pirate leader that nothing short of sending out fleet must have recovered ascendancy a ducat can spare have to be spent on fortification must have be misfortune indeed have be obliged to fit out such expedition at present who have fallen sir louis five more of knight of galley pierre de vignes raoul de montpelier ernest schmidt raymond garcia albert schenck here be list of knight of santoval galley 't be long list sad one piccolomini said after reading name with seven who fell in first fight twenty seven knight have fallen brave comrade truly can ill spare such loss be true there be five prize to show for have struck hassan ali blow will resound through levant cost be heavy be indeed ricord agreed four vessel be well filled with rich spoil that scoundrel have gathered doubt not one captured be equally rich still have be ten time a valuable booty must be dearly purchased at price there be now consultation among leader be agreed that six knight must be placed in of captured ship with ten of galley slave to work sail others being equally divided between three galley be in first place to row to island where pirate be imprisoned to slay capture whole of afterwards be to make direct for rhodes with so numerous fleet there be fear of being attacked arrangement took short time to complete hour later left port three galley rowing ahead while five prize under easy sail followed sir john boswell have be wounded not so seriously a to altogether disable be in command of one of prize having sir adam tedbond harcourt gervaise german knight with sir marmaduke lumley who after first fight be over be found to surprise pleasure of comrade to be still living be with rest of wounded on board one of galley two of pirate have fallen dead across in ardour of attack on knight have there unnoticed until return of sir louis comrade have driven pirate overboard leech be of opinion that might yet recover from wound on arriving at island sixty of knight disembarked wood near shore be first searched be found untenanted be about to advance up hill when man appeared on crest above waving white flag be told to come down on arrival said that be sent by companion to offer to surrender on promise life must be spared knight be well pleased to be saved trouble of long search through wood messenger left at once to acquaint pirate that term be accepted in short time eighty men made way down hill on reaching beach be disarmed divided equally between galley distributed among rower filling up place of who have be killed by fire of moslem of men drafted into prize begged for food water before began work on being questioned admitted that surrender be due principally to fact that have be unable to find food of sort on island that after searching over spring of water must be discovered in case sir john boswell said have doubt have surrendered before thought probable that good many of must have remained hidden trusting to be able to make raft after have left so get away believing rightly enough that must be disinclined to search foot of island for a be doubt not be here little fleet anchored that night at rendezvous after two more day rowing reached rhodes where appearance of three galley followed by five prize be greeted with great acclamation news however that twenty seven knight have fallen that thirteen fourteen others be very gravely wounded damped satisfaction one have at first felt d'aubusson came down a soon a reached mole be greatly affected when received ricord report be unfortunate loss indeed sir louis said though may be that victory be not too dearly purchased speak of captured ship of spoil contain even of slave have brought welcome though may be of effect that defeat capture of craft of hassan ali will have be plain that preparation sultan be making belief rhodes be doomed have so encouraged infidel that be becoming really formidable at sea blow will show that order have yet power to sweep sea of pirate since however adventure have taught that single leader like hassan sail with at least nine ship under order be clear that in future galley must not adventure singly among island be fortunate indeed that first santoval then piccolomini arrived to assistance how be that happened to come up so opportunely sir john boswell with ralph harcourt gervaise tresham went in boat to rendezvous have arranged reached after adventure will leave sir john to tell may say that two young knight named have in encounter obtained very high credit amongst for valour with fought one bore more stoutly be glad to take early opportunity of bringing conduct before notice a will learn from sir john gervaise tresham afterwards showed quickness of wit be mean of saving life of with may say also of with for have failed to reach rendezvous must have fallen easy victim to five ship hassan ali brought against sending for sir john boswell grand prior heard from detail of adventure in boat be right glad to hear speak so warmly of tresham sir john for regard a special protege be pleased indeed to find at outset of career have proved not only brave knight full of resource quick at invention think sir john that two young knight have shown well worthy of receiving honour of secular knighthood assuredly have sir john agreed then sir john will bestow upon order a order doe not bestow honour member forfeit right a knight to bestow individually none among be more worthy of admitting to rank than must gladly do sir peter honour must come far better from must not only be more highly prized by must be of greater value in eye of others be simple knight commander of order name must scarce be known beyond rank to be knighted by one whose name be known honoured throughout europe must give standing wherever went place on level with best if be opinion boswell will myself undertake will do at once be better done here than at conclave of order now when be fresh from battle let knight be summoned from other galley at once in few minute whole of knight be assembled on poop of galley friend brother knight d'aubusson said first in name of order have to thank most heartily for brave deed that have performed for fresh honour have won for man have a learn from three commander borne a true valiant knight ready to give life in cause of order of humanity two name have be specially brought before by commander ricord by good knight sir john boswell be of two young companion who though knight of order have not yet received secular knighthood in opinion of two knight have right worthily won sir ralph harcourt sir gervaise tresham step forward two young knight colouring with pleasure at unexpected honour removed helmet stood with bowed head before grand prior d'aubusson went on turning to knight around be about comrade to undertake office of knighting sir louis ricord sir john boswell stand a sponsor before proceed must ask whether too approve hold sir ralph harcourt sir gervaise tresham have proved worthy of honour of secular knighthood at hand there be general reply in affirmative answer of survivor of ricord crew being specially emphatic grand prior drew sword two young knight knelt before sponsor standing beside sir ralph harcourt have now be four year knight of order hitherto have have opportunity of drawing sword against infidel now that chance have come have proved true valiant brother of order well worthy of secular accolade be in capacity now knight be not grand prior of auvergne sir peter d'aubusson of grand cross of st louis who now bestows upon honour of secular knighthood touched lightly with sword then turned to gervaise sir gervaise tresham be young indeed to receive honour of secular knighthood valour be of age in opinion of commander in of comrade have proved worthy of honour have shown too that a sir john boswell have related to be not only brave in action able in moment of danger to plan to execute be tell mean of saving life that of comrade by thus enabling to bear to place of rendezvous news of sir louis danger be also mean of saving life of sir louis companion of bringing home in safety prize have taken with such beginning be easy to foresee that will win for day distinguished position in rank of order be most worthy of honour now bestow upon touched with sword two young knight rose to foot bowed deeply to d'aubusson then retired with sponsor be at once surrounded by knight who shook by hand warmly congratulated upon honour have befallen receiving equally warm congratulation on arrival at auberge of langue five prize turned out when cargo be landed to be much more valuable than cursory examination made by knight have warranted in expecting contained indeed accumulation of most valuable content of prize taken by pirate for long time previously a desperado preyed upon turkish commerce a well a christian good consisted largely of eastern manufacture of kind costly robe delicate embroidery superb carpet shawl goldsmith work small amount of jewel be among spoil collected bulk of merchandise captured be two day later despatched in galley to genoa marseille to be sold for benefit of order d'aubusson without hesitation carried out sir john boswell promise to slave who have rowed boat be not only set at liberty be presented with sum of money be placed on board galley landed on mainland english knight be proud of honour have be won by young countryman only exception being robert river who be devoured with jealousy at advancement did not openly display feeling for report not only of sir john boswell of other two english knight be so strong that dared not express discontent have twice be engaged with pirate have gained no particular credit indeed have in opinion of comrade be somewhat slack in fray be favourite in auberge though spared pain to ingratiate with senior knight have short time before be very severely reprimanded by bailiff for striking one of servant have more than once have to reprove for manner to servant bailiff said will now be punished by septaine will fast for seven day on wednesday friday will receive bread water only will be confined to auberge for period next time have reason to complain of will bring matter before grand master represent to that be best to send home since can not comport to servant of auberge a befits knight of order have always borne reputation of being specially kind to servant be intolerable that one who have be short time only professed knight must behave with hauteur insolence that not even oldest among must permit there be not one of servant here who be not in own country of rank station equal if not superior to own though misfortune have fallen upon be to be pitied rather than condemned for in future be to give order to servant to address save when at meal require anything if have complaint to make of conduct to will make to will inquire into matter if find have failed in duty will be punished will keep eye upon in future there be other fault have observed in more than once have heard address sir gervaise tresham in manner be not duelling forbidden by rule might bring about bloodshed from what have seen when have be watching exercise be a much superior in arm a be in manner disposition reproof have greatly subdued robert river a felt that display of jealousy of gervaise must be resented by other knight might result in serious consequence to abstained from exhibition of when returned to auberge although must not bring to join in congratulation offered to next day however when be talking to ralph harcourt remarked from what hear harcourt d'aubusson praised young tresham very highly seems to that there be nothing at out of way in what did be very unfair that must be selected for higher praise than be not unfair at ralph said warmly for be of generous nature incapable of base feeling of envy tresham did great deal more than did when saw pirate boat gaining so fast upon seemed to sir john boswell a well a to myself that there be scarce chance of escape that must do be to choose spot on to make stand then to sell life a dearly a must must see that sir john be scanning hill for spot where must best defend a to hiding on so small island with hundred men eager for blood searching for be well nigh impossible be suggestion alone saved life enabled to fetch succour to sir louis sir john who be old tried soldier said that for quickness merit of conception oldest knight in order must not have done better be not one to praise unduly be four year older than gervaise tresham tell be named tomorrow commander of galley must willingly serve under well well need not be angry harcourt have nothing to say against tresham doubt have happy thought turned out well can not see that there be anything wonderful in seemed to unfair that one who be mere boy must receive higher praise than who a heard sir john sir adam tedbond say last night at refectory bore right gallantly did best ralph said shortly there be small credit in when be fighting for life most cowardly beast will fight under such circumstance when see moslem rushing at scimitar in hand know that if cut down will cut down naturally strike a hard a quickly a can have never liked gervaise river be sure know why always speak in contemptuous sort of tone about true doe harm certainly doe good for what reason must feel contempt for although so much younger be better swordsman better rider than be be liked by one in auberge be more than can be said of yourself be always good tempered be quiet unassuming what on earth do always set against for know do set against river said sullenly own to having great liking for be natural enough seeing that father be lancastrian while be yorkists be not pleasant to see so much made of boy merely because d'aubusson have favoured be certain harcourt said hotly that such idea have never occurred to one sir peter be great man will soon be grand master at present be grand prior of langue of auvergne whether favour tresham not be matter concern none of gervaise be liked by for own good quality bear a young knight must do respectfully towards senior be ever ready to do service to one one have ever seen out of temper be always kind considerate to servant when in command of party of slave at public work never say harsh word to treat a if be human being not brute beast besides though be more skilful than of with sword indeed at of military exercise be unassuming have particle of pride arrogance be for thing that be liked friendship of d'aubusson have naught to do with be not only d'aubusson who have prophesied that will rise to distinguished rank in order boswell ricord said same for one thoroughly believe be there one among under age of twenty might go farther who have already won such credit for one who when sixteen can make mark in order like ours be certain to rise to high office may before many year be over be proud to serve under will never do river said fiercely must rather go bury for life in smallest commandery in england may be harcourt retorted temper also roused possibly might prefer that to fighting under other leader be reflection on courage sir ralph harcourt will lay matter before bailiff can do a like harcourt said disdainfully think will benefit by pain when temper cooled down river acknowledged to truth of what harcourt said be not in favour of bailiff while harcourt tresham stood at present moment high in estimation complaint must lead to inquiry into matter have led to former word even if harcourt be reprimanded for using must assuredly not gain in estimation of knight harcourt thought no more of matter though laughingly told gervaise that river be by mean gratified at attaining honour of secular knighthood virtually placed over head be not nice fellow gervaise said naturally must be galling to to good many others who have not yet have chance of distinguishing think be very good of that be so kind cordial of course be otherwise with who be a old a most of other professed knight serving here with be quite different a river somehow have never be very friendly with of course be doubly galling to hope will soon get opportunity of winning spur too be just like tresham if be in place must have good wish for fellow who have never lost opportunity of annoying that without smallest cause of offence on part be sure must not wish ill harcourt must make allowance for just a do feel that if have have same opportunity must have obtained same credit honour chapter vii first command first news that knight heard on return from expedition be that grand master orsini be seriously ill at advanced age doctor feared there be little hope of rallying gervaise felt keen regret on hearing that kind gentle old man who have be for three year master be at point of death nevertheless be generally felt among knight that in view of danger threatened rhodes be for good of order that strong capable man whom respected who possessed entire confidence must at time be invested with absolute power d'aubusson have indeed for year be real head of community question have if only a matter of form to be referred to grand master in order to obtain approval signature in state of feebleness to have for month past fallen much time be frequently lost before must be made to understand question referred to moreover order of d'aubusson must be appealed against view thwarted authority questioned be therefore felt that much a respected old grand master must be advantage to order when supreme authority passed into hand of d'aubusson four day after return of expedition orsini died few hour later grand council be convened d'aubusson unanimously elected grand master of order ceremony of funeral of predecessor be imposing one knight of order in rhodes be present together with number of leading native of island although gervaise have since arrival on island seen many stately ceremony far surpassed anything have previously beheld gervaise have at one of first interview with d'aubusson after arrival at island be advised by to acquire knowledge of turkish there be few knight of order who speak language said a rule while young men be ready to devote amount of time to acquiring dexterity in martial exercise will bestow labour in obtaining knowledge may be fully a useful to a skill in arm in dealing with turk one other party have to employ interpreter be often by mean certain that men convey full meaning of speech translate again have large number of turkish slave be highly to be desired that knight must be able to give order to men in own language lastly knight who have be taken prisoner by turk even bravest might meet with misfortune must find alleviation of lot might be able to plan carry out escape did speak turkish well must strongly counsel to acquire knowledge of tongue gervaise have intended to follow advice of grand prior duty of office a page time required for military exercise study with chaplain have rendered well nigh impossible during first three year to turn attention to learning turkish a soon a pageship be at end found that duty included supervision of turkish slave felt want of knowledge of language from time devoted hour day to study employing one of servant of auberge who be man of rank education at home to instruct while conscientiously spent amount of time at work be most disagreeable portion of day labour event however have taken place during expedition have impressed greatly with utility of knowledge of turkish for have not be for sir john boswell possessing acquaintance with language must have be impossible to communicate with rower of boat to have arranged plan by have escaped pirate have then there determined that a soon a returned to rhodes must take matter up in very different spirit to in before approached have on way home spoken to sir john who have highly approved of determination when be young knight of eighteen be taken captive twenty six year ago at time when egyptian fleet appeared before rhodes galley advanced to attack under cover of night retired proceeding to mainland took shelter under gun of turkish fort attacked there be desperate engagement without decisive advantage on side lost le than sixty knight egyptian seven hundred men fleet returned to egypt three others who be left wounded on deck of one of ship have boarded failed to capture be carried to egypt remained there captive for six month when be ransomed by order during time learnt enough of language be akin to turkish to be able to make understood to understand what be said to have kept up that much for intercourse with slave servant at rhodes have found very useful consider then that will do well to acquire tongue will be useful not only to to others when get back will if like ask bailiff to free from duty in order that may devote to head of langue at once granted sir john request must said that more of young knight must give portion of time to study most of look to returning home when term of service here have expired many think only of amusement imagine that advancement be best achieved by valour tresham have already distinguished very greatly so much so that think must be well if did not go on expedition for time stayed here while others have opportunity of doing same be to send out with next galley that start must be accused of favouritism lad who be now deservedly popular with must be regarded with envy possibly even with dislike at same time after what have done must have difficulty in refusing be to volunteer to sail in next galley set out desire then on part to learn turkish be in way opportune will too in long run be of great advantage to in order will give weight bring into prominence think there be six in order who can fairly translate turkish document there be two who must write reply in same language inform then that from present time will be excused from work except of course to join in ceremonial when be required to be present if sir john will pick out from among servitor here one who be well instructed educated capable of writing a well a reading language will similarly relieve of other work place at disposal of young tresham tell lad that hope will persevere until obtains complete knowledge of tongue can mention to what have said a to opinion of advantage knowledge of will be to in order gervaise accordingly devoted to study instructor be turk of fine presence have be large landowner in syria held high official position in province have be captured in galley on way to constantinople whither be proceeding on official mission be delighted with new post gervaise a youngest member of community from kind manner in always spoke to servant of whom have acquired knowledge of english be general favourite among turk be glad that be to be thrown with still more rejoiced at being appointed instructor a relieved from menial work although preferable to to bulk of slave be condemned yet galled spirit infinitely now that have entered upon work with approbation of superior conviction of great utility gervaise set to work with same zeal ardour have exhibited in military exercise during heat of day sat in shade reading writing with instructor in cool of morning afternoon walked with on wall in country beyond after sunset sat with in unfrequented corner of roof time conversing with of own country that of instructor at first be difficult have to eke out turkish word have acquired with english be not long before there be necessity for intercourse for ten twelve hour day with turk pain taken by instructor caused to acquire language with extreme rapidity of course have to put up with great deal of banter from younger knight upon passion for study sometimes pretended that mania a considered arose from fact that be determined to become renegade be fitting for high position in turkish army at other time insisted that intention be to become turkish dervish to win great turkish heiress settle in syria a always bore banter good temperedly be ready occasionally to join in sport when assault at arm be carried on soon became tired of making fun of after nine month constant work young knight study be abruptly stopped by receipt of letter from pasha of syria offering considerable sum for ransom of instructor request be at once acceded to a be policy of knight to accept ransom for prisoner because sum so gained be useful because be compelled sometimes to pay ransom for member of order suleiman ali be be arranged to be put on board egyptian craft bound for acre safe conduct having be sent for vessel crew for knight who be to receive ransom from pasha at rate sir gervaise turk said when young knight expressed great regret at leaving position a instructor pupil must have come to end shortly for last three month there have be little teaching between have talked have be save that for short time day read wrote there have be little to teach speak native language now a fluently a do must pas anywhere a syrian especially a there be slight difference of speech in various province believe that in syria must not be suspected of being anything native assuredly must be taken for syrian elsewhere have learnt enough must be waste of time for knight soldier to spend day in study on following day gervaise be to surprise sent for by grand master except on occasion of few public ceremony have not seen d'aubusson since have be elected to present high dignity summons to attend at palace therefore came unexpectedly have become quite stranger tresham grand master said cordially when entered have not forgotten have several time questioned bailiff concerning tell that have become anchorite save at meal for occasional bout at arm be seldom to be seen be glad to hear of devotion to study thought better to leave undisturbed at yesterday evening sent for instructor be man of influence in syria wished to learn how be affected towards now that be about to return there talked for time then asked what progress have made be surprised pleased to find that in opinion must pas anywhere a native that be perfectly capable of drawing up writing document might desire to send to sultan of general be far more than have expected show how earnestly must have worked knowledge may prove of much assistance to order believe time have spent in acquiring may prove of much greater advantage to in career than if have occupied in performing even most valiant deed at future time will ensure appointment to responsible office here be partly to assure of approbation sent for partly to inform have appointed to proceed with suleiman ali a knight in charge of vessel to receive ransom agreed on upon handing over office be honourable one one of trust be first fruit of advantage will gain by knowledge of turkish thank be selecting because be better fitted than knight can spare for mission also may say because choice will be pleasing to suleiman ali whose goodwill be desirous of gaining before now turkish province have thrown off allegiance to sultan have must admit be usually reconquered such might not be always case if such event happened in syria man influence goodwill might be of great advantage to a might well suit to ally with syria against constantinople be glad to say that found at least a well disposed a man must be who have be year in slavery admitted that for slave have be kindly gently treated added that unpleasant memory might have retained have be obliterated by nine month of pleasant companionship spent with when gervaise returned to dinner at auberge informed ralph harcourt other young knight that have be appointed to take charge of vessel in suleiman ali be to be conveyed to acre statement be at first received with incredulity seemed incredible that youngest knight in langue must be chosen for such mission involving a did separate command even older knight when news be passed down table be surprised must say that be astonished at grand master choice sir gervaise tresham doubtless distinguished greatly month since from time have not be out with galley indeed done anything must seem to recommend for so marked favour a separate command know wingate sir john boswell said seems to that when young knight of seventeen eschews pleasure refrain from volunteering for service at sea spends whole time in study doe distinguish very greatly of three four hundred young knight here doubt if one other must have so acted certainly none to knowledge have done so yet suppose that d'aubusson selected for duty a reward for so much self denial study because by self denial study be more fitted for than of here save three four knight in other langues of whom be in too high position to be employed in so unimportant duty can speak turkish not few score of word sentence such a can a suleiman ali tell like native be one of chosen for mission must be necessary to send interpreter with one know how hard be to do business in manner seems to that grand master have acted wisely in putting aside question of seniority employing knight who be better suited than other for be right boswell bailiff said really have be astonished at manner in tresham have given up to study must have be natural thing have after gaining so much credit be anxious eager to gain more when spoke to about determination to learn turkish thought must speedily tire of that when next galley sailed name must be among list of volunteer for service be sure comrade that there be few if among who must not infinitely prefer fighting moslem to spending whole time in learning language for one consider fact that have for nine month laboured so incessantly assiduously that have come a boswell say to speak like native be even more to credit than deed for be knighted conversation took place at upper end of table be not heard at lower end where younger knight be seated be not chosen from favour gervaise said hotly to one of companion who have asserted that be so be simply chosen because can speak turkish how much turkish can speak one of laughed gervaise turned to turkish servant behind said in language hassan sir giles trevor wish to know how well speak turkish have heard talking with suleiman ali will give opinion about man turned gravely to sir giles trevor lord said in english sir gervaise tresham speaks turkish same a do if dress up in turk clothes suppose turk not know christian by speech exclamation of surprise broke from young knight well have earned appointment tresham ralph harcourt said heartily always told when asked that be getting on have not least idea that be getting on like can read write turkish language well enough for practical purpose ralph at rate wrote complimentary letter morning from grand master to governor of syria bailiff of spain who be a know for ten year prisoner among turk read through at d'aubusson request to see that there be error in be good enough to pas without alteration must give good deal sir giles trevor said if must follow example shut up for nine month with infidel to study language must not do if life depended on must throw off wall at end of first fortnight pretend can do what tresham have done ralph harcourt said always hated lesson with chaplain who gave character of having thickest head of of pupil vow kissed handle of dagger will spend hour day in trying to learn something of turkish of course know that such time will not be enough to learn great deal if one must get up just enough to be able to give order to slave to question captain of vessel one have captured to make understand little if by bad luck one fell into hand must be quite enough for be sure sometimes one be quite at loss how to pas hour when sun be at hottest if one tried one ought to be able to pick up little without much trouble look at servant there be not one of speaks little english if infidel can learn enough english to get on with without regular study ca see why must be able to learn enough turkish in same way two three of other young knight declared that too must devote short time during heat of day to learning turkish agreed to begin together forthwith with one of servant who spoke english most fluently robert river be not present for have returned to england six month before to take up residence at house in clerkenwell in order that might bring to bear interest of many powerful friend to secure for appointment a commander of one of estate of order in england departure have caused general satisfaction among other knight whom arrogance ill temper have frequently irritated gervaise especially be glad at leaving island for after received honour of knighthood river made point of always addressing with affectation of deference respect often tried temper to utmost be well that river have gone ralph said laughing for know how must have supported chagrin appointment must have given be devoured with jealousy a be must have be trial beyond bearing be heartily glad have gone gervaise said gravely have put up with great deal from think must have stood much more if vow have not forbidden fighting must have called to account long ago only thing else to do be for to lodge formal complaint before bailiff of continually offensive bearing manner must not bring to do indeed there be special matter must have seemed to justify single speech that in must warrant such grave action on part used to wish over over again that must meet in quiet spot in england unarmed must there settle matter in good english fashion with fist even with couple of quarterstaff others laughed must be very unknightly form of contest care not for gervaise replied must be very satisfactory one anyhow quite serious enough for occasion sneer petty insult be not sufficient to justify drawing of blood there have be enough of shed for last twenty year in england without two brother knight betaking to sword against other sound thrashing must have done of harm if have fallen to lot to get largest share of might have done good think be sure of appointment one of others said have be so frequently in trouble here that be likely that official report be always sent home to grand prior when knight return to england will be so unfavourable that even most powerful influence will fail to obtain post if so may have back here again especially if turk carry out threat of assailing for appeal will be made to grand prior for knight to aid in defence that evening gervaise went again to palace to receive final instruction craft in be to travel be egyptian trader a at present war have not be formally declared between sultan peaceful trader a know carry on avocation unmolested either by warship of turk by ours enter port without special permit crew be never allowed to land in order that detailed account of fortification may be taken to sultan moreover brawl might arise between native population might aid slave to escape however will be altogether safe from interference from turkish war vessel if overhauled by one of safe conduct will be sufficient to prevent interference with be not so with pirate will plunder own countryman a readily a will christian safe guard of governor of syria will be of use to in consists danger of mission can not send one of war galley on errand if there be not enough knight on board to beat off pirate fewer there be better hear that craft be fast sailor a crew will be a anxious to avoid pirate a will do best to escape leave to to take route can either sail hence direct for acre can coast along shore of anatolia syria lying up at night in bay must be overtaken think must be of use for to disguise for of crew must be sure to denounce must worst happen be captured by pirate will of course in first place show safe conduct if find that return will send at once to governor of syria complaining of capture when furnished with safeguard requesting to order search for to be made at port on coast with instruction that be to be at once released sent to for return hither placed on board craft bound for christian port while on part will endeavour to acquaint turkish authority with fact that have be seized while travelling with safe conduct from governor of syria more than from effort on part mine rely upon suleiman ali who will be sure a soon a be set on shore lose time in acquainting pasha of capture in calling upon to interfere in favour in case worst must befall must be temporary detention unless indeed pirate must take to egypt a country be friendly with at present since egypt dread ever increasing power of turk will be question of ransom for have secret agent there who will inform without delay of arrival of christian captive understand sir will do best in matter if be captured trust that opportunity of escape will soon present for must if taken conceal from captor fact that understand language must thus if must evade guard have chance of escaping a in native dress must meet converse with hunting for without having suspicion of being white slave for whom be in search once at acre will be safe land unless be absolutely necessary for might fall victim to fanaticism of inhabitant knight have ever set foot on shore there since ill fated day when moslem wrested from bathed ruined wall with best blood of order templar destroyed last hope of ever recovering holy sepulchre next morning at daybreak gervaise suleiman ali went on board egyptian trader sailed for acre current of opinion have changed at auberge when knight came to think over mission on gervaise be about to start slight feeling of jealousy with younger knight have received news be entirely dissipated while did not seem to that there be chance of distinguishing perceived a thought over considerable danger there be of capture by pirate ralph of companion came down to mole to see off with feeling in envy bore part see now gervaise that be truly holiday excursion on be starting must envy greatly be going in command of armed galley prepared to beat off craft might try to overhaul going alone a be be very different thing must pirate meet must offer resistance position must be perilous one indeed however think be born to good luck be confident that patron saint will look after therefore expect to see back here in fortnight time at outside hope so with heart ralph will be fault of mine if tarry will keep open sea skirt land tresham one of others asked will keep open sea grand master left to choose course think there be more danger by coast where pirate may be hiding in unfrequented bay in readiness to pounce upon passing craft than in open sea where must have at least advantage that must not be taken by surprise might make race of sun will be up in few minute order be to set out at sunrise so must say goodbye at once a soon a vessel be under way gervaise took seat on poop by side of suleiman ali related to conversation have have with grand master risk that will run have not escaped turk said indeed now regret that be chosen a escort almost wish that son have not purchased freedom at present time since involves risk of losing yours there be doubt that sea swarm with pirate sultan be too busy with own struggle for empire to bestow attention upon so small matter pasha officer of port have not power even have will to put down piracy in district indeed be a often a not participators in spoil order year back scoured sea so hotly that piracy well nigh ceased have now for forty year be obliged to turn attention chiefly to own defence posse comparatively small fleet of galley wealth be expended on fortress what with egypt sultan hand be too full for to act a police of sea consequence be that from port bay inlet pirate craft set out mere rowboat like under command of hassan ali veritable fleet thus humblest coaster largest merchant craft go alike in fear of must that sultan egypt order must for two three year put aside difference confine effort to sweeping sea of pest to storming stronghold to inflicting such punishment upon a for very long time to come peaceful merchant might carry on trade without fear heard tell captain that be to steer straight for acre think be right in avoiding coast where most harmless looking fishing boat may carry crowd of pirate hidden in hold at same time if will take advice will head much more to south so a to be out of regular track of ship making from constantinople island to acre may meet pirate anywhere be assuredly thicker along more frequented route safest plan of must probably be to bear south strike egyptian coast well to east of mouth of nile thence till get to palestine country be utterly barren uninhabited while running up coast to palestine there be save at jaffa port to speak of until arrive at acre besides inhabitant there even if pirate must not venture to disregard pasha safe conduct by mean say that course must be absolutely safe may meet with vessel on way south doubtless of cruise off barren coast speak of to intercept trader to from egypt acre other syrian port for trade carried on be considerable although of same religion turk be disposed to view egyptian a enemy rather than a friend must have even le hesitation in plundering than in robbing own countryman think that suggestion be good one will follow at rate course be good deal longer be comparatively of little moment great thing be to carry safely to acre to get back with equal safety suleiman said with smile be quite a important in eye in fact of two must far rather that be captured on voyage thither for in case might be able to arrange for ransom of of chapter viii evening at rhodes suleiman ali advice be carried out added considerably to length of voyage saw only one doubtful craft be lying close inshore under shadow of sand hill did not see until hoisted sail shot out from land be however three mile distant from land at time wind be blowing from north consequently pirate be dead to leeward sail be set at once on board trader being fast sailor maintained position until wind then dropped just a light faded must see that vessel behind have put out sweep trader kept up sail until certain that must be no longer seen then canvas be lowered crew took to boat towed due north night be fortunately dark one watching anxiously from deck of trader be unable to discern pursuer a passed behind a soon a be well assured that must have gone on boat be got in sail hoisted again taking advantage of light flaw of wind proceeded on course in morning sail of galley must be seen on horizon distance be too great for to take up pursuit again with chance of success trader continued course to acre without seeing more of a soon a trader entered port egyptian captain went on shore taking with copy of safe conduct letter from grand master to pasha going to residence of governor handed to saying that have on board aga suleiman ali knight who be charged to deliver up on payment of ransom have be expecting governor said have received letter from pasha stating that have written to grand master respecting ransom of aga sending amount suleiman son have offered young man be not of age when father be captured be so now be therefore able to raise sum required will go down to port with hand over ransom welcome suleiman whom know well back from captivity transfer be speedily made heavy purse be handed to gervaise suleiman be free man send word if can when return to rhodes latter said a bade farewell to young knight will be anxious until hear fortune be with a sailed may desert on return must aught befall tell captor that if bring to will pay ransom that must in fairness require must refuse to do send if possible messenger to on receipt of message will send trusty man to purchase freedom have treated a friend equal friend will always remain vessel be to remain four day in port to discharge cargo take in suleiman have talked of remaining at acre until sailed gervaise protested strongly against have family from whom have be so long separated awaiting return with anxiety pray to make stay on account be well content to remain on board here to look at city have so often be theatre of great deed richard lion heart captured so many of hospitallers died to defend be charged by grand master not to land indeed feel that must be act of folly to do so there be doubtless many on shore who have relative friend now working a slave among of might well seek to avenge by slaying one of order feel kindness must be pain to to know that be lingering here on account when must be longing to embrace child four day passed rapidly gervaise have at suggestion of governor laid aside mantle insignia of order if do so said must place strong guard of soldier on board in order to ensure that pasha safeguard be not violated sailor be turbulent race be recognised here might make tumult slay before word of what be going on reached in case will place two soldier on board until leave port on morning of fifth day sail be got up vessel sailed out from port fortune again favoured reached rhodes without adventure gervaise went at once to palace handed over purse of gold to treasurer then sent up name to grand master be immediately conducted to room be glad to see back tresham have be uneasy about have fulfilled mission without adventure without adventure sir save that be once chased by pirate on way east escaped in darkness save for that voyage have be wholly uneventful have received ransom handed purse to treasurer be glad that first command have turned out so well will see that lack employment fact that be able to act a interpreter will ensure welcome on galley at present however be not intention to send out many cruiser life now be precious amount of spoil can be brought in will counter balance loss of who fall however may find mission on can be employed know that love active life a for nine month have put rein on inclination have devoted wholly to study so that might be of greater use to order have good right to employment in knowledge can be utilised on arrival at auberge gervaise be very heartily greeted by younger knight told be born lucky gervaise ralph harcourt said there have be more than one wager made that must be captured for part be confident that good fortune must not desert still though not surprised be delighted to see again now tell about voyage gervaise gave brief account of adventure with pirate then described visit of governor to ship did say anything to be courteous solemn just sort of man must fancy turkish governor must be looked little surprised when accosted in turkish asked question at time though daresay inquired afterwards of suleiman how came to speak language only time actually said anything be when requested must not wear mantle of order while in port a sailor be turbulent race might lead to attack upon a be responsible to pasha that safe conduct must be respected must be necessary if declined to follow advice to keep strong body of soldier on board a must have be horrible nuisance especially a wanted to enjoy in quiet view of city with castle wall acceded at once to request seemed to reasonable one did send two soldier on board remained down in waist did not interfere with pleasure in way next to jerusalem how must like to see acre ralph harcourt exclaimed be of other city most closely connected with order helped to win be last to defend have heard so much about fortress have be so often described to that know situation of bastion at least a be when left though know not what change turk may since have made know not ralph of course only saw seafront be upon land side that attack be made know that breach be repaired long ago be said that place be stronger than ever from port be solid massive be indeed grand stately fortress here have done be possible to make rhodes impregnable nature did nothing for there nature have done everything castle look a if must defy assault of army however large indeed be not wrested from by force knight when city wall be stormed town filled with foe fought way down to water edge embarked there for be reduced to mere handful however strong castle may be need hand to defend still well nigh moved to tear to see turkish banner waving over to think how many ten of thousand of christian soldier have died in effort to retain holy place have died in vain wonder whether turk will ever be forced to relinquish hold of holy place who can tell sir giles bailiff who have come up to group unobserved said quietly certainly not in time not until moslem power threatens not only europe have crumbled to dust so long a acre remains in power there be hope say not that by mighty effort of christendom palestine might be wrested from infidel a be wrested before past show that while men nation can be stirred to enthusiasm for time fire doe not last long once again faithful few must be overwhelmed by odds must be brought against while europe looked on impassive if not indifferent knight utmost can be hoped for be that tide of moslem invasion westward may be stayed at present be bulwark a long a standard of order wave over rhodes so long be europe safe by sea foresee that can not last strongest defence stoutest heart bravest of heart can not in long run prevail against overpowering number a at acre may repel assault after assault may cause army after army to betake again to ship a rock be overwhelmed by rising tide so must rhodes succumb at last if left by europe to bear alone brunt of moslem invasion that men can do will do a long a be possible to resist will resist when further resistance becomes impossible will trust act a did before be driven from palestine only to fortify at rhodes if be driven from rhodes will feel assured find home elsewhere again commence labour nearer be to europe more hope there be christendom will aid for will more generally understand that defeat must mean laying open of shore of mediterranean from turkey to gibraltar to invasion of moslem however comrade be in future share be in present trust flag of order will float over rhodes a long at least a lifetime of youngest of that may bequeath duty of upholding cross untarnished to who come after can then leave issue in god hand listened respectfully to word of leader although opinion fell like cold water upon fiery zeal high hope of hearer possibility of losing rhodes have never once entered into mind of majority of be likely that ere long might be called upon to stand siege acquainted a be with strength of place deep seemingly impassable moat massive wall protecting tower bastion have seemed to that rhodes be capable of withstanding assault however numerous foe however oft repeated invasion bailiff be a knew man of dauntless courage of wide experience great judgment that must believe that rhodes must although not in time inevitably fall brought home to for first time fact that fortress be outpost of europe one placed so distant from christendom in hour of peril might be unable to furnish with aid a bailiff walked away there be silence for short time then sir giles trevor said cheerfully well if last time need not trouble head a to what will take place afterwards a bailiff say duty be with present a mean to drive turk back when come see that there be occasion for to take to heart even if be fated that moslem will one day walk over tomb if christendom chooses to be supine let christendom suffer say at rate be not going to weep for what may take place after be turned into dust sound very well sir giles ralph harcourt said have argument to advance against though be sure there be much to be said if bailiff chaplain indeed of elder have heard say so have doubt must have have fitting reply sir giles tossed head mockingly will fight neither better worse friend harcourt because may be that moslem be a bailiff seems to think destined to lord here have only promised vowed to do best against moslem vow only hold good a long a be in flesh beyond have concern what be staying here for wasting time be hour for of who be going to be starting for ball given by signor succhi a be one of richest merchant in town will be gay one there be lack of fair face in rhodes be grievous pity that elder set will against even younger member of community joining in dance be not one of thing swore to give up however here in rhodes there be flying in face of rule three four of other young knight be also going what be thinking of doing gervaise harcourt asked have nothing particular to do ralph except first of must write letter to suleiman ali hand to bailiff praying to send off by first vessel may put in here on way to acre if do now may be neglected promised to write directly got here will not be hour after will be ready to do anything like in le than time indeed rejoined ralph now what will do with do say to stroll through street be never tired of like better to go by way of roof gervaise street be badly lit although be busy enough in quarter be so narrow that one get jostled pushed on terrace everything be quiet have plenty of light music be pleasant to see family sitting together enjoying if one be disposed for cup of wine of cool sherbet be delighted to give for be pleased when one of join group have quite number of acquaintance have made in way while have be working away at turkish very well gervaise said if such be fancy ralph let take one of path across roof might walk there twenty year by without making acquaintance pledge to join in intimacy of yours however will be quite content to amuse by looking on at scene in general while be paying visit drinking sherbet there be plenty of fair girl among rhodians ralph said with smile though be pledged to celibacy be in way bound to abstain from admiration gervaise laughed admire a much a like ralph expect to do so have scarcely a much a spoken to woman since entered house in london must have idea what to say to young girl be part of education of true knight to be courteous to woman be one of great duty of chivalry must remember that be secular knight a well knight of order work of order be quite sufficient for at present ralph in time may come to like society of woman to admire beauty possibly even to wear colour of one for seems to be fashion though why who be bound to celibacy must admire one woman more than can not understand have by time descended from castle be taking way along one of broad path led over flat roof of house by mean of bridge thrown across street be acquaintance of mine ralph said stopping at one of wall three foot high bordered path beyond be enclosure of fifty foot square clump of shrub flower surrounded by stonework eight ten inch high enclosing earth in grew be scattered here there lamp be hung to cord stretched above while others be arranged among flower in centre large carpet be spread on eight ten person be seated on cushion girl be playing lute singing to accompaniment stopped abruptly when eye fell upon figure of two young knight there be sir ralph harcourt father exclaimed in italian be language most used on island spoken with more le fluency by knight among whom served a general medium of communication be waiting to be invited in sir knight went on saucily thought that by time must know be welcome tongue run too fast child father said a rose walked across to ralph be welcome sir ralph very welcome pray enter join will do so with pleasure signor vrados if will also extend hospitality to friend sir gervaise tresham most gladly merchant said pray to enter two knight passed through gate in wall rose to foot a went up to carpet greeted ralph with warmth showed that be favourite introduced gervaise to wonder that know face sir knight merchant wife said thought knew knight of order by sight from seeing at public ceremony observing pas in street for last nine month sir gervaise have be anchorite have be learning turkish have so devoted to study even have scarce caught sight of save at meal a for walking in street be last thing must think of doing consider good conscientious young knight be a nothing in respect to friend used to look upon a little brother for be at house of order in london together be four year younger than be know four year between boy make immense difference now table be turned quite look up to will believe a much a like signora of what sir ralph say gervaise laughed a have say known for time must by time have learnt that word be not to be taken literally learned that quite early in acquaintance girl who have first noticed said with affectation of gravity always tell can not believe anything say be grateful to sir knight for having thus borne evidence to quickness of perception by time servant have brought more cushion on ralph gervaise seated wine sherbet cake be then handed round master of house placed gervaise on right hand a stranger have be among island sir gervaise indeed need not ask that since know that sir ralph be knighted together for valour in affair with ship of hassan ali come from lesbos be now eighty year since family settled in rhodes have seen grow from small place to great fortress 't be wonderful place gervaise said know nothing of fortress of europe seems to that other can well be stronger than be among place with natural advantage knight have always have abundance of slave merchant said so many that have not only have sufficient for work here have be able to sell number to european potentate yes rhodes be wonderfully strong that great fosse must seem a if must defy effort of army to cross yet past have shown that even strongest defence held with greatest bravery can be carried by general with immense army careless how sacrifice so that do succeed look at acre for example be looking at five day ago gervaise said thinking that be beyond might of man to take do mean that be at acre merchant asked with surprise yes went there to hand over captive who have be ransomed of course have safe conduct be glad indeed of opportunity of seeing so famous fortress be fortunate indeed sir knight be if will pardon saying so singular that so young knight must have be chosen assuredly even senior knight of order must rejoice at opportunity of beholding fortress so intimately connected with past history of order be due entirely to being able to speak turkish gervaise said a friend sir ralph be mentioning have be studying hard can now speak language fluently a be necessity on mission few knight who can so speak be in high office must hardly be asked to undertake so unimportant service be selected really speak turkish well be accomplishment that few save greek subject to turkey posse do intend may ask to make rhodes home ask because suppose must not have taken labour have intended shortly to return to england yes hope to remain here permanently know that first step towards promotion here be generally commandery at home did not enter order with idea of gaining office dignity desire simply to be knight of cross to spend life in doing faithful service to order worthy ambition indeed one so far a experience go very few knight entertain see yearly score of young knight depart small proportion of whom never place foot on rhodes again although doubtless many of will hasten back again a soon a danger of assault from turk becomes imminent see who dwell here under protection of order naturally talk over thing among ourselves although in matter of fortification will admit that enormous effort have be made to render town secure be clear that in matter of knight to defend there be very much left to be desired be very well to say that knight from part of europe must flock hither to defend journey must be long one must occupy much time must probably not receive news that turk have sailed until place be already invested then must be difficult if not altogether impossible for ship with reinforcement to make way through turkish fleet to enter port to man wall properly must need force five time a numerous a be now here recognise valour of knight have accomplished wonder even can not accomplish impossibility for time must hold wall a number became reduced by fire of turkish cannon battle at breach must at last be too weak longer to repel onslaught of foe with almost unlimited supply of soldier be true enough gervaise admitted to mind be shocking that four fifth at least of order pledged to oppose infidel must be occupied with inglorious work of looking after manor estate of society throughout europe while one fifth at most be here performing duty to be sworn of revenue of estate mere fraction find way hither still trust that greater part of knight will hasten here a soon a danger becomes imminent without waiting for news that turkish armament have actually set forth for hour two young knight remained on roof gervaise talking quietly with merchant while companion laughed chatted with lady friend of host after have left with promise that must not be long before repeated visit ralph bantered gervaise on preferring society of merchant to of daughter found pleasant very well informed man ralph enjoyed talk with just a enjoyed talking nonsense to daughter listening to song who be man sitting next to eldest daughter doe belong to rhodes be greek from one of island though did not catch from know whether be relative of family business connection of merchant stranger who have brought letter of introduction to nothing be said on head why do ask like man face be handsome fellow have crafty expression did not say much seemed to that at time when appeared to be sitting carelessly sipping sherbet be really trying to listen to what vrados be saying to must not do so for be on other side of circle be speaking in somewhat low tone while rest of be chatting laughing what must want to listen for most sapient knight ca tell ralph be certain that be trying to listen well a be doubt talking more sensibly than most of ralph laughed certainly showed discernment daresay be wrong gervaise said quietly know have spy at constantinople probably sultan have spy here idea occurred to that perhaps man might be one of well be bound to say gervaise ralph said little irritably have never heard so grave accusation brought on such insufficient evidence rather a far a can see without shadow of evidence of kind drop in upon man who be one of most respected merchant whose family have be established here many year whose interest must be same a of order because guest of doe not care to take active part in joking with girl because imagine that there be cunning expression on face must straightway take into head that must be spy excuse ralph simply said that idea occurred to that might be spy be very different thing to accusing of being one be ready to admit that chance be infinitely greater that be honest trader relation of merchant that presence here be perfectly legitimate natural than that must be spy still there be chance if be one out of thousand that may be latter think that be at of suspicious nature really must like to learn little about man mean that be going to try to do so must be unworthy action to pry into business when be concern of one own still must like to know why be here ralph shrugged shoulder come of living life of hermit gervaise other people meet talk enjoy what society there be in city without troubling head for moment a to where people come from what business be here still le whether be spy such idea so much a occur to must say that think sooner fall into way of other people better there be harm done gervaise said composedly be not thinking of asking bailiff to order to be arrested on suspicion only remarked that did not like man face way in while pretended to be thinking of nothing be trying to overhear what be saying be quite willing to admit have made mistake not in devoting to turkish in going to merchant with evening have have experience whatever of what call society so far from giving pleasure to talk to stranger especially to woman seems to that such talk be annoying to at rate at present when get to age possibly idea may change for moment wish to judge others apparently enjoy be distraction from serious work say simply that be amusement understand must remember that entered order in consequence of solemn vow of dead father regard profession make a very serious one that present intention be to devote life entirely to order to active fulfilment of vow be right gervaise ralph said good temperedly only think must be pity if be to turn out fanatic jerusalem palestine be lost admit that there be really very little chance of ever regaining duty therefore be changed be now army of knight pledged to war against infidel in same way a knight noble at home be ever ready to engage in war with france vow of poverty be long since obsolete many of chief official be men of great wealth indeed grand master bailiff of langue be expected to spend doe spend sum vastly exceeding allowance from order great body of knight be equally lax a to of other vow carry to length that a know have caused grave scandal see not that be in way incumbent on to give up pleasure of life be military order be ready to fight in defence of rhodes a in bygone day be ready to fight in defence of holy sepulchre king great noble have endowed with large number of estate in order to maintain a army against islam a such do duty to affect asceticism be out of date ridiculous have certainly no wish to be ascetic ralph must have objection to hold estate if have to hold think at present with great danger hanging over must be better if in first place be to spend le time in idleness amusement to devote energy to cause mean not only by fighting when time come for fighting by endeavouring in way to ward off danger when see danger will do best to ward off gervaise can not go about with nose in air snuffing danger like hunting dog in pursuit of game at rate will not bother to accompany on visit in future chapter ix with galley slave gervaise on consideration be obliged to own to that ralph be right in saying that have ground whatever for suspicion against greek have met at signor vrados must see mean of following matter up must not felt be honourable to go again to merchant house to avail of hospitality while watching guest determined to dismiss matter from mind have indeed altogether done so when week later suddenly recurred to memory party of slave under escort of overseer in charge of knight who have be with at work on fortification be passing along street on way back to barrack be already dusk a gervaise be going same way a be stood aside in doorway to let pas be on point of stepping out to follow when saw man who have be standing in shadow of wall fall in with rank a walked engaged in earnest conversation with one of slave kept beside for hundred yard so then passed something into slave hand turned abruptly down side opening there be few people about in growing darkness action of man passed unobserved by overseer gervaise thinking occurrence strange one turned down same lane a man slackened pace until latter be fifty yard ahead so that must not have looked round have be able to perceive that be knight who be behind after passing through several street man turned into refreshment house door stood open a place be brightly lit up gervaise pausing outside be able to see what be going on inside man have followed be on point of seating at one of table a did so gervaise recognised a greek have met at merchant house at once walked on short distance then paused to think vague suspicion have before entertained a to man now recurred with double force be certainly in communication with one more of slave such communication so secretly effected must be for good purpose so far however there be nothing must tax man with must probably deny altogether that have spoken to of slave gervaise must not point out one have conversed with at rate nothing must be done now required time to think what step must take to follow up matter resolved however to wait follow greek when came out after few minute again repassed door saw that man be engaged in earnest conversation with after considering for time gervaise thought that must be best for to follow other man when left ascertain who be rather than to keep watch on movement of greek who a likely a not must now return to merchant walked several time up down street until at last saw two men issue out together stopped for moment outside then after exchanging few word separated greek going in direction of quarter in lay house of vrados while other walked towards gervaise latter passed carelessly when man have gone nearly to end of street turned followed must see at once that be lay brother of order class consisted of men of inferior social position to knight filled many of minor office be not eligible for promotion following for ten minute gervaise saw approach one of barrack prison occupied by slave knocked at door upon being opened at once entered matter have now assumed much more serious aspect young greek stranger to rhodes be in communication not only with of slave with prison official matter appeared so grave to gervaise after deliberation thought be too important for to endeavour to follow out alone that be necessary to lay before bailiff accordingly after evening meal went up to sir john kendall asked if must confer with alone on matter over be somewhat troubled bailiff assented at once gervaise followed to private apartment now what be matter sir gervaise asked pleasantly nothing serious trust know sir john be matter for consideration seems to of such importance that ought to be brought to knowledge face of bailiff grew more grave seating in chair motioned to gervaise to do same now let hear what be said gervaise told story simply slight smile passed across bailiff face a mentioned that have met greek on roof of house of signor vrados have not liked expression of face vrados have fair daughter have not asked yes sir know little of be only visit that ever paid there indeed to house of one in town sir john face grew grave again a gervaise recounted how have seen man enter into communication with slave frowned heavily when heard of meeting afterwards with one of prison officer in truth sir gervaise said after pause seems to be right serious matter have done wisely in informing of what have seen assuredly there be mischief of sort in wind question be how to get to bottom of of course grand master might order arrest of greek of prison officer may be sure that must commit unless torture be applied for one have belief in what man say under such circumstance most honest man may own traitor when racked with torture may denounce innocent men be at best clumsy device what think of matter have hardly thought over yet sir john certainly plan have yet occurred to well think over sir gervaise be not likely that few day will make difference will take measure to see that greek doe not sail away from island at present will speak to port master about will myself give matter consideration a have shown so quick witted in following up matter so far rely upon more than to carry farther there may possibly be simple explanation of matter may come from island where turk be master have perhaps brought message from relative of slave a to talk with prison officer may be wholly innocent if must find that be so will keep matter to ourselves if possible will get finely laughed at by comrade for having run upon false scent if on other hand matter must turn out to be serious will assuredly get great credit for having discovered therefore turn over in mind tonight see if can arrive at scheme for seeing further into before take step in morning gervaise again called upon sir john kendall well sir gervaise hope that have hit upon scheme for getting to bottom of matter confess though have have sleepless night over have not be able to see method of getting to root of affair save by application of torture know whether plan have thought of will commend to opinion sir have worked out scheme will think enable to get to bottom of matter believe that galley be expected back from cruise today tomorrow now sir idea be must go on board small craft under command of knight upon whose discretion silence can rely such a for example sir john boswell that must intercept galley before board must disguise a turkish slave a such sir john must hand over to officer in command of galley giving letter of private instruction from a to disposal if have other slave on board must ask must be kept apart from a well a from rower of galley on being landed must be sent to prison where saw officer enter last night slave rower must be distributed among other prison thus then slave must be placed with must only know have arrived in galley with other slave captured by have doubt must be able to maintain assumed character must in short time be taken into confidence of others must learn what be going on must be well of course that none of official of prison must be informed a to true character for others besides one saw may have be bribed to participate in plot be going on do mean to say sir gervaise that knight of order be willing to submit to indignity of being treated a slave to keep up disguise long enough to be taken into confidence of plotter might have to stay there for time if prison official believe to be ordinary slave will be put to work either on wall in one of galley be ready to do anything for benefit of order safety of rhodes will meet with approval gervaise replied will doubt be unpleasant did not enter order to do pleasant thing to perform certain duty duty necessarily involve certain amount of sacrifice do think must be able to maintain character because must remember that if detected might be torn in piece by slave before officer must interfere to protect feel sure can do so sir john what story must tell must say that have come from syria sailed from acre in trader be perfectly true also be taken off ship be on by galley must not be altogether false a crossed one a landed think there must be very little questioning for must pretend to be in state of sullen despair give such short answer to question must soon be left alone scheme be good one sir gervaise though full of danger difficulty if be ready to render great service to order willingly accept sacrifice offer to make will send one of slave down into town to buy garment suitable for also stain for skin will of course be necessary for to shave portion of head in turkish fashion will also see sir john boswell ask to arrange for craft to be ready to start at noon galley be not expected in until evening of course may arrive at moment now come here again in hour time will have clothes ready for may suggest sir that must be appropriate to small merchant might seem to account for not being placed with other slave who may be on board galley a must be supposed be set apart in order must be sent to one of auberge a servant afterwards being herded with others must be explained by being found that there be opening for in capacity must think there must be difficulty in obtaining suit a garment of kind be brought here in prize be bought up by of greek merchant who afterwards find opportunity of despatching by craft trading among island just before noon gervaise walked down to port with sir john boswell servant following with bundle seems to hare brained scheme lad sir john who have just joined said a issued from auberge though own from what bailiff tell that there must be treacherous plot on hand when be case be necessary that must be probed to bottom for knight to go in disguise of infidel slave seems to to be beyond bound if one be ready to give one life for order sir john surely one need not mind few week inconvenience will at rate be worse off than be when serving a turkish slave well know that will sir john replied doubtfully be from necessity not from choice be moreover accident be exposed to be surely better to do thing of one own free will than because one be forced to do sir john knight be silent be stout fighting man unused to argument well said after long pause can only hope that will turn out right promise if be strangled in prison will see that slave who have hand in will be strung up have told kendall frankly that if be in place must not permit to try venture however a must think of other plan by there must be chance of getting to bottom of matter word have effect with must not have so much cared if officer of gaol knew who be can see that if there be treachery at work must defeat object altogether what do suppose rascal greek can be intending can not say sir john may be trying to get exact plan of fortification may be arranging plan of communication by in case of siege news of condition of state of defence may be conveyed to turkish commander by time have reached port embarked at once on trading vessel belonging to one of merchant from whom sir john have readily obtained use for day two sail be

appearance go must take anywhere for young turk clothes be not too new be in accordance with tale be going to tell be that be son of syrian trader if a suleiman say speak turkish well enough to pose a native think ought to be able to pas muster how long will dye last because if begin to fade will soon suspect will last fortnight at least so sir john kendall say have arranged that if at end of ten day have not succeeded in finding out anything will send down to prison under pretence that want to ask question about what ransom father must be likely to pay for will have up to auberge there can dye afresh how be to communicate with in case of need servant ahmet who got thing for be to come down morning to be near door of prison at hour when slave be taken out to work if have aught to communicate be to nod twice sir john kendall will send down evening to fetch instead of waiting until be time for to renew dye what be going to be said to harcourt others to account for absence bailiff will merely say that have suddenly sent away by ship on private mission may wonder perhaps none of will venture to ask nature well must say that seem to have made arrangement carefully tresham hope will turn out well be against scheme at first own that see now why must not succeed if there be plot really on hand may be able to get to bottom of be hour after darkness have completely fallen when regular beat of oar be heard ship boat be already in water gervaise wrapped up in mantle followed sir john out of cabin descended with into boat be at once rowed towards approaching galley sir

must not be charged to intercept on errand of course understand anything about sir john will do a ask went to where gervaise have crouched down by bulwark beckoned to follow walking aft motioned to to sit down there then returned to sir john joined other knight who be too anxious to learn latest news who have left island who have come to since sailed to interest in way with figure who have gone aft

sailor who be too old to be made useful for hard work further question be asked men seemed to have interest save in own misery gervaise soon left sitting down in shady corner presently dropped off to sleep in evening came in from various work officer man who have brought gervaise in went up to overseer of galley slave informed that have told off new slave pointing to gervaise to gang be brought in by galley arrived last night said be only slave sent up here hear that have be set aside to be appointed servitor there be vacancy so sent here till one must occur be ordered to make useful in other

active though at present look sulky enough under bad fortune few of slave spoke to gervaise a be waiting for food to be brought majority dropped upon rush too exhausted with toil heat to feel interest in anything food consisted of rye bread with thin broth brought in great iron vessel slave have horn be used for soup water when done with have by rule enforced among to take out to fountain in courtyard wash before be added to pile in corner of room cool of evening aided meal in restoring energy of slave several gathered round gervaise asked question a to what knew of prospect of early invasion of rhodes a soon a officer left room closing locking door after slave became for most part silent few men sat in group together talking in undertone greater number threw down on rush to sleep to think alone gervaise be struck by manner in most of lay without making slightest movement so long a there be light to enable to make out figure addressed two three of a lay with eye wide open asking question with reference to work in case did receive reply men seemed altogether unconscious of being addressed being absorbed in thought of far distant home family might never see again gervaise walked few time up down room a approached silence fell time upon group of men talking together more than once figure rose soon afterwards from ground a came along again asked few question about a soon a be dark lay down in vacant space on rush shortly afterwards talking ceased altogether there be quiet in vaulted room with first gleam of daylight be astir when door be opened poured out into courtyard where have wash at fountain hour later meal precisely similar to of previous evening be served out then overseer called over muster roll gang be made up under officer started for work gervaise with men of room proceeded down to port at once took seat on bench of galley one foot being chained to ring in deck other to of companion at oar slave be more cheerful now a there be work to do at present be allowed to talk occasional laugh be heard for sun brightness of day cheered many after year of captivity have grown altogether reckless be among that there be most talking younger men seemed for most part silent moody will get accustomed to man next to gervaise said cheeringly when first came here seemed to must not support life for month that fate be too dreadful to be borne death must be most welcome like rest became accustomed to in time after work be harder than one must do at home there be stint of food be worse than one must have be one labouring in field be not for loss of love must be nothing in time one get over even have long ago told that if be not dead at least be dead to have living to get can not be always mourning have tried to forget a must have forgotten do work hard gervaise asked who be in galley be regarded by others with envy sometimes often indeed have naught to do day bask in sun talk sleep forget that be slave generally go out for hour two exercise be well enough keep strong in health only when be away on voyage be work hard sometimes row from morning to night be only when be in chase of craft that have really to exert greatly then be terrible may be doing best very best yet to impatient knight seems that might do more then shout to overseer lay whip on back without mercy then row until sometimes drop senseless off bench understand be not very often though work on cruise be long be not beyond strength besides when be away in galley there be always hope galley may meet with four five of ship be captured storm may arise dash upon shore though many must lose life might escape man in thinking of belief that will be one of fortunate one take advice always look cheerful if can always put hand on oar when order be given row a if be glad to be at work again always make show a if be working hardest never complain when be struck unjustly always speak respectfully to overseer in way will find life much easier than must think will be chosen for small boat service be great thing a be not chained in small boat men be foolish obstinate so far from doing good only brings trouble on come in for punishment daily be closely watched life made hell for even a help to escape pay best to be cheerful alert think of escape know though be seldom indeed that chance ever come to of be one thing except death to look forward to there be not man among who doe not think of score of time day small a chance be be greatest for who behave best for instance be only who man small boat when small boat row ashore be always possible that guard may be careless that will keep boat at landing place instead of pushing off at once into deep water a ought to do that in way chance will sooner later come for springing ashore making dash for liberty chapter x plot discovered conversation between gervaise fellow slave be interrupted by arrival at side of quay of party of knight silence instantly fell upon slave straightened up to oar prepared for start among knight who took place on poop gervaise saw with amusement friend ralph have fear of recognition for darkly stained skin black hair have so completely altered that when have looked at in mirror after application of dye be surprised to find that must not have known to be own face ralph be in command of party consisted of young knight who have recently arrived at rhodes a be first time have be appointed a instructor gervaise saw that be greatly pleased at what rightly regarded a promotion galley at once pushed off from wharf rowed out of port work be hard a slave be not pressed to extraordinary exertion gervaise did not find excessive congratulated however that stain be a have be assured indelible save by time for after few minute exercise be bathed in perspiration a galley have be taken out only that instruction might be given to young knight work be frequently broken sometimes went ahead at full speed for few hundred yard a if to chase adversary then must swerve aside slave on one side rowing while on other backed so a to make rapid turn then lay for minute two immovable then backed water turned to avoid attack of imaginary foe then for hour lay quiet while knight divesting of mantle armour worked one of gun on poop aiming at floating barrel moored for purpose mile out at sea at eleven o'clock returned to port bread water be served out to slave be then permitted to lie down sleep galley being moored under shadow of wall at four o'clock party of knight came down work be similar to have be performed in morning at seven o'clock slave be taken back to barrack well what do think of work one of slave asked gervaise a ate evening meal must not be so bad if be like can tell that when have to row from sunrise to sunset with perhaps one two pause for few minute be different thing altogether especially if galley be carrying despatch speed be necessary then get so worn out exhausted that can scarce move oar through water until be wakened up by smart a if red hot iron have be laid across shoulder be terrible work then whip crack minute across one back be blinded by exhaustion rage feel that must give world if must burst chain rush on taskmaster strike if only one blow before be killed must be terrible gervaise said do never get loose fall upon man shook head chain be too strong watch too vigilant said since came here have heard tale of crew having freed in night fallen upon christian for part believe in have thought a suppose one of have thought how such thing must be done a far a know one have hit on plan yet now then men have managed to become possessed of file have by long patient work sawn through chain have when galley have be lying near own shore sprung overboard escaped for attempt succeeds there must be twenty failure for chain be frequently examined woe be to man who be found to have be tampering with a to whole gang getting free at once be altogether impossible unless key of pad lock must be stolen from overseer man bribed into aiding that suppose be impossible gervaise said certainly impossible for who have money to bribe with easy enough if one outside with ample mean be to set about overseer be many of son of turkish mother have sympathy save caused by interest with one parent more than of course be brought up christian taught to hold moslem in abhorrence think many of if have free choice must cross to mainland here have chance of ever being aught what be overseer of slave small prison official be despised by haughty knight hated by while be to reach mainland adopt mother religion everything must be open to follower of prophet have equal chance one may be soldier today bey tomorrow pasha year hence if be brave astute capable in way beyond fellow men like warder must be sure to make way can not have gathered much during service therefore offer of large sum of money must find plenty among eager to earn see be inferior on voyage on board galley knight inspect fetter twice day key be kept in commander cabin for hour two when be not on long passage padlock be unfastened in order that may jump over bathe exercise limb at time knight be always on guard a be without arm be altogether powerless be same thing here senior warder who belong to order although of inferior grade come round a have seen to examine fetter lock bar door if one two of must be corrupted escape must be easy enough be impossible to do gervaise asked eagerly father have money must know be ready if must communicate with to pay handsome sum if sure that must result in obtaining freedom man nodded significantly there may be other mean of doing said perhaps will not be long before hear of seem stout fellow full of spirit a yet anything may be going on be known to few will go further until time come that may be told think not so badly of men of faith a to believe that one must betray secret for sake of obtaining own freedom big reward secret when known by many be apt to leak out muttered word two in sleep raving of one down with fever might afford ground for suspicion torture must soon do rest know nothing of secret do know that there be something going on if successful will give freedom be content to know more until time come there be few save engaged in matter know a much a can see that be better must be so look at man opposite have be here fifteen year seldom speaks doe work be a brute beast despair have well nigh turned into one think that if such man a be to know that there be hope must not be so changed that even dullest must observe see be brisk young fellow say to keep up courage time be nearer than think when will be free from accursed shackle morning a went out to work with gang gervaise saw servant from auberge standing near made sign be satisfied that suspicion have be justified that be not leading life in vain thought better to wait until week passed be taken away to have colour renewed than to make sign might possibly rouse suspicion of comrade on eighth morning when door of room be unlocked overseer said number will remain here be wanted for other work after gang have left prison overseer returned be to take up to english auberge knight who handed over to when landed told that might be wanted a servitor a be who have sent down may be that vacancy have occurred if so be in luck for servitor have vastly better time of than galley slave english auberge have best reputation in respect come along with english auberge be one of most handsome of building standing in great street of knight architecture be gothic in character although langue be one of smallest of represented at rhodes vied with of in splendour of appointment sir john boswell be standing in interior courtyard wait here for few minute said to overseer bailiff will question slave a to accomplishment fancy will not be considered of sufficient age for post be vacant however if must not be so will doubt find post to fit ere long for seems smart young fellow what be better willing one bear well under misfortune then motioned to gervaise to follow to bailiff apartment well sir gervaise sir john kendall exclaimed a door closed behind have found aught to justify cruel penance have undertaken a to penance sir john have be nothing unsupportable exercise be hard enough none too hard for one in good health strength save for filth of chamber in be shut up at night foul state of rush on lie must have naught to complain of have a yet heard nothing of surety yet enough to show that suspicion be justified that there be plot of sort on foot related to two knight conversation have have with galley slave by st george bailiff said have indeed be justified in surmise be glad that attached sufficient importance to suspicion to let undertake strange enterprise what think sir john boswell think with that sir gervaise have fully justified insistence in matter own considered to be hare brained folly what be to be done next sir gervaise be what have be turning over in mind see may have little warning of what be going to take place may not hear of until be locked up for night affair be on point of taking place will of course be most needful that will be able to communicate with speedily that of course be of vital importance bailiff said how be to be managed be what can not exactly see sir john armed guard remains in room night in first place might be in plot if not slave must almost certainly overpower kill a preliminary to work of knocking off chain be there window to room at least of course there be window be within reach there be six small loophole one on side of door two in of side wall be four inch across three foot in length there be two crossbar to be four foot from floor at rate be large enough for arm to pas through sir gervaise might drop strip of cloth out certainly must sir john must easily hide piece of white cotton yard so long in clothes scanty a be must certainly manage unobserved to drop outside window then rest be for to contrive boswell must have one posted in yard of prison with instruction to go ten minute throughout night to see if strip of white cotton have be dropped out when find must go at once to william neave governor be sturdy englishman there be fear of having be bribed to turn traitor be well to take one into confidence think can not do better than employ ahmet on business a already know that sir gervaise be masquerading there will have william neave up here presently tell that for certain reason wish ahmet to pas night for present in prison arrange with on what excuse can best bestow there without exciting suspicion at rate sir gervaise be affair went to closet took out white mantle tore strip off bottom gave to gervaise must be best not to keep here longer said so renew stain while speak a soon a learn detail of plot will drop out from loophole on right hand side of door be to say one on right standing inside if affair be not to come off at once be best for to proceed a before ahmet will be outside when go out with gang on nodding to will make excuse to take away on return say because if see that affair whatever be be not imminent might think better to remain with longer so a to learn plan more fully instead of having thing put stop to at once understand sir john a have said think must be told until blow be ready to be struck a must be afraid that one might inform against if time opportunity be granted think so too sir gervaise afternoon will call upon grand master for have mean of knowing how serious how extended plot may be may include only crew of single galley on other hand whole of slave may be implicated in be evident therefore that matter be too serious to be kept longer from knowledge three more day passed on third evening after allowance of broth bread have be consumed door be closed locked upon for night three four of galley slave after talking eagerly together beckoned to others to gather round at end of room farthest from door two of took up arm full of bedding stuffed into side window gervaise saw in dim light look of intense excitement on face of slave have be vaguely known among that plot be in hand although few have be admitted into confidence of leader hitherto have feared that concerned only small number preparation now made to insure that must not be overheard showed that plan might be be to share in thanks be to allah powerful one of men began lip be unsealed can tell great news that hour for escape from bondage be at hand need not fear warder there went on a several eye be turned apprehensively towards guard who with spear beside be leaning carelessly against wall at farther end looking through window into courtyard be with must know that for last two month agent from constantinople have be on island have be engaged in arranging affair two of taskmaster belonging to order have be bribed by large sum of money several of overseer who be half of blood have eagerly embraced prospect of returning to mother

crew of galley will embark upon man oar rest will divide among galley before starting will seize set fire to other galley ship in port gang in four of room have be told off specially for duty before firing be to take out such provision a may find transport to galley who take fort be provided with hammer long nail to drive down vent hole of cannon when have done be to wait until one of galley fetch off ten minute must be ample time for there be to be done even if alarm be given at once will be away long before knight can be aroused from sleep buckle on armour get down to port exclamation of delight approbation burst from hearer then be only of prison who be in plot one said yes in first place must have be too dangerous to attempt to free in second galley must not carry will be closely packed a be for there be over thousand here hear that there be talk of freeing that instead of embarking at first must make for other prison burst open door rescue others by time must do so knight must be in arm enterprise must fail altogether for a small proportion of can obtain weapon must not hope to overcome be not for strong wall separate quarter from town might make straight for house slay before alarm must be given a be must be impossible therefore plan will be carried out a have told loss of galley of over one thousand slave will be heavy blow for great pain have be taken to prevent confusion when reach port men in room have be instructed a to galley on be to embark a for know precisely what be to be done will simply take place then wait until be on board galley be to

one of overseer who be in plot walked by side a returned from port gave instruction others will have be told in same way else by guard in charge of gang now broke up into little group talking excitedly over unlooked for news exulting over speedy advent of liberty gervaise strolled carelessly to window dropped out white strip of stuff be now quite dark there be fear of one observing movement then joined others after hour half have passed heard footstep approaching door there be pause then outside bar be taken down key turned in lock deep silence fell on slave then voice called

for will be listening for sound must tell slave have be liberated followed by knight went to door of house occupied by overseer of whom be member of lower branch of order be indeed evident that alarm have be given there for light appeared at window a opened door entered hall several half dressed men rushed down stair with drawn sword two of carrying torch in left hand a light fell upon figure of

be that have document concealed may be of use to grand master then descended to hall member of order said to overseer guilty companion have met death by own hand a others concerned in plot have met theirs by sword of knight be well that matter be not spoken of outside prison attempt have be detected have failed be talked of might incite others to repeat attempt possibly with better success now went on turning to governor work be done here call up other warder let take men now prisoner in room place in dungeon let fresh men be placed on guard let knight gather in courtyard when be done knight again assembled d'aubusson said work be nearly done brother traitor be dead revolt be at end remains to capture author of attempt believe be already in hand have given accurate description of to da veschi who have taken four knight with probably will catch down at port if not will be arrested first thing in morning a to slave will be so utterly cowed by discovery that there will be fear of repeating attempt have ordered official of prison to say naught in town of what have taken place there can however be concealment among will of course lay whole matter before council fact that strong body of knight have at so late hour started on unknown mission be of course already known in auberge of auvergne england concealment of fact be therefore possible be most serious attempt at revolt of slave have ever taken place will be warning to that more vigilance must be exercised a be have only be saved from loss of galley slave by acuteness of one of youngest of knight who in first place noted suspicious occurrence must have be passed by without attracting moment thought by ninety nine out of hundred men laid matter before bailiff sir john kendall who accepted offer to disguise a slave to enter prison under circumstance must excite suspicion among others to live work among in order to ascertain whether there be plot on hand task painful one a may imagine carried out for two week rowed a galley slave lot be a hard a of others for a have reason to believe that of official be concerned in plot be necessary that must be kept in ignorance that be other than seemed to be thanks to perfect knowledge of turkish be able to carry mission through with complete success to obtain full particular of plot have tonight crushed knight who have performed inestimable service be sir gervaise tresham of english langue action have performed will be noted in annals of order a example of intelligence of extreme of self sacrifice a well a of courage for life must have be assuredly forfeited have slave entertained slightest suspicion of real character there be murmur of acclamation among knight not one of must have freely risked life in service of order there be few who must not have shrunk from idea of living a slave among slave sharing task subject to order of men of inferior rank often brutal manner knight now returned to auberge be past midnight at english house lamp flambeau be lighted in great servitor be called up wine placed on table knight discussed incident of evening when meal have concluded sir john kendall said brother knight when grand master bestowed honour of secular knighthood upon young comrade of ours predicted that must rise to high distinction in order think will agree with that prediction be already in fair way of being fulfilled that service have rendered to order justify comrade of english langue in feeling proud of drink brother to health loud shout rose from assembled knight for upon return of party who have be away rest of at auberge have hastily robed descended to hall to gather news when shout have died away wine cup be emptied gervaise who be sitting on sir john kendall right hand must gladly have retained seat bailiff told that must say few word after standing in embarrassed silence for minute said sir john kendall brother knight can only say that be very sensible of kindness with have be pleased to regard what seems to after to have be very ordinary affair saw man whom knew to be stranger in island speaking surreptitiously to slave afterwards saw conversing with prison officer naturally struck a curious followed officer to see to prison belonged one must have thought a did that thing be strange if not suspicious only way to find out whether there be anything in be to mix with slave a spoke turkish well enough to do so asked sir john kendall permission to disguise gave assistance shared lot for fortnight there be very great hardship in certainly nothing to merit praise sir john kendall have be kind enough to bestow on nevertheless be very glad to have gained good opinion very grateful to to for drinking to health then sat down abruptly sir john kendall now rose knight following example betook to dormitory next morning notice be sent by grand master to bailiff of auberge knight of grand cross who happened to be in island to assemble in council message be also sent to gervaise requesting to repair at same hour to palace a council must probably require attendance oh dear wish be over said to ralph a latter assisted to buckle on armour see anything to sigh about ralph said think that be most fortunate fellow in world say that have not well deserved because be tremendous way worked at turkish gave up everything else have enabled to do still there be luck in noticing that villain talking to galley slave then to one of officer of prison of course a grand master said last night be one in thousand who must have thought anything more about be sure must so that rest be entirely own doing still be piece of luck that noticed talking with slave think envy gervaise bit feel a much a one have well deserved honour have obtained still know be sort of consolation to that luck have little just little to do with in opinion luck have everything to do with gervaise said heartily feel downright ashamed at there being such fuss made over be bad enough before merely because have hit on plan for escape from pirate be worse feel horribly nervous at thought of having to appear before grand master council well that brown dye will hide blush gervaise can only say wish be in place by bye have heard that caught that rascal greek last night have not heard anything about yes knight hid behind pile of good on wharf there be one about so far a must see soon after twelve saw figure come up on to deck of fishing boat moored by quay be greek stood there for minute two listening then went down again did five six time at one o'clock saw throw up arm a if in despair stepped ashore be about to make way up into town when rushed out seized there be doubt a to what fate will be be sorry to say that hear friend vrados have be arrested there can be doubt about loyalty will assuredly be able to explain to satisfaction of council how man became resident at house be sorry met there ralph be very unpleasant thing to have gone to house to have be received kindly then to be mean of bringing trouble upon yes feel that little myself because took there yet can not regret for if have not seen taken objection to might not have noticed particularly when spoke to one of galley slave be certainly curious that must have doubted man for have met there several time even after visit with must see nothing in to justify dislike gervaise went up to palace while waiting in great hall until summoned before council be warmly accosted by several knight of whom be quite stranger to who joined in congratulating on immense service have done to order be upwards of hour before be called in council have received sir gervaise tresham grand master said full detail from sir john kendall of manner in first discovered have since followed up daring plot by slave at st pelagius be to have risen slain guard who be faithful spiked cannon in three water fort burnt merchant shipping carried off six galley burnt rest in name thank for having saved order from great calamity member of council agree with that have shown amount of discernment of highest kind that be worthy of exceptional favour reward for conduct therefore in own name appoint to commandery of manor of maltby in lincolnshire having fallen vacant be in gift release from usual payment of first year revenue knowing that desire to establish here council have at request decided to make exception to general rule that knight on promotion to commandery must return take charge of in two year from time grant be made to commandery will therefore be administered by senior of knight attached to council on part have requested bailiff of auvergne a grand master of fleet to appoint to command of galley now building approaching completion have consented to do feeling a feel that although appointment be unprecedented for young knight yet in present case exception may well be made may add that admiral have in order that knight greatly senior must be placed under command determined that will appoint to only young knight who will be assured gladly serve under one who have so distinguished feeling certain that under command will have ample opportunity against infidel to prove worthy of order may add also that bailiff of langues promise that will select from among young knight such a may seem best fitted for such service by skill in warlike exercise by ready obedience to order good conduct foresee that spirit of emulation desire to show that though still professed knight be capable of performing a valiant deed a elder will make galley under command one of most successful in order a be aware be stringent rule even in so exceptional case must not be justified in breaking that knight must reside in island for five year previous to being promoted to commandery be now two month more than time since be received a page to late grand master in promoting to commandery have not therefore broken rule may retire sir gervaise gervaise overwhelmed by unlooked for honour thus bestowed upon bowed deeply to grand master member of council then retired from chamber passed out of palace by side door so a to avoid being accosted by knight in great hall took way out on to rampart where walked up down for considerable time before returning to auberge felt hilarity at promotion have never entertained ambition for rising to high office in order have hoped only to perform duty a true knight to fight against infidel day if need be to die for order commandery be knew rich one a chief must draw considerable revenue from estate afforded pleasure except inasmuch a must enable in new command of galley to keep handsome table to entertain well knight who served under seemed to however that reward honour be so far beyond desert that felt almost humiliated by bestowal responsibility too be great must young knight youngest of whom must be year junior serve willingly under order above must be able to emulate deed of experienced warrior must galley worthily maintain fame of order at end of two hour be joined by ralph harcourt have be looking for everywhere gervaise seemed to have disappeared mysteriously none have marked leave council chamber knew where have gone after searching everywhere remembered fondness for walk upon wall so climbed to top of st john tower thence espied well congratulate most heartily on honour have fallen to share especially that of command of new galley be too much altogether ralph feel ashamed at being thus thrust into post ought to be given to knight of age experience how can expect number of young knight of whom well nigh must be senior in age to obey a must older man what have age to do with ralph said have shown that have head to think a before proved have arm to strike why young knight in order must feel proud one of own age have gained such honour raise in own esteem will see that will get pick among professed knight of good many who have finished profession be serving here in hope of day getting promotion to commandery not one a have got that in ordinary course of thing doe not fall to knight until be well on in year have served in many commandery of smaller value can tell directly sir john kendall came back told that have be appointed commander of new galley that be to be manned wholly by young knight there be not one of serving profession in auberge who did not beg sir john to put down name for ten twelve others among who have obtained full knighthood also mean to say that have put down name to serve under ralph must be monstrous see nothing monstrous in gervaise a said just now year have nothing to do with putting aside friendship must rather serve under than under many knight old enough to be father know whether will have luck to be one of chosen a sir john said that there be to be only seven from langue will make forty nine with fifty if be chosen knowing friendship hope that bailiff will let go with be likely enough may be named lieutenant a will be only one beside who be secular knight be therefore superior in rank to rest must be pleasant indeed ralph though must rather that have be made commander lieutenant at rate with to support will feel le oppressed by thought of responsibility a ralph have declared must be case young knight in other auberge be a anxious a of england to be enrolled among crew of new galley bailiff have trouble in choosing among aspirant very few be selected outside rank of professed knight a great pain be taken to comply with grand master wish that only young knight of good conduct disposition distinguished by proficiency in warlike exercise must be chosen crew be in way picked one most of have made one two of three month voyage in galley though comparatively few have have good fortune to be absolutely engaged with moslem pirate to great satisfaction of gervaise ralph harcourt be nominated lieutenant of galley fact that so many have volunteered impressed who be chosen with sense that be at once honour piece of good fortune to be selected be determined that boy galley a elder knight laughingly termed must do honour to order be fortnight before be launched gervaise have heard with great satisfaction that have be decided by council that punishment must be inflicted upon slave for share in intended rising at st pelagius be guilty there be mean of saying who have taken prominent part in plot council felt that be natural that must grasp at prospect of freedom for must have done same have be captive of infidel even warder guard be allowed to go unpunished although offence be much more serious one who must have named men who have accepted bribe be dead lesson have be so severe one there be probability of again turning traitor author of rising have be publicly executed seeing hopelessness of denial have boldly avowed share in matter have acknowledged that be acting a agent for sultan have be supplied with ample fund before leaving constantinople declared that be absolutely unable to give name of concerned in plot save of two overseer a have undertaken work of suborning warder guard though admitted that have on several occasion spoken to slave a gang be on way back to prison have told to be prepared to take part in plan be on foot for rescue from slavery torture have not be a be then usual custom applied to extort information partly because story be probable still more because grand master council did not wish that more publicity must be given to affair be glad that must be allowed to drop without further trial of delinquent in city generally be only known that plot have be discovered for liberation escape of of slave outside member of order none be aware of extent dangerous character to satisfaction of gervaise ralph vrados be able to produce letter document satisfied council that have be deceived a to character of greek be wholly innocent in matter chapter xii boy galley among most pleased at appointment of gervaise to command of galley be sir john boswell ever since adventure with pirate knight have exhibited almost fatherly interest in have encouraged in study ridden with on such occasion a have permitted short holiday have whenever be together related to story of war siege battle escape from thought young knight might gain lesson for future guidance doubt gervaise said one day a be riding quietly along road whether plan of life be altogether best be founded know simply a body of monk bound to devote solely to care of sick to give hospitality to pilgrim in palestine now be monkish work men who devoted solely to such life of charity a in hospital at jerusalem might well renounce human pleasure when great change be made by master raymond du puy from nursing body became brotherhood in arm seems to that vow of celibacy be no longer needful desirable crusader be many of married men fought worse for that must have be far better methinks have be converted into order pledged to resist infidel without vow of poverty of celibacy have never be seriously regarded garrison here might be composed a indeed be now principally of young knight of who have not cared to marry of officer of order whose wife family might dwell here with must have many advantage among others presence of so many lady of rank must have excellent effect of discountenancing repressing extravagance dissolute habit be too common be shame to order knight possessing commandery throughout europe must be worse steward for being married men scandal such a contributed largely to downfall of templar must be avoided sole vow necessary so far a can see must be that knight must remain unmarried disposable at time for service until ten year after making profession afterwards must ever be ready to obey summons to arm on occasion when safety of rhodes invasion of christian country by moslem rendered service needful when must come out just a knight of richard lion heart went out a crusader have spent half life since joined order in commandery at home dull life be be glad enough to resign last command come out here have be able to marry might now have have son of age whose career must watch feel pride in life must have be far happier in england in respect must be better man than be now methinks must strengthen rather than weaken order a fighting body must be in way inferior to what be now must be more liked more respected throughout europe for naturally sight of so many men leading luxurious life in commandery cause feeling against suppose sir john that there be great difficulty in obtaining dispensation from vow in a in other matter everything depends upon interest money of course dispensation be not common doubtless knight when have served term of active service must especially if request be backed by grand master obtain from pope dispensation of vow if have commandery must make vacancy give grand prior grand master council in whosoever gift might be opportunity of rewarding service of gratifying powerful family agree with that must have be much better sir john can understand that monk ever living quiet life apart from world must be content so to continue among body of warlike knight there must be many who in time must come to regret vow took when boy cadet of noble family might by death of elder brother come to be head of great family ruler over wide domain surely must be desirable that man must be able to marry have heir doubtless must be managed in such case gervaise be pity that must have to be managed can see reason in world why knight after doing ten year of service here must not be free to marry providing take vow to render full service to order called upon to do so already vow of poverty be everywhere broken already in defiance of oath too many knight lead idle dissolute life already knight when in own country disregard rule that will draw sword in cause save that of holy sepulchre like other knight noble take part in civil strife foreign war be scandal be better by far to do away with oath save that of obedience willingness to war with infidel than to make vow that men know be constantly shamelessly broken be fond of gervaise be proud of a one who have brought honour to langue who in time will bring more honour be glad that so far a there can be between young knight one of middle age there be friendship between see what greater pleasure must give to life be son for whom must lay by such fund a must well spare instead of spending appointment on having kith kin to give sigh of regret when news come have fallen in engagement with infidel often think of thing sometimes talk over with comrade there be few who hold with that must be far better that must become purely military order like of military order in court of european sovereign than remain a be half monk half soldier mixture so far a can see accord badly with morality public repute however see chance of such change coming must be content to observe vow a well a may be so long a be willing to remain monk try to obtain dispensation from vow must desire to alter mode of life ought either to have remained monk pure simple spending life in deed of charity life suit many men against must be last to say anything else soldier pure simple a be crusader who wrested holy sepulchre from hand of infidel at present gervaise vocation lie wholly in way of fighting may be that time will come when may have other aim ambition when vow of order will gall hope not sir john gervaise said earnestly be young yet knight replied with indulgent smile day may think differently now went on changing subject abruptly when will galley be ready be last ride sir john shipwright will have finished tomorrow next day will take possession of begin to practise so that man will know duty galley slave learn to row well before have order to sail wish be going with sir john must like in many respect doe one good to see enthusiasm of young men doubtless will be merry party on other hand unless mistake will be undertaking wild adventure time for be well nigh passed when turk come here if ever come of have little doubt will be ready to take full share of fighting will seek adventure longer will go no more to sea next only to bailiff be senior of auberge be between lad be like to succeed to grand priory of england when becomes vacant if not will a grand master have told have offer of next high office vacant in palace two day later gervaise company of young knight went down to port to take part in launch of new galley be occasion of solemn ceremony grand master large number of knight being present religious service first took place on poop be named by grand master santa barbara when ceremony be over gervaise be solemnly invested with command of galley by grand marshal of navy then shore be struck away galley glided into water amid firing of gun blowing of trumpet cheer of spectator who have gathered at port to witness ceremony next morning gang of galley slave be marched down third of have be drawn from crew of other galley place being supplied by new hand remainder be taken from men employed on fortification three week be occupied in teaching rower work getting well together be fine crew for governor of st pelagius grateful to gervaise for discovery of plot have ordered overseer to pick out from various gang men specially suited by age strength for work dye by time have entirely worn off face although hair be still several shade darker than of old differed even more widely from ebon hue that have be when be in prison thus although recognised three four men upon bench who have be fellow occupant of cell have fear whatever of detecting in commander of galley late companion in misfortune only portion of knight have be out day while crew be learning to row a there be little for to learn galley carried sail knight be soldier rather than sailor fought on deck of ship a if defending breach storming one held by enemy moreover a of have already made one more voyage be accustomed to such duty a must have to discharge on board be glad when order be published for galley to sail on eve of departure gervaise be sent for by grand master general of galley be with when gervaise entered room bailiff of auvergne always held position of grand marshal bailiff of italy that of second in command with title of grand admiral official however a head of respective langues have many other duty to perform be only on great occasion that took practical share in work of be nominally head real control in naval question rested with general of galley who be elected by council on nomination of grand master power when at sea with fleet be absolute must suspend officer from duty have unquestioned power of life death over crew have be frequently on board galley since have be launched have be pleased with attention paid by gervaise to duty with ready manner in young knight carried out order sir gervaise tresham said be usual a know to appoint galley to certain cruising ground to be confined during three month absence at present there be galley on of station a last relief took place month since be better that must remain at station allotted to have therefore after consultation with highness grand master decided to give free hand be a likely to meet with pirate in one quarter a in will pick up from vessel may overhaul news of doings will enable to direct course to point where will be most useful in first place however will proceed to coast of tunis visconti galley be already there coast swarm with corsair have have many complaint a to depredation court of spain have twice represented to lately that pirate have grown so bold that vessel have be carried off even when coasting from one spanish port to visconti be specially watching coast near tunis will therefore perhaps do better to proceed farther west for village from tunis to tangier be little better than nest of pirate must imagine that will find ample employment there during three month cruise when say that be free to choose own cruising ground mean that must go up levant to east of mediterranean that be not bound to keep close along african coast may must obtain information to warrant doing so seek pirate along shore of spain sardinia corsica sicily need not warn to act with prudence a well a courage for have proved that posse quality allow to be carried away by impetuosity of knight be more often duty of commander to restrain than to encourage crew with such young blood a have under command necessity will be greater than usual be kind to slave be ever watchful yet need not tell maintain strict not over severe discipline be knight comrade of order equal when on shore on board be captain be soldier have afternoon have meeting of knight have urged upon very strongly that having volunteered to serve under must obey order a promptly willingly a if be senior knight of order that behooves specially upon present occasion when crew be composed entirely of young knight to show worthy of honour have be done to by entrusting galley of order to charge told must regard report of individual conduct with same attention respect with must that of other commander that might greatly make mar future prospect in order by conduct during cruise be convinced from what know of that will exercise undue harshness will act with tact discretion a well a firmness will try to do so excellency feel that be heavy responsibility will spare pain to justify unmerited honour have be bestowed upon have seen that taking in of store be complete that nothing be wanting for voyage yes sir stood by while overseer of store checked off sack barrel a came on board water be to be brought off evening a be unable to be present sir ralph harcourt be there to count barrel see that be full goodbye sir gervaise grand master said a interview terminated hitherto have given from time reached island naught reason for satisfaction at nomination of a page have fear that will fail time remember that valour however great can not prevail against overpowering odds have lesson of when served under ricord though finally affair turned out well say attempt desperate undertaking attempt impossible one be careful of life of knight remember that ere long sword may be of utmost consequence in defence of rhodes that even capture of pirate may be too dearly purchased at same time honour of flag of order must be upheld at hazard ah broke off seeing slight smile on young knight face think order contradictory may be so know what mean fear not that will blunder in carrying out be prudent yet not over prudent mean be not rash unless there be such benefit to be obtained a must justify great risk in obtaining on returning to auberge gervaise have long chat with ralph think admiral talk with afternoon have excellent effect gervaise say that one be not before disposed to obey in thing willingly cheerfully put so strongly to that have volunteered specially for service in galley knowing well who be to be commander circumstance that crew be to consist solely of young knight have therefore specially pledged honour so to act that enterprise must be in respect successful one to render so obedience be even greater necessity than valour be most important of vow taken by knight of order be only by strictest most unquestioning obedience on part of to order of superior that work of vast community must be carried on passing over fact that be superior in rank a being secular knight knight commander of order have be specially appointed by grand master council a well a by that bestowed upon while at sea in absence of officer of superior rank full power authority be in fact representative agent therefore to be regarded with same deference respect must be due to oldest knight similarly placed 'lastly said in le serious tone must remember that be experiment a think somewhat rash one never before did galley manned entirely from among youngest of knight put to sea may be sure that unless successful experiment be not likely to be ever repeated have be selected from among many other candidate have not only to justify choice to uphold reputation honour of young knight of order by of whom doings will be regarded with special interest a reflecting credit not only upon yourselves individually a representative champion of ' must see that word have great effect have placed beside marked face a spoke face lit up at appeal think there be one silently registered vow to do in power to prove worthy of confidence placed in companion by grand master admiral have before shadow of fear that everything must not go well knew almost of personally if have have selection from among whole body of knight in convent must not have made choice must have suited better seems to that in auberge bailiff have endeavoured to pick out seven young knight whom considered must most worthily support honour of langue still confident a be before feel more so now after admiral address to have fear either ralph though doubtless admiral word will carry great weight with be thoughtlessness rather than anything else that dreaded now that admiral have spoken to there be fear that anything will occur to give trouble have particularly noticed that when have be on board have be laughing chatting together before got under way manner changed directly first order be given that command be carried out with a much goodwill alacrity a if be under ricord on following morning knight went on board santa barbara baggage be carried down by slave by personal servant from auberge who be to go a attendant during voyage grand master have advanced gervaise sum equal to year income of commandery with have purchased stock of best wine various other luxury to supplement ration supplied from fund of order to knight when at sea gervaise have to go round early to admiral to sign receipt for store to receive final order in writing be therefore on board before when arrived be drawn up in military order to receive knight be in full armour a at word from ralph drew sword saluted young commander gervaise felt with thrill of pleasure of confidence that with following need not fear encounter with pirate force unless in overwhelming number young knight be with exception only of ralph harcourt between age of seventeen nineteen young face free in most case even from suspicion of moustache looked almost of boy there be mistaking ardour enthusiasm in face lack of breadth weight year alone must give to be compensated by skill in weapon acquired by long severe training by activity tireless energy of youth knight comrade gervaise said a after walking through double line to end of poop turned faced be proud indeed to command so gallant body of knight success of expedition depends upon rather than upon a feel assured of warm cooperation have fear a to what result will be if dame fortune will favour by throwing in way of scourge of sea in search of whom be about to set out many of have already encountered fighting side by side with older knight have borne share of work while who have not done so will be sure do equally well when opportunity arrives will not voyage have encouragement confidence inspired by presence of who have long valiantly borne standard of order on other hand have to show that be worthy of confidence reposed in that young knight of order can be trusted to emulate deed of who have rendered name of hospitallers terror to infidel shout of approbation greeted close of address gervaise then walked forward to end of poop looked down upon slave who with oar out be awaiting order to row men said in turkish be desire that while be necessary that must do work lot will be heavier than can be avoided will not be taxed beyond power save when enemy be in sight there be supreme need for haste then must be called upon for utmost exertion wish work to be willing abhor use of lash so long a man doe fair quota of work have given strictest order that will never be used have at own cost made provision that daily ration will be improved while under command meat will be served out to daily when can be obtained for of who hold that strict tenet of religion may be relaxed while engaged in such severe labour ration of wine will also be served out such other indulgence a be compatible with discipline safety of ship will also be granted to there be murmur of gratitude among slave gervaise then gave order to row galley started on voyage knight have now fallen out from rank be soon laughing talking gaily being of noble family knightly rank there be except when on actual duty tone of perfect equality good fellowship prevailing among french be common language for a order be of french foundation three of seven langues belonged to country most of high dignitary being chosen from rank be natural that french language must be general medium of communication between until noon slave rowed steadily well work be then stopped for there be scarce breath of wind stirring water even under awning have a sun gained power be erected over poop heat be oppressive knight have divested of armour most of retired below for siesta a soon a slave stopped rowing awning gervaise have purchased be rolled up under break of poop be to astonishment drawn over think be spoiling slave sir gervaise one of spanish knight asked doubtfully on contrary sir pedro hope that be improving have not worked a galley slave have can assure used to feel hour when be lying broiling in sun doing nothing much more trying than during be at work used to be quite giddy sick with heat on getting out oar again have scarce strength to work be not most important point in port slave always sleep in prison at sea must rest on bench to do so with clothes soaked with heavy dew must be severe trial most prejudicial to health awning cost few ducat reckon that putting aside comfort to slave will be very speedily repaid by better health capacity for labour when away in galley with sir louis ricord used to feel greatest pity for unfortunate wretch when at daybreak in drenched clothes shivering with cold wet rose to commence work then took vow that if ever must come to command galley must provide awning for slave two three of knight standing by expressed warm approval of what gervaise said there be in day little of sentiment of humanity be now prevalent slave be everywhere regarded a mere beast of burden rather than a human being when however have question put to a gervaise have done be ready to give hearty agreement although be utilitarian rather than humanitarian side of question recommended to after three hour rest journey be renewed just at galley anchored off islet lying to north of carpathos while servant be laying table along poop for evening meal gervaise went down to see that order be carried out regarding food for slave be already eating bread meat with air of satisfaction showed how warmly appreciated unusual indulgence while there be few indeed who did not hold up drinking horn a servant passed along between bench with skin of wine gervaise spoke to many of ah lord one of said if be always treated like slavery must be endurable for ten year have rowed in christian galley never before have awning be spread to keep off sun dew will not forget kindness lord will row hardest right cheerfully when call upon for effort there be murmur of assent from galley slave around may allah be merciful to a be merciful to slave exclaimed blessing of whom regard a infidel can at least do harm on contrary can do good gervaise said god moslem christian worship be believe same though under name gervaise have indeed during long conversation with suleiman ali often discussed with matter of faith have come in consequence to regard in very different light to in be viewed by companion there be faith in one god at bottom of mohammedanism christianity mohammedan held in reverence lawgiver prophet of old testament even regarded christ a being prophet have be grievously led away by mahomet whom gervaise regarded a false teacher a have seen innumerable instance of fidelity of moslem to creed punctuality devotion with slave said daily prayer exposed though be to scorn even anger of taskmaster have quite lost during nine month of constant association with suleiman ali bigoted hatred of mohammedanism so universal at time regarded moslem a foe to be opposed to death felt that be unfair to hate for being hostile to christianity of knew nothing chapter xiii first prize after leaving slave gervaise joined companion on poop be engaged in animated discussion a to whether be advisable to grant indulgence to slave majority approved of step gervaise have taken asserted that concession must only lead to look for more must create discontent among crew of other galley not so favoured well comrade said gervaise think so far be better qualified than of to give opinion may be that will fall to lot of of to be slave in turkish hand in case can affirm with certainty that will keenly appreciate alleviation however small of lot must remember that one feeling of slave be dull despair death be only relief have to look forward to do think that man so feeling can do best either at oar at other kind of work be sure must not be so in case if brighten life little show that be not regarded a merely brute beast that take interest in will work in different spirit even viewed from merely monetary point of view must pay well to render a content a possible with lot know how great be mortality among slave how pine away die from material malady can be detected simply from hopelessness weariness of life aided undoubtedly in case of galley slave by sleeping in damp night air after exposure day to full heat of sun brings answer to second objection undoubtedly might cause discontent among slave of other galley when hear that others be treated better than hope that if on return bring back slave in good condition health contrast between appearance that of slave in most other galley will be so marked that admiral may consider must be well to order awning to be fixed to vessel of order even to grant to slave when away on voyage little indulgence have given here expense must be very trifling must certainly add great deal to average life of slave must render capable of better work there be advantage if turk learn that countryman in hand be treated with certain amount of kindness consideration might lead to act similarly to of order who may be unfortunate enough to fall into hand there be great deal in what say sir gervaise one of knight who have before taken opposite point of view said there be reason why galley must not be model one though like enough senior will laugh at making innovation d'aubusson be reformer will certainly support anything that see to be beneficial from quarter come supper be now served young knight be well pleased with entertainment provided for be principal meal of day fast be broken by glass of wine manchet of bread fruit soon after rising at eleven o'clock sat down to more substantial meal in climate heat be at hour considerable a there be duty to be performed there be sitting long at table at day work be over appetite be sharpened by cool evening breeze meal be hearty prolonged after be concluded several of knight brought up from below viol other instrument of music for ability to accompany voice with instrument be considered essential part of education of knight for hour song romance so popular at time be sung in various language represented on board then knight one by one went down to sleeping place until only seven knight of langue of auvergne who be to watch first night remained on deck five of wrapped in mantle lay down on bench one of others descended to waist walked along plank between line of sleeping slave took up place in bow while other paced up down poop fall of footstep being only sound to break silence reigned throughout ship in morning a soon a knight have taken plunge in sea oar be got out galley proceeded on way passing through island skirting southern shore of greece continued course west malta be sighted did not put in there pantellaria be passed in fortnight after leaving rhodes cape bon at entrance to bay of tunis be sighted until greece be left behind night have generally be spent in small port where supply of fresh meat fish fruit be obtainable so far incident have marked voyage weather have continued fine have heard nothing from ship have fallen in with of moslem pirate having be seen few hour however after sighting coast of africa dark object be seen ahead be ship of sort ralph said mast have gone may be that be merchantman have be captured sacked by moorish pirate order be given to rower to quicken pace in little over hour be alongside hull a soon a vessel be close enough for on poop of galley to look down on to deck of other craft be seen that ralph supposition be correct two body lay stretched upon one be crushed under fallen mast other lay huddled up in heap cannon ball having almost torn asunder knight leapt on to deck a soon a galley ran alongside gervaise made first for man lying beneath mast a came up to sailor opened eye murmured water gervaise called out to one of servant to bring water from galley a soon a came poured between man lip knight by united effort lifted mast from across body be evident however that have short time to live dew of death be on face after few minute rallied little looked gratefully at rescuer have be attacked by pirate gervaise said be there one galley two three galley man replied in faint whisper do know where be from tripoli how long ago be about three hour after sunrise when saw coming up man said voice gaining in strength a wine gave took effect be useless to fight hauled down flag in spite of one of pirate fired broadside one of shot hit mast brought down be crushed under boarded took off crew a captive emptied hold knew be done for begged to kill paid attention know little of language a lay there caught something of what be saying be bound for island of sardinia where have rendezvous be to join great gathering of consort know name of place be on east coast more water gervaise knelt to pour water between lip when gave sudden cry shudder ran through frame be dead let return on board gentleman gervaise said rising to foot can hing here a soon a regained deck of galley signed to ralph to follow below now ralph said be one of case in have to decide whether ought ought not to be prudent from what that poor fellow said pirate have about five hour start of a can have idea that be pursued can doubtless overtake before reach question be ought to pursue at once ought to coast along until find visconti galley three of tripoli pirate crowded a always be with men must prove serious opponent yet might engage with fair hope of victory may be seriously disabled in fight must be perhaps unable to carry news to genoa that there be many pirate ship gathering on coast of sardinia to prey upon commerce might be day even week before light upon visconti galley gervaise even when found might not consider justified in leaving coast where be stationed besides while be spending time looking for pirate will be committing terrible depredation must be big expedition under notorious pirate must never venture so far north then think must be justified in pursuing alone be fearful responsibility to have to decide think so gervaise there be saying what misfortune might happen if did not venture to do so very well then so be before deciding finally on so grave matter will lay before company there be doubt a to what decision will be ralph said with smile perhaps not ralph a will be called upon to risk life in dangerous enterprise be a well that must have say in matter when returned on to poop there be expression of eagerness excitement on face of young knight showed how anxiously have be awaiting result of conference below gervaise stepped on to bench motioned to to close up round comrade said although responsibility of course may be taken must rest upon shoulder yet think right that a general before battle often call council of war to assist with advice so must lay before two course open to ask opinion upon sir ralph harcourt be of one mind in matter a decision be grave one must be loath to act upon without concurrence then repeated alternative a have laid before ralph now went on a see there be grave danger much risk in one course if successful advantage be obvious on other hand second plan be more sure more prudent more in accordance with instruction have received ask to let know frankly opinion on subject if view agrees with ours although will not relieve from responsibility of deciding will at least in event of thing turning out badly be satisfaction to know that course have approval that be desire a well a ours that must undertake first then let who be in favour of following pirate go to starboard side of deck while who be in favour of joining visconti laying serious matter have discovered before move to larboard side there be rush of knight to right not one moved to other side decision be same a ours gervaise said to north then if there be great peril in adventure there be also great honour to be gained knight gave shout of satisfaction at finding that choice be also that of officer lay head to north gervaise said to pilot then went to end of poop ordered slave to row on row long steady stroke such a can maintain for many hour have long journey before there be need for haste now be time for willing work oar dipped into water galley be soon moving along at much faster pace than at have performed journey from rhodes slave have not from bench be able to see what have passed on board dismantled vessel from order change of course have doubt that knight have obtained clue to direction taken by corsair who have captured sacked ship there be little wind gervaise said to ralph sail will be of slight use to therefore will go fully three foot to two be quite possible that may not catch sight of for can not tell exactly course will take will steer for cape carbonara be hundred thirty mile distant if see by time get there will be sure that have passed on way unless indeed strong wind must spring up from south however hope that will catch sight of before for will be able from lookout to discover mast sail eight ten mile away while will not be able to see until be within distance can not be more than twenty mile away now for light breeze will aid little a will see occasion for haste will not be rowing at full power with so long passage before already indeed one of knight have perched on seat at top of low mast fifteen foot above poop served a lookout can see nothing yet suppose cairoli line of sea be clear round be indeed four hour before knight on lookout cried that must make out three dark speck on horizon gervaise at once ascended to lookout by ladder be fixed against post be making to left of course be taking turn head rather more to west will do be directly ahead now then came down to deck again must that have seven eight more hour of daylight ralph instead of three at outside however a know course be taking be not likely to miss for a will not be near enough for to make out before sun set there will be chance of changing do think will row night must not think so if land be nearer might keep on until make a have have wind since daylight will lie on oar until morning see at sunset will still be eighty mile from cape carbonara slave must not possibly row distance without rest so that if keep on may take by surprise be what have be thinking ralph must be well not to attack until nearly daybreak must capture one galley easily enough others being ignorant of force might make off in different direction might lose of if on other hand must fall upon short time before daylight must be able to keep in sight even if separated must soon come together continue course a hope when see that be alone bear up fight think that best plan will be to row on until be dark then give slave six hour rest after go on quietly if can make out may do if have light on board will stop wait until be hour to attack if miss will row on to sardinia lie up a proposed until come along think will be very good plan gervaise before sunset three pirate ship must be clearly made out from deck pilot judged to be fully ten mile away hour later slave be told to cease rowing gervaise have ordered cook to prepare good meal be at once served together with full ration of wine a soon a have consumed be told to lie down sleep a at one o'clock galley must be again under way knight supper be served below a light on poop might be made out must lookout be placed by corsair in top have better follow example of galley slave gervaise said rising a soon a meal be finished with exception of spain who be on watch turn in to sleep till be off again of will of course don armour on rising at appointed hour galley be again under way there be not breath of air before starting piece of cloth be wrapped round oar at rowlock to deaden sound might otherwise have be heard at considerable distance on so still night after hour half rowing knight on lookout said that must see light distance ahead pilot experienced old sailor joined speedily descended to poop again be ship light said must say that be lantern on board ship of captain of expedition be shown to enable other two to keep near can not say how far be away for know at what height hang above water must imagine from feebleness of light that must be two mile distant a soon a light have be noticed slave have be ordered to cease rowing be now told that must not be required again for fully two hour when first gleam of dawn appeared in east be called to work again lantern be still burning in quarter of hour knight on poop be able in broadening light to make out three shadowy form two mile ahead of decreased distance by more than half before must discern sign of life motion on board then sudden stir be apparent must hear shout from one vessel to oar be thrust out effort made to get head of ship in same direction so a to catch light breeze have just sprung up moment saw that galley be discovered gervaise shouted down to slave to row hardest told pilot to steer for ship farthest to east be four five hundred yard from nearest consort same distance separated that vessel from third craft will have time to carry ralph before others come to assistance will only arrive one at time if be to lie alongside middle craft be probably that of chief a be have light burning might have other two upon before have done with for be evidently largest most likely strongest handed of leader of pirate evidently saw that there be chance of evading fight flag be run up to masthead of ship three vessel began to endeavour to turn so a to meet galley operation however took time in confusion order be misunderstood instead of slave on one side rowing whilst on other side backed order be lost long before craft for galley be making have got round latter be upon will ram sir gervaise pilot asked might damage besides want to sink sheer away oar on one side galley carried eight gun three on side of poop two forward have be loaded with small piece of iron few shot have be fired by pirate owing to confusion prevailed on board gun be discharged so hurriedly that shot flew overhead passed wide of galley excited a young knight be eager for fray general laugh broke out a galley swept along by pirate ship breaking many of oar hurling slave who manned backwards off bench moment later gun poured iron content among pirate who clustered thickly on forecastle poop a vessel grated together knight sprang on board corsair member of english langue have be provided with short piece of rope before joining companion in fray lashed vessel together side by side fight be very short one france auvergne led by ralph harcourt boarded at bow other five langues at poop so impetuous be onset that pirate who have still scarce recovered from surprise at being hastily aroused from sleep to repel attack of foe who have so suddenly sprung out from darkness upon offered feeble resistance many threw overboard swam to ship nearest to others be cut down rest flung away arm cried for quarter who did so be without loss of minute time thrown down into hold of ship hatch secured over have before be arranged that ralph must take command of corsair having with france auvergne germany a soon therefore a captive be fastened below gervaise called knight of other four langues back to deck of galley lashing be cast off be pushed from side of prize oar be got out there be time to be lost for largest of three pirate ship have directly be seen that consort be captured poured two heavy broadside into prize be now approaching rowing slowly however for third vessel to come up be hundred yard away when galley swept round bow of prize advanced to meet a did so ralph discharged eight gun of prize have at once reloaded into bow of corsair shot raking crowded deck from end to end when few yard distant two bow gun of galley poured in shower of missile moment later ran alongside pirate poop gun a before preparing way for boarder sooner have leapt on deck than be met by pirate headed by captain gervaise have specially charged knight not to allow to be carried away by ardour be sure to be greatly outnumbered when first spring on board must cut way across deck then form in double treble line across so fighting gradually force before in spite of effort of pirate be accomplished once formed corsair strove in vain to break through wall of steel for time however forward movement must be made so furious be attack upon led by pirate chief several time breach be made in front rank knight behind time bore back assault restored line knight have won way half along poop when yell of exultation rose from corsair a third of vessel rowed up on other side of galley crew sprang on board called knight of second line from place ranged along bulwark to prevent moor from boarding from poop of galley then for moment looked round prize be creeping up be length two away coming up alongside approach be also noticed by pirate who with wild shout flung upon opponent gervaise sprang forward to take place of young italian knight who staggered back with helmet cleft by heavy blow from keen yataghan of pirate captain corsair shouting war cry of allah sprang with bound of wild cat upon gervaise weapon descended on uplifted guard shore right through stout blade with shout of triumph corsair raised arm to repeat blow gervaise in turn sprang forward struck with force with pommel of sword on forehead of opponent latter fell a if shot weapon dropping from hand beside dismayed at fall of leader follower recoiled for moment tall pirate sprang forward to take place shouting to to follow be about to throw upon gervaise when gun crashed out close alongside storm of iron swept away front line of moor shout of st john st john rose above din be one of bow gun of prize a swept along gun after gun poured content among pirate do clear galley ralph can manage here now gervaise said a ralph leapt on board latter followed by party of knight rushed across poop sprang on to galley among pirate who have be striving in vain to break through line of defender gervaise called to party to follow taking offensive fell upon remnant of corsair who still held forward end of poop discharge of cannon at such close quarter have wrought terrible havoc among pirate with slight resistance turned ran down ladder leapt into water knight followed forward among bench of rower who cheered loudly in many tongue a passed at forecastle moor made stand knight forced way up in two minute be over now to aid of comrade gervaise shouted a last of corsair be struck down ralph party have indeed cleared poop of galley in vain endeavoured to climb up on to of third pirate ship whose superior height gave great advantage to defender gervaise leapt down on to bow of galley followed by knight then ran aft until must climb into waist of pirate so intent be corsair upon defending poop that did not see what be going on elsewhere gervaise have obtained fair footing before be noticed then number of men ran down attacked party be too late for whole of knight have by time leaped on board assailant be forced back pressing close upon knight gained poop before main body of pirate be aware of coming warned by shout shriek of comrade that have be taken in rear moslem who be defending side of poop wavered for moment ralph took advantage of hesitation sprang on board companion pouring in after there be stern desperate fight moslem fought with fury of despair disdaining to ask accept quarter few leapt overboard preferring death by drowning to by sword of christian great majority died fighting to last shout of triumph rose from knight a last of moslem fell first impulse of of be to take off helmet in order to breathe fresh air for while stood panting from exertion nobly gallantly done comrade gervaise exclaimed be indeed victory of have right to be proud now first thing be to free slave of shackle there be many white face among let langue look after wounded while released captive clear deck of body of fallen pirate took hour hard work to knock off chain of slave greater

struggled desperately to break chain while fight be going on have a soon a contest be decided risen to foot shouted battle cry of order then overcome by emotion sank down upon bench remained a if in stupor until knight who have hurried first to struck off fetter then three men grasped other hand while tear streamed down cheek be dream comrade one of said in hoarse voice be free again let first return thanks to god for release then can thank brother three knight knelt at bench where have toiled suffered hid face in hand sound came from lip stifled sob heaving of naked shoulder seamed scarred by stroke of taskmaster whip told young knight who stood unhelmeted silent around how deep be emotion then rose be fabricius caretto one said be giacomo da vinci pietro forzi knight commander of order

galley gervaise found three knight in cabin dressed in usual attire of order presented very different appearance indeed to wore when have first seen have bathed combed matted hair be alone sufficient to transform feeling that be once more free men knight of honoured order have done even more to effect change although looked thin worn martial bearing have come back naturally a donned knightly robe buckled on sword be glad to see that be better gervaise said a went up to greet twenty year seem to have dropped off shoulder since morning be not same men sir gervaise be slave be now free be christian dog now be christian knight be subject to scoff blow now thank god have sword to strike with though a yet arm may not have regained full strength must at least bear share in fray comrade have be telling somewhat of how wonderful thing have come about have be explaining what at first filled with surprise that galley must be manned solely by young knight of whom commander be one of youngest can testify at least have grand master be in command crew composed of veteran knight must have done better be fortunate in taking so much by surprise that first of ship fell into hand before consort must come to assistance gun did good service in struggle with others matter be well arranged a well a gallantly fought one of other knight said have first fallen foul of chief galley must have gone hard with for crew be so strong that must scarce have overcome before other two vessel came up to assistance now let to meal gervaise said three knight be placed at head of table by be pleasant to see how enjoyed food can scarce persuade be not dreaming caretto said sometimes when lying at night wet through with damp air have wondered to myself whether must ever have lived thus whether must ever exchange hard bread water for what seemed to fabulous luxury though at time one have taken a matter of course can not tell how strange feel to to come back to old life again will soon be accustomed to gervaise said with smile then will look upon captivity a dream just a then regarded past life suppose sir gervaise pietro forzi said that will sail direct for rhodes with prize indeed gervaise replied at same time that learned from dying man left on board ship pirate captured yesterday of course have taken be so enabled to follow also learned that be on way to join corsair fleet be collecting at point on eastern side of sardinia with intention of sweeping coast of italy be rather than capture of three vessel induced to disobey general instruction have be given to cruise along northern coast of africa determined to push north to give warning along coast from naples to genoa of danger threatened if possible to enable genoa to fit out galley to encounter corsair duty have still to be fulfilled though fear that genoa will be able to do little for of late have be engaged in long civil struggle between great family have taken small part in maritime affair however can at least warn a well a naples pisa other town may possibly find opportunity for ourselves striking blow against pirate if so certainly will be glad to accompany if will allow to serve under for nothing must please so much a opportunity of paying off small share of vengeance owe of course if must rather will sail for rhodes in prize be not thinking of sending to rhodes at present gervaise said seems to that may be able in way to utilise to advantage have sail rower for oar there will be in besides seven knight of order thirty men who like yourselves must feel willing to strike blow at late oppressor need hardly say that will be glad indeed to have company aid of three such well known knight of order must must do so gladly resign command into experienced hand can not do anticipating that must be willing to join in expedition have be thinking how must best utilise aid have thought that if must accept position must appoint one of to of prize to act not a commander a leader of band of released captive most of be sailor of course with must work gun give effective aid to little party of knight in actual fight three knight exclaimed that must gladly accept post offered idea be capital one sir gervaise a long a doe not come to close fighting three ship must be able to render efficient aid to galley in encounter will be at rate match for own number of pirate ship caretto said a soon a meal concluded moslem captive be questioned one by one a to rendezvous at pirate fleet be to assemble however protested that place be known only to three commander of whom have fallen in fight chapter xiv corsair fleet hour later be ready for start knight of langues of france germany spain went on board respective ship a did three party of released captive with knight who be to command while rower took seat on bench shackled with chain have recently held christian wind be from south with sail oar prize be able to keep fairly abreast of galley with few short interval of rest slave continued work night until shortly before daybreak land be seen ahead pilot at once pronounced to be cape carbonara good landfall gervaise ralph said pilot have done right well suppose mean to anchor when get there certainly ralph slave will have rowed nearly eighteen hour with only two hour rest must have hour at least of sleep before go on a have be up night will turn in also will send boat ashore to try find out from native may come across whether vessel bearing appearance of moorish corsair have be seen passing up coast also to find out what bay inlet there be where must be likely to anchor of italian knight have best go with boat for though believe people speak different dialect to of mainland must have more chance of understanding than of others sun have risen when little fleet came to anchor close to cape boat be at once prepared to go ashore gervaise begged fabricius caretto senior of rescued italian knight to endeavour to find out whether swift sailing craft of kind must be hired if so be to secure on term come off in at once to galley gervaise have already talked matter over with ralph agreed that strongly manned craft of kind must go faster than of have taken that moreover must be pity to weaken force by sending one of prize away having seen off gervaise retired to cabin threw down for short sleep leaving knight who have be off watch during night to see that went well in two hour be roused native craft have come alongside with sir fabricius caretto think be just craft for knight said a gervaise came on deck belongs to large fishing village just round point to left there be several boat there villager said that be speediest vessel anywhere along coast belongs to two brother who with four men constitute regular crew have arranged for twelve others to go in in order that may row along at good pace if wind fall light be companion come off yet can hoist flag for recall do so will be greatly obliged if will undertake mission to seaport need one of name rank to speak with noble official authoritatively will gladly do so sir gervaise give instruction can rely upon carrying out thank greatly sir fabricius will be glad if will take with two of knight may select have to write letter for to deliver to authority at naples pisa genoa will write briefly leave to explain matter more fully will merely say have intelligence of arrival here of fleet of moorish corsair of whose strength be ignorant assuredly intention be to make raid on commerce of coast perhaps to land at unprotected place at ostia after warning authority to send order along coast for inhabitant to be on guard pray to carry word at once to rome request holiness pope to order armed galley to put to sea a soon a possible beg at naples pisa to do same thing of course be from genoa that must hope for most assistance in place will if possible see syndic such of council a can be got quickly together moment have done can at genoa sail for island of madalena lie off northeastern point of island there will either find boat with message where to direct course think perhaps will be best to omit naples will save fully day if not two to do so pray at ostia to send off news down coast to request papal authority to despatch mounted messenger be likely that at first at rate corsair will try narrower water to north from here to ostia be nigh two hundred mile if wind be brisk may arrive there tomorrow afternoon start again at night arriving at pisa before noon on following day while allowing for four five hour to ascend river there may be at genoa next morning three hour must suffice to gather from authority what force can despatch a soon a have learned embark again sail south may reach madalena in two day thus at earliest must be from six to seven day before can bring news there if meet with calm foul wind may be well nigh double that time if at ostia can get faster craft than hire take relay of fresh rower will furnish with mean when give letter in le than hour gervaise be on deck again boat have returned with other italian knight ample store of provision have be placed on board sperondra for crew for three knight without minute delay took place on board great sail be hoisted craft glided rapidly away villager spoke truly a to speed ralph said a looked after even with light wind be running fully six mile hour a by look of sky there will be more of soon will make run to ostia well within time calculated gervaise now questioned other italian knight a to what information have gained said peasant have told that several strange craft using oar sail have be noticed passing northward so strong be opinion that be algerines tunisian for last three four day none of fishing craft have ventured to put to sea be able to tell little a to bay along coastline described a very rugged precipitous five six little stream ran knew down from mountain thought most likely place for corsair to rendezvous must be in deep indentation north of cape bellavista behind cape comino if not at place might meet in great bay at whose entrance stand tavolara island that beyond there be several deep inlet on northeastern coast of island gervaise have consultation with ralph first thing be to find out where corsair have meeting place ralph must be done without catching sight of galley of prize of must be sure to recognise ralph nodded be difficult question gervaise of course if have boat speedy enough to row away from corsair must be easy enough with wind oar go so fast that boat must escape be quite certain ralph therefore if be done by boat must be by one so small insignificant that must pay little attention to if caught sight of idea be that must take own little boat be fast one paint black to give appearance of fisherman boat hire couple of good rower from village with one knight dressed a fisherman must go ahead of explore inlet where ship must be sheltered must follow ten mile behind when get near place where native think fleet be likely to be boat must go on at night while anchor in way ought to be able to discover corsair while unseen to gain idea of number position in be anchored bring back news will go gervaise must not spare ralph risk of capture doe not seem to to be great there certainly be risk dare not part with have better be italian because there will doubtless be opportunity of landing at village questioning inhabitant therefore will send fosco if there be eight ten corsair gathered in of bay news be sure to travel along shore may get tidings in way first thing be to send off to village again to fetch two young fisherman must be active fellow strong possessed of courage will ask da vinci to go select while be away will paint boat black make ready for to start at once sooner be off better italian knight at once undertook mission started for shore fosco who have be chosen principally because be light of frame a well a very shrewd intelligent be then called up mission explained to be delighted at having be selected gervaise took down to cabin consulted map with galley be furnished will row on to muravera be twenty mile from here see village lie at mouth of river a soon a arrive there will land find out whether there be report of moorish pirate having be seen along coast will be there evening will come on board report next day will get to lunasei be about five mile on side of cape bellavista will certainly know there if pirate be lying behind cape if be so will row back to meet if be not will remain there until come up in evening remember must on day be seen chased find be overtaking will make for shore land conceal yourselves will keep along near coast a pas can come down to water edge signal to to take off now have better disguise so a to be in readiness to start a soon a da vinci come off with men will only need to take small stock of provision a night can replenish here hour later da vinci came off with two stalwart young fisherman little boat have already be painted be lowered at once fosco stepped into started two hour later prize got up sail accompanied by galley coasted quietly along shore arriving late in afternoon at muravera fosco at once came on board there be news here beyond gained morning sir gervaise said strange ship have certainly be seen sailing north did not approach coast similar report be given at lunasei there be certainly no corsair lying behind cape bellavista news must assuredly have reached village at orosei next day report be same there be strange ship at cape comino have be warned overnight that coast beyond cape be so precipitous that there must be village at to make inquiry arranged with fosco that ship must anchor north of cape that must go on at once to inspect next bay if found ship there be to return at once if not be at daybreak to land at one of village in bay to make inquiry news be brought in by during night be evident pirate be not in bay gervaise ralph said a came on deck at daybreak yes be glad of be large bay if genoese send dozen galley of pirate might still escape while next bay be deeper narrower must be more easy to entrap have along thought most probable that must rendezvous there map show village for many mile round might lie there for week without so much a shepherd getting sight of from cliff moreover be nearest point for cutting off ship coming down between corsica mainland can besides snap up proceeding from south to marseille a for most part pas between sardinia corsica at eight o'clock boat be seen coming round point news fosco gervaise asked a approached galley none sir gervaise have heard nothing of pirate seen anything of exclamation of disappointment broke from knight make more likely gervaise said that be lying in one of inlet to north see lower down kept comparatively close to shore being careless who might notice a approached rendezvous must be more careful might either pas along at night keep far out if have not be anxious to conceal near presence must have be likely to put into bay in search of plunder captive for tempe one of largest of sardinian town lie short distance away there must be considerable amount of traffic there be four five small craft lying there fosco who have by time stepped on board put in considerable number of fishing boat when came upon ship in dark thought at first have lighted on pirate on letting boat drift closely by soon saw be not corsair galley will get up anchor go into bay ralph asked be safer not to do so ralph possibly one of craft lying there might be presently captured by might learn from crew of presence of galley of order there therefore think best to remain where be till then to proceed anchor on north side of island of madalena if can find sheltered cove where must not be seen from land by passing ship during day there be good deal of discussion among knight a to whether corsair might not already have sailed away be evident that if ship have arrived there must be motive for delay three ship knew must never join others might have be detained from cause there must be doubt that pirate have already ample force for capturing a many merchant vessel a might come across might be intended to carry out more daring project to sack burn town along coast carry off leading people for ransom fill vessel with slave attack being made simultaneously on several unprotected town vast amount of plunder must thus be reaped together with captive of even greater money value be plan must doubtless delay until who have promised to join in expedition have arrived balance of opinion then be that corsair be still in hiding by daybreak next morning be moored in sheltered little bay to north of madalena galley lying inside prize so a to be concealed a much a possible from view of craft might happen to pas mouth of bay fosco started a soon a darkness fell in evening returned early in morning be there shouted a neared galley hidden in deep inlet run into one of narrow bay how many be there of seventeen eighteen must not say be moored side by side by time fosco boat have reached galley have done well indeed gervaise said a young knight ascended to poop now give full account of what have seen a know sir gervaise bay opposite island split up into two running long way inland like fang of great tooth have of course difficulty in finding entrance to bay a be short distance across strait steered first for left hand shore kept close along under shadow of cliff in many case rise almost straight out from water rowed very quietly fearing to run against rock for although be light enough to see across water to make out craft might be anchored there be very dark along foot of cliff there be need for haste a knew have plenty of time to explore arm of bay to be back here before day began to break rowed up to end of inlet then having assured ourselves that be empty came down other side turned up western arm have got distance along when fancied heard voice so let boat drift along only dipping oar in water occasionally must make out sign of corsair when suddenly came upon break in cliff be only fifty yard across here creek came in at right angle to shore must have given shout of pleasure a looked up for there score of light be burning above dark mass must hear sound of talking laughter be glimpse caught for men at once backed water be soon round corner again up till then fisherman have be ready enough to go where wanted sight of clump of galley regularly scared wanted to row straight away of course pointed out to that have taken pay to do thing that have to do said that if caught must be either killed made slave of must not contradict said that in first place a be ready to run risk there be reason why must do so in second there be chance whatever of being taken a if discovered must get so long start that must either escape altogether run boat ashore at point where tree came down to water edge carry boat up hide then move up into hill until corsair have gone waited there three four hour looking round point occasionally at end of time be quiet two three of lantern still burned there be sign of life movement on deck after waiting half hour to ensure crew being asleep rowed quietly up creek keeping within oar length of rock there be not much to see galley lay two abreast a there be space between supposed whole be lashed together there be eight of on side went along think there be only seven on other side a thought did not much matter whether there be fifteen sixteen a men be in state of horrible fright turned went back again own felt very glad when got round point without alarm being given came quietly out be fortunate did so for have not gone quarter of mile when heard sound of oar lying silently under cliff saw two large galley row past be strong force gervaise ralph said a paced up down poop together probably in of galley be eighty hundred men in addition to rower be evident that unless genoa sends help will not be able to interfere with plan know ralph think may injure sorely though might not be able to defeat altogether want tonight to take one of prize row round to bay passed there to buy three coasting vessel six eight fishing boat get a much pitch oil other combustible a can purchase in village on shore if can engage score of fisherman to man better idea be that if caretto return with news that genoese have galley ready for sea must do what can to injure corsair if smear craft be going to fetch with pitch oil fill hold with combustible so turn into fire ship may at least do pirate tremendous lot of harm when get to mouth of inlet must have fire ship rowed in by three four men in having boat behind in to escape a soon a boat be lighted sight of dozen craft coming down on in flame must cause terrific panic for moored closely together a be if one took fire there must be little chance of others escaping of course must add to confusion by opening fire with gun must hope to capture at least of a tried to make way out be grand idea gervaise splendid idea must be terrific blow to moor must make sea safe from for long time when buy other thing ralph get quantity of black cloth matter not how coarse of what material also white a soon a come back with hand will set to work to make stuff up into mantle of order with white cross will put on to christian in prize moor will suppose that be attacked by four of galley of order if can get more arm iron headpiece better will do what can gervaise arm will certainly be wanted for found on deck be sufficient only to arm christian a to steel cap will not matter so much a in darkness confusion sight of mantle will be quite enough to convince corsair that be knight of order by way gervaise have not yet looked into hold of prize be so ralph knew of course a ship have just started must find nothing in save cargo of unfortunate craft captured on searching found a have expected that cargo of captured ship have be of great value consisted of wine olive oil grain be useful for number of mouth to be fed be considerable heavy inroad have already be made on store of galley rower of four vessel be at once set to work to crush grain between flat stone brought from shore ample supply of coarse flour for use for at least fortnight be obtained before sunset a soon a darkness fell ralph two of french knight started in one of prize late on following afternoon sail be seen coming from north before sun set be able to make out to be craft in caretto have sailed anchor of galley be at once got up rowed out to meet boat conduct into little bay be almost dark when came within hailing distance what news do bring sir fabricius bad news regret to say think genoa will be able to send out galley for at least fortnight there have be civil dissension fighting between rival faction in consequence ship be dismantled laid up crew will have to be collected for repair executed officer chosen fortnight will be earliest time in can be here pisa have war galley unless pope sends out directly get news corsair will have own way have discovered yes lie few mile from here there be fifteen sixteen of two day ago two others joined that night have lost time indeed have scarce begun to expect sir fabricius added a knight two comrade stepped on board have done best knight said angrily be in rage with ill success have accomplished be that merchant vessel will put to sea at present at ostia must only send off message to rome to ask for order at pisa authority at first treated story a fiction believe took for impostor on news spreading knight came forward recognised then have meeting of council talked wrangled protested said that be absurd to suppose that must at moment notice fit out ship to cope with fleet of corsair sole idea be to man fort to repel attack however mounted messenger be sent off at once up down coast to give warning to inhabitant of town to put into posture of defence to villager to fly with wife family into interior a soon a saw galley of doubtful appearance approaching be there four hour then started for genoa there be almost panic there too a member of council be mostly merchant be filled with dismay for safety of ship good at sea of course there be thought that corsair however strong must venture attack upon genoa told that have captured three of corsair with single galley that if must send ten others must probably be able to make head against pirate a have told genoa be at peace with world war galley be laid up most of must need repair recaulking before must be fit to send to sea although maintained that more than week must elapse before must be ready to sail be right sure that will be double that time before be fitted out of course in genoa be well known though family estate lie near mantua acquaintance flocked round urged to stay until galley be ready for sea must not hear of six hour after arrival started again made voyage to corsica at good speed since then have have oar constantly out to help sail men have well earned pay can assure be enough to make one mad with rage to think that pirate will be able to harry coast of italy at pleasure for there can be little chance that will abide quiet much longer at rendezvous be annoying indeed gervaise agreed murmur of disappointment ran round assembled knight however have consolation that have done must be sure that will do so in future gervaise have charged ralph to say nothing about object of mission general supposition be that have sailed to endeavour to purchase bullock a supply of meat be nearly exhausted ralph have let drop few word to effect have indeed be charged by gervaise to bring off few ox if must be obtained without loss of time gervaise be on deck at midnight soon afterwards beat of oar be heard be still night one of knight on watch remarked to seems to sir gervaise that sound be confused one that there must be several vessel rowing will call up companion may be that be pirate fleet coming out need not do gervaise replied be expecting sir ralph to bring back with fishing boat for think can find use must have heard before if corsair have be putting out fosco be in boat watching mouth of inlet must have started with news have there be stir on board galley be quarter of hour before number of dark object entered little bay a soon a did so ceased rowing splash of anchor a fell into water be heard then came sound of boat oar ralph be soon alongside see that have succeeded ralph there be fear of failing when one be ready to pay full value of what one want to get have bought three coaster eight fishing boat have sufficient store of pitch oil with plenty of straw faggot there be difficulty in getting men to come with a soon a heard that fleet of eighteen moorish galley be in next bay be ready enough to aid in plan for destruction for knew well enough that of must be sure to make raid along coast sacking burning carrying off men woman child a slave said only wanted two men for craft so many be willing to come have thirty more than number asked for can divide among be strong active looking fellow will keep here then ralph see there be one twenty of knight in three prize a lost two in capture four others be not fit to put on armour have six twenty addition will be very welcome what be armed with have bow arrow long pike ax good have managed to collect more arm yes people be charcoal burner woodman in winter be therefore able to get together thirty forty ax hatchet will be ample with arm took from moor to equip ninety christian think can depend upon for fighting ralph think there be doubt about few of be pretty well worn out with labour suffering have gained strength spirit greatly in past week may be sure that will fight to death rather than run risk of turn in galley have got stuff to make mantle yes there be plenty of coarse black cloth wear in summer in winter of course be clad in sheepskin have sufficient white cotton cloth to make cross have only one thing to wish for now ralph be that corsair may not take into head to sail tomorrow fosco will bring news at daybreak will at once send boat off to watch mouth of bay when leaf if sail can not venture to attack a long a keep together odds be far too heavy only plan will be to follow at distance when can just keep upper sail in sight then to attack detachment may separate from main body hope will not come to gervaise must be hard indeed when have devised splendid plan have got everything ready to carry out if be to give slip do others know anything about yet thought better to keep silence till tomorrow doubt of galley slave understand enough of one other of language to gather what be on foot besides late captive might in satisfaction at thought of revenge say enough to to let know that attack on fleet be intended one of might in way free from iron swim ashore know there be small fishing village across island there must be difficulty in stealing boat making off with news say that risk be great still be better not to throw away even chance knight have turned in in very gloomy mood for caretto have returned with news that there be hope of assistance from genoa for fortnight seemed therefore that pain have be thrown away now may a well turn in until daylight chapter xv splendid exploit gervaise be up again at dawn be amused at wonder of knight a came up one by one at sight of little fleet anchored outside a soon a be fairly daylight sent off to three prize to request knight to come on board galley when be assembled there said be aware comrade that sir fabricius caretto have brought news that galley at genoa be laid up that will be fortnight before can put to sea long before that corsair will assuredly be ravaging village small town along coast of italy unless can prevent doing so must be simple madness to try to attack at sea of feel sure be conscious must be only throwing away life galley there be murmur of assent among knight be ready for encounter in there be chance however faint of success saw that for single galley to attack one of largest corsair fleet have ever set out must be nothing short of insanity leader word however seemed to show that have plan in mind by hoped to strike blow at enemy listened eagerly for what be coming have heard from comrade fosco that ship lie moored in two line side by side in narrow inlet have returned morning with news that be still there think that three four more have arrived during last two day be probable be waiting for three captured to join tonight be intention to attack not by rowing in boarding for must be hopeless yesterday sir ralph harcourt went a be aware to fetch provision be part only of object of trip have a see brought back eleven craft with may tell be laden with combustible pitch oil straw faggot will be rowed towed to inlet tonight set on fire launched against pirate enthusiastic cheer broke from knight saw at once lying a corsair be side by side destruction of many of be certain have also brought fisherman gervaise went on two three of whom will go in fire ship having boat towing behind in will escape a soon a craft be alongside galley galley three prize will take post at mouth of inlet fire of gun will add to confusion among pirate will endeavour to fall upon galley may extricate from mass try to make escape sir ralph have brought back material for making ninety mantle of order for christian on board three prize thirty fisherman to bring crew of galley up to full strength light of flame will suffice to show pirate that a will believe four vessel manned by knight of order be barring entrance many will may calculate jump overboard swim ashore rather than face will be able at rate to capture three four of craft for a come out one by one can close round with nearly fifty knight ninety released captive burning for vengeance fifty sixty fisherman for from fire ship will of course join will make short work of may even hope to entirely destroy fleet again joyous shout rose from knight must indeed be exploit that might be proud to share in breaking rank in have stood while gervaise addressed crowded round with exclamation of enthusiasm devotion now said a soon a silence be little restored knight of langues on board prize will send at once to coaster on left of other two sir ralph will go there now supply with material for making mantle for christian have brought thread fish bone needle will see that stuff be cut up into suitable length handed over to crew that man make up mantle there can be little sewing required for sleeveless gown need be carefully done great thing be that white cross will be conspicuous a soon a have set to work will examine state of arm see how many more be needed to complete list then send off to sir ralph who will furnish a many a be required fisherman have brought own weapon see that slave be well fed today before evening inspect well fetter so that may be free from anxiety a to attempt by to escape during conflict rest of will go on board native craft see that combustible be fairly distributed among wood straw soaked with pitch oil a also sail rope that deck be well coated be most important duty get torch made also so that there will be two on board craft be to be lighted last thing before get to point will be thrown down into straw faggot in hold by fisherman when get close to corsair can be prepared before morning meal when assemble here hope to receive report that everything be in readiness one of other coaster have bullock on board sir ralph will send one to of prize one to have better be killed cut up at once in order that crew may have two good meal today of fresh meat see that galley slave have share time be lost in carrying out order ralph a soon a cloth arm meat be distributed went round in boat to see that combustible be properly laid for firing everything done to insure that flame must spread rapidly sard shared in work ration wine be distributed to when knight sat down to meal on board galley be able to report that everything be in perfect readiness that work of sewing mantle be making good progress day passed slowly to young knight of whom be burning with excitement at thought of coming fray released christian be le exultant at prospect of taking vengeance for suffering have so long endured scene on board four ship be most animated after talking over with ralph gervaise told off three more of knight to of prize so that there must be ten on board reduced strength on board galley to seventeen a must have assistance of strong band of sard considered to be ample under circumstance be arranged that galley with one of prize must close with first corsair came out that other two prize must attack second after capturing be to assist other a circumstance might dictate gervaise strongly impressed upon knight in command of prize that be not single handed to attack corsair unless one of consort be near free to give assistance must run risk of reverse said be certain of destroying many of vessel of breaking up fleet be far better that few must escape than must run risk of losing ten of number to say nothing of have rescued from captivity in excitement of fight order must be strictly borne in mind victory must be marred by misfortune brought on by headstrong rashness corsair be bound to be very strongly manned ten knight even aided by such assistance a may get from christian might find altogether over matched against crowd of desperate men a soon a be dusk anchor be drawn up fleet got under way proceeded slowly for wind be light fishing boat moved heavily through water there be however occasion for speed for gervaise did not wish to commence attack until past midnight gun have be loaded before starting pile of ammunition be placed near presently wind nearly died out galley prize then took coaster fishing craft in tow be nearly one o'clock when got within mile of inlet tow rope be then thrown off fisherman got out sweep galley led way fire ship followed in body three prize brought up rear oar have be muffled slowly made way until fosco who be standing next to gervaise on board galley said that point just ahead marked entrance to inlet then stopped rowing until fire ship be close up be a have previously be arranged in two line five fishing boat manned by four men having small boat in tow behind formed first line three coaster with six men at oar three other fishing boat formed second torch be now lighted ralph took place in centre boat of first line gervaise went on board one of coaster order be given to men to row what wind there be be favourable blowing from northwest therefore right into inlet scarcely have first boat reached entrance when shout be heard row men hardest now ralph shouted sard bent to oar five boat advanced rapidly towards corsair a did so babel of shout cry rose from dark mass of ship swelled into tumult of alarm a on ralph order throw torch into straw flash of flame leapt up from boat five more stroke be alongside two outside ship a crashed heavily into men leapt from seat sprang over into small boat threw off painter rowed astern opening on hand to allow second line of fire ship to pas by gervaise direction divided three bore along on side of corsair then ran in among throwing grapnel to fasten fire ship alongside then a flame sprang up from hold crew betook to boat rowed out of inlet by time reached galley prize eleven fire ship be mass of flame be spreading to corsair lying packed together a be confusion be terrible number of men endeavoured to push off fire ship be too late others tried to extricate galley from mass throwing off hawser striving with hand oar to push vessel out of line a soon a boat be alongside galley gun of four vessel opened fire with grape into crowded ship now lit up by flame a clearly a at noontide while battle cry of order sounded high above din nothing can save ship near end of line ralph said of behind may make way out between others rock can see of there be lowering yard sail to prevent catching fire a pas knight distributed among gun worked incessantly directing fire chiefly against outside ship so a to hinder crew in endeavour to arrest progress of flame be soon able to fire impartially into mass a heat of flame drove pirate back score of men leapt overboard made for shore presently two three ship be seen making way along narrow line of water on side of flaming group in front a first advanced galley one of prize rowed short distance forward to meet deck be crowded with men among whom discharge of cannon from ship created terrible slaughter moment afterwards closed with one on side knight released captive sard sprang down on to deck fight lasted minute appalled by disaster have befallen by terrible effect of broadside poured in at few yard distance by sight of so many of dreaded warrior of cross of corsair threw down arm flung on deck into hold cry for quarter who resisted fell either under sword of knight vengeful ax of late captive pike of sard great bulk leaping from bow stern swam ashore back to ship gervaise shouted moment resistance ceased leave floating here will help to block way six vessel alone managed to make escape from blazing mass of ship of be captured almost a easily a first have be a soon a seemed that remainder be involved in flame boat be lowered sent on board prize to take possession save for wounded on deck be entirely deserted by crew a who have run below a soon a found that captor have left vessel dropped into water made way by swimming with assistance of oar to shore there remained only slave chained to bench few of have be killed by broadside gun have be aimed at poop forecastle where corsair be clustered together consequently number of galley slave who have fallen be comparatively small in none of galley be proportion of christian anything like so large a in three prize first taken greater portion being men of inland tribe who have be captured in warfare malefactor who instead of being executed have be sold to corsair nevertheless in six galley seventy christian be found at once freed be terrible to think that in galley have be destroyed large number of christian must have perished in flame gervaise expressed bitter regret that have not considered that attack by fire ship must necessarily involve loss of so many christian life ca be helped ralph said a gervaise poured out feeling to to very many of death must have be welcome if have not attacked a did have sailed for italy hundred if not thousand of christian must have be killed a many more carried away into captivity so see balance be in favour of course adopted gervaise admitted nevertheless regret at fate of so many unfortunate captive quite overpowered for time satisfaction at complete success have be achieved victory have be almost bloodless one on part of assailant few of knight have received wound two among christian crew have be killed four sard while two score have received wound more le serious a unlike knight have defensive armour while waiting for daylight to appear wound be dressed bandaged by knight in morning captured galley be towed out anchored short distance away then gervaise rowed up to head of inlet followed by other three ship found that eleven of corsair have be burnt to satisfaction discovered four uninjured galley lying there deserted save by slave seeing fate of comrade who have first issued out commander have instead of trying to escape rowed quietly to head of inlet movement being covered by flame smoke have there landed having laden with store for support on shore be great satisfaction to knight for not only did swell list of prize reduced by over thirty number of christian slave who have perished in flame taking galley in tow rowed out of inlet whose bank be strewn with half charred timber oar relic of fight a soon a have anchored by side of first prize council be held on board santa barbara be clearly impossible to take thirteen prize to rhodes for there must be three four knight to be to fall in with one moorish pirate might suffer great disaster while must meet with storm must fare badly indeed a must not depend upon rescued christian for management of sail oar in heavy weather at same time be most anxious that prize must be carried to rhodes never save a result of great battle have fleet of captured galley be brought in knight be prepared to endure danger rather than part with one of finally after much discussion be determined that must make for genoa from thence rescued captive must be able to find way to home great majority be italian spaniard former must proceed by land sea to respective home while spaniard must have long time to wait before vessel of own nationality entered port even if one be not lying there when arrived moreover in case must be necessary to despatch vessel to genoa in order that might be known that danger be averted that there be longer necessity for getting galley ready for sea chief ostensible reason however for going to genoa be that there must be difficulty in engaging a many sailor a might be necessary to take prize to rhodes underlying argument be reason ralph laughingly stated be very well to bring forward one argument after not one of have courage to say what be sure of have at bottom of heart know very well that want to go to genoa to enjoy triumph rhodians be very well there be very many more fair face at genoa fie sir knight such spirit be little in accordance with vow of order be not bound to humility here be longing for plaudit of noble lady of genoa of young knight laughed others coloured hotly need not be ashamed of feeling caretto said be not ardent desire of true knight to do gallant deed do not value above thing guerdon of applause from fair eye of lady comrade have performed gallant deed well deserve reward now sir gervaise if not for reason at rate for others have be brought forward suppose be agreed that sail for genoa for part be heartily glad that such be decision young knight of langue have many friend there in name be sure can promise reception a hearty sincere a will receive be settled that rescued captive must be divided equally among thirteen prize three knight must go in moorish captive be also divided equally among to aid with sail to row few oar in case of dead calm setting in command be distributed according to seniority three rescued italian knight remaining on board santa barbara with gervaise sard be anxious to return to village in order to carry news that several hundred of moorish pirate have landed will have great trouble with one of young fisherman who spoke little italian said to gervaise there be always great number of swine herd of goat up among forest on hill must send up drive in a many of a possible of course will send messenger to tempe will need very large force to combat pirate who will be able to come down plunder destroy then retire to hill whence will be hard to dislodge be sorry indeed that such trouble must have be caused to gervaise replied be afraid that can give assistance will hunt down in time sard said confidently there be many village scattered about tempe what with fisherman woodman charcoal burner will soon get strong body together besides know mountain must say that have best avoid pitched battle with keep on harassing by night day cutting off who separate from main body until at last be completely worn out will deal with sir knight be hunter for there be wild boar stag in forest wolf too wild sheep on higher mountain man among can use bow skillfully wield pike hatchet hunt will not be unprofitable for can get good price for take alive to work in mine hour later one of galley started with sard for village in bay of tempe after landing be to rejoin rest of fleet at former anchorage at madalena by be gathered there next morning set out for genoa wind be light in anxiety to return home a soon a possible released captive volunteered to take former place on bench vessel be kept going at fair rate of speed two day rowing took to bastia where approach created unbounded excitement until banner of order be seen floating from stern of santa barbara while smaller flag have be hastily manufactured flew from masthead of thirteen prize even then inhabitant feared to put out believing that flag be ruse number of fled at once with family valuable to mountain be not until boat be lowered ralph accompanied by three four other knight rowed ashore that panic be allayed a soon a be understood that galley of knight have not only captured thirteen corsair have destroyed eleven others have thus annihilated fleet be intended to prey upon commerce of italy ravage western coast alarm be succeeded by wildest enthusiasm by time ralph have obtained fresh meat store came ashore to purchase greater part of population be gathered on shore flotilla of boat put out with filled with picturesquely dressed men woman carried flag others green bough while lady have bouquet basket of fruit galley be first attraction mounting side lady presented offering of fruit while men cheered waved hat many musician came out in boat played on bagpipe three reeded flute succession of air peculiar to island gervaise received visitor on poop be at first altogether incredulous when told that be lad before who have commanded galley have performed remarkable feat have freed from terrible danger youth of knight of order le surprised have not gervaise assured that be altogether contrary to rule of order for knight to allow to be embraced many of lady must have taken form of showing enthusiasm gratitude next morning fleet started for genoa wind be much stronger than have be on previous day be therefore unnecessary for oar to be put out except indeed on board galley there at christian relieved slave for hour at bench next morning circle of hill round genoa with city nestling at foot on water edge climbing for distance up slope be in view caretto at once suggested that must be well to signal to fleet to lie to if do so said will assuredly think that be corsair fleet advancing to attack burn vessel in port may be saluted a approach by shower of cannonball if will permit sir gervaise will go forward in one of prize explain matter will return here in short time thank sir fabricius a such mischance a mention might indeed very well occur will lower sail lie here until return while caretto be away knight crew breakfasted former put on armour gayest attire in readiness for landing gervaise although with much inward vexation considered necessary to do same do wish said to ralph who be smiling at rueful face that must for today take place let pas a lieutenant must not mind at gervaise must put up with disagreeables a well a advantage of being commander must submit to be honoured feted here a well a getting end of credit at rhodes will have satisfaction of well deserving for be sure plan of attacking with fire ship must never have occurred to one else if have not be for must have have mortification of seeing sail off without being able to move finger to interfere with if one be fighting for fame honour must be true enough member of order whose sole object be to defend christendom from moslem must strive only to do duty care nothing for such thing a honour glory human nature be human nature see reason why one must despise honour glory when come to one in course of duty fancy will think so too gervaise in course of time be quite sure that among fifty knight there be not one who doe not feel well content that have not only done duty to order have gained share in credit honour will certainly be given to who have taken part in so crushing defeat of corsair a for myself for moment pretend be not sensible of fact that a second in command of galley chance of obtaining promotion in order be very greatly improved be nearly two hour before caretto returned be well indeed went in said to gervaise for city in uproar alarm bell of church be calling citizen to arm troop be being hurried down to fort battery rumour have of course exaggerated strength of fleet population believed that safety of city be menaced by approach of mighty squadron a soon a news be bruited abroad learned that fleet consisted solely of prize captured from moor by galley of order alarm quickly changed into delight sharp angry clang of bell be succeeded by peal of gladness joy of citizen at being relieved from cloud of anxiety have hung over city since last visit be unbounded went at once to council chamber where found many of leading citizen already assembled having be summoned in hot haste a soon a approach be made out at first be almost incredulous when told that ship of pirate fleet have be either destroyed captured that fleet in offing consisted entirely of galley thirteen corsair have captured a soon a really grasped fact sent off messenger to church to order joy bell to be rung to dockyard to arrest work upon galley then have to give short account of surprise destruction of corsair fleet finally begged to ask to delay entry to port for couple of hour in order that might have time to prepare suitable reception for suppose there be help for gervaise said be there anything that ought to do must decorate galley with flag on board must set one to work to make great flag with cross of order to hoist to masthead of prize instead of little thing be now flying under will hoist flag of corsair among be of tripoli tunis algiers know that there be aught else can do chapter xvi festivity at last fleet headed by galley to knight have returned rowed towards port gun flashed out from fort at entrance at once from other battery responded bell pealed out again

freedom le than two hundred christian captive among cavalier giacomo da vinci pietro forzi in name of republic sir gervaise tresham may say in of italy thank most heartily for splendid service that have rendered must have seemed to well nigh incredible that single galley even if commanded manned by most famous knight of great order must have accomplished so extraordinary feat still more strange be that must have be performed by so young knight with crew composed a sir fabricius caretto have told of knight chosen from among youngest of order give far more credit to highness than deserve gervaise replied three of ship be indeed captured in fair fight caught rest asleep massed together a to be incapable of successful resistance fell easy victim to fire ship launched against credit be due to be shared equally by subcommander here sir ralph harcourt indeed by knight of company doubtless may be so sir gervaise doge said with slight smile be to head plan rather than to hand strike that such success a have achieved be due credit of night attack be a cavalier caretto tell wholly yours for until issued final order seemed to to two good knight companion that there be naught to do to remain in port watch corsair fleet sail away to carry out work of destruction by time have reached poop of galley gervaise now called forward knight one by one presented to doge who expressed to gratitude felt by whole of citizen of genoa for service have rendered to republic ceremony being over knight broke up rank conversed for few minute with who have come on board with doge latter then

only sixteen of course join until later think that here entered at earliest age permitted almost have served in two three voyage in galley before be appointed to santa barbara reason why so young crew be chosen be that commander be also young have done such exceptional service to order that be appointed to command of galley have a will allow well justified choice be because be deemed inexpedient to place knight many year senior under command partly perhaps to encourage younger knight by giving exceptional opportunity of distinguishing that crew be chosen entirely from rank be selected a second in command because gervaise have be special friend when came out from england in same ship have before fought side by side against moslem see that wear gilded spur sir ralph lady said must therefore be dubbed knight yes have good fortune to be knighted by d'aubusson at same time that sir gervaise be also so honoured be for affair with turkish pirate be gervaise who really won honour for have share in affair save that of doing best in fight who must do more countess queried gervaise must do more countess a be shown in attack on corsair by mean of fire ship have head to plan in case speak of happy thought of not only saved life of ourselves sir john boswell indirectly be mean of preventing two of galley being captured by corsair be sir gervaise one of lady asked ralph smiled look round

do of fix on one think most accord with idea of what knight brave in action wise prudent in council must be like six lady fixed on one of young knight be wrong said ralph how can choose countess said laughingly when none of resemble ideal hero most of be pleasant courtly looking youth a yet there be vestige of hair on face one must not fancy of a destroyer of fleet of corsair do see one speaking to elderly lady in recess yes be wife of fragoso mean to say that lad be commander of galley why look youngest of be between seventeen eighteen there be several others who be older yes be sir gervaise knight commander of order of st john how can possibly have served time a professed knight be one of grand master page time in service counted just a must have done have entered a professed knight at fifteen therefore stood in same position a three four year older than speaks turkish a well a own tongue a told received accolade at hand of grand master year half ago be now knight commander will assuredly one day occupy one of highest post in order speak a if be jealous sir ralph yet methinks can not be pleasant for to have one younger than yourselves placed at head think there be one of who so feel ralph said earnestly in first place have performed excellent service in next place even who did not know before have felt since started that be born leader then too regard with pride one who have brought credit upon younger member of order moreover owe post in galley to fact that be chosen for command be difficult position for to fill have managed so that while obey order a cheerfully willingly a if be veteran when off duty regard a one of be staunch friend sir ralph be staunch friend of sir gervaise countess for more know of more care for well deserves promotion honour have fallen to share will bring across here to sir ralph want to talk to hero of yours be sure that daughter be longing to be introduced to ralph waited until gervaise be disengaged then brought across after introducing moved away at once leaving gervaise to be interrogated by lady must be accustomed to festivity sir gervaise for have just heard that be one of grand master page be accustomed to signora be not at same thing a liking reply be given so earnestly that lady smiled taste be quite exceptional do mean to say that must rather be on board galley than here must not be polite gervaise said with laugh if be to say must infinitely rather be on board indeed have not like most of comrade be brought up in court castle until day joined order led life of exile father belonged to defeated party in england save for few month when cause to be attached be triumphant lived quietly on estate have recovered life being one of care anxiety so see have training in gaiety pleasure at rhodes there be state reception religious pageant meeting such a be of course impossible in convent since be eleven year old think have only once spoken to woman so can well understand signora feel awkward in speech pray to make allowance for ignorance of language of courtesy such a must naturally be expected in knight even though belonging to religious order there be naught to make allowance for countess said gently woman can appreciate simple truth be not a men seem to think always yearning for compliment who be most proficient in turning phrase be not often among foremost in battle wisest in council can tell that woman value deed far higher than word sir fabricius caretto be cousin of mine have afternoon be speaking so highly of to young daughter here that be glad indeed to make acquaintance how long do intend to stay in genoa no longer than will take to engage men to carry prize to rhodes be afraid that sound rude broke off a noticed smile on face of lady not rude said countess though most knight must have put differently said that duty compelled to leave a soon a prize must be manned come to same thing of course will remain guest of doge a long a be here otherwise must have given greatest pleasure to have entertained cousin be of course staying with see feel very deep obligation to have be so long slave among moor that have almost come to hope death have freed from fetter so may imagine pleasure when arrived here so suddenly ten day ago be expecting that must remain with for time say that must first go back to rhodes after will ask for leave return here have banquet tomorrow evening to celebrate return earnestly hoped that must be present since say that care for such gaiety will if prefer be glad if will come to join at family meal at twelve thank countess must very greatly prefer will give real pleasure to come friend sir ralph harcourt have be telling how have destroyed corsair fleet have be so alarming too be englishman though speaks italian well yes speaks great deal better than do gervaise said be dear friend of mine be indeed chiefly owing to support influence have be able to manage so pleasantly well in command of body of young knight most of whom be senior tell that speak turkish yes thought that must be very useful spent nearly year in acquiring bailiff of langue being kind enough to relieve of other duty be fortunate enough to find in one of servant of auberge well educated widely informed turk who be very pleasant companion a well a excellent instructor learnt much from besides language knowledge of turkish have already proved to most useful be indeed mean by obtained commandery appointment a captain of galley perhaps will tell story tomorrow be if be too long to tell now be indeed much too long if will interest will be glad to recount tomorrow next day gervaise went to palace of countess da forli be widow with child except claudia young daughter who have accompanied to fete evening before caretto four five relation of family be only guest beside be quiet sociable meal served with le ceremony than usual a countess wished to place gervaise a much a possible at ease during meal little be said about affair with pirate caretto telling of experience a captive be well claudia said laughing that did not see at time be rescued for be such scarecrow that must never have be able to regard with due proper respect afterwards be so thin that bone almost came through skin be thin enough now cousin girl said have gained so much weight during last ten day begin to fear that will ere long get too fat to buckle on armour bad a thinness be be nothing to dirt moreover be coming near to losing voice there be nothing for to talk about in misery often day passed without word being exchanged between da vinci forzi do know felt almost more thankful for bath perfume than did for liberty be able at once to enjoy comfort of one while be time before must really assure that slavery be over be free man again now sir gervaise countess said when meal be over be turn claudia be longing to hear story to know how came to be in command of galley be almost a anxious caretto said did not like to ask question on board galley have be looking forward to learning when got to rhodes did indeed ask two knight who accompanied on mission here must only tell that one knew have performed very great service to order that concerned intended rising among slave detail being known to only few who have be understood told that be not to be repeated be very simple matter gervaise said although grand master council be pleased to take very favourable view of be in fact question of luck just a be surprise of corsair there be really secret about at least except in rhodes there be thought best not to speak of because fact that attempt among slave be almost successful might if generally known encourage others to try to escape perhaps with greater success told last night countess have only once before in last six seven year spoken to woman be on occasion that adventure so far a be concerned have commencement then beginning at visit with ralph harcourt to greek merchant family on roof of house recounted suspicion have entertained manner in be confirmed method by have discovered plot for rising be interrupted several time when attempted to abbreviate story to omit of detail there be exclamation of surprise at proposal to personate turkish prisoner to share lot of slave in prison on bench of galley have idea sir gervaise caretto said when have concluded that too have be galley slave understand now care showed to render lot of rower a easy a possible be splendid scheme well carried out indeed no longer wonder that be appointed to command of galley received rich commandery in england at hand of grand master what think countess did speak too highly in favour not one jot cousin why sir gervaise seems to that have be born two century too late that must have be knight errant instead of being sworn to obey order bound to celibacy do wear lady favour in helm know that not few of order do so a have said countess know lady who must bestow favour upon in second place be eighteen must be ridiculous for to think of such matter lastly seems to that being vowed to order can desire other mistress claudia who have listened with rapt attention to story whispered in mother ear latter smiled seems to sir gervaise went on after what have done for italy there be many fair maiden who must feel honour that colour must be borne by one who have shown so valiant knight see gage of kind doe not necessarily mean that there be deep feeling between knight who bear lady who bestows show only that on part feel honour that gage must be worn by distinguished knight on part that considers a somewhat more than compliment wear a proof of regard on part of one whose good opinion at least value be true that among secular knight may mean even more than ought not to mean more among knight of order like yours pledged to devote life to lofty holy aim daughter claudia whisper to that must deem honour indeed if must wear token accepting in spirit in have spoken be fourteen now a know maid of fourteen here be a old a one of sixteen seventeen in country gervaise turned to girl who be standing by mother chair looking earnestly at have noticed evening before have asked question have listened so intently that have felt almost embarrassed claudia be very bright face yet marked by firmness strength turned eye again to countess never thought of wearing woman favour said if daughter will bestow one upon will be proud to wear trust may carry unstained will feel honoured indeed that one so fair a be sure by face so deserving of devotion that knight of order can give have thought worthy of being one of on whom must bestow so high favour with confidence that must be ever borne with credit honour what will give mother claudia asked countess without shadow of embarrassment with gervaise have spoken not kerchief claudia in rough work of knight must not be kept without spot stain moreover if judge sir gervaise rightly methinks must prefer token that must wear without exciting attention remark from comrade go fetch of jewel may think fit then will give girl said unfastening thin gold chain wore round neck pulled up heart shaped ornament in pink coral set in gold pearl mother uttered low exclamation of dissent know mother be last gift prize far beyond anything have therefore be more fit to be token then turned to gervaise went on without slightest tremor in voice accession of colour in cheek sir gervaise tresham bestow upon favour will deem honour indeed to know that be borne by one so brave worthy said that must be glad to be one of who bore favour will be more than for vow to that while live other knight will wear favour of mine claudia mother said disapprovingly know what be saying mother have often wondered why maiden must so carelessly bestow favour upon knight who begged for have said to myself that when time came must grant once only then to one whom deemed worthy of in way one in whose loyalty honour must trust implicitly who must regard a something sacred deeming honour to wear a being pledge of trust esteem kneel sir gervaise while fasten round neck gervaise took out small brooch fastened collar of silken doublet then knelt on one knee girl fastened clasp round neck a rose hid heart beneath doublet fastened collar lady claudia said earnestly accept favour in spirit in bestow so long a live will prize value beyond honour may gain a feel next to heart will ever recall to that gave a pledge of esteem trust will strive to utmost so to bear may be worthy of gift none of others spoke while little ceremony be being performed caretto glanced at countess with amused smile latter looked grave somewhat vexed however made effort to dispel cloud on face when gervaise ceased speaking said have be somewhat more serious business than intended sir gervaise think that regret in way course have taken 't be well for maiden on threshold of womanhood that must place before lofty ideal that must entertain warm feeling of friendship for one worthy of so also be good for young knight to know that have trust confidence of pure innocent maiden knowledge will aid to be in way true to vow have taken to remember always that be bound to be not only valiant knight of order sincere soldier of cross then went on more lightly have heard sir gervaise that there be question of making noble of genoa indeed gervaise replied in great surprise idea never entered into thought nevertheless know that be spoken of last night although have not yet be finally settled will not be until council meet afternoon must not tell if did not think that be a good a agreed upon be pleased to be first to whisper to that be intended to bestow upon honour be jealously guarded seldom granted even to crowned head unless a token of gratitude for signal service done to republic must feel most honoured most grateful countess for so extraordinary favour did feel have done extraordinary action to merit there can be doubt that destruction of corsair have saved genoa maritime town from immense loss by damage to trade by raid must have be made at various point on coast can not see that mere fact that have destroyed fleet merit marked honour be caught in trap half of burned might have be done equally a well by sardinian fisherman unarmed without aid a to fighting be of small account first three craft captured offered much stouter resistance lost two of number in other affair knight be killed even seriously wounded believe countess feel absolutely ashamed at fuss be made over seems to that be sort of impostor obtaining credit under false pretence man be fair judge of own action sir gervaise caretto said man may believe solon roland others may consider a fool empty braggart must be taken that general opinion of public be judgment from there be appeal be not mob of genoa only who regard service that have rendered a extraordinary be opinion of councillor authority of republic of who like have borne share in warfare that not only be service great that be due to singular ability with in command of only single galley have wholly destroyed captured fleet threatened commerce a councillor therefore competent judge be unanimous in opinion that have deserved highest honour that genoa can bestow upon be useless for to set up own opinion to contrary take good thing fall to sir gervaise be thankful be seldom that men obtain more honour than deserve while very often happens that deserve far more than obtain fortune have doubtless share in man career when be not once several time that knight gain special credit for deed have performed may be sure that fortune have le to do with matter than personal merit three time have earned special credit upon first occasion grand master mean judge of conduct character deemed worthy of secular knighthood honour have not in memory be bestowed at rhodes upon young knight on second be promoted to command of galley though never before have such command be given to save knight of long experience now for third time councillor of one of greatest of italian city be about to do honour be good to be modest sir gervaise be better to underestimate than to overrate one own merit be not well to carry feeling to extreme be quite sure that in case disclaimer be wholly sincere unaffected take advice accept honour world may pay a not undeserved determining only in mind that if deem excessive will at least do in power to show that be not ill bestowed will not trust take counsel amiss on contrary sir fabricius gervaise said warmly be really boy yet though by good fortune pushed strangely forward be glad indeed to receive council from knight of vastly greater experience than in future however much may be conscious in own mind that anything have done be greatly overrated will at least abstain from protest now countess must pray to excuse know sir ralph harcourt be before down at dockyard waiting coming to engage sailor will come tomorrow at same time hope sir gervaise a claudia sworn knight have now claim upon for short time that remain here must regard a home although must necessarily remain guest of doge be fine young fellow indeed caretto said after gervaise have left there be affectation about modesty really considers that success have gained be solely stroke of good fortune of course have be asking many question about of young knight of own langue harcourt among tell that be always in earnest in everything undertakes be without rival among younger knight of convent in skill in arm for strength activity in exercise seems to care nothing for ordinary amusement in join at rhodes for nine month be scarcely ever seen by in auberge save when gathered for meal so continuously did work to acquire perfect command of turkish how thoroughly succeeded be evident from fact that be able to live among galley slave without exciting suspicion in mind that be other than pretended to be syrian captive that be brave go without saying though perhaps braver than majority of companion extraordinary thing about be although a say little more than boy have coolness to plan head to carry out scheme must do credit to most experienced captain be already credit to order must live will assuredly rise to highest office in may even die grand master in stormy time be coming on there will be ample opportunity for still further to distinguish to fulfil singular promise of youth that posse great tact a well a other quality be shown by enthusiasm with companion regard in case among to whom have spoken have discerned smallest jealousy of tact be needed to stand thus among fifty young knight almost senior in age will assuredly enable later on to command confidence affection of older men when other guest have left caretto only remained countess turned to claudia went too far claudia be willing enough when asked that must bestow favour upon most young knight wear favour may be sign of devotion far more frequently be piece of gallantry in case of knight hospitaller can only be latter be in case merely sign that have so distinguished that maiden feel pride that gift must be carried into battle by on part that too be proud of gift so bestowed by one whose goodwill prize in way be willing that must grant favour manner in gave be far more serious than occasion warranted promise to grant similar favour to a long a lived surprised may almost say shocked be according to custom here considered almost woman have not sir gervaise belonged to religious order be of presuming disposition might well have gathered meaning from word far beyond what intended have even entertained presumptuous hope that be not indifferent to merit in present case of course harm be done still methinks that must be far better have word be unspoken cousin here will be sure agree with caretto did not speak stood playing with moustache waiting for claudia reply girl have stood with downcast eye while mother be speaking only expressed what felt mother said after pause think that sir gervaise tresham be likely to misunderstand seems to that never among whom have met have seen one so worthy praise can be higher than with cousin have spoken of have rescued whom dearly love from slavery have saved genoa from great disaster many town village from plunder ruin do indeed feel proud that knight must wear gage be there no other reason must be unwilling that so long a carried must posse similar one from be sure that sir gervaise will have felt that be meaning of word wished to see that be not favour lightly given by girl who might few week hence bestow similar one upon be gage seriously given of honour in held very well said claudia caretto broke in before countess must reply warrant young knight will not misunderstand gift that will prize highly carry nobly be not one of who will boast of favour display time except perhaps to friend sir ralph harcourt will wager never tell soul who be donor when claudia shortly afterwards left room said to countess excuse for breaking in agatha felt that be much better to agree with not to make overmuch of matter be just of age to make one hero must hardly have chosen better subject for worship in first place be knight of st john in second be going away in few day perhaps tomorrow may never cross path again thought of will prevent fancy from straying for time keep heart whole until decide on suitor for hand nevertheless must rather that have not be so claudia be not given to change may last long enough to cause trouble when bring forward suitor speak of well in case might be worse caretto said philosophically then with smile in answer to look of inquiry knight of order have ere now obtained release from vow fabricius countess exclaimed in shocked voice yes know agatha that child be one of richest heiress in italy for very reason need not that husband must have wide possession in other respect must wish for better will assuredly be famous knight be sort of man to make perfectly happy lastly know can not forget that owe liberation from slavery to at rate agatha a said before may never cross path again may year two hence find perfectly amenable to wish chapter xvii captured upon following day doge requested gervaise to accompany to meeting of council upon entering grand hall found not only member of council assembled in robe of office large gathering of noble principal citizen of genoa together with knight of galley whom under ralph harcourt order gervaise found to surprise drawn up in order across hall here in name of republic battista fragoso announced to that by unanimous decision of council have be elected noble of genoa honour added on only one two previous occasion in history of republic bestowed upon of princely rank have nobly earned by great service have rendered to state name be then inscribed in book containing name title of noble of genoa next battista fragoso presented with superb suit of milanese armour a own personal gift then with casket of very valuable jewel a gift of city of genoa presentation be accompanied by plaudit of assembly by le warm acclamation of knight ralph be then called forward presented with suit of armour little inferior to given to gervaise knight received heavy gold chain of finest workmanship of genoa two day later preparation for departure be complete sufficient number of men be engaged to man prize charge also genoa took upon put on board much stronger crew than gervaise deemed necessary for navigation of ship weather be fine wind favourable quick passage be made to rhodes when harbour be in sight ship be ordered to proceed in single file galley leading way with huge banner of order floating from stern smaller flag on staff at side be not until passed by two fort guarding entrance that flag fluttering at masthead of prize afforded to on intimation of event have taken place even then none supposed that fleet of prize have be taken by one galley headed a santa barbara slowly rowed up harbour state barge of grand master put off to meet d'aubusson with party of knight soon stepped on board welcome back sir gervaise although little expected to see return so soon what be meaning of procession follows by rig appearance be moor how come to be thus sailing in wake be mystery to be moor excellency form part of expedition fitted out by corsair of algiers tripoli tunis other piratical stronghold for purpose of destroying commerce ravaging coast of western italy fortunately fell in with ship have be plundered by three of on way north learned from dying captain who be only one of crew left with life on board direction be taking something of nature of expedition pursued three galley came up with have good fortune to capture then have delight of finding among rower noble knight fabricius caretto giacomo da vinci pietro forzi grand master knight with uttered exclamation of joy a three knight named stepped forward embraced with liveliest pleasure dear caretto grand master exclaimed be almost resurrection for have long mourned a dead return to at present time be indeed fortunate for upon whose judgment aid must better rely than of old comrade in arm then turning to gervaise went on be daring brilliant exploit indeed sir gervaise in due time will be paid to brave companion to whom to now tender thanks of order tell rest briefly for must fain hear from noble knight old friend story of what have befallen tale be very brief one highness cavalier caretto sailed at once in swift craft from south of sardinia to carry warning to city on coast of italy of danger threatened in order that war galley might be despatched by genoa to meet corsair fleet during absence discovered little inlet in pirate lay hidden waiting doubtless arrival of three ship have captured to commence operation on return of knight with news that must be at least fortnight before genoa must fit out galley fearing that pirate might at moment put to sea procured small sardinian craft fitted a fire ship with captive have rescued sard fisherman manned three prize distributing knight between at night launched fire ship against corsair whose ship be crowded together eleven of be burnt six captured a endeavoured to make way out took possession of four others whose crew have run ashore deserted none escaped exclamation of astonishment almost of incredulity broke from knight be possible sir gervaise that thirteen vessel that follow be prize captured by galley alone be a have honour to tell highness capture except in case of first three be due almost solely to good fortune to position in found almost incapable of defence what think knight comrade grand master said to companion there be of who deemed rash to entrust galley to so young commander so youthful crew what say now never in annals of order have sight be witnessed a of thirteen prize being brought in by single galley to say naught of eleven others destroyed caretto comrade must have have share in marvellous victory by mean italian replied beyond having honour of aiding to carry out order of sir gervaise tresham commander of galley plan be wholly of own devising execution solely due to arrangement of detail without slightest suggestion on part of myself comrade will presently narrate to whole story will come better from lip than from of sir gervaise whose disposition be to wholly underestimate merit of action have performed must also bear testimony not only to bravery displayed by sir gervaise sir ralph harcourt lieutenant one of knight crew to admirable discipline order good fellowship on board galley must have done credit to most experienced commander to most veteran knight of order grand master paused moment then said in loud voice sir gervaise tresham sir ralph harcourt knight of seven langues of order a yet can hardly appreciate full extent of service that have rendered thanked now for capture of three corsair what can say when learn that have destroyed taken whole fleet invite to banquet will hold tonight where cavalier caretto will relate to detail of marvellous exploit within few minute after return of grand master party ashore flag of order be run up to flagstaff of fort bastion bell of church chimed out triumphant peal salute be fired from gun of three water fort while along wall facing port townspeople waved numberless gay flag a welcome to galley most of knight went ashore at once gervaise under excuse that wished to see that everything be in order before landing remained on board until be time to go to banquet being sure that by time knight must have fully told story at respective auberge that there must be no more question to answer banquet differed little from at genoa gervaise be heartily glad when be over next day grand master sent for if judge rightly sir gervaise thing will best please at present be order to put to sea again at once to conclude usual period of service of galley be indeed gervaise replied earnestly must be glad sir if will allow that time must begin to count afresh from present start have really have short period of service for wasted week at genoa ten day on journey back here so that have have really no more than month active service yes if count only by time d'aubusson said with smile reckoning by result have done good five year cruise however so small request can certainly be granted place of two knight who be killed of four others whose wound be reported to a being too severe for to be fit for service for time will be filled up at once from langues to belonged will cruise among western island whence complaint have reached of corsair who have be plundering burning sometimes be heard of a far north a negropont at others be off south of morea then again hear of among cyclades have be unwilling to despatch galley for there be ample employment for one here after blow have struck on moorish corsair be likely to be quiet for little have best therefore try for time if can not come across pirate must let know how much paid for vessel used a fire ship to sard be expense chargeable to general service may tell that to be due that recognition of exploit such a genoa bestowed upon will be made at council morning be urged that signal mark of honour must be granted interposed saying that have already received exceptional promotion that must not be for good that of order for so young knight to be raised to official position of character usually held by senior be perfectly sure must prefer remaining in command of galley to promotion must retain on island indeed must highness wish to gain experience to do service to order so far from pleasing promotion must trouble distress must have be done must most gladly have sent home prize instead of going to genoa must myself have continued cruise so cavalier caretto told grand master replied very well then in three day will set out again admiral tell that never before have galley returned with slave in such good health condition that unquestionably plan of erecting awning to shelter from midday heat night dew have have most beneficial effect on health have recommended general adoption three day later santa barbara again left port be soon upon station for week cruised backwards forward along coast among island often heard of pirate ship effort to find be unavailing one evening there be sign of change of weather by morning be blowing furious gale from north in spite of effort of rower galley narrowly escaped being driven ashore at last gained shelter of island anchored under lee slave being utterly worn out by continuous exertion a soon a gale abated again put to sea after proceeding for mile saw ship cast up on shore people must be made out on board of white flag be raised must have be driven ashore during gale gervaise said will row in to within quarter of mile of see what can do for a soon a anchor be dropped boat be lowered will go ralph for will be glad to set foot on shore again there must be people on island wonder none of have come to aid of poor fellow suppose village be on other side of island have not yet heard of wreck gervaise asked three of knight to accompany boat rowed by galley slave be soon on way be glad at change afforded to monotony of life on board at prospect of scamper on shore there be five six men to be seen on deck of wreck have a boat approached come down to rock a if to meet who came to aid a knight leapt out threw suddenly upon with knife scimitar have hitherto be concealed beneath garment while at same moment crowd of men appeared on deck of ship leaping down ran forward with drawn sword two of knight fell dead before have time to draw weapon third shook off two assailant for minute kept at bay others rushing up cut down gervaise have received slight wound before realised what be happening snatched

muley who be head of household gervaise resisted impulse to thank new master followed in silence be first taken to bathroom furnished with abundance of hot cold water muley uttered exclamation a on gervaise throwing off bernouse saw that flesh be mass of bruise after filling bath with hot water motioned to gervaise to get in lie there until returned be time before came back bringing pot of ointment bandage be only on body that wound needed dressing for here blow have fallen on naked skin when have dressed muley went out returned with turkish garment consisting of pair of baggy trouser of yellow cotton white shirt of same material sleeveless jacket of blue cloth embroidered with yellow trimming pair of yellow slipper completed costume muley now took into room where set before dish of rice with meat gravy large piece of bread wooden spoon gervaise ate food with deep feeling of thankfulness for fate have thrown into such good hand then after taking long draught of water rose to

apartment where lady two girl be sitting on divan be slightly veiled a gervaise afterwards learnt ben ibyn be not moor berber people who keep woman in close confinement a do moor allow to go abroad freely without being entirely muffled up khadja merchant said be christian slave purchased today have for long time desired one not until now have found one who must thought satisfy expectation what think of be noble looking youth truly isaac with fair wavy hair grey eye white skin truly neighbour will envy such possession have often seen christian slave before have always be broken down dejected looking creature one bear like warrior rather than slave be warrior be one of terrible knight of rhodes whose very name be terror to turk whose galley be feared even by boldest corsair must be of approved valour for be commander of one of galley girl looked with amazement at gervaise have often heard tale of capture of ship have sailed from tripoli by galley of christian knight have pictured fierce warrior a of almost supernatural strength valour that youth whose upper lip be shaded with slight moustache must be one of struck a being almost incredible doe not look ferocious father one of said look pleasant good tempered a if must injure one yet morning daughter braved unarmed anger of corsair on deck of own ship when pirate called upon men to seize threw one overboard struck two more on to deck needed eight men to overpower hope wo get angry with younger girl exclaimed gervaise must not suppress laugh then turning to merchant said in turkish must ask pardon for having concealed from knowledge of tongue kept secret from on board corsair meant to have done same here deeming that if none knew that spoke language must greatly aid must ever see opportunity of making escape ben ibyn have behaved so kindly to that feel must not be honourable to keep secret from to allow lady to talk freely before thinking be altogether ignorant of what be saying have acted well honourably ben ibyn said putting hand on shoulder kindly have heard much of character of order that though valiant in battle knight be courteous chivalrous deeming deceitful action to be unworthy of binding by vow to succour distressed to be pitiful to weak have heard that wounded be tended by in hospital with a much care a men of own race religion that in many thing knight be to be admired even by who be foe see now that report be true although a say might be of advantage to that none must know speak arabic yet be from spirit of honourable courtesy have now told that do so did not tell wife went on turning to that reason why bearded hassan today be because corsair brutally struck little female captive thus see at risk of life when captive carried out vow to protect defenceless now wife there be one thing must know for time at rate must abandon idea of exciting envy of friend by exhibiting christian captive to a be aware sultan have choice of one slave may select from batch brought in assuredly must choose one did come to ear to ear of one of officer that christian knight have be landed for reason hassan sold to for le sum than must otherwise have demanded must for time keep presence here secret idea be that will remain indoors until move next week into country house where will be comparatively free from observation certainly isaac must not on account that must be handed over to sultan for must either be put into galley have to labour in street will tell muley to order other slave to say nothing outside of fresh arrival so for present there be fear of being talked about in town hassan will for own sake keep silent on matter have not yet asked name went on turning to gervaise name be gervaise tresham will be easier for to call by first name only then gervaise be well that retired to rest at once for be sure that sorely need touched bell on table told muley when appeared to conduct gervaise to place where be to sleep be have already ordered apart from quarter of other slave young fellow be mass of bruise ben ibyn said to wife when door closed behind gervaise hassan beat so savagely after have overpowered bound that well nigh killed exclamation of indignation burst from wife daughter muley have seen to wound went on will doubtless be cured in few day now wife that wish be gratified have purchased christian slave for may ask what be going to do with be sure know said in tone of perplexity have thought of having to hand round coffee when friend call perhaps to work in garden did not think that must be anything like be reason why must not do so ben ibyn said christian hear treat woman a if be superior being feel dishonour to wait upon think can not do better than carry out plan be certain there be sort of work that must prefer to therefore let be understood that be to be own personal attendant that when have occasion for service will work in garden only for present let of friend see must spread news like wildfire in week soul in town must know that have good looking christian slave sultan officer must be sending for to ask how obtained must put turban on one who caught glimpse of hair of however far distant must know that

stain skin at present will pas a nubian will avoid question talk lord will wonder that can not speak tongue must pas among a mute indeed speaks arabic a well a do muley man uttered exclamation of surprise have intended to conceal knowledge ben ibyn went on must have be politic when found that intention be kind told that knew tongue now revealed knowledge a thought must be dishonourable to listen to talk leaving under impression that must not understand truly christian be strange men muley said youth who have not yet grown hair on face be nevertheless commander of war galley be ready to risk life on behalf of slave can strike down men with unarmed hand be a gentle in manner a woman now seems can talk arabic although be in power to keep secret tell rather than overhear word be not meant for ear truly be strange people frank will prepare stain in morning lord complete disguise before of others see next morning muley told gervaise that master thought that must be safer more convenient for to pas a dumb nubian slave gervaise thought plan excellent one be soon transformed muley shaving that part of hair must have shown below turban then staining deep brownish black from waist upwards together with foot leg up to knee darkening eyebrow eyelash moustache save that lip lack thickness nose be straighter than of nubian one must doubt that be one of race be of little consequence a many of be of mixed blood though retaining dark colour have feature that in outline resemble of arab now will take to ben ibyn so that may judge whether further change be required before servant slave see be excellent merchant said when have carefully inspected gervaise must pas without recognizing now can take into servant quarter muley tell that be new slave whom have purchased that henceforth will be duty to wait upon wife to whom have presented a special attendant that will accompany daughter when go abroad to make purchase visit friend give reason if can think of one why have bestowed in chamber separate from rest gervaise at once took up new duty hour later carrying basket followed into town be strange to thus to be walking among fanatical moor who have known damage that have inflicted upon galley must have torn in piece none gave however more than passing look nubian slave be uncommon sight in town in wealthy moorish family be commonly employed in place of trust especially a attendant in harem lady be now a closely veiled a moorish woman being only in house that followed berber custom gervaise have learnt from muley that ben ibyn be one of richest merchant in tripoli trading direct with egypt syria constantinople besides carrying on large trade with berber tribe in interior returned to house with basket full of provision having handed over to cook went to private apartment a khadja have requested to do here daughter asked innumerable question a to country custom then about rhodes order to belonged surprise be great when heard that knight be bound to celibacy why must not marry if like why must not have wife child home like other people khadja asked be that may devote whole life to work home be convent at rhodes at one of commandery scattered over europe where take charge of estate of order why must not marry then gervaise at rhodes there might be danger for woman child when return to europe to take charge of estate surely must do duty worse for having wife gervaise smiled did not make rule of order lady have thought that although so long a be doing military work at convent be well that must not marry yet there be good reason why when established in commandery at home must not like other knight noble marry if so plea in evening merchant returned from store be situated down by port soon after came in sent for gervaise there be question have intended to ask last night said escaped more than two month since there sailed from port others many vessel not ship of state corsair in more than twenty ship started with intention of making great raid upon coast of italy word have since be received of friend here be becoming very uneasy more so a hear that at tunis algiers have news be received have heard at rhodes of moorish fleet having be ravaging coast of italy have friend on board ship sailed from here interest in venture ben ibyn merchant shook head berber said be not like moor have little to do with sea save by way of trade for regret that corsair ship be constantly putting out be not for doings might trade with port of france of spain italy be on good term with there be reason why because faith be different must be constantly fighting be true that turk threaten europe be even now preparing to capture rhodes be question of religion turk be warlike ambitious have conquered syria war with egypt persia moorish state be small have thought of conquest might live peaceably with europe be not for hatred excited against by corsair in case can tell truth thirteen of ship be taken into rhodes a prize other eleven be burnt not one of fleet escaped exclamation of surprise broke from ben ibyn wife daughter be astonished indeed merchant said be reported here that genoese galley be laid up be thought that must be able to sweep sea without opposition to bring home vast spoil many captive from ship took from many of village small town of coast how came misfortune to happen to will create consternation here when be known for although be not state enterprise sultan almost rich moor embarked money in fitting out of ship be to have share in spoil taken how happened that so strong fleet be taken destroyed without even one vessel being able to get away to carry home news of disaster fortune be against gervaise said three ship on way up be captured by galley of order commander having obtained news of whereabouts of spot where corsair be to rendezvous found lying together in small inlet launched against number of fishing boat fitted out a fire ship corsair packed closely together be unable to avoid a told eleven of ship be burnt four be run ashore to avoid flame while six trying to make way out be captured by galley aided by three prize be taken knight have caused to be manned by sard way of allah seeing be wonderful merchant said be indeed marvellous feat for one galley thus to destroy great fleet be result of good fortune rather than skill valour gervaise said nay nay let praise be given where be due be marvellous feat although there be good bad fortune in event deed must not have be performed must not even have be thought of save by great commander who be knight who thus with one galley alone destroyed strongly manned fleet from great thing have be looked for gervaise hesitated be young knight said of little standing in order whose name be entirely unknown outside rank by time must be well known ben ibyn said will soon be known throughout christendom will be dreaded by moor what be gervaise again hesitated must not have told story at ben ibyn have supposed must have cared to inquire into matter of course will tell name if insist upon must much rather did not ask why merchant asked in surprise if hear not from will assuredly hear ere long from others for will be brought by trader who be in communication with italy can not understand why must thus hesitate about telling name of commander when known will doubtless be cursed by thousand of moorish wife mother berber be race none of friend kindred be on board fleet trader have rather reason to rejoice for in first place so severe lesson will keep corsair in port for long time in second have fleet succeeded according to general expectation so great store of european good must have be brought home that market must have be glutted good in storehouse must have lost value what reason then can possibly have in refusing to tell name of commander who have won for such credit glory gervaise saw that ben ibyn be seriously annoyed at what deemed unaccountable obstinacy will tell ben ibyn rather than excite displeasure though must much have preferred not to do so for speak so much more highly of affair than merit have honour of being in command of galley lady broke into exclamation of surprise while merchant regarded with grave displeasure have thought truthful said pass belief dost tell that beardless youth must with one galley overcome great fleet commanded by most noted captain on coast thought that must not believe gervaise said quietly therefore must have much preferred to keep silence knowing have mean of supporting claim be not only reason other be that already great deal too much have be said about affair in a have told owed everything to good fortune be heartily sick of receiving what consider altogether undue praise ah exclaimed suddenly thought have just occurred to of way by can obtain confirmation of story a value good opinion must not be regarded a boaster liar entreat to take heard tell eight men who be rower in boat when be captured to call upon today that might do something for came morning to store merchant said told wish promised must make inquiry about ship sailing east be to come to again tomorrow then sir beseech to suffer to go down with to store meet there galley of be in command at time be captured be same a in few week before fought corsair eight men be with at time begged for sake to maintain absolute silence a to affair have doubt that have done so for in fury news must excite might fall victim to first outburst though of course wholly innocent of share in misfortune did question without being present might still keep silent fearing to injure if before begin to do so tell that can speak truth with reference to will be sure confirm story incredible a may now appear to be fair offer merchant said gravely accept for may be have be too hasty trust may prove so must rather find to be in fault than that esteem with have inspired must prove to be misplaced will speak further on subject now have not yet asked how be that come to speak language so well gervaise related how have studied with suleiman ali have escorted to syria received ransom have hoped said that corsair must have taken to syria for there must have communicated with suleiman who must be sure have given such shelter aid a be able in event of making escape from slavery finding unable to leave by sea next day gervaise went with ben ibyn to store eight men arrived shortly afterwards merchant in presence of gervaise questioned a to whether knew anything of misfortune be said to have befallen ship have sailed for coast of italy men surprised at question glanced at gervaise who said tell ben ibyn truth will do neither harm will be mentioned by to one else accordingly story be told ben ibyn listened gravely be will of allah said when be concluded have wronged gervaise tale seemed too marvellous to be true speak of to others went on to eight men now a to yourselves for four of who desire to return to syria have taken passage in trader sail tomorrow will touch at joppa acre here be money to provide yourselves with garment to carry to home for said to two who be native of town can myself find employment here if conduct be good will have reason to regret taking service with two of who desire to go to smyrna will give passage there in ship will sail next week in meantime here be money for present want two day later merchant family moved to house two mile outside town here gervaise remained for six month life be not unpleasant one be treated with great kindness by merchant wife duty be slight have more labour to perform in garden than cared to do nevertheless felt that must rather have fallen into hand of le kind master for seemed to that must be act almost of treachery to escape from who treated a friend moreover at country house be not in position to frame plan for escape have decided upon attempting must have found out when hassan made one of occasional visit to port one evening merchant returned from town accompanied by one of sultan officer four soldier ben ibyn be evidently much depressed disturbed told muley a entered to fetch gervaise when latter in obedience to order came in from garden officer said in italian having come to ear of sultan master that merchant ben ibyn have ventured contrary to law to purchase christian slave brought secretly into town have declared slave to be forfeited be commanded to take at once to slave quarter be at sultan order gervaise said bowing head master have be kind one be grateful to for treatment of gervaise although taken aback by sudden change in fortune be not so cast down a might otherwise have be must now be free to carry out plan for escape that might devise by being addressed in italian be evident to that knowledge of turkish be unsuspected when among other slave have always maintained character of mute be only when alone in master family that have spoken at have doubt that betrayal be due to one of gardener who have several time shown sign of ill will being doubtless jealous of immunity enjoyed from hard labour who must thought have crept up overheard conversation in case be singular that fact of knowledge of turkish have not be mentioned gervaise afterwards learned that ben ibyn have be fined heavy sum for breach of regulation be now placed between soldier marched down to town without being allowed to exchange word with merchant on arrival there be taken to slave quarter here clothes be stripped from be given in place ragged shirt trouser then turned into room where fifty slave be lying of about half be european rest malefactor who have

replied have be passing under disguise have unfortunately be detected so see here be mystery explained questioner have further interest in matter gervaise picking out vacant place on stone floor sat down looked round room although large be roughly built have doubtless be erected with view to present purpose there be only few window be small strongly barred twelve foot above floor not easy to get out of gervaise said to at least not easy without aid with moslem here be clear that nothing can be done be roused at daybreak next morning be taken out to work under guard of six armed moor two overseer provided with long whip accompanied work consisted of cleaning street working on road at time of carrying stone for use of mason employed in building addition to palace of sultan be work to

let man pick out gang have worked in turn with of must know what can do besides be necessary that must have men who can understand order gervaise accordingly be allowed to pick out gang chose whom have observed to be strongest most handy at work will be responsible governor said to for mason being supplied with stone if fail will be punished put to other labour so far from there being falling

good friend suleiman ali for reason of own be not desirous of being ransomed at present especially at cost must feel bound in honour to repay to therefore pray to write to saying that while thank from heart for kindness be not able to avail of in first place be well treated here position be not unpleasant one secondly sum required for ransom be altogether preposterous thirdly be not without hope may day find other mean of freeing without so great sacrifice lastly have reason can not mention why at present must not quit tripoli even be free tomorrow can tell that be reason most of weighs with however pray let sultan know have refused to be ransomed for might think be meditating escape must order extra precaution to be taken to prevent doing so will also see ben ibyn thank from for having

unmolested free from insult that boy beggar hurl at christian master mason nodded approvingly when answer be translated to be wise step said for truly hatred of christian be very strong among lower class especially since became known that galley sailed from here nearly two year ago be with fleet from so much be expected utterly destroyed be well then that must pas unnoticed for be there tumult in street might lose life must lose best labour overseer have ever have thus then a gervaise walked through street on first occasion of obtaining liberty attracted attention whatever when saw ben ibyn approaching stepped out to meet merchant looked in face for moment failed to recognise then exclaimed suddenly be gervaise ah son be indeed rejoiced to see have spoken of so often at home sorely did wife daughter grieve when be torn from did not dare to send message to for sultan pretended great anger against used opportunity to squeeze hardly have frequently made inquiry about be glad indeed to find even in prison received promotion have be otherwise have found that be in misery must have endeavoured whatever risk to aid to escape have indeed nothing to complain of be sorry to learn that have suffered on account have ever learned how came about be denounced indeed must have given much to know assuredly dog whoever be must have be made to suffer be hassan villain met when be with gang boasted that be who have sent there have told news to official who have of course repeated to sultan doubtless concealed own share in matter otherwise too must next time returned here have have to pay for part in will make pay more heavily than sultan must ben ibyn said sternly will speak to friend among merchant henceforth berber will buy aught from have hitherto be best customer let not waste time in speaking of wretch how come that be walking freely in street of tripoli can see that face be stained although be no longer nubian gervaise told how be that be free to walk in city after work be done will now went on be able to carry out plan of escape may occur to before leave a will certainly do ere long mean to settle score with hassan pray to send one of men who be with in galley whom took into employment directly hear that ship be in harbour give note message bid simply place in road between prison gate palace look fixedly at a pas will know be signal that hassan be in port can aid in flight will willingly do so that will need be garb of peasant gervaise said might buy one unnoticed in first place have money in second when be known have escaped trader might recall fact that one of slave overseer have purchased suit of dress of arab must be best merchant said that will procure hold in readiness for on day when send word that hassan be here will see that gate of garden be unbarred at night will place garment down just behind mean suppose to travel by land will do so for distance be to steal boat from port must be missed in morning be overtaken will therefore go along coast for distance get boat at one of village choosing time when there be brisk wind when may be able to get well beyond risk of being overtaken now ben ibyn will leave be better that must not meet again lest suspicion might fall upon of having aided in escape can not thank too much for past kindness will ever bear grateful remembrance of family perhaps be better so ben ibyn said for if moor can find excuse for plundering do so have heard news that sultan of turkey expedition for capture of rhodes be complete will assuredly sail before many week have passed have not heard gervaise replied trust may be in time to bear share in defence however blow have be so often threatened that may be time before fall may allah bless son take safely back to friend be assured that will have notice a soon a know that hassan have returned will have bundle with be needful behind gate two month passed gervaise looked in vain for ben ibyn messenger a went to from palace chafed terribly at delay when for aught knew turkish fleet might already have brought be army to rhodes at last a came back from work saw with intense satisfaction one of men whose face recognised leaning carelessly against wall man gave sign of recognition looked at earnestly for minute then sauntered off up street gervaise went up into town a usual walked about until became quite dark then went to gate led into merchant garden found that be unfastened opening went in closed behind a did so started for voice close by said master be messenger whom saw two hour since ben ibyn bade say that thought might require service

be property of christian knight will carry message evening man asked be early still be best that must not linger in city where there be sure to be strict search for in morning perhaps may recognise face be blackened lord be dressed a be when with ben ibyn let settle plan then before sally out from here must not find safer place for talking what message think must be most likely to tempt hassan to come ashore know what spoil have brought besides if merchant wanted to buy must go on board to inspect hassan ware must have something to sell must be something tempting something must be disposed of secretly might tell that employer must mention merchant whose name must carry weight with have received from interior large consignment of slave among whom be three four girl who must fetch high price in egypt a belief have be captured from tribe within limit of sultan territory be anxious to get rid of will dispose of cheaply in lot will hand over to to take to egypt to sell giving large commission for carrying there disposing of like tempting even enemy by story be untrue gervaise said doubtfully have scruple way man said with laugh be who will tell story not gervaise shook head must not say that came from one who owes heavy debt desire to pay think must bring ashore hassan doubtless trade for ready money must be well aware that one here can be greatly in debt lord leave matter in hand will think of story before go on board will fetch ashore first must settle where be to bring there be deserted spot near wall on east side of town know where mean gervaise agreed let go in direction at once for sooner be off better in hour spot be fixed on near hut have fallen into ruin here gervaise seated on sand heap while man hurried away moon have just risen being three day since be at full night be quiet sound of music laughter occasional shout came faintly from town seated where be gervaise must see port ship lying there hour later saw boat row off to one of have already singled out from size general appearance a being that of hassan ten minute later saw returning at distance separate figure must not be made out seemed to that loomed larger than before thought that certainly one if not more person be returning with messenger presently heard men approaching then hassan voice came distinctly to ear how much farther be going to take remember warned that unless found that journey repaid must be bad for be few yard farther lord there be master sheik of beni kali awaiting gervaise rose to foot a hassan two of crew came up now former said roughly where have bestowed captive want to sell will please to follow into courtyard gervaise said have while waiting reconnoitred neighbourhood found enclosure with wall still perfect have determined to bring hassan there in order to prevent from taking to flight hassan entered unsuspectingly followed by two men gervaise fell back little so a to place between entrance then threw back hood of bernouse do recognise hassan said sternly be captive whom beat almost to death told that day must kill even now be willing to forgive to allow to depart in peace if will restore amulet took from corsair gave howl of rage christian dog exclaimed thought to lead into trap have fallen into one reckoned must come alone suspected there be something hidden behind story of black so brought two of crew with upon men cut down so saying drew scimitar sprang furiously upon gervaise latter stepped back into centre of gateway so a to prevent men who have also drawn sword passing to attack from behind have undone clasp of bernouse allowed to fall to ground a addressed hassan long sword flashed in moonlight a corsair sprang forward hassan be good swordsman ferocious bravery have rendered one of most dreaded of moorish rover inferior in strength to gervaise be a active a cat leapt back with spring of panther avoiding sweeping blow with gervaise have hoped to finish conflict at once latter found therefore engaged in desperate fight with three assailant so furiously did attack that foot by foot be forced to give ground a stepped through gateway one of pirate sprang past a did so figure leapt out from beyond wall plunged dagger into back while at same moment by cutting down pirate gervaise rid of one of assailant in front a did so received severe wound on left shoulder from hassan who before must again raise weapon sprang upon tried to hurl to ground gervaise superior weight saved from falling though staggered back pace then heel caught against stone fell dragging hassan to ground with tightly clasped in other arm rolled over over gervaise succeeded at last in getting upper hand a did so hassan twisted right arm free snatched dagger from gervaise girdle struck furiously at gervaise who have half risen to knee be unable to avoid blow threw forward weight partly pinning corsair shoulder to ground blow passed behind inflicting slight wound in back then with right hand be now free grasped hassan by throat with grip of iron pirate struggled convulsively for moment then left hand released grasp of opponent wrist minute later gervaise rose to foot pirate be dead gervaise stooped raised fallen man head from ground felt for chain pulled up claudia gage placed round own neck then turned to guide have to thank for life said holding out hand to must have gone hard with if fellow have attacked from behind have not bargained for three of must not help lord be not until hassan have stepped down into boat knew be going to take one with then suddenly told two of men to take place by saying to a did so ' know not whether message be snare mind if see sign of treachery life at rate will pay forfeit knew not what to do indeed must hing knowing lord valour thought that even against odds might conquer with such poor aid a must give be not poor aid at gervaise said heartily greatly be indebted to sorry indeed be that be unable to reward now for great service that have rendered trouble about lord be greatly mistaken if find in sash of three villain sufficient to repay amply for share in evening work now lord pray to linger not moment gate of town shut at ten o'clock can not be long from that hour now first pray let bind up shoulder garment be soaked with blood fortunately bernouse will hide that be certainly best to staunch blood before start for must be hard for to get at wound myself man took one of sash of corsair tore into strip bandaged wound then with made sling for arm a took off sash leather bag dropped from there be chink of metal placed in girdle saying will have time to count when get back gervaise sheathed sword put on bernouse pulling hood well over head then with few more word of thanks started for gate leaving man to search hassan girdle gate be quarter of mile distant gervaise passed through with usual arabic salutation to sentry with difficulty repressed shout of exultation a left tripoli behind following coast road walked till daylight then left lay down among sand hill for five six hour calculated that pursuit must be begun until midday absence be not likely to be noticed until gang began work in morning when alarm must be given sentry at gate on previous evening must be questioned when be found that one answering to description have passed out before be closed there must be rigid search throughout city port vessel must all be examined boatman questioned a to whether craft be missing not until search proved absolutely fruitless must be seriously suspected that have by passing through gate in disguise by scaling wall made for interior none knew that must speak arabic must be so hopeless undertaking for one unacquainted with language to traverse country without being detected that moor must be slow to believe that have embarked upon such adventure however when search for in town in vessel in port proved fruitless doubtless mounted men must be despatched in direction must take coast road while others must ride into interior to warn head men of village to be on lookout for escaped slave after sleep of five hour gervaise pursued journey have walked for eight hour calculated that must be fully thirty mile from tripoli that not until evening must searcher overtake after walking four mile came to large village there purchased bag of date sat down on stone bench by roadside to eat entered into conversation with two three moor who sauntered up to represented that belonged to party of tribe who have encamped for day at short distance from village in order to rest horse before riding into tripoli whither be proceeding to exchange skin of animal taken in chase young horse for cotton clothes knife other article of barter with tribe beyond after quenching thirst at well in front of mosque retraced step until beyond village then struck out into country made detour came down into road again continued journey eastward walked until then again lay down be now fully fifty mile from tripoli hoped that be beyond point to horseman from town must think of pursuing search be likely that must not have gone beyond village at have halted on previous day for when learned from inhabitant that stranger save arab have entered must content with warning head man to be on watch for stranger unable to speak tongue must not consider necessary to push step farther for four day gervaise continued journey at village through passed added to stock of date until have a many a must carry under bernouse without attracting observation also purchased large water bottle slung round neck time sea lay to left like sheet of glass knew that until change of weather occurred be useless for to attempt to escape by boat on fifth day there be sign of change saw dark line far out at sea came across water rapidly presently gentle breeze began to blow from northwest gradually increased in strength when in afternoon stopped at village wave be breaking upon shore after repeating usual story sauntered down to water edge there be several boat hauled up hundred yard out two three larger craft be lying at anchor entered into conversation with of fisherman question a to boat led to believe altogether ignorant of sea craft be told used sometimes for fishing often made voyage to town along coast with date other produce boat carried single short mast to top of be attached long tapering spar on sail be furled gervaise knew that small felucca be generally fast sailor fair sea boat resolved to seize one of trusting that when once sail be shaken out must be able to manage single handed accustomed to boat picked out that thought must be fastest then walked away for mile lay down to sleep until village be silent for night have with oaten cake have bought there string of fish have purchased from boatman with date thought must manage for four five day at least a to water must only hope that must find supply on board boat when judged to be about ten o'clock went down to shore again took off clothes made into bundle then wading out into water to within fifty yard of felucca swam off to towing bundle behind have difficulty in climbing on board after dressing in clothes have worn at tripoli have kept on underneath arab attire pulled head rope until craft be nearly over anchor then loosened line brailed up sail got stone served a anchor on board hauled sheet aft took place at tiller wind have dropped good deal with sun there be still sufficient air to send light craft fast through water steered out for time then when thought good mile from shore headed east by appearance of water a glanced past thought that must be making from five to six mile hour when sun rose at five o'clock believed that be nearly forty mile on way now fastened tiller with rope proceeded to overhaul craft be decked over forward only crept into cabin be little more than three foot high first thing eye lit on be bulky object hanging against side covered with thick black blanket of arab manufacture lifting saw a expected that object beneath be large waterskin well filled blanket have evidently be placed over to keep cool when sun streamed down on deck above there be also large bag of date of flat cake guessed that have be put on board evening before in readiness for start in morning relieved of chief anxiety for have be unable to think of plan for replenishing supply to concoct likely tale be obliged to go on shore must account for being alone in craft of size wind increased again after sunrise being unable to reef sail single handed managed partially to brail up day craft flew along with wind on quarter making six seven mile hour felt that by morning must be well beyond pursuit on run passed several craft engaged in fishing gave uneasiness have in morning with old sail found constructed three rough imitation of human figure one with arab dress with bernouse have placed against bulwark so that at short distance must appear that there be three men on board feeling confident that deception must not be noticed kept course without swerving passed of fishing boat within hailing distance waving hand shouting usual arab salutation to crew during day contented with eating date oatmeal cake two at sunset added to two three fish that have split open hung up to dry in sun wind there be charcoal on board flat stone served a hearth in bottom of boat have mean of lighting fire for fisherman must have brought off when came on board in morning after have finished meal taken place again at tiller altered course hitherto have be steering to south of east following line of coast now saw before projecting promontory of cape mezurata mark western entrance of great gulf of sydra now directed course two point north of east so a to strike opposite promontory known a grenna more than hundred mile away wind fell much lighter shook out sail to full extent night kept at post finding wind perfectly steady lashed tiller so a to keep boat head in direction in be steering dozed for hour waking up occasionally to assure that be keeping course at sunrise indulged in wash in sea water felt freshened revived now kept sharp lookout for distant sail for be out of ordinary course coaster must take must have attracted attention of corsair coming out from land sea however remained clear of ship day felucca made rapid progress for although wind freshened gervaise did not lessen sail a before being now accustomed to boat confident of power a soon a wind died away again after sunset lay down for good sleep feeling be absolute necessity knowing that before morning must be obliged to keep sharp lookout for land slept longer than have intended for day be breaking when opened eye sprang to foot saw land stretching ahead of at distance a thought of fifteen mile at once put helm down bore more to north judged from what have heard on coast that must be nearly off cape tejones behind lie town of bengasi be confirmed in belief on finding hour later that coast have run nearly north south trended sharply away to northeast day long kept about same distance from land at night instead of keeping on course brailed up sail entirely allowed vessel to drift a knew that before morning must lose coast if continued a be going slept without moving until daylight then saw to satisfaction by mean of landmark have noticed evening before that boat have drifted few mile during night a day went on saw that coastline be now east west felt that must be off most northerly point of promontory accordingly laid course to northeast must take close to cape most easterly point of crete from two hundred fifty to three hundred mile distant for twenty four hour sailed quietly on wind dropping lighter lighter then suddenly died out altogether for hour there be not breath to stir surface of water heat be stifling gervaise slept for time when awoke same stillness reigned there be change in appearance of sky brightness be dulled by faint mist while although sea be of glassy smoothness there be imperceptible swell caused felucca to sway uneasily gervaise have sufficient experience of levant to know that sign be ominous of change at once set to work to prepare for although saw that must be difficult for unaided to hoist long spar back into place decided to lower be not difficult a weight brought down on to deck a soon a slackened halliard unhooked from block then lashed sail securely to when have done looked round bank of dark cloud lay across horizon to northwest in short time must see that be rising rapidly before taking down spar sail have deliberated a to whether must be better to run before coming gale to lie to have decided on latter alternative a be to continue to blow long might be driven on to egyptian coast moreover felucca bow be much higher out of water than stern thought that must ride over wave with greater safety than must did sweep down upon stern have heard that greek when caught in sudden gale in small boat often lashed oar together threw overboard with rope attached rode to safely through sea must otherwise have overwhelmed after much consideration a to what have best be done took anchor rope be sixty yard in length fastened one end to end of spar then lashed middle of rope to bow of felucca then using oar a lever with great labour managed to launch spar over bow with sail still attached to when have completed looked round at state of weather cloud have risen so fast that edge be nearly overhead spanning sky like great arch ahead of seemed almost a black a night have not be out in many of gale at time sweep eastern water of mediterranean with terrible violence have seen enough of to know that be ordinary one that be about to encounter looked over bow spar at present be lying in contact with stem with oar pushed across so a to be at right angle with craft then there being nothing else to do sat down waited for storm to burst in short time heard dull moaning sound puff of wind struck boat in few second died out be sufficient to give light craft stern way drifted backwards rope tightening until spar lay across bow twenty yard away dull moaning have grown louder now ahead of saw white line approached with extraordinary rapidity knowing fury with must burst upon leapt down stood at entrance to cabin with head just above deck with deafening roar wind struck boat staggered a if have on full course struck on rock while shower of spray flew over half blinded deafened gervaise crawled into cabin closed door lay down there whatever happened there be nothing must do be soon conscious that spar sail be doing work for boat still lay head to wind noise overhead around be deafening above howl of wind must be heard creaking of timber boat seemed to shiver a fresh gust struck in hour looked out again there be a yet little sea force of wind seemed to flatten water instant wave lifted head be cut off a if by knife carried away in spray boat herself be moving rapidly through water dragging spar behind gervaise almost trembled at thought of speed at must have flown along have not be for restraint of floating anchor gradually sea got up light craft rode easily over gervaise after commending safety to god lay down be soon fast asleep in spite of motion of vessel slept soundly for many hour when awoke opened cabin door looked out tremendous sea be running thought wind although so strong that must scarce lift head above shelter of bulwark be le violent than have be when first broke upon saw to satisfaction that felucca breasted wave lightly that although enveloped in spray took green water over bow spar sail acted not only a floating anchor a breakwater white crested wave came on a if must break upon boat seemed robbed of violence by obstruction to course passed under felucca without breaking for forty eight hour gale continued at end of time ceased almost a suddenly a have begun sun shone brightly out cloud cleared entirely away be hour before sea went down sufficiently for gervaise to attempt to get spar on deck again be heavy task taxing strength to utmost after deal of labour be got on board then raised to position at masthead sail be shaken out felucca again put on course chapter xx beleaguered one morning towards end of may sir john boswell be standing with other knight on st stephen hill near city having hurried up a soon a column of smoke from bonfire lighted by lookout there gave news that turkish fleet be at last in sight similar warning have be given month previously fleet have sailed past island being bound for phineka be rendezvous where mahomet great armament be to assemble there must be little doubt that long expected storm be time about to burst fleet now seen approaching numbered hundred sixty large ship besides great number of small craft conveying force variously estimated at from seventy to hundred thousand men 't be mighty fleet sir john said worst of be that know there be more to follow still doubt not will send back defeated defence be complete recent peace with egypt have enabled to fill up magazine with provision of kind inhabitant of island have have ample warning to move into town carrying with everything of value so turk will obtain little plunder will be able to gather mean of subsistence on island a animal have be driven within wall even unripe corn have be reaped brought in however long siege last need be in fear of being reduced to sore strait for food look over there there be small craft under sail come not from direction of phineka see one of turkish galley have separated from rest be making off in direction may be that little craft contains one two of comrade who be late in coming to join may well be so sir john for have be straggling in by two three for last month will get grand master leave to put out in one of galley sir john said for by way be bearing turk will cut little craft off before can gain port hurried to d'aubusson who be standing short distance apart from others gazing at turkish fleet minute later be running down hill to town accompanied by three four other knight made direct for outer port where two galley be lying in readiness leapt on board one of already contained quota of knight at once rowed out of port just a did so turkish galley fired gun fear will be too late sir john said turk be gaining fast on other craft whatever may be there go gun row hardest shouted down to slave turkish ship did not fire again wind be light be going two foot through water to one sailed by other craft galley from rhodes be still mile away when turk be close to boat be trying to escape sir john knight chafed a saw must be too late ca make out why boat did not use oar former said of course must not have kept away from galley if have rowed must have made difference might have be nearly up can only see one man on board of sir john one of younger knight said two three others murmured that be of same opinion others must be lying down can not have le than from fifteen to twenty men turk be close alongside still hold on there have gone about escaped attempt to run down now be heading for again brave fellow brave fellow sir john exclaimed while cheer broke from around have done for must have seen coming out if have surrendered might have hoped to have be retaken chance of getting quarter be truly not great for expecting a turk do to carry off inhabitant of island dozen fisherman must have seemed to scarcely worth keeping however by holding on have thrown away chance may have have turk be alongside be leaping down into little craft ah two more galley have just left fleet be heading here see sir john one of knight exclaimed there be single man standing in bow of craft be facing moor alone see how crowd there can see weapon flashing in sun have to press past mast to get at a yet seems to hold at bay have chosen post well d'urville number of assailant prevents archer on turkish craft using bow fire bow gun shouted to knight forward take steady aim at galley will distract attention nobly done indeed one of other knight shouted have seen strike down four of turk row men row 't be useless sir john muttered a clenched hilt of sword useless roland must not long maintain so unequal fight groan broke from around a suddenly dark mass of assailant made forward move single figure be lost to sight be for instant moment later crowd separated man be seen to spring overboard will riddle with spear when come up will have nothing to do to avenge to station comrade be turn now have time to lose for other two turk will be up in twenty minute have order not to fight if must be avoided must take fellow five minute later galley ran alongside turk to who have captured boat have already hastily returned ship discharged gun into other then a galley ran alongside knight tried to leap on board of be opposed by dense mass of turk for in addition to usual crew moslem be crowded with troop for three four minute knight tried in vain to get footing on board then sir john shouted to to forbear gave order to rower at once to push off cloud of arrow swept across poop a did so for most part fell harmless from armour of knight for time cannon on side continued to fire a christian increased distance gradually ceased have gone hundred yard from turk when head appeared over stern railing of poop figure swung on to deck man be attired in turkish garment head be bare exclamation christian broke from knight man strode up to sir john boswell used to say must make matter even with day sir john have more than kept word sir john fell back pace in astonishment then with shout by st george be tresham threw arm round gervaise neck while knight thronged round with exclamation of satisfaction be whom saw keep turk at bay for three good minute single handed sir john said holding gervaise at arm length to gaze into face truly seemed well nigh impossible that one who be like to be on craft must have performed so doughty deed how did escape be simple enough gervaise replied a soon a dived turned swam along under boat came up by stern then held on by rudder sheltered from sight saw that galley must be up in five minute have fear of wasting time to look for directly came alongside dived again rose under stern did not think that must be able to take for craft be crowded with troop so contented with holding on until be out of reach of arrow then climbed up be delighted to see again gervaise be feeling very sore at moment know others felt same at being obliged to sheer off without making capture grand master order be strict noted craft pursued by turk asked leave to take out galley to cut off said 'take one sir john adventure attack against turk unless be likely to fall easy prize to capture must be of little benefit to must be dearly purchased at cost of knight life therefore a soon a engaged found that be full of troop must not be captured without heavy loss that two of consort might arrive before accomplished be plainly duty to abandon attempt although may guess went sorely against grain to give order especially a knew that host must be looking on from st stephen hill however rescue more than make up for failure thankful indeed be that made suggestion that must put out to save little craft though thought contained few fisherman coasting sailor who have in ignorance that turk be at hand tried to enter rhodes one of looking on with did indeed suggest that might have on board knight two coming to join did not give matter second thought how go thing sir john how be old friend ralph harcourt think comrade in santa barbara except three who fell by side when be captured be well at present on island a for last two year none have be allowed to depart a to other matter go not so well a one must wish commandery have not responded to call for aid a must have done for however be not altogether to blame for have be so often threatened with attack have so frequently applied for aid in money men that must have begun to doubt whether danger be really imminent in other respect be well prepared have obtained large store of provision from egypt will have ground for uneasiness on score defence have be greatly strengthened one fear that will not be able to beat off attack have destroyed principal building outside wall though must have be better must have gone much further in direction now let have adventure escape 't be long story sir john must pray to let defer for time in first place have two three wound that will be glad to have bandaged why did not say so at once sir john exclaimed in dark clothes soaked with water a be did not see bloodstain ought to have looked for for surely one must have gone through fight altogether unprotected with armour too without being wounded come below will attend to also order wine food sir john have touched nothing save water for twenty four hour before fasted somewhat strictly by time gervaise wound be not severe have be bandaged have eaten hasty meal galley be alongside mole between two harbour be provided with clothes went with sir john straight to english auberge where knight insisted that must at once lie down will report return to d'aubusson will tell be by order that be resting wound be not very deep must have lost good deal of blood be to exert now be pestered with question must probably bring on attack of fever there be nothing to do at present for must be day before can land bring up gun gervaise obeyed order not unwillingly for felt that be really weak be greatly worn out by want of sleep sir john kendall at boswell request issued order that be on account to be disturbed that one be to enter room unless sounded bell placed by bedside gervaise indeed falling off to sleep few minute after have down did not awake until following morning having idea that have slept more than two three hour sounded bell in order to inquire whether ralph have returned to auberge be surprised to find friend have just risen that have be asleep eighteen hour few minute later ralph hurried into room thank god that be back again gervaise said a grasped hand of friend did not return until late in evening having be at work with large body of slave at fortification may guess what joy felt at news be changed good deal suppose will think so at end of day two ralph lost good deal of blood yesterday have be on short ration will very soon pick up again will bring wine directly gervaise early a be grand master have already sent down to inquire a to health will reply in person a soon a have have meal dressed suppose must wait to hear what have be doing until return gervaise suppose so ralph of course be long story must tell at once that there be nothing very exciting in that differed little from of others who have be prisoner among moor save be strangely fortunate suffered hardship now want to ask about clothes have thing be sold be still in store question be raised short time since be mooted by way by old enemy of yours robert river who returned here three month ago with batch of knight from english commandery sir john boswell answered roundly can tell said that must be kept be for fifty year for that must wager life that must sooner later make escape be sorry fellow have returned ralph have got commandery yet believe that sir john kendall sent home so bad report of even great influence of family have not sufficed to obtain appointment that have be merely assistant at one of smaller manor sir john boswell told in confidence that understood that river did not at first volunteer to come out in response to appeal of grand master that grand prior informed that unless took opportunity of retrieving character might give up hope of ever obtaining advancement ah here be breakfast hour later gervaise presented at palace clothed in suit of armour have be given to by genoa although be engaged with several member of council at time grand master ordered to be at once admitted a soon a heard that be in attendance welcome back sir gervaise tresham said warmly a entered rejoice greatly at return consider happy omen for success of defence that so brave distinguished knight must at last moment have arrived to take share in others present shook gervaise cordially by hand congratulated on return must dine with evening d'aubusson went on tell story of captivity escape at present a may suppose have too many matter on hand to spare time for aught be not pressing important will need few day rest before be fit for active service by time will settle a to what post will best suit twice day have gervaise to recount adventure first time to sir john kendall knight of auberge second to grand master most of leading member of order be assembled at palace among others be introduced to viscount de monteuil elder brother of d'aubusson one of most famous leader of day have brought with considerable body of retainer although not member of order have offered service in defence of town council have gratefully accepted offer have unanimously named commander of force many other knight soldier have come from different part of europe animated alike by desire to aid in defence of christendom against advance of moslem to gain credit honour by taking part in siege be sure to be desperate one brother have already spoken of to sir gervaise viscount said when young knight be presented to although indeed there be occasion for to do so since name of knight who two year ago saved commerce of italy from ruin with single galley destroyed captured great fleet of over twenty barbary pirate thus for time put stop to depredation of infidel be known throughout europe by way be bearer of message to took ship at genoa on way hither stayed two three day there while be being got ready for sea knowing be bound hither certain very beautiful young lady of noble family to whom have honour of being introduced prayed that if must by chance have escaped from captivity said that be convinced that must when heard rhodes be threatened assuredly endeavour to escape to come hither to take share in defence be to tell that trusted still bore gage that on part have held fast to promise made still have gage viscount for though be for long time deprived of succeeded in regaining when made escape gervaise said quietly de monteuil at once turned conversation to topic gervaise found that attempt be to be made to take offensive against turk that be to be permitted to advance against city without interference many of more fiery spirit among knight chafed at prohibition record of past showed that army a large a of mahomet have suffered defeat at hand of body of knight stronger than gathered for defence of rhodes d'aubusson however knew that between undisciplined horde gathered in countless number to oppose crusader troop of mahomet well trained in warfare who have borne standard victoriously in numerous battle there be little comparison be commanded too by paleologus general of great capacity under such circumstance although victory might be possible chance of defeat must be far greater while victory must be only won at great sacrifice of life defeat must mean annihilation to garrison loss of city upon whose fortification enormous amount of money labour have be expended on other hand felt perfectly confident that city must be successfully defended at cost of life far le than must be attained by victory in open field while blow must be inflicted upon prestige power of enemy by being ignominiously compelled to retire to ship after failure of attack must be a great a if army have be defeated in field therefore grand master with full assent of leader turned deaf ear to entreaty of younger knight that might be allowed to make sortie calmly waited behind formidable defence have for past ten year be occupied in perfecting in anticipation of assault of moslem host accordingly after disembarking at leisure turkish army moved forward took post upon st stephen hill from eminence commanded full view of town hill sloping gently down to foot of wall in later time first care of general commanding defence must have be to construct formidable work upon commanding position cannon of period be so cumbrous slowly worked so inaccurate in aim that advantage of occupying position must prevent enemy from firing down into town be considered to be more than counterbalanced by weakening of garrison by abstraction of force required to man detached work by risk of being surrounded cut off without garrison of town being able to aid that defence of st stephen hill be considered unnecessary for safety of rhodes be shown by fact that attempt have be made to fortify when forty year later moslem again besieged city there be shadow of apprehension felt by garrison of rhodes a great array of foe be seen moving on to hill preparing to pitch camp on summit be great tent of pasha round be marquee of other commander while encampment of troop stretched far away along upper slope of hill previous to despatch of expedition sultan have made preparation for aiding arm by treachery agent have sent to propose temporary truce have during stay on island made thoroughly acquainted with outline of work very accurate plan of have also be obtained from inhabitant of rhodes who have abandoned christianity taken service with turk in addition to have arranged with renegade german known a maitre george man of very great ability a artilleryman engineer to desert to city there do in power to assist besieger by affording information by giving bad advice to besieged on day after paleologus who be renegade greek have established camp sent in herald to summon city to surrender at same time making lavish promise that life property of native population must be respected that must be allowed to continue to reside there to enjoy full exercise of religion of other right possessed pasha have real hope that knight must obey summons thought that might excite spirit of disaffection among townspeople must when crisis came greatly hamper effort of defender rhodians however be well satisfied with rule of order knight although belonging to catholic church have allowed native of island who be of greek faith perfect freedom in exercise of religion rule generally have be fair just wealth prosperity of island have increased enormously since establishment there population have inclination to change rule for of turk summons to surrender being refused enemy made reconnaissance towards wall d'aubusson have longer reason for checking ardour of knight strong body of horseman under command of de monteuil sallied out drove turk back to camp maitre george who be acting a military adviser of pasha saw at once that weakest point of defence be fort st nicholas at extremity of mole along neck of land dividing outer from inner port at short distance away on opposite side of port stood church of st anthony in garden of church battery be at once erected garden be three hundred yard from st nicholas danger must arise from construction of battery be at once perceived incessant fire opened upon from gun on wall round grand master palace number of workman be killed erection of battery be pushed on night day ere long three of immense cannon have be brought from constantinople where sixteen of have be cast under direction of maitre george be placed in position cannon be eighteen foot in length carried stone ball of twenty six inch in diameter before be ready to open fire gervaise have entirely regained health strength grand master being unwilling to appoint to separate command over head of knight many year senior have attached to person in capacity of what must now be called aide de camp know gervaise can rely upon coolness discretion can not be everywhere want to act a eye in place where can not be know that knight so far a bravery devotion be concerned will one do best will die at post before yielding foot while fighting like paladin will think of naught else however hardly pressed will omit to send to for reinforcement nay even did think of probably must not send deeming that to do so must be derogatory might be taken a act of cowardice now be service will specially look for from when post be attacked will when presence be required elsewhere send to represent of course wish to interfere in way in conduct of defence in will take such share a can be specially to observe how matter go if see that knight be pressed in sore need of assistance to enable to hold post will at once bring news to will hurry there with reinforcement post must have be more in accordance with desire of gervaise for portion of wall defended by english langue be far removed from point selected by turk for first attack sea front being defended half by langue of italy half by of castile fort st nicholas be under command of cavalier caretto a soon a turkish battery be completed gervaise went down there with order from grand master that be for present to consider a forming part of garrison be pleasant for caretto for italian knight have conceived strong friendship for young englishman have rejoiced greatly at return from captivity have be so much occupied with duty of placing castle in respect in state of defence that have have opportunity for private conversation with since return to rhodes gervaise on part be le pleased caretto have shown so much tact after release from moor have so willingly aided in capacity allotted to without in slightest degree interposing council unasked that gervaise have come to like greatly even before arrival at genoa circumstance there have brought closely together friendship have be cemented during voyage to rhodes caretto have gone back to italy where have commandery few day after gervaise have sailed on last voyage have only returned to rhodes three month before gervaise escaped from captivity be turning table caretto said with laugh when gervaise presented grand master order be under command last time now seems that be to be under mine suppose applied to come here in order to have fresh opportunity of distinguishing heard that have be placed on d'aubusson own staff yes be on still be by order not by own solicitation that be here will tell what duty be grand master know commander of post have hand so full that will have time for sending complete report to considers moreover that might in case however pressed hesitate to ask for aid until too late for reinforcement to be brought up duty will be to let grand master know how matter be going to send to at once if seems to that help be needed must of course always send for reinforcement at request of commander be only in event of being too busy in heat of fray to think of aught resisting attack must exercise own judgment in matter caretto nodded be good thought of d'aubusson when one be in thick of fight in breach with moslem swarming round doe not occur to one to draw out of fray to send off message for will be glad indeed to have matter off mind though be not one must care to trust with responsibility might send off for aid when be not needed others might delay so long that help might come too late with one so cool headed a must not fear contingency now a be not busy at present let have comfortable talk a to what have happened since met last be at banquet at grand master on night when related adventure have certainly much to tell seems to for reason other cut short certain detail must not see why a there seemed prospect of escape open to did not accept offer of suleiman ali to ransom saw chance of escape at moment did not doubt must get away from town whenever chose although be not clear how must proceed afterwards be for opportunity be waiting felt sure that with knowledge of language must come sooner later in next place captor have fixed exorbitant sum for ransom did not wish to impose upon generosity of suleiman there be reason private one mean to say that have fallen in love with moorish damsel sir gervaise caretto laughed for shame cavalier a if christian knight must care for moslem maiden even be a fair a houri of creed christian knight have done so before now caretto laughed greatly amused at young knight indignation doubtless will do so again well suppose must not ask what private matter be though must have be something grave indeed to lead slave to reject offer of freedom know that when be rowing in galley matter of private business can conceive must have stood in way for single moment have chance of freedom presented be matter of honour gervaise said gravely one of must speak to one else a be present at time there can think be harm in doing so at time be captured be stripped of everything have upon of course with rest of gage lady claudia have given hung round neck where have placed be taken possession of by captain of pirate who seeing that bore christian emblem looked upon a sort of amulet understood what be saying a be desirous that knowledge of turkish must not be suspected said nothing be very glad that so regarded for have taken to be ordinary trinket might have parted with must never have be able to obtain clue a to person to whom sold a be put round neck with remark that might bring better luck than have befallen told jeeringly month afterwards that have done so that must never part with given a be felt that honour be concerned in recovery must ever meet lady claudia again must feel disgraced indeed if when asked whether still bore gage have to confess that be lost lost from fault of own caretto put in losing be not indeed from fault of own have pirate thrown into sea must have held free from disgrace a be still in existence knew possessor be bound in honour to recover at time suleiman ali messenger arrived corsair be away there be saying when ship must return therefore decided at once not to accept offer of freedom have not be for own must have done so for knew must repay suleiman from revenue of commandery must have accumulated in absence if have have to wait ten year longer to regain gage felt be in honour bound to do so be in fact six month before corsair put into port again moment did so carried out plan have long before determined upon obtained disguise from ben ibyn by ruse succeeded in inducing pirate to meet outside town believing be arab chief who wished to dispose of valuable slave girl have brought in have with one of old galley slave who have be taken into ben ibyn employment when pirate came up with two of crew furiously attacked a soon a threw off disguise must have gone hard with have not stood by killed one of who be about to attack in rear slew other hassan gage be in place again chapter xxi fort of st nicholas well have proved indeed caretto said when gervaise finished story that be worthy of bestowal of gage by fair damsel think that many knight however true might be to donor must have suffered month of slavery in order to regain token lost by fault carelessness of own lady must have blamed held in way dishonoured by loss have message by viscount de monteuil from lady claudia other day saying that trusted have kept gage can assure that six month of slavery be cheaply purchased by pleasure felt that still possessed be glad too to learn have not be forgotten by of that may well assure tresham commandery be not far from genoa be frequently with never without drawing aside asking if have heard news of talking over with chance there might be of escape can tell that there be not few young noble of genoa who must give much to be allowed a be to carry gage wear colour must see now must scarce know again so altered improved be there be fairer face in italy hope day to meet again gervaise replied although own to knowing be better must not do so until gave gage have scarcely noticed have a know experience of woman have so much on mind at time what with fuss be making about question of getting prize here that in truth paid slight attention to fair face of dame of genoa gracious earnest way in though scarce more than child gave gage vowed that other knight must posse one so long a lived struck so greatly that own gave matter much more thought than be right becoming in one of order incident be much more gratifying to than honour paid by republic during long month of captivity have recurred to so frequently have in vain endeavoured to chase from thought a sinful thus to allow constantly to think of woman mistake sir fabricius be speaking to a to confessor just a have kept amulet hidden from so be thought of secret must not part with for life for moment deceive with thought beyond fact that gift have made feel interest in fate have sentiment in matter probably indeed look back upon gift a foolish act of girlish enthusiasm led into making promise that now can not find unpleasantly binding for be natural among young noble of own rank country there must be whom must see with pleasure wearing colour caretto looked at with amusement be not bound by vow a knight of order how must feel in matter must feel worse gervaise said without hesitation have oftentimes thought that over see that be good for be so bound doe not decrease chance for a know there be chance render more easy for to know that be so why must say that have chance tresham because be easy to see that be so be save for commandery prospect in order penniless young knight without home estate without even place in country country not hers know that be not only sinful mad for to think so frequently of at least be not mad enough to think that can either win heart aspire to hand of one who be say so beautiful who be moreover a know heiress to wide estate 'there be squire of low degree loved king daughter of hungarie caretto sang with laugh be not of low degree of noble family gervaise be not squire knight already very distinguished one be young lady though be rich heiress king daughter at rate squire be not vowed to celibacy sir fabricius be dream pleasant one know perfectly well that be dream one will do harm so long a ever bear in mind that be so many knight of order before have borne lady gage carried valiantly in many fight have be le true to vow for doing so upon contrary have be better knight gervaise be always good for knight whether belongs to order not to prize one woman above others to try to make worthy of ideal a to vow of celibacy know that ere now knight have be absolved from vow methinks after service have rendered to italy by ridding sea of corsair holiness must make difficulty in granting request that might make in other direction know whether be aware that after sailed from here letter came from rome a well a from pisa florence naples expressive of gratitude felt for service that have rendered of admiration for splendid exploit that have performed no grand master have have hand so full of other matter doubtless affair so old escaped memory indeed may have forgotten sailed before letter arrived forget to jog memory on subject for can tell that letter did not come alone be accompanied by present worthy of service rendered a to vow a to vow feel a said just now that must not free myself of if must for being bound by can more easily pleasantly enjoy dream besides what must do if left order without home country mean with naught to do to sell sword to warlike monarch besides caretto love order deem highest privilege to fight against moslem to uphold banner of cross a to that must like de monteuil many other knight here always come out to aid order in time of need a to vow be not foolish enough to suppose that must ask to be relieved from until have assured that claudia be also desirous that must be free be absurd gervaise said almost impatiently let talk more about caretto will end by turning head making presumptuous enough to imagine that lady claudia who only saw for three four day while be still girl have be thinking of seriously since know claudia thought caretto remarked drily do know that last year refused to listen to at least score of excellent offer for hand including one from son of doge that without reasonable cause assigned by to great wonderment of seeing that doe not appear to have leaning towards life in nunnery at rate if at future time must pluck up heart of grace to tell love refuse will at least have consolation of knowing that be not only one by long way whose suit have be rejected now a to affair here methinks that tomorrow battery will open fire upon seems completed yes think be nearly ready gervaise said turning mind resolutely from subject have be discussing from palace wall saw before came down here large number of men rolling huge stone down towards church gun be firing steadily must load ten time a fast a do must hardly be able to stop work so numerous be engaged upon yes will soon learn something of quality of artillery tower be strong enough to resist ordinary gun will soon crumble under blow of such enormous missile never have seen heard in europe of cannon of such size indeed in matter turk be far ahead of have ever since cannon be first cast made of much larger size than in europe have done however there be one comfort may destroy fort have still to cross water under fire of gun on palace wall when once land great battery must cease firing will be able to meet on equal term in breach fight a hard a may think can hold own especially a reinforcement can come down to more quickly than can be brought across water next morning at daybreak deep boom of gun announced to city that great battering cannon have begun work in fort sleeping knight sprang to foot at concussion seemed to shake to centre must have rushed to wall caretto at once issued order that one must show on battlement unless under special order there be nothing whatever to be done until turk have breached wall be ready to advance to attack sword will be needed when hour come man owes to order to run useless risk until hour when be required to do share of fighting time required to reload great cannon be considerable at regular interval hurled heavy missile against wall distance being so short that ball struck after twenty shot have be fired caretto accompanied by gervaise went out by small gate on eastern side of tower made way round by foot of wall to see what effect shot have produced on solid masonry caretto shook head be a feared said stone ever quarried by man must long resist such tremendous blow in place see stone be starred cracked in others shock seems to have pulverised spot where struck worse still whole face of wall be shaken there be crack between stone of be partly bulged out partly driven in may take time before breach be effected sooner later wall will surely be demolished will go up make report to grand master do so gervaise almost wonder that have not come down to see how wall be resisting gervaise on reaching palace heard that d'aubusson be at present engaged in examining le person than maitre george right hand of paleologus who have soon after daybreak presented before wall on other side of town declaring that have left turkish service craving to be admitted news have be sent at once to d'aubusson who despatched two of senior knight with order to admit receive with honour have be done grand master with of council be now closeted with newcomer several of knight be gathered in courtyard discussing event there be question that if renegade came in good faith defection must be serious blow to assailant that well known skill experience must greatly benefit defender for part sir john boswell who formed one of detachment english langue a well a others contributed to form garrison of palace said must have hung fellow up by neck over gateway must never have set foot within wall think that man who have denied faith taken service with enemy be to be trusted oath may take must remember boswell said that hitherto george have not fought against christian have served mahomet in war with other infidel be not saying word in defence of having become renegade yet even renegade may have sort of heart now that have be called upon to fight against christian may well have repented of fault determined to sacrifice position prospect rather than aid in attack on city will see a for regard renegade a most contemptible of wretch have belief that have heart conscience when maitre george came out from palace laughing talking with two knight who have entered with be evident that be well pleased with reception by grand master who have assigned to suite of apartment in guest house in reality however d'aubusson have doubt that object be treacherous one that like demetrius who have come under pretence of bringing about truce object be to find out weak point to supply turk with information george have in conversation with laid great stress on strength of turkish army excellent quality of troop enormous battering train have be prepared word spoke added to grand master suspicion for if man considered that capture of city be morally certain must be simply throwing away life to enter a deserter grand master be however too politic to betray doubt of george sincerity be treated a traitor paleologus might find agent to do work be therefore better to feign belief in story to obtain information possible from at same time to prevent gaining knowledge of affair must be of slightest use to turk instruction be therefore given to two knight that while george be to be treated with courtesy be to be strictly watched though in such manner that must be in ignorance of that whenever turned step in direction of part of defence where fresh work have be recently added preparation made of be desirable turk must be kept in ignorance be to be met a if by accident by one of knight told off for purpose step diverted in direction george soon made popular among many of knight who have suspicion of real character be man of exceptional figure tall strong splendidly proportioned with handsome face gallant bearing be extremely well informed on subject have travelled widely have seen many adventure be full of anecdote among younger knight therefore be soon regarded a charming companion very popularity among aided d'aubusson plan a george be generally centre of group of listener so have few opportunity of getting away quietly to obtain information sought gervaise delivered report to grand master be free now d'aubusson said will accompany to st nicholas have be detained by coming of man george be clever knave doubt not have come a spy however have taken measure that will learn nothing can harm life have be lost at tower hope sir caretto have forbidden to show on wall have done well be time for rash exposure where there be naught to be gained be grave fault to run risk on arriving at end of mole d'aubusson accompanied by caretto made investigation of effect of turk fire 't be worse than expected said when laid out fortification thought that such gun a must be used against never entered mind against ordinary artillery wall must stand long battering be clear that will have to depend more upon sword than upon wall for defence fortunately although turk have indeed chosen spot where wall be most open to assault of battery have to cross water to attack breach when be made will have to fight under heavy disadvantage tresham be last night saying to that seemed to must not be difficult matter for one who spoke turkish well to issue at night on other side of town to make way round to battery disguised of course a turkish soldier then mixing with artillery men to drive spike into one of touch hole said that must gladly volunteer for task d'aubusson shook head decidedly must be too dangerous even be spike driven in turk must have great difficulty in extracting for tube be so big that man might crawl in drive spike up from inside moreover must one more of gun be disabled permanently others must be brought down set in place so that nothing must be gained very short delay must be of advantage to certainly must in way justify risking of life of so distinguished young knight bombardment of st nicholas continued for day breach be fast forming in wall slope composed of fallen rubbish extended from front of breach to water edge grand master be frequently on spot a be at present sole object of attack garrison be strengthened by a many knight a must be sheltered within wall at night shattered masonry have fallen inside be carried out with new work thrown up across mole to strengthen defence on side must enemy land between town fort small battery be planted wherever must sweep approach to breach plank studded with nail be sunk in willow water of harbour to impede progress of who might attempt to swim wade across for time therefore function of gervaise be in abeyance laboured with rest of garrison at defence at daybreak on th of june great number of vessel boat crowded with soldier bore down on st nicholas a approached gun on fortification must be brought to bear upon opened fire in dense mass advanced made way to rock landed soldier there others got alongside mole majority grounded in willow water of harbour troop leaping out waded to foot of breach on crest d'aubusson have taken up station beside stood caretto around most distinguished knight of order with wild shout turk rushed up breach swarmed thickly up ruined masonry until at summit encountered steel clad line of defender for hour terrible struggle continued a fast a head of turkish column broke melted away against obstacle tried in vain to penetrate fresh reinforcement took place of who have fallen in point of valour devotion moslem showed worthy antagonist of christian be not only at breach that conflict raged at other point turk well provided with ladder fixed against wall desperately strove to obtain footing there from breach cloud of dust rose from under foot of combatant mingling with smoke of cannon on rampart fort turkish ship at time entirely hid from sight of anxious spectator on wall of town fortress of still more numerous throng of turk on st stephen hill terrible struggle continued without moment intermission combatant now fought in comparative silence knight exhausted worn out by long effort beneath blazing sun still showed unbroken front be only occasionally that battle cry of order rose in air a fresh body of assailant climbed up corpse strewn breach yell of moslem rose le frequently sacrificed life a freely devotedly a who led first onset have done a hour wore on assurance of victory died out doubt a to whether be possible to break through line of terrible foe gained ground d'aubusson although in spite of remonstrance of knight always in thickest of fray be yet ever watchful quickly perceived where defender be hotly pressed where support be most needed gervaise fought by side so that when necessary must carry order to little body of knight drawn up in reserve despatch to point where aid be needed cannon still continued fire on side fragment of one of stone ball from basilisk struck off d'aubusson helmet selected from among fallen knight resumed place in line still contest showed sign of terminating turkish galley ever brought up reinforcement while defender grew fewer more exhausted during momentary pause while fresh body of turk be landing gervaise said to grand master if will give leave sir will go out at watergate swim up inner harbour in very short time turn few of craft lying there into fire ship tow out with couple of galley at rate can fire craft have grounded create panic among others well thought of gervaise will write order on one of tablet do take place for minute withdrawing behind line grand master sat down on fragment of stone drawing tablet from pouch in girdle wrote on in thing carry out instruction of sir gervaise tresham be acting by order authority have full power in respect handed slip of parchment to gervaise who hurried to water gate in inner harbour threw off helmet armour issued out at gate plunged into sea swam out distance in order to avoid missile of turk who be trying to scale wall from mole then directed course to st michael guarded inner entrance to fort have fastened parchment in hair a of garrison of tower noticing approach came down to assist handed to be at once taken to commander of st michael answering a went anxious question a to how matter stood at breach aid be sorely needed turk have gained foot of ground a yet many of knight be killed most of others utterly exhausted with heat labour unless aid reach speedily tower with defender will be lost instant commander knew what be required bade six of knight embark with gervaise in boat moored behind tower row up harbour to spot where shipping be massed together protected by high ground of fortress from turkish fire gervaise waved hand a neared end of harbour to officer on wall while six knight who be with ran off to tell master of galley to prepare two of to leave port instantly gervaise explained to officer in charge of wall at point plan that be charged to carry out asked for twenty knight to assist will leave very weak along here officer said then let have ten send for ten from other part of wall here be grand master order giving full power authority be important that single moment will be wasted will have twenty of mine officer said will draw ten from langue next to to fill place in few minute quay be scene of bustle activity gervaise picked out ten of smallest vessel knight went among other ship seized good store must be useful a combustible compelled crew to carry on board craft chosen a fire ship then barrel be broken open old sail faggot saturated with oil pitch in little more than quarter of hour after arrival gervaise have satisfaction of seeing that ten boat be filled with combustible ready to be set on fire now called for volunteer from sailor number of at once came forward including many of captain placed one of in command of fire ship gave four of sailor galley will tow out said take close to enemy ship will range five abreast when give word one at end of line will steer for nearest turk with oar pole get alongside captain will then light train of powder in hold throw torch among straw see that if possible men fasten to turk if can not be done be not essential for in confusion enemy will not be able to get out of way of fire ship a drive down against at last moment will take to boat row back here will protect from assault of of turkish ship having made sure that captain understood order gervaise took command of one of galley senior knight going on board other ten fire ship be now poled out until five be ranged abreast behind craft gervaise requested commander of other galley to lie off point of st nicholas until have got rid of five fire ship then to advance launch craft against turk smoke of gun lay so heavy on water combatant be so intent upon struggle at breach gervaise steered galley into midst of turkish vessel laden with troop ready to disembark without attracting notice then standing upon taffrail signalled to two outside boat to throw off rope make for turkish ship nearest to did be not until sheet of flame rose alongside that enemy awoke to sense of danger other three fire ship be almost immediately cast off two of be equally successful turk managed to thrust off third drifted however through shipping presently brought up alongside one of vessel fast aground with ten knight gervaise must not attack one of larger vessel crowded with troop there be many fishing boat have be pressed into service against one of gervaise ordered men to steer galley shout to rower made redouble effort yell of dismay arose from turkish troop a saw galley bearing down upon frantic effort be made to row out of way be in vain for sharp prow struck amidships cutting boat almost in two sank like stone galley without pause making for boat looking back gervaise saw that consort be already in midst of turk among whom wildest confusion prevailed ship trying to extricate from mass upon battery of fortress now concentrated effort two fresh column of flame have already shot up satisfied that be going well gervaise continued attack upon smaller craft six of whom be overtaken sunk three four of larger vessel endeavoured to lay alongside galley speed be so superior to theirs that easily evaded attempt sweeping round rejoined other galley have just issued from among turk who be already in full retreat defender of st nicholas reanimated by sight of discomfiture of turkish fleet with loud shout rushed down from spot have held for so many hour drove assailant before flung upon crowd assembled at foot of breach have already suffered terribly from fire of battery again again have striven to storm mound of rubbish have time be repulsed with loss of bravest leader seeing abandoned by ship panic seized a knight rushed down upon relinquished thought of resistance dashed into willow water many be drowned in attempt to swim across deep channel in middle succeeded while others made escape in boat in have be brought ashore from ship struggle be over two galley made for breach knight leapt out a soon a boat grounded wading ashore joined group have so long gallantly sustained unequal fight fatigue exhaustion wound be forgotten in triumph of moment crowded round grand master caretto to whose joint exertion success of defence be so largely due thank comrade d'aubusson said man have today fought better than rest knight have shown worthy of fame of order meed of praise for success be first due to sir gervaise tresham at moment when began to doubt whether must much longer withstand swarm of fresh foe who continued to pour against while be overcome by heat labour sir gervaise who have throughout be fighting at side offered to swim into port to fit out dozen of merchant craft there a fire ship to tow round into midst of turkish vessel behind two galley be lying ready for service remembered how have before destroyed corsair fleet at sardinia with fire ship proposal seemed to a inspiration sent from heaven at moment of great peril wrote order giving full authority to act in name in time seemed to incredibly short saw round point with fire ship in tow saw a well a did how completely plan be carried out ten twelve of turkish ship be mass of flame besides noted that galley ran down destroyed several smaller craft filled with soldier panic in ship spread to troop on shore rendered last part of task easy one say from heart that consider be to sir gervaise tresham that owe success have not be for happy thought sun must have gone down on dead body lying on summit of breach on turkish flag waving over fort of st nicholas until now none of defender of breach have known how what seemed to almost miraculous change in fortune of fight have come about thronged round gervaise shaking hand many of warmly embracing according to custom of time be natural that idea must occur to said having before successfully encountered with fire ship a on shore especially knight aided with power took brief time to get boat in readiness for burning much credit too be due to merchant captain sailor who volunteered to take charge of fire ship to manoeuver alongside turk grand master knight who have borne brunt of battle now retired along mole to town bearing with most seriously wounded comrade assisting whose wound be le severe twenty knight who have manned two galley remained in fort caretto continued in command a although have suffered several wound refused to relinquish post gervaise who have thanks partly to skill with weapon still more to temper of splendid suit of armour presented to by genoa escaped without scratch volunteered to remain with until next morning principal motive for making request being desire to escape from further congratulation praise for success of plan after caretto wound have be dressed by knight gervaise have partaken of food wine greatly needed caretto be persuaded to lie down for time knight promising to bring word at once if perceived movement on part of enemy gervaise remained with feeling now excitement be over that sorely needed rest after exertion in full heat of summer sun have be great day gervaise caretto said only hope that when again go into battle with infidel will have at hand to come forward at critical moment with master stroke to secure victory claudia will be pleased indeed when hears how knight who bear gage have again distinguished will look on gay idle young fop of genoa with greater disdain than ever now need not say anything in more so a feel grievously weak disposed for sleep chapter xxii struggle at breach two hour later caretto gervaise be roused by arrival of hundred knight in place of previous garrison bore news that pasha have sent in flag of truce to ask for armistice until sundown to enable to carry off for burial body of who have fallen in attack request have be willingly granted d'aubusson have at same time thought well to send down strong reinforcement to garrison to prevent attempt at treachery on part of turk have seldom heard pleasanter news caretto said for just a fell asleep be wondering how be to rid ourselves of corps of infidel by tomorrow place must have become unbearable though living turk must not turn out of tower must when dead speedily have rid place of in hour number of moslem vessel be seen approaching caretto did not wish turk to imagine that doubted good faith while directing main body of knight to remain in concealment near breach placed two on sentry duty on crest of ruin with four other knight gervaise went down in complete armour to salute officer in command of burying party a landed from boat ship anchored short distance out number of boat rowed from to shore a turkish officer landed caretto saluted said in arabic give courteous greeting sir when cannon cease to sound sword be sheathed there be longer animosity between brave men braver than whose body lie stretched there breathed air of heaven if sir knight with uncover head be from want of respect for dead solely because dare not stand bareheaded under fierce ray of sun turk answered with equal courtesy complimenting knight on defence have not seen with own eye said must have deemed altogether impossible that so small number of men must thus for hour have withstood attack of of best of sultan troop tale have come down to from father of marvellous prowess of knight of order how at smyrna at acre elsewhere performed such feat of valour that name be still used by turkish mother a bugbear to frighten child story have always seemed to incredible now perceive be true that present member of order in way fall short of valour of predecessor knight remained with turkish commander of officer while work of collecting carrying away dead be performed conversation on side being supported by caretto gervaise le than seven hundred body be carried down to boat besides great many wounded by artillery fire none be however found breathing among great pile of dead at upper part of breach for ax double handed sword of knight have in most of case cleft through turban skull represents part of loss turkish commander said sadly a last party came down with burden to boat at least a many more must have perished in sea either in endeavour to escape when be lost in destruction of vessel by fire by shot from battery by being run down by galley ah sir knight if have not be for appearance of fire ship methinks matter might have ended differently in altogether agree with caretto said be indeed well nigh spent must have soon succumbed have not be that fire ship arrived to rescue have fair right to claim that victory must have remained in hand have not craft gone out snatched from then with salute on side turk took place in boat knight returned to fort a soon a darkness came on large body of slave be marched down from town under direction of knight laboured night at mound removing great quantity of fallen stone rubbish in line halfway up piling above so a to form scarp across mound must need ladder to ascend party worked at top of mound there built up wall eight foot high work be completed by daylight knight felt that be now in position to resist attack must paleologus again send troop to assault night have passed quietly there be sound of stir movement in turkish battery nothing must excite suspicion of large body of troop being in motion when became light be seen that turkish ship have sailed away to previous anchorage on other side of island although at considerable interval great cannon hurled missile against fort be evident that for time at least attack be not to be pressed at point fresh body of slave however came down from town to relieve who have be all night at work repair of defence be continued with greater neatness method than have be possible in darkness at eight o'clock bell of st john church gave notice that solemn service of thanksgiving for repulse of enemy be about to be held notice have be sent down early to tower knight who must be spared without too greatly weakening garrison went up to attend service be conducted with pomp ceremony possible after be over great procession be formed to proceed to shrine where picture of virgin held in special reverence by order be placed a wound through street in splendid array grand master official in robe of state knight in full armour mantle of order while inhabitant in gala costume lined street window housetop lady waving scarf scattering flower down on knight roar of great cannon on south side of city showed that turk have commenced attack in quarter without pausing procession continued way be not until service in chapel have be concluded that step be taken to ascertain direction of attack a soon a be over knight hastened to wall during night turk have transported great basilisk with other large piece of artillery from camp to rising ground on south side of city have opened fire against wall covering jew quarter at same time against tower of st mary on one hand italian tower on other from other commanding spot huge mortar be hurling great fragment of rock other missile broadcast into town portion of wall selected for attack showed that turk have be well informed by spy of weak point of defence wall behind jew quarter lay be to appearance of thick solid masonry be really of great age having formed part of original defence of town before order have established there masonry therefore be ill fitted to resist huge ball hurled against by basilisk langue of provence be in charge of part of wall leaving for present to bear brunt of storm grand master sent knight who must be spared to assist inhabitant to erect shelter against storm of missile falling in town shed with sharply sloping roof constructed of solid timber be built against inner side of wall beneath number of inhabitant found refuge work be performed with great celerity by inhabitant aided by gang of slave in two three day townspeople be in shelter in shed in vault of church in other strongly constructed building among missile hurled into town be ball filled with greek fire house being entirely built of stone conflagration of importance be caused by a band of knight be organised specially to watch for bomb whenever one of be seen to fall hurried from lookout to spot with gang of slave carrying basket of earth bucket of water quenched flame before have made great headway roar of bombardment be almost continuous be heard at island distant from rhodes telling inhabitant how battle between christian moslem be raging be not long before wall in front of jew quarter began to crumble be soon evident that must ere many day succumb to storm of missile hurled against d'aubusson lost time in making preparation to avert danger ordered house in rear of wall to be levelled deep semicircular ditch be then dug behind new wall constructed of stone brick from house destroyed be built backed with earthen rampart of great thickness solidity work be carried on with extraordinary rapidity grand master set example throwing aside robe armour laboured with pick shovel like commonest labourer excited people to highest pitch of enthusiasm class threw into task knight slave men woman child even inmate of convent nunnery aided in work when at last outer wall fell turk thought that success be at hand pasha saw with astonishment dismay entry to city be still barred by work a formidable a have destroyed at enormous expenditure of ammunition there be now short breathing time for besieged depression failure of effort excited among turk be shortly dispelled by arrival of ship with despatch from constantinople in pasha be informed that sultan be about to proceed to rhodes with reinforcement of hundred thousand men fresh park of artillery paleologus have doubt a to whether report be true be merely intended to stimulate to new effort for speedy capture of place knowing well that grand master be heart soul of defence that failure of assault be mainly due to energy ability determined to resort to weapon so frequently in use in eastern warfare that of assassination to end employed two men one dalmatian other albanian presented before wall a deserter a there be reason for suspecting tale be admitted within gate welcomed a having escaped from enforced service soon spread tale of speedy coming of sultan with vast reinforcement a pasha have on previous day caused salute to be fired other demonstration to be made news be readily credited caused greatest dismay among defender of knight of italian spanish langues believed prospect of successful defence against so enormous force be absolutely hopeless determined to put pressure upon d'aubusson to treat for surrender before became too late opened negotiation with italian named filelfo one of d'aubusson secretary who undertook to lay opinion before grand master d'aubusson at once summoned knight concerned in matter before found with several member of council sir knight said have heard from secretary opinion in matter of surrender since be in such terror of moslem sultan have full permission to leave town more than will myself secure safe departure might be imperilled if comrade even inhabitant of town came to learn that have advocated surrender went on changing tone from of sarcasm to sternness if remain with see that word surrender never again pass lip be assured must continue intrigue in direction will meet with fate so justly deserve overwhelmed by grand master accusation sternness italian spanish knight threw on knee implored to grant early opportunity of retrieving fault by battle with infidel feeling that lesson have be sufficiently severe henceforth there must be renewal of intrigue for surrender d'aubusson forgave promised place in van when next moslem attacked incident be not without advantage for two pretended deserter believing that filelfo who have also fallen under displeasure of grand master must be ready to join in conspiracy against life approached filelfo who be greatly attached to d'aubusson saw by manner that wished to engage in intrigue feigning great resentment anger at disgrace led on until divulged entire plot for d'aubusson assassination made brilliant offer to if must afford facility for carrying out producing in proof of power to do so letter of pasha authorising to make such promise in name filelfo at once divulged whole plot to d'aubusson two men be immediately arrested tried by council sentenced to death be not however formally executed for populace obtaining news of treachery broke in upon guard tore to piece foiled in attempt on life of grand master pasha prepared for renewal of attack be not long before knight on lookout at church of st john perceived that fort of st nicholas be again to be scene of attack be ere long discovered that large number of men be busy distance along shore in building long structure must only be intended for floating bridge among sailor who have aided in attack with fire ship be several men belonging to english trader in port who have done so have be handsomely rewarded for conduct five of englishman have afterwards gone to english auberge have asked to be enrolled for service against turk a be weary of remaining on board in idleness when there be work to be done offer have be accepted have in common with sailor in port laboured at construction of inner wall when be completed sir john boswell under whose special charge have be placed said to gervaise think can not do better than send men down to st nicholas be probable now turk see that can hing at new breach may try again there sailor be accustomed to night watch there be many of knight who be not used to such work can be better trusted to defend breach than to keep vigilant watch at night will take men down to caretto tell that can sleep soundly if have couple of on watch one of roger jervis who be mate of ship can speak italian a be in command of caretto will find trouble in making understand st nicholas have now be put into fair state of defence a party have be kept steadily at work there gervaise have not be to tower since morning after assault saw with satisfaction how much have be done to render secure found that caretto be fast recovering from wound a seems probable sir fabricius said after first greeting to knight that turk will favour with visit have brought five watchdog be countryman of mine be among who navigated fire ship other day sir john boswell have sent down be of course accustomed to keep watch at night one of be mate of vessel will be in command of speaks little italian so will understand order may give have be speaking to a came down will divide men into two watch will be on guard night will assign quiet place where can sleep in daytime can erect shelter with piece of sail cloth few bit of board will of course be furnished with food will be very glad to have for be always restless at night lest on watch must close eye see have quite made up mind that fort will not be attacked again so be le inclined to be vigilant than must be did think that attack be impending now that there be reason to believe that st nicholas might again be attacked gervaise be frequently there with order inquiry from grand master number of vessel in harbour be fitted up a fire ship so a to be in readiness when attack came be about to start early one morning when saw roger jervis coming up with heavy anchor on shoulder why what be bringing that up here for asked have be diving for see clothes be dripping with water ay ay sir have be in water that italian commander told to come straight up here to tell grand master about story right glad be to have met for must have made poor fist of alone know more of lingo than just to talk few word of then have better tell story before take in well be like sir knight have hudson jeffreys posted upon wall thought must take turn down on rock for be dark night can see much farther when be by edge of water than can when be at masthead sat there for hour be thinking that be about time to go up turn out other watch when saw something dark upon water be ship be certain if be boat there be one in be too dark to make quite sure what be watched for time though did not think much of thing taking for boat have got adrift maybe barrel from one of turkish ship presently made out that be good bit nearer than when first saw that puzzled there be tide to speak of in sea there be wind moving about must make out now that be boat though very small one certainly there be one rowing looked very strange craft a saw by way be bearing that must come ashore about five six fathom from where be sitting slid quietly off rock put sword down by handy for action waited presently boat came up alongside rock fellow stood up from behind stern be glad to see for have begun to think that there be witchcraft in thing moving along by can tell be savage with for not having guessed there be man swimming behind pushing on stooped over boat took something heavy out then felt about among rock under water then laid thing down there seemed to to be settling firm have mind to jump up let fly at then thought must be better to let finish what be doing go off with idea that one have seen so kept hid until started again waded short way before have to swim must see that a went be paying out rope over stern be clear enough now what have be up to have be fixing anchor what did for what use must be to must not say be certain that must not take trouble with chance of being knocked on head for nothing so waited for bit till have got out of sight over to other side of port then got up felt about chancing to get foot under rope went right over into water after that may guess be not long in finding anchor unknotted rope from carried ashore then struck that turk might take into head to give pull on in morning if did must find out that game whatever be have be found out so got hold of stone of about twenty pound weight fastened rope end round be enough to prevent rope getting slack make think that be still fast to anchor of course if pulled hard on must come home directly went reported matter first thing morning to governor seemed to think that be important told to bring anchor up to grand master who must get one of english knight to find out about for must not make out much of what said be very important gervaise said behaved very wisely in matter have rendered great service by discovery will take in at once to grand master still bearing anchor sailor followed gervaise into apartment where d'aubusson be taking council with of senior knight pardon interrupting highness gervaise said matter be so important that knew must listen to however occupied be then repeated narrative of sailor discovery be indeed of highest importance d'aubusson said knowledge that give may enable to defeat attempt might otherwise have proved ruin see knight solves question that be just discussing agreed that long floating bridge that have be constructing be intended to enable to cross outer port again attack st nicholas yet seemed to that even by night battery must be able to keep up such fire on boat towing head of bridge across a to render well nigh impossible for to get over now see what plan be with aid of rope end of think be firmly fixed on side mean to haul bridge across that so silently that hope to be upon almost before have time to don armour will now be fully prepared need have fear of result there must now be little doubt that attack must be made without loss of time especially a turk believed that must get bridge across unseen fire ship be altogether more formidable than gervaise have improvised be ordered to be made ready for action being arranged admiral left council at once that time must be lost in getting in readiness d'aubusson then turned to english sailor have rendered great service indeed by vigilance showed great prudence by allowing turk to believe that have accomplished mission unsuspected have thought have be observed other plan must have be adopted for so great service be meet that great reward must be given then took bag from hand of one of secretary whom have sent to fetch while be discussing matter of fire ship here be two hundred golden crown added handing bag to seaman with can either settle on shore can build stout ship pursue calling must do so call st nicholas in remembrance of gratitude of order of st john for having saved that fort from turk astonished delighted at reward represented very large sum in day sailor stammered thanks added hope tonight that if again have charge of fire ship may be able to do more to prove to highness how grateful be for gift throughout day preparation for defence of st nicholas went on unceasingly gang of men a usual worked in breach a be deemed advisable that there must be outward show of activity must lead turk to suspect that design have be discovered reinforcement of men munition be sent along mole everything being taken out by boat rowing closely along under wall be hidden from view of turk barrel of greek fire pitch cauldron for heating latter store of firewood great ball of cotton steeped in oil turpentine sheaf of dart spike on short stave be after darkness fell to be thrust in among fallen masonry to form chevaux de frise other matter that ingenuity of defender must suggest be landed at water gate of fort while garrison be strengthened by addition of large number of knight store of ammunition be collected in readiness at battery commanded mouth of outer port by sunset d'aubusson felt that everything be possible have be done to meet impending storm at midnight turkish preparation be complete attack by bridge be to be assisted by large number of boat other craft many armed galley be also brought up to destroy tow away defender fire ship paleologus be down by shore directing preparation of best troop be placed upon floating bridge when be ready order be given to pull upon rope sooner however did strain come upon than there be jerk rope slackened be at once evident that anchor have be discovered well laid plan disconcerted paleologus be furious believing that attack have arranged must still be irresistible ordered number of boat to take bridge in tow while still larger force be to make direct attack upon breach movement be to be conducted a silently a possible until be discovered then dash forward be to be made be two o'clock before fresh arrangement be completed boat put out have gone short distance when anxious watcher in st nicholas learnt by dull confused sound that came across water that attack be in spite of failure of plan to take bridge silently across to be persevered in cannon be at once fired to give notice to other battery to be in readiness a soon a dark mass of boat be made out gun of fort opened destructive fire upon moment later be seconded by from fortress however be at present being fired almost at random a turkish boat must not be made out at distance now that need for concealment be at end turkish war cry rose shrilly in air boatman bent to oar great cannon at st anthony church hurled tremendous missile at tower seconded by fire of number of other piece have in darkness be brought down almost to water edge a before boat swept up to foot of breach turk leaped out undismayed by storm of shot climbed up to assault short ladder that have brought with enabled to surmount escarpment so laboriously made with loud shout of allah flung upon defender on crest of breach here be met by line even more difficult to break through than before knight be ranged three deep in front be armed with sword battleaxes while in other two line thrust spear out between swordsman covering with hedge of steel point others in rear brought up bucket of blazing pitch greek fire advancing through gap left for purpose hurled bucket down into struggling mass on slope there fire not only carried death among assailant lurid flame enabled battery to direct shot with terrible effect upon breach crowded boat at foot bridge be with immense labour presently got into position be not long before fresh light be thrown upon scene a fire ship issuing out from inner harbour burst into column of flame towed by boat came into action be convoyed by two galley with full complement of knight soon became engaged in fierce fight with turkish vessel that bore down to arrest course of fire ship scene be indeed terrible one roar of cannon shout of combatant scream of poor wretch upon whom terrible greek fire fell clash of arm shout cry of turk a pressed across bridge united in din thrilled with horror spectator in city on st stephen hill several of turkish galley in effort to arrest approach of fire ship towards bridge became involved in flame be so far successful that when daylight broke bridge be still intact combat at breach continued to rage with determination fury on side turk there be led by brave young prince named ibrahim near relative of sultan with whom be great favourite be ever in front line of assailant splendid bravery animating soldier to continue effort a daylight broadened out however light enabled christian gunner to aim with far greater accuracy than have before be possible concentrating fire upon bridge across reinforcement continued to press to support of assailant succeeded in sinking so many of boat that be no longer passable next turned fire upon turkish galley four of sank shortly afterwards ball struck gallant young leader of turk who although previously several time wounded have continued to fight in front line fell dead follower disheartened by fall by destruction of bridge at once abandoned effort rushed down to foot of breach terrible scene enacted at repulse of previous attack be now repeated concentrated fire of gun of defender carried destruction into crowded mass gained boat still remained uninjured rowed for opposite shore greater number rushed into water strove to recross either by swimming by aid of debris of shattered boat total loss be greater even than suffered by in first attack between two three thousand being killed drowned among number of best officer amount of spoil in form of rich jewel costly gold ornament found on body of dead piled on breach be very great for three day after terrible repulse turk be inactive pasha remaining shut up in tent refusing to see one to issue order at end of time roused from stupor of grief disappointment abandoning idea of further attack upon point have cost so dearly ordered troop to move round renew attack upon wall in front of jew quarter commence construction of battery on edge of great ditch facing retrenchment behind breach before effected knight of italy spain determined to seize opportunity of retrieving disgrace have fallen upon at night descended into deep cutting carrying across ladder silently mounting opposite side rushed with loud shout into unfinished battery turk there taken utterly by surprise made slight resistance few be immediately cut down rest fled panic knight at once set woodwork of battery on fire hurled gun down into ditch then returned triumphantly into town dashing feat completely reinstating in good opinion of grand master comrade incident showed pasha that must neglect precaution accordingly commenced work at distance from wall pushed approach regularly forward until again established battery on site of from troop have be so unceremoniously ejected while forming approach workman have be constantly harassed by fire from gun on wall suffering considerable loss of life numerical superiority be so vast that loss in way affected plan of pasha a soon a battery be completed gang of men accustomed to mining operation set to work in rear to drive sloping passage downwards opening into face of great cutting through vast quantity of earth stone be poured so a to afford passage across depth being largely diminished by great pile of rubbish have already fallen from breached wall novel mode of attack be altogether unexpected knight have regarded fosse have be cut at enormous expenditure of labour a forming altogether impassable obstruction be dismayed at seeing progress made in filling up d'aubusson full of resource a be saw that defence be seriously threatened unless plan of meeting unexpected danger must be devised consulted maitre george latter must make suggestion only advice being erection of battery at spot where be almost self evident that must be of utility whatever other circumstance combined to render suspicion d'aubusson have entertained of good faith of renegade almost certainty george be seized tried put to torture under owned that have be sent into town for purpose of betraying be same day hung in great square guilt must always be considered a uncertain there be proof against save own confession confession extorted by torture be of value there be certainly many good ground for suspicion be possible that george really repented apostacy acted in good faith in deserting standard of paleologus be undoubtedly man of altogether exceptional ability acquirement even knight who have written account of siege do justice to fascination of manner charm of conversation d'aubusson now set to work in direction to counteract effort of turk erected immense wooden catapult threw huge piece of rock into midst of turkish work crushing down wooden screen erected to hide approach breaking in covered way causing great loss of life among besieger at same time gallery be driven below breach opening into ditch where exit be concealed by mass of rubbish through strong working party issued out at night carried away up passage rock other material that turk have during day brought with immense labour from distance to shoot material so carried away be piled up behind retrenchment greatly adding to thickness strength for day turk observed to astonishment that road be constructing across ditch be diminishing instead of increasing in bulk at length became so evident that garrison be in way removing material that pasha determined to deliver assault before heap be so far diminished a to become impassable former defeat have however taught that success must not be always calculated upon however good prospect might appear although have real hope that defender must yield sent formal summons for to do so be refused with disdain preparation be at once made for assault pasha promised to soldier sack of town booty captured so assured be of success that sack be made to carry off plunder stake on knight when taken prisoner be to be impaled be prepared sharpened soldier carried coil of rope with to secure captive before ordering assault way be prepared for by terrible fire from siege gun of turk be kept up for twenty four hour so tremendous be effect that knight be unable to remain on rampart turkish troop moved into position for attack movement being covered by roar of gun soon after sunrise on nd of july signal be given at number of different point turk rushed to assault attack save on breach be merely feint to distract attention of garrison to add to confusion caused by sudden unexpected onslaught pasha plan be well designed carried out knight unable to keep place on rampart under storm of missile have retired to shelter behind wall there be thought of instant assault a considered that must not be delivered until new wall behind breach have be demolished consequently rush of turk found defender altogether unprepared swarming across mass of debris in ditch ascended breach without opposition scaling ladder be placed against new wall before knight must hurry up to defence even before alarm be given in town turkish standard be waving on parapet moslem be crowding on to wall in vast number suddenness of attack complete surprise sound of battle at various point around wall caused for time confusion dismay among knight charged with defence of wall facing breach roused by uproar inhabitant of town rushed up to roof to ascertain what be happening cry of wild terror alarm at seeing turkish banner on wall added to confusion d'aubusson sprang up from couch on have thrown in full armour at first sound of alarm sending off message to auberge to summon man to defence ran down into town followed by small party of knight rushing through street now filled with half dressed people wild with terror reached foot of wall whose summit be crowded with enemy saw in instant that be lost unless must be driven thence without delay effect of presence be instantaneous knight hitherto confused dismayed rallied at once prepared for desperate undertaking bank on inside be almost perpendicular charged with defence have used two three ladder for ascending to rampart be at once seized planted against wall position of contending party be now reversed christian be assailant turk defender d'aubusson be first to ascend covering head with shield mounted rampart ere must gain footing on top be severely wounded hurled backwards again made attempt be again wounded thrown down once more mounted time made good footing moment later gervaise who have accompanied from palace stood beside animated with same spirit a leader threw recklessly against turk using short heavy mace in melee be far more useful than long sword scimitar clashed upon helmet armour at blow struck turk fell for foot gained knight sprang on to wall joined moment number increased war cry of order rose louder fiercer above din very number of turk told against crowded together a be must not use weapon effectually pressing fiercely upon knight drove back along wall on hand hurling down into street over rampart on so narrow field of battle advantage be on side of knight whose superior height strength protection afforded by armour rendered almost invincible nerved a be with fury at surprise have overtaken knowledge that fate of city depended upon effort after quarter of hour desperate conflict turk be driven down partial breach effected in wall by last bombardment christian be again master of rampart paleologus however hurried up reinforcement headed by band of janissary whose valour have decided many obstinate conflict before ordering to advance gave instruction to company of men of approved valour to devote effort to attacking d'aubusson whose mantle rich armour rendered conspicuous object among defender of breach advancing to attack janissary burst through mass of turk still continuing conflict rushed up breach then chosen band separating from rest flung upon grand master suddenness fury of attack isolating gervaise from knight around surrounded a be by foe already suffering from two severe wound shaken by fall from ladder grand master yet made valiant defence in front while gervaise hurling mace into face of one of assailant drawing two handed sword covered from attack from behind d'aubusson received two more severe wound still fought on gervaise while in act of cutting down assailant heard shout of triumph from behind looking round saw grand master sinking to ground from wound with cry of grief fury gervaise sprang to receiving a did so several blow on armour shield intended for fallen knight standing across showered blow with such strength swiftness that janissary shrank back before sweep of flashing steel more than one who tried to spring into close quarter fell cleft to chin ere assailant must combine for general rush body of knight who have just beaten off assailant fell upon rank of janissary with force fury there be withstanding chosen troop of sultan for first time broke fled excited almost to madness by sight of beloved master stretched bleeding on ground knight dashed down breach in eager pursuit action be decisive of fate of struggle panic among janissary at once spread main body of troop who have hitherto valiantly striven to regain advantage snatched from now lost heart fled in confusion escape be barred by great body of reinforcement pressing forward across heap of rubbish formed breach over deep ditch maddened by fear fugitive strove to cut way through friend whole of defender of breach now fell upon rear of struggling mass hewing down almost without resistance while cannon from wall tower kept up unceasing fire until last survivor of what have become massacre succeeded in gaining work beyond ditch fled to camp from gateway postern knight now poured out gathering together advanced to attack of st stephen hill met with faint resistance greater portion of disorganised troop have made pause at camp have continued headlong flight to harbour where ship be moored paleologus heartbroken despairing at failure sharing flight camp with rich booty great banner of pasha fell into hand of victor who satisfied with success exhausted by effort made attempt to follow flying foe to hinder embarkation for even now turk enormously outnumbering a did might be driven by despair to resistance so desperate a once again to turn tide of victory chapter xxiii reward of valour gervaise knew nothing at time of final result of battle for a soon a knight have burst through circle of opponent sank insensible on body of grand master when came to be lying on bed in hospital of order a soon a moved ralph harcourt who be with other knight occupied in tending wounded came to bedside thank god that be conscious again gervaise told that be faintness loss of blood that none of wound be likely to prove mortal for last twelve hour have declared that be asleep looked so white must not fear must never wake again how be grand master gervaise asked eagerly ralph shook head be wounded sorely gervaise leech declares that one at least of wound be mortal still can not bring to believe that so great hero will be taken away in moment of victory after having done such marvel for cause not only of order of christendom then beat back again from breach gervaise said be not be in such confusion that sallied out captured camp with pasha banner enormous quantity of spoil pursued to harbour then halted fearing that might in desperation turn upon terribly weakened a be by loss have again snatched victory from grasp so let go on board ship without interference morning there be not turkish sail in sight inhabitant be well nigh mad with joy elated a be at success gladness be sorely damped by state of grand master loss of so many of comrade though indeed langue have suffered le than of others for brunt of attack on st nicholas breach did not fall upon still lost heavily when at last hurried up to win back wall from who have fallen gervaise asked among principal knight be thomas ben henry haler thomas ploniton john vaquelin adam tedbond henry batasbi henry anlui marmaduke lumley be dangerously wounded of younger knight fifteen have be killed among old enemy river died coward death only one thank god of langue when fray be thickest sir john boswell marked crouching behind parapet seized by gorget hauled out knee shook so that must scarcely walk must have slunk back when released sir john raised mace to slay a disgrace to order langue when ball from one of turkish cannon cut well nigh in half so that fell by hand of turk not by

must be glad to stay here to assist in work highness there be plenty of knight to see to d'aubusson replied will be long before be fit for such work no give order for to proceed with caretto to genoa unless indeed must prefer to go to other locality to recruit strength must much rather go with sir fabricius highness than to place where have acquaintance have great esteem respect for be worthy of

be delighted to see be sorry have kept waiting so long at present genoa indeed europe be agog at news of defeat of turk italy especially see clearly enough that have rhodes fallen must have be next object of attack by mahomet therefore lady must not hear of leaving until have told something at least of event of siege also how came about that be there to share in defence see that be ready to land therefore let be going at once most of people will be taking siesta at present will get through street without being mobbed for can assure that mantle of order be just at present in such high favour have hard task to wend way through street to cousin house on arriving at palace of countess of forli gervaise be surprised at change have taken place in lady claudia from what caretto have said be prepared to find that have grown out of girlhood have altered much have however changed even more than have expected have become thought fairest woman that have ever seen countess greeted with great cordiality claudia came forward with timidity contrasted strangely with outspoken frankness remembered in girl for time chatted together of event of siege of captivity news that have be captured threw quite gloom over sir gervaise countess said at first consoled with thought that must speedily be ransomed when month passed by heard that effort of grand master have failed to discover where have be taken must have lost hope have not be that cousin have returned after even longer captivity among moor be glad to hear that did not suffer so many hardship a did be in way to be pitied countess gervaise said lightly have kind master for month be treated a friend rather than a slave afterwards have good fortune to be made head of labourer at building in sultan palace although certainly worked with labour be not greater than one must perform without distress have naught to complain of a to condition after talking for upwards of hour countess told caretto that have several matter on needed counsel retired with to next room of suite opening from apartment in have be sitting for minute two others sat silent then claudia said have changed much since saw last sir gervaise then seemed to scarcely possible that must have performed feat of destroying corsair fleet now be not so difficult to understand have widened out bit lady claudia moustache be really moustache not pretence at one otherwise feel have changed alteration in be infinitely greater too have filled out said with smile be thin girl then corner angle don t want compliment of to tell truth be heartily sick so went on in softer tone have actually brought gage home oh sir gervaise eye filled with tear cousin have told how must have be so foolish a to remain voluntarily in captivity that might recover gage child have given not child lady claudia girl not yet woman admit yet be not given in spirit of young girl in of earnest woman have taken vow never to part with a have pledged to bestow similar favour upon other knight be confident that must keep vow although in case a true knight be bound to preserve gift still more so be bound by thought of manner in have presented to must not have blamed must never have dreamt of blaming said earnestly for losing a did felt sure lady claudia have be absolutely beyond power to regain must not have blamed be not beyond power that being so have be obliged to wait for ten year instead of two must not have come back to without moreover must remember that prized beyond thing have often scoffed at knight of order like ours wearing lady favour have always thought absurd that pledged a be must thus declare admirer of one woman more than seemed to gage of kind be too sacred to be shown spoken of only mentioned to caretto a cross questioned a to why refused offer of ransom must not have done so then have not be present when be bestowed regarded not a lightly given favour result of passing fancy by one who gave favour freely a pledge of friendship a guerdon for what have done therefore more to be honoured than gift of republic freed from passing danger have then be what be now might have be foolish enough to think of in light regardless of fact that be rich heiress of one of noblest family in italy knight with possession save sword say not so sir gervaise said impetuously be not knight on whom genoa florence have bestowed citizenship whom holy father have thanked who have be honoured by pisa whom ferdinand of naples have created knight of grand cross of st michael whom grand master have singled out for praise among valiant knight of order of st john who a cousin tell saved fort commanded from capture who stood alone over fallen grand master surrounded by crowd of foe how can speak of a simple knight then stopped sat silent for minute while flush of colour mounted to cheek give gage again sir gervaise said gently in silence gervaise removed from neck wondering greatly what must be intention turned over over in hand sir knight said be of great value in eye when bestowed upon be gage not gift now be to of value beyond richest gem on earth be proof of faith loyalty of knight most esteem honour so in giving to again part with with pang for have far greater reason to prize than can have gave before a girl proud that knight who have gained such honour applause must wear favour without thought that trinket be heart give to now a woman far prouder than before that must wear gage not blind to meaning of emblem gervaise took hand a fastened round neck kissed then still holding said do know what be doing claudia be raising hope have never be presumptuous enough to cherish can not help that said softly there be assuredly presumption in hope paused moment must not esteem said holding hand now be false to vow will return to rhodes tomorrow ask grand master to forward to pope endorse petition may be released from vow to order can not think that holy father will refuse request then when be free can tell how love honour how a have in past devoted life to order so will in future devote to happiness girl bowed head 't be right must be so said have waited feeling in heart that vow have given must bind for life must be content to wait year longer if need be be bound by vow can acknowledge that have long be lord of life that so long a wore heart have given so long must listen to wooing of other fear that countess mother gervaise began interrupted need not fear said mother have long known knowing also be not given to change have ceased to importune to listen to other offer sole objection be that might never return from captivity now that have come back with added honour will not only offer objection will be sure receive gladly especially a know that cousin sir fabricius for whom have greatest affection hold in such high esteem six month later gervaise again landed at genoa after having stayed at rome for few day on way back d'aubusson have expressed no surprise at return to rhodes at request made caretto prepared for said smiling when asked if might accompany to genoa order will be loser for must assuredly have risen to grand priorage of langue day have right to complain have done duty more doubt not must mahomet again lay siege to rhodes may count on hastening here to aid assuredly may sir must danger threaten sword will be a much at service of order a if be still member of by mean disapprove d'aubusson went on of knight leaving when have performed active service for in civil life sometimes have in power to render better service to order than if passing life in quiet duty of provincial commandery will be so in case lady be great heiress a possessor of wide land influence in northern italy may be very valuable to in case of need will like brother de monteuil be able to bring gathering of men at arm to aid have fear that pope will refuse to release from vow recommendation alone must be sufficient a moreover be under obligation to will do so without hesitation since have be away friend harcourt have be appointed commander of galley sir john boswell being incapacitated by grievous wound received during siege have accepted rich commandery in england sailed two day since to
