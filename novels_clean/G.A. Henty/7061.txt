working among crucible retort however only said do think of undertaking education by mean mr ormskirk said hastily must be impossible for to find time at present when have completed study must then take in hand make companion assistant teach be known of science in meantime in meantime yes suppose something must be done might get tutor must be great disturbance to might send up to monastery at westminster where son of many gentleman be taught doubt whether training rather want of training that have have must fit for westminster prior said quietly there be plan that perhaps might be more suitable for one of brother be scholar already three four of son of gentry in neighbourhood come to for three hour so day convent be poor one fee receives be welcome addition to mean excellent mr ormskirk said delighted at difficulty being taken off shoulder must be very thing then perhaps will speak to boy lay order upon prior said be in village a passed by brought up here very much against

son well well suppose be not to be blamed be own fault for being so heedless of be bad edgar said yet be own fault rather than thine be thankful that good prior have brought condition before before be too late there must be more of appearance be disgraceful to to because be in rag to yourself because be dirty have never dreamt of henceforth must be changed must be clothed a befits son of gentleman must be taught a be right for son of scholar to be must bear in mind that day will become gentleman yourself trust learned one have arranged with good prior here that will go day to monastery to be

nine to twelve in afternoon will procure teacher for in arm in day gentleman must learn use of weapon although most peacefully inclined have more than once be forced when abroad to use man who can not do so becomes butt of fool loses self respect will like sir edgar said eagerly can play at quarter staff now with boy of size in village well there must be more of that father said up to present have be child be time now that must cease to consort with village boy prepare for station in life may be good boy know naught about be not fit associate for be not blaming said more kindly a saw boy face fall be natural that having associate of own rank must make friend where must find trust that have done harm well prior day week boy will come to must get befitting clothes for other pupil will think that be son of hedge tinker hour later andrew be despatched to dartford in cart hired in village with order to bring back with tailor also to inquire a to who be considered best teacher of arm in town to engage to come up for hour afternoon to instruct edgar seven year have passed since time rough unkempt boy have grown into tall young fellow who have done fair credit to teacher at convent have profited to full by teaching of old soldier who have be instructor in arm father have unconsciously be also good teacher to have with great effort broken through habit to have be so long wedded young waiting maid now assisted housekeeper meal be no longer hastily snatched often eaten standing be decently served in order occupied considerable time greater portion of be spent in pleasant chat upon scene mr ormskirk have witnessed abroad in talk on subject boy be studying sometimes also upon mr ormskirk research hope entertained from a edgar grew older upon ordinary topic of day grievance caused by heavy taxation trouble of time course of event have led to for although very ignorant of contemporary matter mr ormskirk be well acquainted with history of country up to time when have first gone abroad recluse be surprised at interest came to feel in conversation while endeavouring to open son mind opened own although when edgar be not present pursued research a assiduously a before be no longer lost in fit of abstraction must even occasionally walk down to village when edgar went to school in order to continue conversation upon be engaged edgar on part soon ceased to regard father a stranger admiration for store of information learning served a stimulant to study for previous life have given little liking for last two year however father have seen with regret that there be little hope of making profound scholar of that unless must discover solution of problem still eluded there be little chance of being found by successor once roused have good sense to see that be not in such life that edgar be likely to find success wisely abandoned idea of pressing task upon that saw be unfitted to boy nature energy with edgar worked with instructor in arm who have be already twice changed so a to give greater opportunity of attaining skill with weapon interest with lad listened to tale of adventure showed direction in bent lay for last two year father have frequently read to record of sir walter manny other chronicler of war warlike adventure impressed upon virtue necessary to render man at once great soldier great man if boy said must day go to court mingle in public affair above thing keep clear of party who cling to party may rise with success such rise be ever followed by revers then come great suffering to upon fallen side duty of english gentleman be simple must work for country regardless altogether of personal interest man may never rise to high rank will be respected personal honour be little to be desired be upon who stand higher than neighbour that blow fall heaviest while rank file may escape unscathed be noble leader whose head fall upon block think that there be trouble in store for england duke of gloucester overshadows boy king a latter grows older will probably shake off tutelage though may be at cost of civil war then too there be exaction of tax gatherer day people will rise against a did in france at time of jacquerie a have done again again in flanders at present condition of common people who be villein serf be well nigh unbearable altogether future seems to to be dark confess that being student storm when burst will affect slightly a be clear to that be not life that will choose may affect greatly for however little may wish if civil strife come like everyone else may be involved in in such event edgar act a conscience dictate there be always much to be said for side of question can not be so in wish to lay stress on in way can not make good monk out of man who longs to be man at arm warrior of weakling who longs for shelter of cloister let however man strive to do best in line have chosen for good monk be a worthy of admiration a good man at arm must fain have seen great scholar a be clear that be out of question seeing that nature doe not incline to study must that must become brave knight be with view when sent to be instructed at convent also gave instructor in arm so whichever way inclination might finally point must be properly fitted for at fifteen lesson be given up edgar having by time learnt a much a be considered necessary in day continued exercise with weapon without strong idea that beyond defence against personal attack must be of use to army be not in day career when king have need of force to fight in france to carry fire sword into levy be called out noble baron supplied contingent archer men at arm be enrolled paid by king levy however be only liable to service for restricted time beyond personal retainer baron in time followed royal example of hiring men at arm archer for campaign being partly paid from royal treasury partly from own revenue at end of campaign however army speedily dispersed man returning to former avocation save therefore for retainer who formed garrison of castle of noble there be military career such a came into existence with formation of standing army nevertheless there be honour rank to be won in foreign war be to young men of gentle blood looked to make way since death of black prince matter have be quiet abroad unless for who be attached to household of powerful noble there be for present avenue towards distinction edgar have be talking matter over with prior of st alwyth who have taken great fancy to with whom have since have given up work at convent frequently have long conversation be engaged in one of when narrative begin quite agree with father prior continued be there just strong government mass of people might bear present position seems to a natural that serf must be transferred with land a if be herd of cattle for such be rule throughout europe a well a here one see that there be great difficulty in way of making alteration in state of thing see be men free to wander a chose over land instead of working at vocation country must be full of vagrant who for want of other mean for living must soon become robber then too very many must flock to town so far from bettering condition must find worse off than before for there must be more people than work must be found for illustration edgar talk matter over with prior of st alwyth so long a be called upon only to pay fifteenth to king treasury be contented enough now be called upon for tenth a well a fifteenth often be greatly exceeded by rapacity of tax collector other burden be put upon altogether men be becoming desperate then too cessation of war with france have brought back to country number of disbanded soldier who having got out of way of honest work lost habit of labour be discontented restless add to danger who live in country see thing king noble know nothing of treat with contempt well knowing that few hundred men at arm can scatter multitude of unarmed serf must give freedom to serf good father say not that must give absolute freedom must grant charter giving far greater right than at present fifteenth of labour be a much a must be called upon to pay when king necessity render needful that further money must be raised burden must only be laid upon back of who can afford to pay hear that there be much wild talk that doctrine of wickliffe have done grievous harm say not son that there be not abuse in church a well a elsewhere pestilent doctrine lead men to disregard authority to view natural master a oppressor hear that seditious talk be uttered openly in village throughout country that there be men who must fain persuade ignorant that above be drone who live on proceeds of labour a if indeed man however high in rank have not share of labour care fear then that if there must be rising of peasantry may have such scene a took place during jacquerie in france that many who must be thing different be in favour of giving more extended right to people will be forced to take side against can hardly think that must take up arm father must know that must not withstand charge of armour clad knight men at arm unhappily son mass think believe what plea to believe what men who go about stirring up sedition tell foresee that in end will suffer horribly before end come may commit sort of outrage may sack monastery murder monk for be also looked upon a drone may attack destroy house of better class even castle of smaller noble may even capture london lay in ash thought after have done thing terrible vengeance must be taken lot must be harder than before must never occur to take own house for instance what resistance must offer to fierce mob of peasant none edgar admitted why must attack prior be silent know what mean good father edgar said after pause say that father be magician because stir not abroad spends time on research remember when be small boy lad of village wished to anger must shout out 'here be magician son ' have many fight in consequence just so edgar ignorant always hate that can not understand so friar bacon be persecuted accused of dabbling in magic when be making discovery useful to mankind say not that will do great harm when first rise for can not be said that serf here be so hardly treated a be in france where lord have power of life death over must slay like cattle if chose none interfering hence hatred be so deep that in very first outbreak peasant fell upon noble massacred family here there be such feeling be against government tax so heavily that anger be directed fear that new poll tax have be ordered will drive to extremity have news across river in essex people of place have not only refused to pay have forcibly driven away tax gatherer when thing once begin there be saying how be going to end however if there be trouble think not that at first will be in danger here if have success at first pretension will grow will inflame love of plunder will take place of reasonable objection to over taxation seeing that have to stretch out hand to take what desire plunder rapine will become general a edgar walked back home felt that there be much truth in prior remark have heard many thing said among villager showed that patience be well nigh at end although since began study have time to keep up former close connection with village have always be on friendly term with old playmate talked far more freely with than must do to anyone else of gentle blood once twice have from spirit of adventure gone with to meeting be held after dark in quiet spot near dartford listened to talk of stranger from gravesend other place knew how heavily taxation pressed upon people sympathy be wholly with there have be nothing said even by most violent of speaker to offend protest be against exaction of tax gatherer extravagance of court hardship that men must be serf on land once have be addressed by secular priest from other side of river who have asserted that men be born equal have equal right sentiment have be loudly applauded have sense enough to see that be contrary to fact that men be not born equal one be son of noble other of serf one child be cripple weakling from birth strong lusty one be well nigh fool clear headed seemed to that there be must be difference many of secular clergy be among foremost in stirring up people smarted under disability for most part be what be called hedge priest men of little education looked down upon by regular clergy almost wholly dependant on contribution of hearer resented difference between richly endowed clergy religious house denounced priest monk a drone who sucked life blood of country be last gathering at edgar have be present have be shocked offended at preaching be name of priest knew not did villager went by name of jack straw be edgar thought dangerous fellow lad have objection to abuse of tax gatherer to complaint of extravagance of court man denunciation of monk clergy at once shocked angered edgar intercourse with villager have removed of prejudice generally felt by class in other respect naturally felt a did others of station resolved to go to more meeting after taking meal with father edgar mounted horse that latter have bought for rode over to house of one of friend number of who have like be taught by monk of st alwyth have increased somewhat there be when left six other lad there three of be intended for church be son of neighbouring landowner be to visit albert de courcy son of sir ralph de courcy that edgar be now riding albert have be special friend be about same age of very different disposition difference between character be perhaps chief attraction have drawn to other albert be gentle in disposition health be not good have be weakly child father who be stout knight regarded with slight favour have acceded willingly to desire to enter church feeling that must never make good fighter edgar on contrary be tall strongly built have never known day illness be somewhat grave in manner for companionship of father character of conversation have made older more thoughtful than most lad of age be eager for adventure burned for opportunity to distinguish while enthusiasm for noble exploit great commander interested quiet friend who have power of admiring thing that must not hope to imitate in alone of school fellow did edgar find sympathy with own feeling a to condition of people henry nevil laughed to scorn edgar advocacy of cause richard clairvaux more than once quarrelled with seriously on one two occasion almost betook to sword other three who be of le spirit took part in argument saying that thing did not concern being matter for king minister of interest whatever to in other respect edgar be popular with strength skill in arm gave authority even richard clairvaux acknowledged in cooler moment edgar visited at house of father father encouraging to do so a thought that association with equal must be great advantage to a far a manner be concerned however others with exception of albert de courcy who did not need gained more than did for mr ormskirk have during long residence at foreign university close connection with professor acquired certain foreign courtliness of bearing be in strong contrast to rough bluffness of speech manner characterized english of period have share in rendering so unpopular upon continent where although strength fighting power made respected be regarded a island bear manner be standing jest among frivolous noble of court of france at house of sir ralph de courcy edgar be special favourite lady de courcy be fond of because son be never tired of singing praise because saw that friendship be really benefit to somewhat dreamy boy aline girl of fourteen regarded with admiration be deeply attached to brother believed implicitly assertion that edgar must day become valiant knight while sir ralph liked for courtesy of bearing firmness steadiness of character have saw very beneficial influence over of albert sir ralph be now content that latter must enter church be unwilling that son must become what called mere shaveling desired that must attain power position in profession lack of ambition energy in son be grievance to almost a great a lack of physical power saw that although so far there be still absence of ambition yet boy have gained firmness decision from influence of friend that be far more likely to attain eminence in church than have be before be surprised that son of man whose pursuit despised must have attained such proficiency with weapon matter have learned when one day have tried skill with edgar in bout with sword recognized that with gift of manner strength enthusiasm for deed of arm be likely one day to make name for whenever therefore edgar rode over to sir ralph be certain of hearty welcome from a to lad opinion a to condition of peasantry opinion must have scouted a monstrous on part of gentleman sir ralph knew nothing albert having be wise enough to remain silent on subject custom of time being wholly opposed to anything like free expression of opinion on subject from lad to elder be quite time since be here last master ormskirk lady de courcy said when entered albert so often go up for talk with when have finished study at monastery that be forgetting here crave pardon mistress de courcy edgar said indeed have be working hard for father have obtained for good master for sword frenchman skilled in many device of english teacher be wholly ignorant have be teaching of young noble in london father hearing of skill have have down here at heavy cost for last month a be for moment without engagement in london be yesterday that returned naturally have desired to make utmost of opportunity most of time have be spent in fencing room have gained much by instruction sir ralph asked hope so sir ralph have tried best have be good enough to commend warmly even told father be aptest pupil that have will try bout with presently knight said be nigh two year since have one together arm be growing stiff for want of practice though day endeavour to keep in order for opportunity chance may occur by practising against imaginary foe by hammering with mace at corn sack swinging from beam methinks hit a hard a of old in truth know little of trick of frenchman availed nothing at poictiers against crushing downright blow still must gladly see what trick be like chapter ii fencing bout after have talked for short time with mistress de courcy edgar went to fencing room with sir ralph there put on helmet quilted leather jerkin with chain sewn on at shoulder now be to do best sir ralph said a handed sword to edgar took one so long a played gently edgar have advantage have learned trick well sir ralph said good temperedly in truth quick return puzzle greatly admit be unprotected must have chance with let see what must do be fighting in earnest took down couple of suit of complete body armour from wall albert who be looking on fastened buckle for of ah know how strap go sir ralph said in tone of satisfaction well be something to know that even if know what to do with when have got on now master edgar have at edgar stood on defence strong a arm be from constant exercise have difficulty to save head from sweeping blow sir ralph rained upon by faith young fellow sir ralph said a after three four minute drew back breathless from exertion muscle seem to be made of iron be fit to hold own in serious melee be wrong not to strike for know that more than once there be opening have be quick edgar be well aware of fact have not taken advantage of for felt that at age be best to abstain from trying to gain success must not be pleasant for good knight well well will fight no more latter said when albert have unbuckled father armour hung up edgar said now albert let have bout lad coloured hotly knight burst into hearty laugh might a soon challenge daughter aline well put on jerkin albert be well that must feel what poor creature man be who have never have sword in hand albert silently obeyed father order stood up facing edgar be about same height though albert looked slim delicate by side of friend by st george father exclaimed take up bad posture albert have looked at edgar often enough at exercise to see how ought to place have never seen look so manly since day be born now strike in sir ralph surprise at son attitude grew to amazement a sword clashed together saw that although edgar be not putting out full strength skill son instead of being scarce able a have expected to raise heavy sword not only showed considerable skill even managed to parry of trick of weapon to have fallen victim stop stop said at last be dreaming have someone else taken place of son take off helmet be indeed albert said a uncovered what magic be be little surprise that have prepared for sir ralph edgar said trust that will not be displeased two year ago persuaded albert that there be reason why even priest must not have firm hand steady eye that must help to overcome nervousness must make strong in body a well a in arm since time have practised with almost daily after have finished study at st alwyth master have done best for though of course have not strength a lack practice have have have gained wonderfully of late must in few year match in skill for what want in strength make up in activity master ormskirk knight said be beholden to more than can express mother have observed during last two year that have gained greatly in health have widened out in shoulder understand now how have come about have never questioned about indeed must a soon have thought of asking whether have made up mind to become king a whether have begun to use sword why see that have taught already of trick that have just learnt have not have time to instruct in many of sir ralph showed one two acquired so quickly that in month have doubt will know a well a do by st george have done wonder edgar a for albert be a pleased a if have heard that king have made earl truly indeed did master ormskirk tell that must do good to learn to use sword 't be not priest weapon although many priest bishop have ridden to battle before now have improved health given ten year more life than must be likely to have have without seemed to strange that son of house must be ignorant a to how to use sword now consider that seemed to almost disgrace be removed know mother aught of sir when began feared that resolution must soon fade indeed must have done so have not edgar constantly encouraged held to though indeed at first so fatigued that must scarce walk home can well understand lad now will come tell mother have news for dame will in small degree astonish said a followed by two lad returned to room where be sitting in first place young master ormskirk have proved better man than with sword say not so pray sir ralph edgar said in skill with french trick may have have better of with mace must have dashed brain out a must not have guarded head against blow that must have struck with not just yet perhaps knight said when get full strength must assuredly do so will be famous knight day dame be not most surprising piece of news what must say be to tell that weakling of ours although far from approaching skill strength of friend be yet able to wield heavy sword manfully skilfully must say that be dreaming be sir ralph well do say so in wide awake earnest master ormskirk have be instructor for last two year lad have be learning of of master account for change that have noticed in health bearing faith used to go along with stooping neck like girl who have outgrown strength now carry well health of late have left naught to be desired be for that friend invited to exercise with sword indeed recipe have done wonder voice have gained strength though still have girlish ring about speaks more firmly assuredly than used to do be indeed wonderful news sir ralph rejoice to hear master ormskirk be indeed beholden to for at one time doubted whether albert must ever live to grow into man of late have be gladdened at seeing so great change in though dreamed not of cause aline have stood open mouthed while father be speaking now stole up to albert side be pleased brother said may tell now what happened other day with black bull charged to say nothing about what be about black bull aline father said a caught word be naught sir albert replied colouring save that black bull in lower meadow ran at frightened away father girl broke in be not that at be walking through meadow together when black bull ran at albert said to 'run run aline ' did run a hard a must looked back for time a ran being greatly terrified a to what must come to albert stood still bull lowered head rushed at then sprang aside just a expected to see tossed into air caught hold of bull tail a went past held on till bull be close to fence then let go scrambled over while bull went bellowing down field well done well done sir ralph said why albert seems marvellous that must be doing such thing black bull be formidable beast strongest man if unarmed might well feel discomposed if saw coming rushing at will wager that if have not have that practice with sword must not have have quickness of thought enabled to get out of scrape might have stood between bull sister if have done so must only have be tossed perhaps gored trampled to death afterwards will have beast killed otherwise will be doing mischief there be not many who pas through field still want to have of tenant killed well master ormskirk wife feel grateful to for what have done for albert there be making of man in now let take up what trade will say much boy be not way if ever want friend whether be at court camp can rely upon to do a much for a must for one of own maybe more for deem that man can not well ask for favour for of own blood can speak good word even urge suit for one who be kin to so far a understand have not made up mind in what path will embark sir ralph for at present although can scarce be said to be at peace with french be not fighting with have be so must willingly have joined train of brave knight raising force for service there there be ever fighting in north with scot be war of skirmish not a be in edward reign moreover by what father say there seems reason for harrying scotland far near fighting at present be scarce of nature in much credit be to be gained might enter household of powerful noble lad father spoke to of sir ralph told that must rather that be with simple knight than with great noble for in rivalry between there might be trouble come upon land maybe even civil strife one who might hold head highest of one day might on morrow have struck off with executioner axe at rate be best at present to live quietly see how matter went before taking step must bind to fortune of one man more than father speaks wisely 't be not often that men who live in book spend time in pouring over mouldy parchment in well nigh suffocating with stinking fume have common sense in worldly matter when have conversed with father have always found that although take not much interest in public affair at present be marvellously well versed in history can give illustration in support of what say well whenever time come that think good for to leave fireside venture out into world have to come to will so far a be in power further design thank most heartily sir ralph glad be to have be of service to albert who have be almost a brother to since first met at st alwyth must go over see father have talk with about ride to london to morrow may be forced to tarry there for time when return will wait upon have talk a to plan for now doubt not must all rather be wandering about garden than sitting here with so will detain no longer albert be very angry with master ormskirk that did not take into counsel tell about learning to use sword aline said later on a watched edgar ride away through gateway of castle call very unkind of have not thought of being unkind aline albert said quietly when began did not feel sure that strength resolution must suffice to carry through indeed be at first very painful work for having never before taken strong exercise often must have given up from pain fatigue that caused have not edgar urged to persevere saying that in time must feel neither pain weariness therefore at first said nothing to knowing that must disappoint did give up then when arm gained strength edgar encouraged by praising progress began to hope that might yet come to be strong gain skill with weapon kept back in order might a have done to day have pleasure of surprising a well a father by showing be not so great milksop a have rightly deemed never thought that be milksop albert sister said indignantly knew that be not strong be sorry for be much nicer for that must be content to walk ride with to take interest in thing that like instead of being like henry nevil richard clairvaux who be always talking thinking of nothing how must go to war what must do there there be need must do aline edgar be much better swordsman than of know much more be much more likely to be famous knight day than nevil clairvaux be certain that hear talk about edgar be nice too girl said frankly very strong do not remember how carried home more than two mile when year ago fell down when be out with sprained ankle now albert perhaps day will get so strong that may not think of going into church shutting up life in cloister may come to be famous too have not thought of aline said gravely if ever did change mind must be that might always be with edgar be great friend with through life just a be now sir ralph wife be at time discussing same topic may yet be agatha that after boy may give up thought of being churchman have never said word against hitherto because seemed to that be fit for nothing else now that one see that have spirit have thanks to friend acquired taste for arm have strength never dreamt possessed matter be changed say not yet that be like to become famous knight need not that one must be able to swing heavy mace hold own in melee there be many post at court where one who be discreet long headed may hold own gain honour so that be not mere feeble weakling who can be roughly pushed to wall by blusterer must ask question concerning sir ralph wife said may be a say methinks that will be more likely that will turn to if ask question leave to think out for lad edgar have great influence over will assuredly use for good a for myself must be such great grief be albert to enter church a must be to though too must prefer that must not be lost to must rather that went to court played part there believe that have talent prior of st alwyth said that young ormskirk be by far most promising pupil of course latter have now ceased to study with having learned a much a be necessary for gentleman to know if be not intended for church albert be well aware what wish be that if have said naught against taking up profession be because deemed fit for other now will see that having done so much may well do more may be that in time may speak to tell that have changed mind on matter perhaps must be best so dame have good hope that will be a say care not much for court where lancaster gloucester overshadow king still man can play part there though must not that must attach to lancaster faction to gloucester for be ambitious will be struggle between for supremacy if go will go a king man richard a grows up will resent tutelage in be held will not be able to shake off will need men can rely upon prudent good adviser nearer to own age better may well be that albert must be like to gain rank honour more quickly in way than by doughty deed in field be good that man must stick to last a for must rather delve a peasant than mix in intrigue of court there must be courtier a well a fighter say not aught against boy with quiet voice habit of going about making little more noise than cat be far better suited for life than with rough speech fiery temper for manner have also much to thank young ormskirk edgar caught from father who though strange man according to thinking be yet singularly courteous gentleman albert have taken from friend well wife will put down a one of fortunate day for never have heard better news than albert gave afternoon when edgar returned home told father what have taken place thought that sir ralph must be mightily pleased day when heard that son have be so zealously working here with too be glad to see be altogether without influence to push fortune learning can give scarce know man at court for while lived at highgate seldom went abroad save for visit now then from scholar anxious to consult scarce being entered house therefore beyond relating to such matter of history a be well for to know by telling of deed of caesar other great commander must do naught for have done great deal for father have taught more of military matter of history of country of france italy than can be known to most people will assuredly be of much advantage to in future may be so edgar great thing be to make first start here must in way aid have often wondered how matter must be brought about now have obtained powerful friend for although sir ralph de courcy be simple knight with great heritage wife be daughter of lord talbot be one of most valiant of noble knight who fought so stoutly in france spain a such be known to respected by who bore part in war therefore can do for service that of others be most necessary king be well aware that be one of knight in whom black prince father have fullest confidence to whom owed life more than once in thick of melee thus then when time come will be able to secure for post in following of brave leader must rather that be so than in household of great noble who must assuredly take one side other in faction of court be too young for a yet being too old to be page too young for esquire must therefore wait until be old enough to enter service a esquire a one of retinue of military leader must rather be esquire ride to battle to win spur must not care to become knight simply because be owner of so many acre of land must wish to be knighted for service in field so must also edgar holding here be large enough to entitle to rank of knight did choose to take up indeed must be with a be with many others empty title holding land enough for knight fee must of course be bound to send so many men into field be called upon to do so must send a substitute if call must not come until be two three year older in way must be le likely to gain opportunity for winning honour than if formed part of following of well known knight be call to come must go with few better than sir ralph who must be sure to be in thick of if come not ere long may think too old to take field contingent must doubtless be led by knight a substitute think not father that sir ralph be likely to regard a lying on shelf for time to come be still very strong man must chafe like caged eagle be there blow to be struck in france unable to share in four day later man who have be down to town returned with budget of news edgar happened to be at door when rode past what be news master clement said for saw that man looked excited alarmed there be bad news young master mighty bad news thou knowest how in essex men have refused to pay poll tax there have be naught of on side of river a yet though there be sore grumbling seeing that tax collector be not content with drawing tax from of proper age often demand payment for boy girl who a might see be still under fourteen happened so to day at dartford one of tax collector went to house of wat tyler wife have money for tax hers man insolently demanded tax for daughter who be girl of twelve when mother protested that child be two year short of age offered so gross insult to girl that mother screamed out neighbour ran with news to wat who be at work on roof of house near being full of wrath thereat ran hastily home entering smote man so heavily on head with hammer carried that killed on spot collector knave must have seized wat neighbour ran in drove from town with blow whole place be in ferment many have arm in hand be declaring that will submit more to exaction will fight rather than pay for life be of little value to if be to be ground to earth by leech fleming trader in town have hidden away for in present humour mob might well fall upon kill be against fleming indeed that feeling of country people ran highest tax be not a usual collected by royal officer by men hired by flemish trader settled in england proceeds of have be bestowed upon several young noble intimate of king have borrowed money from fleming on security of tax amount that be likely to produce have be considerably overrated result be that fleming finding that must be heavy loser by transaction ordered collector to gather in a much a possible obeyed instruction rendering by conduct exaction of poll tax even more unpopular than must have be have be collected by royal officer who must have be content with sum must be legally demanded be serious news edgar said gravely fear that much trouble may come of doubtless tax collector misbehaved grossly employer will take heed of will lay complaint before king of slaying of one of servant of assault upon others by mob of dartford so that erelong will be having troop of men at arm sent hither to punish town ay young master not being of dartford must not care so much for there be hot spirit elsewhere there be many who must be like to take up arm a well a men at dartford to resist attack then trouble must spread there be saying how far may grow true enough clement well may hope that when men mind become calmer people of dartford will think best to offer to pay fine in order to escape bloodshed may be so man said shaking head though doubt there have be too much preaching of sedition say not that people have not many real grievance way to right be not by taking up of arm by petition to crown parliament rode on edgar going in to father told what have heard from clement 't be what feared mr ormskirk said english be patient race not given a be of foreign nation to sudden burst of rage so long a taxation be legal must pay however hardly pressed when come to demanding money for child under age to insulting be pushing matter too far fear with edgar that trouble will spread be sorry for people for however loudly may talk however valiant may be can assuredly offer weak resistance to strong body of men at arm will make case worse by taking up arm history show that mob be seldom able to maintain struggle against authority just at first success may attend a soon a who govern recover from first surprise be not long before put down movement be sorry not only for men for others who like altogether disapprove of rising just at first mob may obey leader act with moderation be like wild beast sight of blood maddens if rising must become serious one will see that there will be burning ravaging head will be smitten off after slaying consider chief culprit will turn against in better condition than last time sir ralph de courcy be over here told that priest called jack straw many others be heard not only preaching sedition against government seizure of good of wealthy confiscation of estate of monastery division of wealth of rich nice programme just one must be acceptable to men without penny in pocket sir ralph said that must give much if with dozen men at arm must light upon meeting of people when must give lesson must silence saucy tongue for long time to come told be glad that have not opportunity for methought must do more harm than good 'you wo think so said 'when there be mob of rascal thundering at door resolved to make bonfire of precious manuscript to throw into midst of ' ' have doubt replied 'that at time must welcome news of arrival of men at arm have store of good must attract cupidity ' ' knight said know that among common people be accounted magician because be wiser than be ' ' know that ' replied 'it be same in country credulous mob think that scholar although may spend life in trying to make discovery will be of inestimable value to be magician in league with devil however although not fighting man may posse mean of defence be to full a serviceable a sword battle ax have long foreseen must trouble arise villager of st alwyth must be like enough to raise cry of magician to take opportunity of ridding of one vaguely fear many month ago made preparation to meet such storm to show that magician be not altogether defenceless that compound in power be well nigh a dangerous a believe only not in same way 'well hope that will find so if there be trouble recommend if hear that there be talk in village of making assault upon that send messenger to straightway may be sure that ere hour have passed will be here with dozen stout fellow who will drive rabble before like sheep ' thank much for offer sir ralph will bear in mind must there be occasion think may be able to manage without need for bloodshed be vastly more formidable enemy than be imagine that have greater respect for supposed magical power than have for weight of arm heavy though be ' 'perhaps be so friend ' sir ralph said grimly 'for have not felt full weight yet though own must rather meet bravest knight in battle than raise hand against man whom believed to be possessed of magical power laughed said that so far a knew such power existed 'your magician be chemist said object of search be elixir of life philosopher stone may be powerful for good be assuredly powerless for evil ' surely believe in power of sorcery ' said 'all men know that there be sorcerer who can command power of air bring terrible misfortune down on oppose ' ' believe that there be men who posse such power said 'there be knave who may pretend to have such power be only to gain money from credulous in reading have never come upon single instance of man who have really exercised such power do believe that such power exist men have at time believed in portent even roman army must turn back be on march against enemy if hare ran across road be following say not that there may not be something in such portent though even of have doubt still like dream may be sent to warn assuredly man have naught to do with occurrence must be not peaceful man draw sword a readily against most famous enchanter a against other man of same strength skill with weapon ' must see that good knight be shocked at light way in spoke of magician indeed power of superstition over men otherwise sensible be wonderful however took leave without saying more than that men at arm must be ready if sent for chapter iii wat tyler that evening mr ormskirk continued subject of talk of afternoon looked surprised edgar when said that told sir ralph have made preparation for defence that of compound in laboratory be a dangerous a common people regard although danger have naught to do with magical property must know that many substance while wholly innocent in be capable of dealing wide destruction when be mixed together for example saltpetre charcoal sulphur a friar bacon discovered make when mixed together powder whose explosive power be well nigh beyond belief be now coming into use a destructive agent in war many other compound can be produced of explosive nature indeed of such powerful sudden action that dare not even make experiment with many other strange thing have be discovered of may seem useless at present may upon further experiment on property turn out of value to man substance discovered two year ago be experimenting upon bone endeavouring to ascertain whether powder might not be procured when mixed with other substance must produce unexpected result after calcining bone treated white ash with various acid alkaloid with fire water returning again again to trial when have time while conducting experiment found that there be certainly substance present with whose nature be altogether unacquainted one evening going into laboratory after dark observed with astonishment what looked like lambent flame upon table in alarm ran forward to put out found that there be heat in lighting lamp must no longer see on table found few grain of stuff have be experimenting on turning out lamp light be again visible after much thought concluded that be similar to light given by little creature called glowworm in turn somewhat resembles light can be seen at time in pile of decaying fish tried many experiment a nothing came of gave up not seeing that use must come of fire gave out heat produced powder however that when rubbed on substance became luminous in dark presenting appearance strange sufficiently alarming to ignorant thinking matter over time ago took little of powder from phial in have stored away moistening rubbed on wall in form of circle triangle other sign did just before became dark a moisture dried figure gradually assumed luminous appearance saw use to must be put in awing mob setting to work made large supply of powder how long doe retain light father be uncertain for hour in darkened room light gradually growing fainter if bright day follows figure stand out on following night a brightly a before while if day be dull show up faintly at night see not that use can come of such thing for light be at time too faint to be used for reading unless page be held quite close to come downstairs with will show head of one of old roman statue that be dug up near rochester bought for few penny last year went down into laboratory light be burning there see edgar have painted head with stuff now can see nothing more unusual than if have be daubed with whitewash now will extinguish lamp prepared a be edgar nevertheless stepped back with exclamation of surprise almost awe head stood out in darkness with startling distinctness have effect of being bathed in moonlight although much more brilliant than even light of full moon seemed to indeed almost a if faint wavering light played around giving stern face of old roman sardonic evil expression can touch edgar will see that there be not slightest warmth be wonderful father yes be strange thing be so far a can see of use save a wonder be just one of wonder to most people must seem to be magical showed short time ago to prior having explained to beforehand how have discovered be above superstition of folk in general knowing must have motive in deceiving be much interested said to be one of thing be best concealed can quite understand that there be many thing in nature of be ignorant know that what say of decayed fish sometimes giving out light like be perfectly true everyone know that glowworm when weather be damp light up bank field although heat can be felt doubtless in research on bone have discovered substance akin to cause light in case must never persuade vulgar of 'nay there be even churchman prelate who must view a magic therefore friend seeing that a say powder be not likely to be of use to man must say that be best that destroy for if whisper of got abroad might well be accused of dealing in magic knowledge of thing beyond be magic to ignorant roger bacon be treated a magician doubt not that will ever be case with who be more learned than fellow men therefore advice to be burn stuff say naught about ' did not take advice edgar for seemed to that might well be used to awe unruly mob might come hither at night to attack have made experiment though believe not in supernatural must have frightened have seen without knowing anything of nature know that old skull be dug up out of garden last month have hung lower jaw on wire so that can be moved have to day painted now will blow out light again then take from cupboard moment later room be in darkness then exclamation of surprise almost terror rose from edgar in front of there be gibbering skull lower jaw wagging up down a if engaging in noiseless laughter be much more brilliant than stone head have be lambent flame played round what think ye of edgar be ghastly sir horrible be not pleasant object father said quietly a struck tinder again lighted lamp fancy edgar that if mob of people be to break down door find confronted by object must fly in terror assuredly must father must not stop running side of dartford even though expected sight sent shiver through teeth well nigh chattered must only avail in case of night attack must avail something even in daylight edgar downstairs room have little light little intend to block up by nailing board inside by hanging sack over outside then if place skull in passage who sought in laboratory must be brought to standstill there be other mean have buried jar filled with friar bacon powder round house with train by can be fired at present common people know little of gun methinks that explosion of two three of jar must send about business have other device be not necessary to enter upon must be effective therefore need have little fear that mob will gain entrance here may be sure that after repulse must be very loath to touch place again yes father might bring accusation against of witchcraft admit that there be that danger prior here have long taken interest in investigation can testify for that be scientific product have naught to do with magic besides if there be rising of common people king noble will be in mood to listen to complaint against who have thwarted attack of rioter doubt must be so father still for must rather charge sword in hand with band of stout fellow behind have not got stout fellow edgar for even if have must prefer to set poor knave running without doing harm to rather than to slay maim for attack must be made in ignorance in hatred of above have be goaded by oppression into taking up arm fault rest upon others rather than upon poor people next morning however edgar went round to tenant of whom there be fifteen have heard of affair at dartford be of course in everyone mouth sympathy be wholly with rioter think a do edgar said to one of exaction of tax gatherer be indeed beyond bearing if people do rise to demand fair treatment just right a men must wish success fear that evil counsel will carry far beyond that may attack house castle of gentry although may be in way author of trouble be sure that father have oppressed one that have not master edgar be a good lord a one must desire exacts due beyond right indeed if there be trouble sickness press one beyond mean have not be called upon for service for many year if dartford men must come hither to attack will find that have to reckon with be what have come for edgar said must hear of intention to attack well to do must have hold yourselves in readiness to gather at house to aid in defence father have mean of own for discomfiting may come against a may fail must be well that there must be body of men ready to repel attack can rely upon master say not that can do so on men be serf sympathy will be with rioter think must fight against fear must not venture life against of own class be more than must be expected if yourselves come will think be sufficient have fear that men will in first place interfere with gentry first impulse will be to obtain redress for wrong have bad adviser many will join for sake of plunder when once begin others will take part with in matter there be saying what may come of well can depend upon at rate master will have to ring bell within hearing will run arm in hand to defend house will hope have time enough to gather there before mob arrives doubt not that will will engage trusty man to go down to town watch what be going on be sure to have notice of such movement a have said think not that there be chance of beginning in such way will be only after have encountered troop blood have be shed having gone round of tenant edgar rode down to dartford on way passed many men going in same direction almost of be armed with stave pike ax bow saw that country people have only be waiting for act must serve a signal for revolt in order to gather a fellow in essex have already begun to do found street of town crowded with people be excited noisy mass have serious determined air that showed be resolved upon going through with work have be begun in many place group of men be assembled in open space listening to talk of others standing on table barrel have be brought for purpose speech be to same point edgar saw that be result of previous agreement men of kent one exclaimed day have come when have to prove that be men not mere beast of burden to be trodden under foot know how be oppressed how illegal exaction be demanded of how a soon a one be paid fresh tax be heaped on be men without voice men whom government regard a merely being from whom money be to be wrung be 't be not enough that must starve in order that oppressor may roll in wealth may scatter lavishly a choose indulge in luxury in pleasure no hound sent among to wring last penny from now take to insulting wife daughter at last patience be at end have news morning from country round that people be with before long ten of thousand of men of kent will be in arm course be resolved upon men of essex will march on london woe be to who try to bar way will be done orderly with discretion war only against government to obtain right already demand have be drawn up unless be granted will not be content be what ask first total abolition of slavery for ourselves child for ever reduction of rent of good land to d acre third full liberty of buying selling like other men in fair market fourth general pardon for past offence recital of demand be received with shout of approval nothing le will be content with went on there be of king adviser who have best not fall into hand for if do life will pay penalty for evil deed upon one thing be determined there will be plundering cause be just one for be ready to fight must join with intention of turning movement to private advantage of plunder robbery warn that such will not be permitted man caught plundering will at once be hung may call rioter may try persuade king that be disloyal subject though be not case one thing will not say of that be band of robber thief by to night will be joined by true men of neighbourhood will then march to gravesend where fellow have already risen be in arm thence go to rochester deliver of brother who have be thrown into prison because must not pay unjust tax done will go straight to london demand from king charter granting four point demand wat tyler have be chosen leader have struck first blow a man of courage energy there be fear of betraying seeing that have already put head into noose now shout for charter for king for common of england such be tenor of speech be everywhere received with loud cheer a edgar rode down main street on way home heard shouting brawny powerful man came along surrounded by mob of cheering men looked at edgar steadily stepped in front of horse be son of man at st alwyth said have seen in street before what think of what be doing have heard of attending meeting there think that have be cruelly wronged edgar answered quietly that four point that demand be just right wish good fortune in obtaining trust that will be done peacefully without opposition whether peacefully not be determined that will be obtained if be needful will burn down london kill man of rank who fall into hand force way into king presence will have justice if do so will be wrong edgar said calmly moreover instead of benefiting cause will damage demand be just will be to interest of man to gainsay even noble must see that land will gain strength be men free ready to bear arm in defence save for article about price of land a to be in way judge see not that man will be penny poorer if on other hand such deed a speak of be committed must set noble throughout land against must defeat own good object must in end bring destruction upon yourselves so that instead of bettering position must be worse than before do doubt man exclaimed with scowling brow that common of england must if wished sweep away accursed noble follower be common of england united well armed disciplined must doubtless do so edgar replied quietly know not whether be united certainly be armed disciplined saw how little undisciplined mass even if well armed can do against trained troop when few thousand of english soldier defeated nigh twenty time number at poictiers say that against force of steel clad knight men at arm number of men however brave if armed a be must make stand must not be battle must be slaughter therefore while wishing well admitting full justice of demand must say that be best for own sake for sake of who love that must conduct yourselves peaceably so a to show men that harm can arise from granting charter ask for in giving right privilege of free men there be murmur of approval from many of standing round tyler who have made step forward looked back angrily must have spoken man next to whispered something in ear without saying more walked on while edgar touched horse with heel proceeded on way although father doubt heard ride up to house did not ascend from laboratory until usual time for although since prior have called attention to son condition have when not at work done in power to make boy happy have even given up two hour evening to at other time be absorbed in work to exclusion of aught else have be down into town asked a seated at table yes father may happen afterwards there be fear of trouble at present speech of almost men be quiet reasonable urged that serfdom must be abolished free right of market given price of good land to be not over four penny acre that past offence must be pardoned beyond did not go indeed declared that everything must be done peacefully in order that man caught plundering must be hung forthwith by applause followed be evidently sentiment of great mass of peasant fear there be of wat tyler at head who will go much farther at present however will disguise real sentiment seems to march on london that threaten will be far from peaceable in first place be going to gravesend joining gathered there will then march to rochester free who have be thrown in prison for non payment of tax then march on london must end in disaster edgar for if obtain what desire from king may do seeing that uncle be away will be difficult to raise force of sudden must suffice to defeat will gain by doubtless a soon a gloucester lancaster arrive in charter will be annulled possibly leader of malcontent punished for share in matter still say not that even so movement will not have done good noble have enough on hand with own quarrel jealousy seeing that continuance of serfdom be likely to give rise to trouble may be more serious than hasty ill considered movement may be content to grant be asked in order to make end to trouble of kind english be not like peasant of other country so far at least a have seen feeling of independence be very strong among there be none of obsequious deference that serf in italy france pay to master next morning albert de courcy rode into st alwyth why albert edgar said a went out to door on seeing approach have got holiday to day have holiday for time edgar have received message from father saying that deems well must at once escort mother aline to london for have heard of trouble at dartford a king have asked to remain at court at present must fain have mother aline with old hubert be to take command of castle to bid tenantry be ready to come in for defence must trouble threaten be not have spoken to king of praising swordsmanship benefit have derived from teaching richard desired to send for to present to be kind indeed of sir ralph edgar exclaimed warmly will assuredly take advantage of goodness although undeserved be indeed splendid opportunity for when do start will leave at ten heard a came along that peasant marched at daybreak morning to gravesend therefore there be fear of crossing path must run down speak to father be small thing that will allow to disturb at work methinks that will not mind upon such occasion in five minute mr ormskirk came up into hall with edgar son have told master de courcy of great kindness that father have done to must indeed say word to hinder going with 't be opportunity like of may never occur to again be only on account of trouble with peasant that dislike to go away at moment deem not that trouble will come of here can myself a know cope with must attempt aught against house therefore bade not to let that matter enter mind to prepare at once to ride with up to town so that can rely upon being at castle at hour appointed then with permission will ride off at once mr ormskirk for also have preparation to make having started at once on arrival of father messenger a soon a have gone mr ormskirk went up to chamber returned in minute two here edgar be purse with money for need first thing must do when reach be to procure suitable garment for presentation to king clothes be well enough for country gentleman be in way fit for court need not say to choose over gay colour for know that taste lie in direction wish to become courtier edgar for though be excellent thing to be introduced at court to be known to high personage there be altogether different thing from being hanger on of court who do naught bask in king favour be seldom men of real merit have to play part curry favour be looked down upon by really great while must attain marked place in king favour be regarded with jealousy enmity sooner later be sure to fall can not remember fate befell queen favourite when edward threw off tutelage took rein of power into own hand such be ever fate of favourite noble commonalty love upstart more than one will foresee erelong draw upon enmity of king uncle other noble for influence have gained over mind of young king must wish then to make a many acquaintance a can for none can say who may be of use to at one time keep aloof from close intimacy may be that in after year may find well nigh impossible to keep aloof from party in state do so a long a be able until can discern clearly who be true patriot who be actuated only by own selfish ambition bearing in mind always that be simple gentleman desirous when english army enters field against foreign foe to play part manfully with honour to gain reputation a soldier not a frequenter of court will bear instruction in mind father indeed accord with what before said to determined to make guide to conduct now have better see to packing of valise will not be necessary for to take many thing a can equip in hour later edgar after bidding farewell to father mounted horse will look to see back again in two three week at longest mr ormskirk said be better to come home even if go again shortly though may be that will have occasion for visit to town for time to come if sir ralph must keep longer be best to make excuse to return know that there be many at court little older than for king being a yet scarcely fifteen naturally like to surround with who be not greatly older who have same love for pleasure gaiety such associate will do good though say not that little of might not be of advantage seeing that be somewhat more grave than be natural at age owing to life that have led here with young de courcy although have greatly encouraged companionship with for be very pleasant agreeable young gentleman be too gentle lacking in high spirit have increased rather than diminished tendency to silence little companionship with more ardour must not be amiss must remember that cheerful spirit enables man to support hardship fatigue lightly to animate soldier by example be one of most important characteristic of leader of men edgar arrived at castle of de courcys few minute before ten horse be already standing at door did not go in deeming that might be in way sent in word to lady de courcy that be there at service in few minute came out accompanied by son aline be glad to have so good escort master ormskirk said smiling for after what sir ralph told feel that can safely entrust to care will assuredly do best lady said trust that there will be occasion to draw sword deem that most of who make road unsafe will have gone off to join tyler band thinking opportunity for plunder be sure to present at rate a take see two men at arm with be unlikely that anyone will venture to molest assisted lady de courcy daughter to saddle party soon rode off followed by two men at arm do purpose to make journey in single day edgar asked assuredly aline be accustomed to ride on horseback journey be not too far to be done before evening fall especially a will be for one day journey only road be good day fine there will be occasion to ride at speed why be seventeen eighteen mile must think poorly of horsemanship if think can not traverse such distance so travelled on horse sometimes going at amble sometimes dropping into walk a proceeded met several little party of men hurrying along armed with pike club farming implement passed without speaking seemed to be much more fearful that might be interfered with than desirous of interfering with others be miserable looking varlet dame de courcy said disdainfully two men at arm must be match for score of doubt not that must albert agreed though methinks that blow with one of flail must make head ring even under steel casque doubt whether must think of anything running away albert edgar said be sorry for poor fellow have great grievance fear be not setting about righting of best way hope that great ill may befall surely people have not sympathy master ormskirk lady de courcy said in surprise have seen enough of to be sorry for edgar said life be of hardest live mostly on black bread be thankful enough when can get enough of to heavily tax men such a be to drive to despair that without producing gain expected for be in most case simply impossible for to pay tax demanded seems to that poll tax be of others worst since take into account difference of station wealth to rich impost be trifling to poor be crushing seems to too that be not only wrong stupid to maintain serfdom men family must be fed small money payment must not add greatly to cost of service indeed must be gained in additional value of labour when men be kept a serf work a serf mean to say work unwillingly slowly while have sense of being free of having same right a others must labour more cheerfully moreover must double strength of force that king noble must place in field be not speaking upon own judgment from what have learned from father have sudden attack to fear from lurking foe for act of edward first be still in force by highway leading from one market town to be always to be kept clear for two hundred foot on side of ditch tree bush in man might lurk to do harm while a ill happened to traveller be made payable by township in occurred there be strong personal interest on part of inhabitant to suppress plundering band in neighbourhood edgar albert rode in partial armour with steel cap breast piece being ordinance that of gentle blood when travelling must do so carried sword by side light ax at saddle bow be little past three o'clock when crossed london bridge then made for tower near sir ralph be lodged chapter iv in london be glad indeed to see young swordsman sir ralph who be waiting at door to receive said to edgar after have greeted wife child affair at dartford threatens to be more serious than expected be on point of starting for home when heard of trouble must have done so have not king asked to remain here seeing at present uncle many other noble be absent that a be pleased to say advice sword might be useful to must trouble grow serious when therefore received news that part of kent be in blaze sent out messenger to dame to come hither to what be latest news master ormskirk can best tell sir ralph seeing that be yesterday in dartford learned something of intention edgar then recounted what have seen heard in street of dartford account tally with news came here hour since namely that crowd of men be marching towards rochester panic prevails in town wise head have sent off messenger a if army must be got together sent down to aid before rioter reach place be glad to come up husband lady de courcy said 't be time since be in town must fain see what people be wearing for fashion change so rapidly that if one be away from town six month one find that everyone stare a if one have come from barbarous country be afraid of when wrote to sir ralph laughed felt that coming up must cause to open purse widely indeed in case be not far wrong for there have be great change in fashion of men woman in last year young king be fond of brave attire love to see around brightly arrayed indeed seems to that money be spent over lavishly that be cheaper for man to build new castle than to buy suit of new raiment for wife men at court dress in such tightly fitting garment that for part wonder how get into woman husband oh a to say nothing must use own eye in matter however just at present men thought be too much occupied by trouble in essex kent to think much of feasting entertainment will be well to wait to see what come of before deciding on making new purchase be there chance of trouble in city father albert asked know not lad better class of citizen be assuredly opposed to who make trouble although have often shown that can make trouble when think that privilege be assailed still a know that booth be likely to be ransacked be band of rioter to obtain possession of town will doubtless give aid in power matter doe not depend upon there be ever in great town majority composed of craftsman butcher others together with lower rabble who be ready to join in tumult sedition like enough if rioter come here will take part with while burgess will be only too glad to put up shutter do say naught must give mob excuse for breaking into magazine must that lancaster be here with thousand so of men at arm went on gloomily there be one at court who can take command king morning asked if must undertake defence of palace said to ' be simple knight majesty young lord of court citizen must pay heed to order moreover be not one of whose head be good to plan matter must die in majesty service must warrant that many of enemy must go down before did must set host in battle array be there host here a to what course to follow how be best to behave at pinch be matter beyond a to be best that majesty took counsel with whom duke of lancaster have appointed to whom such business appertains will give order will carry out even if be bade to defend london bridge with dozen men at arm at such work might do a well a a to counsel have none to give save be in place must issue proclamation to knave saying that must hold parley with men having arm in hand that if must peacefully disperse must order that commission be appointed to examine into complaint that ill proved to be justified must be righted that if forced will give nothing that if advance against london blood must be on own head behould still come on must shut up in tower have good garrison where may well hold out against rascaldom of country until baron can raise levy come to assistance still may well be majesty that fellow will think better of may after disperse again to home pray take

kindness in speaking of to king offering to present to indeed be ashamed that what be pleasure to be done from love bear son must be regarded a worthy of thanks much le a obligation can not come with

have last be in london not only in fashion in costliness of material for with death of old king accession of young one fond of gaiety rich dress spirit of extravagance have spread rapidly among class

clothes befitting presentation to king wish to be of fashion not extravagantly so at trader order apprentice showed numerous sample most of light bright in colour want something more sober in hue knight said be well enough for men with long purse who can afford ample provision of garment must show spot stain must soon be past wearing besides although doubtless such a be mostly used at court must be useful for only for in country must be far too conspicuous for wear other good be brought down edgar eye at once fixed upon rich maroon sir ralph took longer before made choice for albert finally fixed upon somewhat light blue well suited lad fair complexion light golden hair while be choosing mercer have sent into neighbour tailor who now measured good be of satin suit be to be made in precisely similar fashion namely close fitting tunic reaching down only to hip have loose hanging sleeve lined with white silk be turned over scolloped hose be of same colour a doublet be tight

have not worn from then till now will warrant that cost well nigh a much a aline garment mine while waiting for lady two sword belt have be bought for lad edgar being embroidered with gold thread albert with silver now boy think that will do sir ralph said may not be able to compete with of young peacock of court will make sufficiently brave show need not feel envious of best of when shopping be completed returned to lodging here partook of meal after sir ralph went to tower while wife daughter fatigued by day journey speedily betook to bed lad sat talking for time over event of day fear edgar albert said presently that from father choosing for so light coloured suit instead of graver hue like selected have hope that will not go into church after well why must albert be gaining in strength doubt not that will yet grow into strong man of course a long a be weak delicate a seemed must never be able to bear weight of armour be natural that must regard life in church a one be best fitted for that must be perfectly willing to follow profession now be wholly different besides even if at present may not wish a do to be soldier may well become wise councillor hold high position at court there be few young noble indeed who have so much education a surely such life must be better than burying in cloister albert be silent for time do really think edgar said at last that will be ever able to bear arm with credit to become councillor one must need be courtier be sure that life at court must suit better than must suit therefore thought must put aside taste be for quiet life in country know must be very happy living at home a have done from childhood if be to be in world must bear part if need be follow king to battle unless must do duty manfully must rather follow out life thought must be mine enter church must like most of to be able to be always with edgar to fight by side have long be like brother know that will win rank fame though have ambition for must glory in success be well content with friendship a share in that may be sure will always have albert a to plan see not why must not carry out in war time must ride together in peace must live at castle be so close to st alwyth that can ride over visit other daily when be there mayhap must not be very often for when england france be at peace there be trouble between scotland may join noble leader of free lance in service of italian german prince such when there be peace at home be best avenue for fame distinction can not say yet what may feel a gain strength skill in arm may be that even there may be companion must strength health permit that indeed must be good so good that can scarce yet believe that can be so although there be reason to contrary have for year be grief to to know that path lay so far apart that time must soon be coming when must be separated for ever be with faint hope that exercise might bring more colour to cheek that with strength skill in arm might come thought of life than of cloister first urged to let teach use of arm hope have grown gradually since found how much benefited by exercise acquired strength of arm have hardly hoped for moreover albert can not be proud of name father before have won by gallant deed if went into church must no longer appear in roll of knight of england must be ill indeed that line of knight who have so well played part on battle field since ancestor came over with conqueror must become extinct have never thought of before edgar albert said after long pause see for year have looked forward to entering church a matter settled for by nature have enthusiasm for seemed there be other place for of late since have gained health strength have seen that possibly might be otherwise at first struggled against idea deemed suggestion of evil one have grown in spite of although never allowed fully to entertain until saw joy with father perceived be not altogether weakling that have deemed since then have thought of incessantly until now have be unable to come to decision on one hand must please father at same time satisfy desire have of late sprung up for more stirring life than of church must be able to remain comrade on other hand have always regarded church a vocation did not like to go back from moreover although stronger than of old thought might never attain such health strength a might render worthy knight feared that when tried must be found wanting thus have wavered knew not way inclination drew most strongly never thought of what have just said that if be to enter church line must come to end however there be occasion definitely to settle for year yet will tell father to morrow that if at end of time deems have so far continued to gain in strength that may consider not unworthy to represent name in field will be ready to submit to wish while upon other hand must think a before better fitted for church will enter at once be glad indeed to hear say so albert think that there be reason to doubt that will continue to gain strength will prove worthy of name accordingly next morning albert asked father to accompany into garden there detailed to conversation that have have with edgar result glad indeed be albert that must have come about knight said laying hand on lad shoulder what friend said to have often be in mind be sore thought son there have ever be de courcys on battle roll of england since ancestor fought at hastings might well feel grieved at thought that might possibly appear there more pleasure that have given be more than can express will not allow to fear that now have made so fair start will fail to gather fresh strength vigour will wager that will bear banner a forward in fight a who have gone before blame deeply have misjudged so long have encouraged instead of slighting might long since have begun to gain strength might early have commenced exercise be so essential to form good knight in future will do can to make up for lost time a far a swordsmanship go can have better instructor than friend will train in knightly exercise on horseback to vault into saddle to throw off when horse be going at full speed to use lance carry off ring will take care not to press beyond strength not to weary with over long work effort will be to increase store of strength not to draw unduly upon will warrant that if improve a rapidly under tuition a have under of master edgar before year be up will be able to place in train of noble knight without fear that will prove inferior to others of own age going into house again when morning meal be served sir ralph said there be bad news a to rioter in kent lad last night heard that message have arrived saying that have entered rochester broken open jail released not only held there for non payment of tax malefactor that have be joined by rabble of town have slain several notary lawyer torn up parchment deed register have maltreated of clergy broken open cellar drunk wine that from thence intended to march to maidstone then to canterbury raising country a went must at least give time for preparation sir ralph so pointed out last night knight replied who be to make preparation proclamation be drawn up by council warning to return to home on pain of punishment promising inquiry into grievance be to be scattered broadcast through kent essex be likely to have effect men know well enough that have rendered liable to punishment a be ready to run risk when first took up arm be not likely that will be frightened at threat now when find none to oppose that number grow from day to day seeing that time be likely to do little for must rather have marched straight on to london must then have arrived here in more sober mood now that have begun to slay to drink will get fiercer more lawless day a number increase so will demand day by day more more serious news came in canterbury be occupied by rebel declared intention of slaying archbishop have left before have arrived there committed many excess executed three rich citizen opened prison killed lawyer burned deed register a have done at rochester kept whole place in state of terror while remained did while store of wine remained unexhausted why must be so bitter against lawyer why must destroy deed register father albert asked can be for one reason albert great part of have small plot of land acre two perhaps more on term of villeinage paying so much in kind money desire be to destroy deed document in order that may henceforth pay rent claiming land for defying from whom hold to show title a lord of soil there must be shrewd knave among wat tyler men of town can care naught for such matter suffer who have interest in matter to do a choose know that deed have so far committed that will not dare to draw back must follow wat leadership implicitly will see erelong that from murdering lawyer will take to murdering lord if council here be taking step to summon knight of shire feudal lord to hasten hither with levy retainer how do think to arrest course of ill doer edgar asked opinion be that king have to ride out meet rebel that will on seeing fall on knee crave pardon whereupon will promise to redress grievance will disperse to home have such hope be likely that will quietly go home having once worked up to fight for what call right with thought of taking vengeance on consider enemy of unlimited drinking feasting on part of of rich plunder in london when see that there be one to prevent taking satisfaction nothing force will avail though something might be done way be more difficult than look knight of shire must hardly raise levy for most of who must be called out be already with mob of others few must venture to answer to summons when returned might find house burned family slain see know not how far fire may spread hear that in suffolk hertfordshire men be assembling party marching away to join of essex in truth lad thing be far more formidable than deemed at first for say that two hundred thousand men will march on london in french jacquerie there be a many a sir ralph yet be put down be so only after have done vast damage besides lad english villein differs from french serf englishman of rank hold by what considers right be ready to fight for archer have proved that commonalty be a brave a knight though badly armed rascaldom may fight sturdily french peasant have right be chattel that lord may dispose of a chooses a long a met with opposition who fell into hand be destroyed castle ravaged plundered peasant behaving like pack of mad wolf fellow be of sterner stuff will have mind to fight if be to show that can fight a well a better plunder be certainly not first object be probable that may be done way will be work of scum of town who will join solely with object doubt whether le than five thousand men at arm archer must be able to show face to array a be said to be approaching especially a there will be many archer among who although not to compare with who fought at poictiers be yet capable of using weapon with effect see prospect of gathering such force matter be worse a rascaldom of london will be with will have to keep in order a well a cope with in field besides one must remember that in matter like can not fully depend on force that may gather archer men at arm must be drawn largely from same class a better portion of rioter must be slack in fighting against certainly of home county must not be depended upon possibly even in garrison of tower there may be many who can not be trusted place if well held must stand out for month be by mean sure that will do so when time come will certainly raise voice against king abiding here with friend must ride away without difficulty if leaf before place be beleaguered suppose will take mother sister into tower father must mob come hither know not can say until see temper of garrison when rioter approach on day after new clothes arrived sir ralph took son edgar to castle presented to king be son majesty of whom spoke to be happy to say that think will day be able to follow to battle a followed noble prince father for have now resolved must health remain good to take up profession of arm be glad to hear young king said for indeed 't be more suited to son of valiant knight like sir ralph than of church excellent though may be for who have inclination for seems to fair young gentleman one whom must please to see often at court majesty be master edgar ormskirk young gentleman of good family father have not although holding more than knight feu taken up that rank taste being wholly turned towards learning being distinguished scholar having passed through own university at oxford of padua pisa be one of most esteemed friend master edgar a told be greatly skilled for year in use of sword to have long devoted with great ardour be to son be indebted for having gained health strength together with more skill in sword than have ever looked for from beg to recommend highly to majesty favour can answer for worth a well a for strength skill must have better recommendation master ormskirk young king said pleasantly trust although father care not for knighthood will have opportunity of gaining that honour for must value if won fairly majesty a greatest honour must gain be not that father hold honour more lightly than do know 't be opinion that if given merely for possession of land 't be accident of birth that if reward of bravery 't be honour be of highest one be not that thought be wholly turned towards scholarship to discovering secret of nature must gladly have attained methinks that be right king said in time when landowner held feu on condition of knightly service rendered called upon be well that must be called knight such being term of military command now that many be allowed to provide substitute methinks that be error to give title to stay at home will be glad young sir to see also at court though methinks added with smile that have inherited of father sobriety of nature will hold pleasure at small price thank majesty for kindness edgar said bowing indeed must not presume to judge amusement a frivolous because might be unused to in truth two year ago studied at convent of st alwyth spare time then most of time since have be so occupied by exercise in arm have have small opportunity for learning way of court hope to do so seeing that good knight must bear a well at court a in field will have small opportunity now king said rather dolefully royal mother be absent talk be of riot trouble none seem even to think of pleasure after leaving king sir ralph presented son edgar to sir michael de la pole who held high office robert de vere one of king special favourite several other young noble who received kindly for sake of sir ralph chapter v rescue perhaps boy must hardly have be introduced at court better than by knight said a returned to lodging there be men much more highly placed many more influential than be for very reason can be friend with king mother be always most courteous to because be friend of black prince husband have taught son that might come must rely upon fidelity to person on other hand one have reason to dislike fear be simple knight longing most to be at home at court a seldom a may be besides hold aloof from party in state for must know that court be composed of two faction one be that of john of gaunt duke of lancaster uncle of king be greatly ambitious men even say that must fain be king believe not yet be sure that must like to rule in name of king have powerful party having with duke of gloucester brother other great noble on other hand be ill liked by people say at canterbury rioter made man met swear to obey king common by meant never to accept king bearing name of john to oppose lancaster gloucester king mother have surrounded with number of men who being for most part of obscure birth have sympathy with john of gaunt faction oppose in way doubtless majority of be well fitted for office that hold unfortunately there be amongst for most part young with pleasant manner handsome face whom king make favourite again be well nigh a bad a john of gaunt must have power in own hand for people love not king favourite although rabble at present talk much of men being equal rail against noble yet at bottom english people be inclined towards of good birth king favourite be more detested if lack quality england however must not fare badly be john of gaunt master be great warrior well nigh equal in bravery to black prince be true that be haughty arrogant upon other hand be prudent sagacious although might rule england harshly must rule wisely however hold aloof altogether from state matter trust that will strive to do so must fain see king take power into own hand a soon a get somewhat older if must be ruled must prefer that be by great englishman of royal blood rather than by favourite whose only merit be fair face gallant manner smooth tongue who be sure not only to become unpopular to render king unpopular be for reason journey so seldom to london desire that must also hold aloof from court must not be here without taking one side other can not be long however before king becomes impatient of tutelage by duke will then see how matter go will be time enough then for to frequent court though be better even then that must do a did leave such matter to whom concern content with doing service to england in field from friendship for black prince of course know john of gaunt well must there be a seems likely fierce fighting in france in spain for a know duke have claim to crown of castile will cross water with present to duke place in train of of knight comrade of mine who be still young enough to keep field while will only take up arm again in event of king leading great army into france two friend spent much of time in wandering about street of london to seemed peaceable orderly indeed kept in main thoroughfare where better class

straight thrust have desire to kill waited until must slash across face needed few pass before saw opportunity when dame agatha came down in morning tenderly kissed albert boy said never said aught at time when seemed that be never like to grow strong enough to lay lance in rest wield battle axe to show regretted that be not able to follow profession of arm a of race have ever done felt that be

must moreover say little when father be conversing with two stranger what thought of edgar scarce noticed lady for be talking with father so far a remember did not open lip after being introduced to did not notice resemblance to daughter that albert speaks of seemed to fair young maid who looked not own so heavy a felt when carried be very uncourteous master edgar dame agatha laughed good knight

manner to of landing carpet be deeper richer several splendid armoire cabinet similarly carved stood against wall in be gold silver cup exquisitely chased salt cellar other silver ware chair be in harmony with room seat being of green embossed velvet curtain of same material hue with edging of gold embroidery hung at window lad eye must not take in matter at once being fixed upon lady who rose from chair to meet be thirty five year old of singular sweetness of face there be little about of stiffness that have expected to find in wife of london citizen be dressed in loose robe of purple silk with costly lace at neck sleeve by side stood ursula who be dressed a became age in lighter colour in cut material resembled of aline new attire dear sir said a husband presented visitor to with what word can thank for service that have rendered for must have be widowed childless to day be chance mistress gaiton edgar said saw stranger in danger of life from cut throat a honest men must do went to succour be glad indeed to have be able to render husband such service be only such action a soldier performs when strike in to rescue comrade surrounded by enemy carry off wounded man who may be altogether stranger to may be true from point of view merchant said just a man at arm rescued from circle of foe wounded man carried off field must assuredly feel gratitude to who have saved so do feel gratitude to naught that can say will lessen feeling towards now let to table opened door leading into apartment edgar glanced at albert a saw latter be looking at ursula offered hand to dame gaiton albert with little start did same to girl merchant held aside hanging of door then followed into room where table be laid be similar to room have left save that floor be polished instead of being carpeted table be laid with damask cloth of snowy whiteness of fineness of quality such a of lad have ever seen before napkin be of similar make great silver ornament in shape of venetian galley stood in centre of table flanked by two vas of same metal filled with flower plate be of oriental porcelain contrast indeed to rough earthenware in general use spoon be of gold meat be carved at side

of piece of bread just a be still eaten in east spoon being only used for soup sweetmeat two servitor attired in doublet of red green cloth waited wine be poured into goblet of venetian glass after several meat have be served round lad be surprised at fresh plate being handed to for sweetmeat before be put upon table gold bowl with perfumed water be handed round dipped finger in wiping on napkin truly mistress gaiton albert said courteously seems to that instead of coming to court country folk must come to city to learn how to live be a strange to a if have gone to far land by side of whose people be a barbarian husband have be frequently in italy replied be much enamoured of mode of life say be strangely in advance of ours most of what see here have brought with thence have sent over to have be made here from drawing prepared for for purpose carving of wood work be copy of in palace at furniture came by sea from venice gold silver work be english for although husband say that italian be great master in such work in advance of own hold that english gold silversmith can turn out work equal to very best therefore think right to give employment to london craftsman drapery be far in advance of anything can be made here a to hanging carpet although brought from genoa florence be from eastern loom be strange merchant added how far be in most thing behind continent in matter save fighting may say condition of common people look at garment save in matter of coarse fabric nigh everything come from abroad finest cloth come from flanders silk satin velvet from italy gold work be made from italian model finest arm come from milan spain best brass work from italy maybe day will make thing for then too people not only of lowest class be more rude boorish in manner drink more heavily eat more coarsely english banquet be plentiful own lack elegance luxury of one abroad save in matter of joint there be comparison between cooking except in weaving of roughest linen be incomparably behind flanders france italy although have striven somewhat to bring surroundings up to level of civilization abroad house be a hovel compared with palace of venetian genoese merchant rich trader of flanders paris truly must be magnificent indeed edgar said if so far surpass yours have never even thought of anything so comfortable handsome a room say naught of in father house for be scholar so that can work in peace among book in laboratory care naught for aught else be same in other house have visited seem bare cheerless by side of yours have always heard that house of merchant of london be far more comfortable than castle of great noble hardly conceived how great difference be be built for different purpose merchant said castle be designed wholly with eye to defence be of stone since will not burn window be mere slit designed to shoot from rather than to give light trader upon other hand have not to spend money on band of armed retainer have city wall man be soldier if need be then intercourse with foreign merchant visit to continent show what others be doing how vastly house be ahead of ours in point of luxury equipment have show to keep up at rate when go abroad be custom that of flemish merchant to vie with nobility in splendour of apparel multitude of retainer follower thus see can afford to have home comfortable may ask master gaiton if robe chain be badge of office albert asked yes have honour of being alderman albert looked surprised thought sir that alderman be aged men not always merchant said with smile though generally be case alderman be chosen by vote of common council of ward that choice generally fall upon one whom deem will worthily represent upon one who show most devotion to interest of ward city father be prominent citizen before early learned from to take interest in affair of city chanced that when on accession of young king duke of lancaster must have infringed of right privilege be one of speaker at meeting of citizen being younger perhaps more outspoken than others came to be looked upon a one of champion of city thus without merit of own be elected to represent ward when vacancy occurred shortly afterwards husband scarce doe justice master de courcy trader wife said for be not only because of championship of city right a one of richest most enterprising of merchant because spends wealth worthily giving large gift to many charity being always foremost in work for benefit of citizen maybe too fact that be one of eight citizen who jousted at tournament given at king accession against noble of court who overthrew adversary have also something to do with election nay nay wife be private affair be of little interest to guest speak with partiality at rate sir edgar said courteously fact that so bore in tournament suffices to explain how be that be able to keep cut throat at bay until just before arrived at spot be peaceful men in city merchant said know that if be to maintain right to give such aid a behoves to king in foreign war need knowledge a much a others how to bear arm apprentice a well a free man throughout city have to practise at butt to learn to use sword dagger be naturally well instructed a father be wealthy there be always two three good horse in stable learned to couch lance sit firm in saddle a at hastings poictiers contingent of city have ever be held to bear a well a best although like most men always go about street with sword in belt can use if need be strangely enough be trading community be most given to fighting look at venice genoa milan pisa antwerp ghent bruges to go further back carthage tyre even among look at men of sandwich fowey in cornwall be trader still more be fighter be ever harassing ship of france making raid on french coast see that be a say edgar said though have never thought of before somehow one come to think of citizen of great town a being above thing peaceful difference between knight be that latter be always ready to fight for honour glory often from pure love of fighting want to fight be ready to do so for right perhaps for interest at bottom believe that there be little difference between class perhaps if understood other better must join more closely together be necessary to other have honour of england equally at heart knight noble do most of fighting for while on part import produce everything need beyond common necessity of life of be interested in checking undue exercise of kingly authority if supply greater part of force with carry on war with france assuredly be who find greater part of money for expense while get share of spoil of battle have sister master de courcy merchant wife asked presently have one be just about same age a daughter methinks there be strong likeness between mother be here having be sent for by father on news of trouble in neighbourhood in case wife merchant said be seemly that ursula accompany to morrow when go to pay respect to sir ralph de courcy after dinner be over merchant took guest into small room adjoining that in have dined friend said london merchant be accustomed to express gratitude not only by word by deed at present methinks seeing that a have told have not yet launched out into world there be naught that need may not be so always for none can tell what fortune may befall only say that service can possibly render at time have to ask be rich man having son daughter be only heir have estate be different taste turned towards trade must have put in way of becoming like foreign merchant even in own profession of arm may be of assistance must go to war later on wish to take strong following with have to come to say how much will cost to arm equip will forthwith defray pleasure in doing so will be greater than yours in being able to follow king with goodly array of fighting men one thing at least must permit to do when time come that be to make first essay in arm will be pleasure pride to furnish with horse arm armour however be small matter what really wish to believe be that under circumstance one can not say what will happen during present trouble can rely upon absolutely thank most heartily sir edgar said must time come when a say circumstance may occur in can take advantage of most generous offer will do so be well loyally said merchant replied will hold to will remember that by so doing will be who confer favour not for wife will always be uneasy in mind until can do something at least towards proving gratitude for service that have rendered few minute later after taking leave of merchant wife daughter two friend left house truly have be royally entertained edgar what luxury comfort yet everything quiet in good taste apartment of king be cold bare in comparison felt half inclined to embrace offer to declare must fain become trader like edgar laughed who ever heard of such thing a son of valiant knight going into trade why bare thought of such thing must make sir ralph hair stand on end must even shock gentle mother why must edgar in italy noble be trader one think dishonour why must not peaceful trade be held in a high esteem a fighting can not say albert edgar replied more seriously may be case in venice assuredly be not so here may be that day when reach a high civilization a genoa venice posse trade may here be viewed a be there a honourable for even of highest birth surely commerce requires far more brain wisdom than dealing of blow merchant of venice can fight a earnestly a can trade still one man can stand against public opinion until trade come to be generally viewed a being a honourable calling a of war men of gentle blood will not enter upon must remember albert be exception who can gain such wealth a of host to day have gone into house of one of many who can only earn subsistence from must not have be so entertained of course be not serious albert not serious in thinking of being trader edgar though methinks life must suit well quite serious in not seeing why knight noble must look down upon trader there quite agree with a father said to 'you must not think edgar that can set up judge others according to own idea be especially speaking then of freeing of serf bettering of condition thing said 'will come assuredly when general opinion be ripe for who first advocate change be ever looked upon a dreamer if not a seditious dangerous person to force on thing before world be fit for be to do harm rather than good theoretically there be a much to be said for view of priest jack straw other agitator a for of wickcliffe opinion will at first bring persecution maybe death to who hold peasant will rise in arm will when affair be over must escape with life find condition even worse than before while follower of wickcliffe will have whole power of church against may suffer persecution even death besides being often viewed with grave disfavour even by family for taking up with strange doctrine doubt be so edgar wish lived in day when be not deemed necessary that one of gentle blood must be fighting man priest in time of richard ii be not considered in way misdemeaning to receive present for service rendered chain of gold arm armour even purse of money be so received with a little hesitation a be ransom for prisoner taken in battle therefore sir ralph expressed a much pleased when heard of merchant promise to present military outfit to two lad of proffer of other service by st george said such good fortune never befell although have be fighting since youth have be true earned many heavy ransom from prisoner taken in battle be matter of business gold chain wear be present from black prince say have not received present in time from merchant whose property have rescued from marauder to whom have rendered other service still know not of one piece of good fortune equal yours truly have small satisfaction in for have wondered sometimes where sum must have come from to furnish albert with suitable armour horse must have if be to ride in train of noble in truth will be glad to see merchant of yours maybe daughter will be nice companion for aline who not having own pursuit here find methinks dull just at present court have other thing to think of besides pleasure on following day visit be paid afforded pleasure to party knight be pleased with manner of merchant who owing to visit to italy have little of formal gravity of craft while there be heartiness straightforwardness in speech well suited bluff knight lady be le pleased with other dame agatha found to surprise chatting with visitor on term of equality discoursing on dress fashion doings of court life in city a if have known for year at mother suggestion aline went with ursula into garden from time to time merry laughter must be heard through open window hope that will allow daughter to come see mine sometimes dame said a guest rose to leave when at home girl have horse dog garden household duty to occupy here have naught to do save to sit embroider to have girl friend must be great pleasure to ursula will be very glad to do so trust that will allow daughter sometimes to come to will always send back under good escort day rendered political situation more serious kentish rising daily assumed larger proportion be swollen by great number of essex men who crossed river joined one morning news came that hundred thousand men be gathered on blackheath kentish men having be joined not only by of essex by many from sussex herts cambridge suffolk norfolk be not under one chief leader men from locality have own captain be tyler william raw jack sheppard tom milner hob carter thing be coming to pas indeed sir ralph said angrily a returned from tower late one afternoon what think rabble have have insolence to stop king mother a with retinue be journeying hither methought that there be not englishman who did not hold widow of black prince in honour yet scurvy knave stopped be true that shouted greeting to must not let pas until have consented to kiss of unwashed face in faith seeing that life must have be in danger did refuse be forced to consent to humiliation by st george make blood boil to think of here while such thing be going on be doing naught even city doe not call out band be there preparation made to meet storm profess to believe that fellow mean harm will be put off with few soft word forgetful of what happened in france when peasant rose that rascal have already put to death score of judge lawyer wealthy people however when princess arrived with news even king councillor concluded that something must be done be to ride with five other knight at six to morrow morning to blackheath to ask rascal in name of king what be that must have to promise that request will be carefully considered at nine next morning knight returned what news sir ralph dame agatha asked a entered how have sped with mission in truth have not sped at pestilent knave refused to have aught to say to bade return tell king that be with that must have speech that be altogether useless sending out others to talk for must come 't be past bearing never did see such gathering of ragged rascal not one of verily believe have a much a washed face since started from home scarce thought that england must have turned out such gathering let have bread wine such meat a have ready there be to be council in hour must be there there be saying what advice of poor spirited courtier may give what will be counsel sir ralph counsel will be that king must mount with what knight may have couple of score of men at arm must ride to oxford send out summons to noble to gather there with vassal then come talk with rebel in such fashion a must best understand may have grievance be not way to urge by gathering in arm murdering number of honourable men insulting king mother burning deed record now demanding that king must wait on scurvy majesty yet know that there will be of time server round king who will advise to intrust to rascal who have insulted mother by faith be there couple of score of old companion here must don armour mount warhorse ride at may be that must be slain before came about must make such slaughter of that must think twice before took step towards london be a expected knight said when returned from council majority be in favour of king yielding to knave placing in power archbishop of canterbury hale treasurer withstood so hotly that king yielded to not until have charged with treachery with wishing to imperil king life for safety of own skin de vere might have come to blow have not be for king presence then what be final decision of council sir ralph wife asked be sort of compromise knight said one pleased not at rate will save king from insult will send messenger to day to saying that will proceed to morrow in barge to rotherhithe will there hold converse with intends not to disembark to parley with from boat will at least in way be safe from assault hear that great body of essex herts norfolk suffolk rebel have arrived on bank opposite greenwich that be purpose while of blackheath enter city from southwark to march straight hitherwards so that will be altogether encompassed by citizen will surely never let cross bridge know not knight said gloomily lord mayor have audience with king morning confessed to that although better class of citizen must gladly oppose rioter to last suffer none to enter wall great number of lower class be in favour of fellow that might be that must altogether get better of make common cause with rabble many of people have be out to blackheath have stayed there with mob while others have brought back news of doings among rabble on blackheath be many hedge priest notably hear one john ball pestilent knave who preaches treason to tell that a men be equal so good of of better class must be divided among having nothing doctrine plea rascal mightily next day accordingly king went down with of councillor to rotherhithe vast crowd lined bank of river saluted with such yell shout that with fearing people might put off in boat attack bade rower turn boat head make up river again fortunately tide being just on turn be thus able to keep course in middle of river so escape arrow might otherwise have be shot at chapter vii death to fleming that morning aline have gone early to city at invitation of mistress gaiton to spend day with ursula under escort of brother edgar be to have fetched before dusk early in afternoon richard gaiton brought back be sorry to bring daughter back so early said to dame agatha have news that after king turned back morning leader of rebel have be haranguing telling that be clearly useless to put trust in promise to hope that redress must be obtained from king who be surrounded by evil councillor since must not allow to trust among people people must take matter into own hand have remained quiet long enough now be time that must show strength rabble shouted loudly 'let to london death to council death to rich having gathered under leader started to march for southwark a there be saying what may come of matter methought that be best to bring young lady back again thank dame agatha said be indeed better that must be together morning lord be saying that if knave marched upon london have decided that must move into tower be indeed best madam there be saying what may happen when fellow become inflamed with wine begin to taste sweet of plunder ourselves feel ashamed that be not in position to march out with city force to maintain law against rabble be clear to that majority be on other side have taken into head that if fellow gain right privilege for city may also gain fresh right many of serving men craftsman even apprentice have friend relation among people for most of belong to county round london there be others better placed who not only sympathize a do with natural desire of country people to be free from serfdom who favour cause because think that be people free to carry arm must check power of king noble so come that city be divided in in strait when must show front against rebellion be powerless to do aught even among who talk loudest against rabble there be many fear who send secret encouragement not because care aught for grievance because people be set against fleming who be ill liked by many of merchant a being rival in trade who have in hand greater portion of dealing with flanders low country indeed though see that in long run will benefit greatly by foreign trade quite perceive that privilege that king have given to fleming in order to win good will assistance against france do for present cause disadvantage harm to many of trader of london 't be troubled time dame agatha said 't be hard to see what be for best however in tower assuredly will be safe hope so merchant said gravely surely can not doubt master gaiton dame agatha said in surprise hear that rabble be openly saying that men at arm archer will not act against maybe empty boasting there may be something in men be almost all enlisted from kent sussex essex hertford have heard report that there be sore discontent among because pay be greatly in arrear owing to extravagance of court be well perhaps that must mention to sir ralph above pray to remember madam so long a house stand so long will be refuge to yours may betake yourselves in case of danger here say not that be safer than elsewhere for there be saying against whom rage of rabble may be directed sir ralph came home late in afternoon be gloomy depressed thing be going badly wife said verily be not for duty owe to king must take horse ride to kingston there cross river journey round so a to avoid fellow get to home wait there see what come of must attack fight to end seems to that have lost head one give one counsel one give never did see such faint heart lord mayor have be with king speaks bravely a far a better class of citizen be concerned be overborne by commonalty who favour rabble partly because hope to gain by disorder partly because leader of rabble declare that will slay council above duke of lancaster against whom many in city a well a in country have deep grudge what counsel did give husband asked king to give command of men at arm archer must march through city across london bridge close gate there defend alike against rabble on farther side that of city until help must be gathered king be willing that must be so council said be to do gathering from essex hertford suffolk cambridge must march hither be joined by rabble of city so attack tower being more furious at what must deem breach of privilege by taking possession of gate so nothing be done have looked out of window across river if not do so lady agatha crossed room gazed out from several point in southwark column of smoke mingled with flame be ascending what be ralph be rabble who be plundering southwark a hear have broke open prison of marshalsea king bench malefactor there have joined have be done without stroke being smitten in defence where be boy went into city with aline morning have not returned ah here be coming through gate well albert what news have sir ralph asked son a entered city be in uproar father most of shop have closed there be gathering in street though lord mayor robert gaiton many of better class have be haranguing refuse to disperse to home robert gaiton took into guildhall where many of most worshipful citizen be assembled discussing matter what be to be done have force at command fleming be in great fear have betaken to church where hope that life may be respected without a seems to good warrant for a rabble at canterbury did not respect even cathedral be not likely that will hold church here a sanctuary robert gaiton advised that if entered city to morrow must not show in present apparel for say that if rabble enter may fall foul of whose dress must show to belong to court have given two sober citizen suit in said must be able to move about without fear of molestation thing have come to nice pas indeed sir ralph grumbled when son of knight can not walk with safety in street of london still gaiton be doubtless right will not let boy enter city surely sir ralph dame agatha said anxiously say so dame lad be going to be soldier be well that became used to scene of tumult moreover may bring news of what be doing there may help have obtained use of chamber in tower for aline place of course will be by king side maybe report that boy will bring of doings in city may be useful be wish lad to go into city with permission sir must gladly do so there will be much to see may be to learn be so above take to heart lesson that be dangerous to grant aught to force that if rabble be suffered to become even for hour master will soon become a wild beast be so in france will be so wherever by weakness of authority mob be allowed to raise head to deem master of everything evil have be brought about by cowardice of garrison of rochester castle have done duty must have defended place for week against knave even if not strong enough to have sallied out defeated in open fellow seem to have inspired everyone with terror in faith befalls will be mainly fault of who must at first outbreak have gathered together to make stand against unarmed rabble for might at time have be crushed by single charge take blame to myself now that instead of summoning hither did not hasten home a soon a heard of doings at dartford gather score of neighbour with retainer give battle to mob there be comparatively few at time have not gained confidence in even if have deemed too strong to attack in field might have thrown into rochester aided garrison to hold castle have seen trouble in flanders have learnt how formidable mob may become when have once tasted blood be well that must both learn that even when commonalty have just ground for complaint must not be allowed to threaten security of realm by armed rebellion must that black prince be here instead of boy king must then have very different measure taken even if king mother have spirit courage counsel of men who surround king must be overborne be so alarmed a well might be at meeting with rabble on blackheath that spirit once have seems to have quite departed be in favour of granting what will later on sir ralph again went to tower shortly returned put on cloak hood at once said to wife essex hertford men have arrived on north side of city may be here in morning will be then too late to retire to tower will give quarter of hour to pack up belonging men will carry for a to boy can safely remain here until daybreak then put on citizen dress make way quietly into city a soon a gate be open put over own clothes charge to take part in street fray if better class of citizen make stand throw off citizen clothes join strike for king country for assuredly england must be ruined be rabble to have way in quarter of hour lady be ready court suit of albert edgar have be packed men at arm took up valise followed by sir ralph wife daughter made for tower in morning a soon a knew that gate must be open two boy attired in citizen suit buckling on sword left house a soon a entered city found that street be already filled with people be corpus christi at time kept a general holiday regardless of trouble many be flocking out to enjoy holiday in country boy have debated whether must first go to merchant agreed not to do so a must probably be in consultation with authority must be fully occupied without having to attend to a advanced farther be easy to see that there be element besides of holiday maker abroad band of men carrying heavy stave many of with sword at belt be hurrying in direction of bridge edgar albert took same direction bridge be crowded partly with holiday maker partly with armed men while window of house be occupied by spectator who be looking down with evident apprehension at what be about to take place gradually making way forward two friend reached other end here there be group of citizen on horseback among be lord mayor william walworth many of alderman robert gaiton among mob be shouting open gate uproar be great on mayor holding up hand there be silence fellow citizen said know ye not what have be done by men at southwark not content with plundering ill treating inhabitant breaking open cellar

kentish men of essex band together with rabble of city have remained at tower be only a rode back believing that trouble be over heard what have happened will king still grant charter father albert asked know not everything have be changed by conduct of fellow murder of archbishop lord treasurer others to say nothing of insult to king mother insolence of mob in making master of tower indeed king must not grant charter be matter must be done by king parliament when knight of shire representative of great town meet will be equally indisposed to grant concession to men who have burned palace destroyed deed title wheresoever must find killed man of law on whom must lay hand throughout england have risen against lord of soil if rabble must whenever have fancy rise in arm enforce claim that chose to propose must soon be master of may be that erelong serfdom will cease see not why men must not have right of buying selling in open market a to fixing price of land think not that can be done seeing that land be vastly more fertile than others that land town be of much greater value than elsewhere even in time there have be great change condition of serf be very greatly improved while hardship complain of heavy taxation be not felt by serf only be common to however although for time believe that unlawful riotous doings will do harm rather than good assuredly who have taken leading part in will be punished yet in end will be seen that be best that thing that now ask for must be granted that england must be content class stand together undoubtedly fellow have shown that can bite a well a growl though must always be put down in end might be only after great effort much heavy fighting after terrible misfortune befalling not only town throughout country who dwell in house incapable of making long defence at present may be sure that king may promise varlet parliament will grant such charter must not that must do so must be fatal to peace of land for common a call to

master edgar ormskirk be to rush into danger in order to aid succour in peril be right that must be clad in armour suitable for such adventure meet such armour must be provided for by one of who have benefited by valour whose life that of wife daughter have be preserved by therefore send two suit a only token can at present give of thankfulness gratitude be feeble testimony indeed none le sincere know well that armour made by master armstrong must be borne by none worthier trust that sword will ever be used in cause of right in protection of oppressed unfortunate aline clapped hand joyfully a albert finished reading letter timely gift indeed knight said one doe honour to giver who receive open crate lad let see what worthy fleming have sent casque be first piece came to view albert carried to father while aline placed edgar on table in front of dame agatha knight examined carefully know suit said for be in armourer shop week before trouble began with earl of suffolk who have asked to go

showy of foreign suit must not bate penny in price be two suit to stand in shop a long a live do see that tiny mark need to look closely at to make out that be made by cloth yard arrow shot by archer who be reputed strongest in city who carry bow that few others can bend to full shot at distance of five yard doubt if among suit must find one must have stood test without deep dint 't be noble gift lad fleming whom must hardly take to be judge of armour must either have have good adviser with must have trusted wholly to master armstrong advice 't be like enough father sir robert gaiton may have gone with to choose when left yesterday have heard say that though 't be in stuff of italy east that chiefly deal that agent abroad sometimes send suit of finest milan armour sword of damascus other such thing for can always find purchaser among noble who deal with therefore must probably be good judge by time crate be completely unpacked armour with sword dagger laid upon table where two lad surveyed in silent admiration put on sir ralph said know that be longing to do so must be strange be not do buckle on lad dame have done service many time be right that must be first to do for albert aline do wait upon edgar a be new to such work mother will show how to do seeing that have struck five mortal blow in defence be right that must do service aline coloured with pleasure mother first instructed how to arm edgar then buckled on albert sword be girt on casque added last of look two proper esquire wife knight said a ride to morrow will make sorry show beside ah father said albert armour have many honourable mark can be seen that if be not a bright a ours 't be in battle that lustre have be lost while can see bright a armour may be have not have christening of battle well put mother said softly there be more noble figure than father when first buckled armour on for be new suit have taken from great french lord have overthrown in battle be a proud of a now feel of for have shown worthy of though arm be unmarked 't be because battle be fought before have have hardly ventured to hope for dame sir ralph said with strange huskiness in throat knight must have begun career more creditably more honourably three time have fought once on behalf of aline twice for men woman in danger in what better cause must have first fleshed sword now unbuckle at once dame that may write in name letter of thanks to noble fleming have not written letter for year friend must scarce be able to decipher be to try then went on a removed albert casque there be good taste a well a judgment in purchase of arm agatha to who know what arm be be superb to ordinary eye must seem no better than generally worn by knight by esquire of good family whereas have bought one of damascened suit must at once have attracted attention lad must have be taken for great noble doubt not that guided stout alderman in choice be man of strong sense sober taste have not be born merchant must have made rare good fighter a soon a albert harness be taken off sat down wrote in fair clerkly hand letter of warmest thanks on part of sir ralph edgar to van voorden after have be sent off sword dagger be examined admired sir ralph declaring former to be of finest toledo steel latter to come from damascus edgar have said little be even more delighted with new acquisition than albert to have good suit of armour have be greatest ambition father be by mean wealthy have thought that only chance of obtaining such suit must be to overthrow french noble in battle next morning be up betimes mounted few minute before hour at city gate must be opened sir ralph dame rode first aline took place between brother edgar latter keeping watchful eye over horse be fresh after six seven day idleness two retainer rode behind having lady valise strapped behind city church rang out hour when be within hundred yard of gate a opened van voorden with daughter behind on pillion rode out to meet followed by two mounted

said in might introduce to that might assure in mother name of pleasure visit will give 't be kind courteous of mynheer van voorden dame agatha said a leaning over shook daughter hand mother bade say that be impatiently waiting coming that visit will give greatest pleasure yours also mistress aline added a girl rode up be sure that will give great pleasure too joanna van voorden be two year older than aline be fair of different type for while aline hair be golden joanna be of tawny red even making allowance for difference in age be of heavier build than english girl gave sign of growing up into stately woman now master van voorden knight said a latter turned horse proceeded on way must repeat in person what said in letter how deeply obliged be to for superb suit of armour sent last night to son friend speak not of again pray merchant said owe debt of gratitude that never can hope to repay harness be indeed slight token of can only hope that day may have opportunity of more worthily testifying gratitude will scarcely be able to lodge lady went on turning to dame agatha a must have done in house at bread street for one have hired although comfortable enough be much le commodious still doubt not that will find room more comfortable than occupied in tower for indeed a yet even english palace stately though be have not comfort that fleming have come to regard a necessary so have understood sir think that of city merchant can not be far behind judging from what daughter have told of abode of sir robert gaiton many of london trader be in respect far better housed than of noble with whose castle be acquainted sir robert have in italy elsewhere have opportunity of seeing how merchant prince there live have known for year be one of foremost men in city have broad liberal idea none of jealousy of fleming be so common among citizen although countryman more directly rival in trade than do many others who grumble at though be in way injured by trading so chatted until reached spot where knight required to turn off towards bridge there be moment pause valise be transferred to saddle of van voorden follower while adieu be exchanged then fleming party turned to right while knight edgar albert two retainer trotted down at smart pace to bridge here sir robert gaiton in full armour with fifty stout men at arm be awaiting good morrow sir ralph young sir sir robert said a rode up let congratulate on armour becomes mightily for sir ralph put in think have somewhat to thank for choosing yes went with van voorden to master armstrong not so much to choose harness a to give opinion a to size required suit greatly took fancy armourer guaranteed temper be a seemed to about right size for although just at first may be somewhat roomy 't be matter that few month will mend be comfortable edgar added suppose a much so a armour can be sir robert 't be first time have worn such thing seem to marvellously to confine with vizor down must feel well nigh stifled in casque a if fighting in dark will get accustomed to in short time know that when began to be known in city found that must like others of better class of citizen ride in full armour when occasion offered felt just a do perhaps more so for be seven eight year older le accustomed to change even now must far rather fight with vizor up save that one must have protection when arrow cross bow bolt be flying a against other knight must always keep up helm cheek piece cover small part of face naught straight thrust must harm one think must trust sword to ward off however have never yet have occasion to try have have more than one encounter with eastern african pirate during voyage have never taken helmet with on such journey have not suffered by loss by time be across bridge proceeding at sharp trot until beyond boundary of southwark broke into gallop when after going at pace for three four mile reined horse into walk sir ralph said albert if like can remove helmet carry on saddle bow thanks father indeed be well nigh reeling in saddle with heat edgar will take yours off thank have got to get accustomed to may a well do so now a at other time under helmet wore small velvet cap be looking quite pale albert edgar went on a friend unhelmed be not everyone who be made of iron a be albert laughed must make allowance for in year two hope that too will be able to bear weight of thing without feeling must remember that be not two year since began hard exercise while have be at since childhood forget albert wonder at daily at greenwich heard many tale a to damage committed by peasant on homeward way house have be sacked burnt many person of substance killed king ought to have let charge fellow sir ralph said a went forward again when men find that get off

destroyed in essex that rioter have beheaded lord chief justice of england sir john of cambridge prior of st edmondsbury set up head on pole in market place of bury have destroyed charter document of town will have great trouble before order be restored whereas have charged rioter of kent who be worst of others must have be cowed when heard of slaughter by lady will give fellow rough lesson if find besieging castle be strong place sir ralph with fair garrison must easily repel assault by such fellow a must not stand for day against attack by strong body of men at arm even if be unprovided with machine when within five mile of castle obtained sure news that be attacked by two thousand of rioter so far a be known be still holding out will gallop on sir ralph alderman asked nay will rather go more slowly than before so that horse may be in good wind when arrive will need strength for may have to charge through two three time before break run then will pursue cut up a long a horse have breath fellow must have lesson will never be able to dwell in peace quiet when within mile of castle saw that flag be still flying above knew that have arrived in time then albert put on helmet again two lad followed example of sir ralph alderman lowered vizor for a knight said though of knave threw away bow at smithfield many of others took away on reaching field near castle must see that fierce fight be going on rioter have procured ladder be striving to climb wall while small party of armed men be defending battlement by st mary be just in time knight said four will ride in front sir robert will bid men form in two line follow one line twenty yard behind other bid keep together in rank second line closing up with first if fellow make stout resistance above thing must keep in order follow close behind alderman raised voice repeated order to men report a to rascal number be about right sir ralph said now boy do keep between leave space of three yard between horse so a to give man room to swing sword now sir robert let have at going slowly at first increased speed to fierce gallop a neared mass of rioter have be noticed now men on ladder hastily climbed down again confused order be heard many be seen separating from main body flying mass of rioter however held ground seeing how small be number of opponent flight of arrow be shot when be sixty yard distant a be bending forward in saddle arrow be shot in haste most of fell harmless three four of horse be struck plunged violently from pain still kept on with others with shout party fell upon rioter weight of rider horse throwing great number to ground while knight follower hewed right left with sword bravest spirit have thrown in front once troop have cut way through little resistance be met with beyond peasant seeking only to get out of way a soon a be through crowd turned again in same order a before charged mob with same success a drew up again turned sir ralph ordered to charge time in single line be becoming utterly disheartened now said will sweep wider path time when drew up saw that crowd have broken up rioter be flying filled with dismay through field chase slay sir ralph shouted raising vizor that voice might reach give quarter business must be ended once for edgar albert threw up vizor there be fear of arrow now felt half stifled there be longer order kept horseman followed fugitive in direction two lad kept together so a to be able to give other assistance must stand be made none however be attempted greater portion of rioter have thrown away arm when overtaken raised cry for mercy gave none to fleming lad shouted in return infuriated by scene that have witnessed in london for hour followed fugitive sparing none who came within reach of sword have done enough now albert exclaimed at last be fairly spent can scarce lift sword horse be spent not strength edgar said a reined up well have avenged fleming have done something towards paying fellow for insult to princess now let wend way back must say good bye to sir ralph sturdy alderman will then ride home see how father have fared have little fear that harm have befallen for magic must frighten rioter even more than sword well armour have stood in good stead albert when charged first time be several time struck with bill hook pike more than one arrow shivered on breast piece found that blow fell harmless after wasted pain in defending simply struck straightforward blow at opponent found same edgar weapon glanced off armour a stone must fly from sheet of strong ice for while rode slowly to give horse time to recover wind when have done so rode more rapidly keeping straight line have before ridden devious course in pursuit arrived in hour at castle here found that most of horseman have already

gaily must fall in with party there be dozen in stall suppose have be out since have be away besides methinks after such hot work a have be doing cup of wine will do good edgar therefore rode into castle while be taking cup of wine hasty meal in hall sir ralph servitor changed saddle to fresh horse lad then started for home confident a felt be still great satisfaction to to see that sign of violence be visible a approached house door in gate be indeed closed contrary to usual custom dismounting rung bell small grille in door opened then servitor head appeared now then andrew what be staring at why open gate be not sure that be master edgar in grand helmet did not at first make out well be glad that have come back safely young master for heard of parlous doings in london yes have

story be long one to tell pray before begin to let know how matter have fared here for hear from andrew that have not be left entirely alone mr ormskirk smiled have goodly company three day ago hundred of men from dartford joined be sorry to say by good share of at village came round here in evening with intent a be good enough to say of roasting witchman in bed andrew have brought news of intention so be ready for have gone out have painted on door with stuff told of rough figure of skeleton holding dart in hand be of same colour a door so that did not show in daylight then fixed along on top of wall number of coloured light have seen in use in italy on fete day of learned composition have a told before placed case of friar bacon powder round house have laid train to by must be fired from within wall have be dark when came skeleton that skull must have sufficed wanted still hour before device must be of use made out in distance thought that something else must be needed therefore got that eastern gong purchased a curiosity at genoa lighted fire in courtyard a soon a approached threw pitch into fire making thereby great column of smoke set andrew to beat gong furiously telling to shout yell a pleased then went to upper window to observe effect crowd have halted fifty yard away stood open mouthed gazing at place indeed be wonder that such ignorant men be scared for truly yelling of andrew noise of gong be enough to frighten anyone who knew not what meant for time seemed to that must depart without venturing farther of bolder spirit plucked up courage went about among others shouting that true kentish man must be frightened by noise meant nothing have to break down door must soon put end to however night began to fall before got fairly in motion went down prepared to fire powder must be needful besides hoisted skull above parapet over gate thinking that light of phosphorus might not show up well short distance away placed in addition red fire in skull then got on wall sat down where must peep out without being seen shouting great deal to encourage other came on until within few pace of gate then heard sudden cry in front pushed back stood staring at door a if bewitched then ran away distance after much talk came forward again timidly pointing to figure a advanced be now doubtless plain enough to be well made out fifty yard away there came to halt again then called out to andrew to light fire in skull set jaw wagging having so balanced that having be once set going must wag for two three minute before stopped then ran one way with brand from fire other twelve green fire burst out there be yell of horror when skull be made out alarm be doubtless heightened by green fire having never seen thing before started to run wildly off to hasten flight ran down fired four of powder case exploded with noise might have be heard at dartford after andrew went quietly to bed sure that not soul must venture to attack house andrew went into village in morning found that of men have be well nigh killed by fright sort of tale be told of great blazing skeleton dashed out from gate with dart in hand of skull breathed out red fire from blazing mouth grinned gibbered at a to noise ghastly green fire none must account for do believe that there be not villager who must approach within quarter of mile of house after dark on condition chapter xi invitation edgar laughed heartily at father account of success of defence of house then said hope father distorted account of affair may not get into trouble with church have fear of edgar have shown prior preparation approved of heartily being man of much broader intelligence than be common indeed begged of pot of shining paste with painted stone crucifix over abbey gateway be well that did so for last night men came out from dartford with intent to plunder priory of deed muniments on seeing glowing crucifix went off in fear trembling villager be saying morning that priory have be protected by miracle while see in case attribute to work of devil now edgar tell have befallen since went away edgar related various adventure have happened when have concluded father said truly edgar have be fortunate indeed be way of saying that have skilfully grasped opportunity presented man who bemoans ill fortune be man too apathetic too unready too cowardly to grasp opportunity man who be called fortunate be on other hand who never let chance slip by who be cool resolute determined during time that have be away have made friend of two wealthy merchant have rendered high service have also a greatly benefited neighbour sir ralph de courcy have placed foot so firmly on ladder that 't be own fault if rise high now what think of doing have intention of staying at home for while father there will be trouble for time care not to take part in hunting down of poor peasant north of river who unlike fellow be well content when king offered charter granting demand retired peacefully to home so must rather remain here quietly until have chance of drawing sword in foreign war against french scot think that be right moreover although have proved manhood against men can hardly when with army be regarded a more than young esquire till year two have gone over head two day later finding that be now perfectly quiet that there be probability whatever of renewal of trouble sir ralph went up to london with city knight company have ridden over on previous day to call upon mr ormskirk to thank for service edgar have rendered upon entered in much fuller detail than edgar have allowed in return gave description of defence of house in sir robert be greatly interested going down into laboratory examining luminous paint effect upon skull be goodly device said though have during visit to italy come to believe little in superstition be held by mass of people own that courage must have be grievously shaken if have encountered suddenly that gibbering head how long doe effect last three four day believe that be sort of slow combustion although have sensible heat gradually consumes particle give rise to may be that further research will lead to discovery by light might be made permanent in case invention must be useful one have however time to follow up being engaged in more serious matter regard a mere relaxation from more important work yet methinks merchant said that be men of science like to devote to such discovery instead of searching for secret always evade might do good service to mankind look at discovery of friar bacon so far grant that have led to nothing can see in future explosive power of powder will be turned to diverse us besides of machine for battering down wall be light of yours made permanent must do away with necessity for burning lamp indoors what must be more beautiful than hall with ceiling rafter wall pillar glowing a if in moonlight for methinks light resembles of moon rather than other be young man must take up such matter sir robert for believe with that time might be more usefully spent 't be too late now 't be not when one prime be past that men can embark in fresh course lay aside work for have laboured for so many year even if made might bring more woe than good upon world sir robert said where must be value of gold if other metal must at will be transformed into when first produced might enable monarch to raise huge army to wage war against neighbour after time use must become common gold must lose value men must come to think le of than of iron for be not so strong so fitted for weapon for tool then other rarer metal must take place alchemist must begin work again in discovering philosopher stone must transmute other metal into more valuable one mr ormskirk be silent think sir robert said at last that alchemist work solely for good of mankind give thought to consequence might follow finding of philosopher stone dream of immortality that name will pas down through age a of man who first conquered secret of nature made great discovery so many thousand of others have sought for in vain be assuredly ambition a worthy a many others sir robert said thoughtfully knight must be ready to risk life thousand time in order to gain reputation of being one of foremost knight of europe king must wring last penny from subject for rich monument will think carry down name to time doubtless discovery of secret have baffled research for hundred of year be at least a worthy ambition a far more laudable indeed since can be carried out without inflicting woe upon others now farewell mr ormskirk trust that son will always remember that in have friend ready to do aught in power for be simple citizen of london have correspondent in well nigh city in europe can give introduction may be valuable wheresoever go will be grieved indeed if doe not avail of good will gratitude three day later sir ralph returned to st alwyth from london with dame aline for week time passed quietly pleasantly to edgar intimacy between two house became even closer than before sir ralph report of edgar doings in london caused to be frequently invited to house of well to do people in neighbourhood in meantime insurrection have be finally crushed commissioner in various part of country be trying executing who have taken lead in movement until general amnesty be passed two month later peasant lived in hourly dread of life have gained nothing by movement from have hoped so much for while indeed position be worse than have ever be before in time however a remembrance of insurrection died out bore fruit although there be specific law passed abolishing serfdom result be arrived at insensibly privilege be granted privilege became custom with effect of law almost without knowing people became possessed of right for father have in vain taken up arm three week after edgar return from london royal commission came down to dartford authority of town others be called upon to name leader of insurgent sir ralph who be one of summoned said that be altogether unable to give information have be away when first outbreak took place on return found castle besieged having with fifty stout men at arm attacked pursued insurgent nearly five hundred of be slain fighting a did with vizor down having for time a much a must do to defend have recognized no one indeed so far a knew did not see one among rioter with whose face be acquainted two day later a edgar be riding back from sir ralph castle came suddenly upon man at cross road be one of villager well master ormskirk said folding arm can kill if will will be best so for if will live life of hunted dog sooner later fall into hand why must kill carter have naught against then be not who denounced a one of who fought against at de courcy castle not assuredly have have communication with commissioner did know that be one of encountered there someone have given name man said moodily suppose be of at dartford for be true enough that joined tyler day slew collector thought that have done rightfully may be that like fool have exhorted others to join to win charter of right thought be to be got honestly that harm be to be done to man when got to london saw that tyler others intended to slay many person of high rank to burn destroy be seized with horror made way back when others returned be fool enough to let be persuaded to join in attack on sir ralph castle for speech seems that be to be tried hung have best run through master ormskirk have done with must rather that than be hung like dog will hing of kind carter have known for year a honest hard working fellow here be couple of crown with can make way to london be good sir hear that there be party of men on road that order have be given in township to arrest passer by to detain if have not proper paper with well can die better than for lost wife last christmas have child so if wo do business for will go straight back to dartford give up carter do go into wood remain there till then come to house knock at gate can shelter there a long a like a know there be few indeed who come there if get servitor suit assuredly none of visitor must recognize a for village folk have to keep out of way when come with wood meat other matter may not be for long for 't be like will be going to war soon when do so will take with a man at arm moreover be probable that when commissioner have sat for time executed prominent leader of rioting there will be amnesty passed what do say to say god bless sir know well enough that deserve everything have befallen for of surety murder be done in london have so disgraced cause that one have right to look for mercy however sir if be willing to give such shelter a say will serve well faithfully will right willingly imperil last drop of blood in

burning in london rest be poor foolish knave who knew better who be led astray by preaching of of jack priest other troubler of peace think that must be best to speak to old anna not bit master ormskirk save to go to mass never stir beyond house be so deaf that have to shout into ear to make hear smallest thing will simply say to that have got man at arm to go with to war that until leave be to remain here in house did not tell whether be to take horse round to stable be going to ride into dartford now to get man apparel suited to station here edgar returned in hour bringing with servitor

very cross ill behaved came suddenly upon seemed to hard that albert edgar must seem delighted at what pained so much forgive albert there be nothing to forgive dear of course understand feeling that will be hard for to part when have be so much together will be very sorry to leave be sure will agree with that be le hard to do so now than must have be if have be going to be shut up in convent to

dartford well pleased to find that albert be to accompany edgar rode home a passed in at gate hal carter ran up to master tell that be going away master edgar be going to take with not time hal be going to flanders a guest of flemish gentleman must not therefore take man at arm with besides a know naught of language must be altogether useless there think that will not fulfil promise be short absence when return will enter train of warlike knight other then will go with never fear thank sir 't be strange to to be pent up here not that have aught in world to complain of father be most kind to do hope that be of use to yes father have told several time how useful be to in washing out apparatus cleaning crucible getting fire going in readiness wonder now how got on so long without helper will be sorry when time come for to go with indeed said two day ago that when went must certainly look for someone to fill place so long a feel that master edgar will be willing enough to stay seemed to that be doing small service in return for meat drink shelter must feel be getting fat lazy be not that swing battle axe day for hour a bade look through apparel edgar father said that evening see what lack to morrow morning will give money wherewith can repair deficiency suit got in london will suffice for present a winter approach must get cloth garment can be purchased more cheaply in flanders than here of course know not how long stay there may be must depend upon host must be well if at end of month must speak about returning then will see by manner whether really wish to make longer stay not methinks however that be likely will like to stay with until spring if there be matter of importance for must wish to return be sure that feel very earnestly how much owes to be desirous of doing real service to thinking can do in better manner than by giving six month in flanders accordingly three day later two friend again rode to london be followed by man on horseback leading sumpter horse carrying baggage hal carter be much pleased when be told that be to perform service for convenience of carriage wore body armour arm piece helmet greave being carried with baggage on arrival be most cordially received by van voorden family found that be to start on saturday on following morning lad went to tower to pay respect to king be sure neglect that sir ralph have said king be mightily well disposed to a told have related to in full affair in took part in london on return after fight here of course told incident of battle said 'if knight have borne a well a son friend must not have be in so sore strait must be glad to have about person now can well understand that wish son to make name for a valiant knight that for time must curb desire ' king received very graciously sir ralph did good work in dispersing that kentish rabble doing with one blow what have taken six week to accomplish in essex hertford so be going to flanders will see there what have come of allowing rabble to get mastery of truth knave of ghent bruges be of very different mettle to here fight a stoutly a many men at arm 't be true majesty edgar said not because be stouter men for defeated so easily down in kent be of same mettle a archer men at arm who fought so stoutly at cressy poictiers have leading discipline know too that against mail clad men be powerless if be freeman called out on majesty service must fight a well a did forefather be in favour then of granting freedom seems to that must strengthen majesty power must add considerably to force that must put in field must make people happier more contented living down among a do one can not see that 't be hard on men that may not go to open market must work for such wage a lord may choose to give be viewed a men of account whereas be a strong able to work a others may be right young king said see councillor think otherwise be not yet rightly own master in one matter however can have way be in dispensing honour know what said to before went hence young a be must fain knight for valiant work that have done since then have done good service a well a realm by having with sir ralph de courcy sir robert gaiton defeated great body of kentish rebel who be worst most violent of though there be with fifty men at arm be truly knightly service defeat drove rioter in part to home whereas have not be so beaten there might have be much more trouble many worthy men might have be slain by illustration edgar albert be knighted by king richard moreover a be going to flanders with good friend mynheer van voorden who be in way charged with mission from be well that must travel a knight will give more influence may aid to further object therefore be sure that here who know how stoutly have wielded sword how gave aid rescue to worshipful mynheer van voorden family to stout sir robert gaiton dame de courcy daughter how bore yourselves in fight down in kent will agree with that have right well won honour then drawing sword touched slightly on shoulder rise sir albert de courcy sir edgar ormskirk a lad rose be warmly congratulated by several of noble knight standing round will not detain king said short time later doubtless have many preparation to make for voyage hope that thing will fare well with in flanders bear in mind that if draw sword for mynheer van voorden be doing for england chapter xii trouble in flanders on re entering city gate first went to armourer where purchased buckled on gilded spur truly albert can scarce believe good fortune edgar said a left shop seems marvellous that though have not served a esquire must yet at seventeen be dubbed knight by king have well deserved edgar a for have done best to second very good best be albert edgar laughed 't be true that in skirmish outside aldersgate might have managed by in fleming affair in tower must have fared hardly indeed have not be for help fancy that have fleming to thank for good fortune see have already told king that be to accompany perhaps may have pointed out to that might be to advantage of mission that must be made knight have great influence with court seeing that have frequently supplied royal need with money first let visit good friend sir robert knight received most warmly heard from van voorden that be going to flanders with be like to see stirring event for ghent have long be in insurrection against count of flanders thing be likely to come to head erelong ah what do see gold spur then king have knighted be well indeed congratulate most heartily tell felt shame that who have not even drawn sword must have be knighted while two who have fought like paladin have not yet spur be glad have opportunity down in kent of showing be not mere carpet knight be for affair that king said knighted sir robert edgar said other matter be private venture though against king enemy be battle in field success put end to rioting down there will not forget promise about knightly armour merchant said methinks that be best to wait for while armour fleming bought be a good a must be made doubtless will outgrow so must be best for to delay for two three year be not likely that will have much to do with courtly ceremony before then when get to twenty by time will have full height if not full width will furnish with suit with must ride with richard when surrounded by proudest noble best knight thank indeed sir robert must be much better so first shine be not off armour at present must be cumbrous to carry second suit with therefore must much rather that postponed gift now went with into lady room dame daughter said have to present to sir edgar ormskirk sir albert de courcy whom majesty have be pleased morning to raise to honour of knighthood have be well won by own merit bravery dame gave exclamation of pleasure daughter clapped hand 't be well deserved indeed former exclaimed wish good fortune with new dignity how much owe robert that do

that have before be intention to do so ere left have not sir ralph said must be better for to earn in field a since time have fought in stiff battle done good service to realm by putting down insurgent in kent who have be foremost in trouble here must do so at once think now that be well must take man at arm with knight must not ride unattended when get across there will hire two fleming

residence very stately pile earl on hearing news called burgess who be still with sent back to ghent with message to town that must have peace treaty until have struck off head of whom chose john lyon began war by marching to bruges being wholly unprepared be forced to admit men to agree to alliance with ghent then marched to damme where be taken ill died not without strong suspicion of having be poisoned people of ghent sent strong force to ypres knight men at arm of garrison refused to admit craftsman of town rose in favour of ghent slew five of knight opened gate men of allied city then tried to attack tormonde where earl be be unable to take afterwards besieged oudenarde duke of burgundy however interposed peace be agreed upon on condition that earl must pardon come to live in ghent earl kept promise so far a to go there only stayed four day then left town peace be of very short continuance for relation of bailie other knight took forty ship on river put out eye of sailor sent

peter de bois who be now chief of white hood seeing that many of townsman be sorely discouraged by want of success went to philip van artevelde son of jacob van artevelde who be murdered by townsfolk for making alliance with england persuaded to come forward a leader of people on doing so philip be at once accepted by white hood two of leader of party of peace be at once murdered a father have be

strong force who bought large supply at brussels at liege managed to convey back to city most of inhabitant must have died from hunger so matter stand at present mission with be charged at present be to see van artevelde to find out whether like father jacob be well disposed towards english if so to promise aid will be sent to what be own thought on matter mynheer a to ghent say nothing merchant replied population have ever be rough turbulent swayed by agitator tyrannized over by craftsman can well see that be for interest of england ghent must be upheld for trouble in flanders greatly disturb duke of burgundy king of france whose interest never run together again see that independence of ghent bruges other large town be for good of flanders since be not for that country must be appanage of burgundy france heavy impost must be laid upon people franchise abolished trade greatly injured must therefore be sore misfortune for country be earl of flanders to crush ghent for did do so must work will in other town see be something like city of london exist flourish owing to right have gained curbed power of noble have built up great wealth power for merchant have revenue of prince carry on great trade with country see how readily earl fell in with mahew suggestion laid heavy tax on shipping of ghent in same way be supreme master lord must similarly tax trade of other town of flanders to great benefit of merchant of foreign country thus see a fleming must wish to see ghent although love not turbulent town preserved from destruction must surely fall upon be earl to capture why at ypres not only did kill many thousand of citizen in ambush when entered town beheaded well nigh six hundred of citizen if did that at ypres have offended comparatively little what must do to ghent have killed bailie sacked burned palace defied authority hold out against force thank very much mynheer knew little of matter before be glad to be so thoroughly informed in see be same

until reflected light from casement heavy rug carpet be stretched in front of fire place window at other point where family be accustomed to sit there be heavy curtain to window others before door so that draught must be cut off although not so handsome a room of two merchant in london everything be so substantial well kept comfortable that two friend be greatly struck by be now october great wood fire blazed in hall below in upstairs room quite dispelled air of gloom might otherwise have be caused by darkness of furniture truly edgar albert said in low tone while lady be talking together think that will change vocation once again abandon cutting of throat establish a flemish merchant must be year before must acquire necessary knowledge edgar laughed to say nothing of capital required for business truly comfort of house be wonderful be clear to that although englishman have learned to fight be mightily behind others in art of making life comfortable before meal be served friend went upstairs to room took off rough clothes in have travelled apparelled in plainest of two suit when dinner be announced went into room leading from in have before be a number be equal four gentleman offered hand to lady led to table be almost dark now room be lighted with many wax candle be novelty to young knight tallow candle have indeed come into partial use at beginning of century have never seen wax used save on occasion of great ceremony in church be now for first time frau rochter obtained fair view of face of guest be young indeed gentleman be not to have attained rank of knighthood said believe that in england 't be title go with land be so van voorden said before of young knight must reply in case have be won by distinguished bravery for king richard bestowed knighthood upon one can testify to bravery more strongly than for be thanks alone to that life certainly probably of wife daughter be preserved on evil day in london a meal proceeded gave full narrative of manner in have defended house while wife be removed from sick bed carried down to hiding place below be not only for single act of bravery that received knighthood young though be saved life of worshipful london citizen who have since become knight when have fallen into hand of party of robber when tower be in hand of rioter without assistance killed seven men who have entered lady chamber lastly rode with two knight fifty men at arm at mob consisting of two thousand of worst of rebel entirely defeated with loss of five hundred be for last act that be knighted mynheer van voorden omits to say edgar added that be largely to own good office that owe honour said nothing to king what be true just merchant replied told that have already determined to promote on first opportunity indeed even have not spoken believe that must have done so before left london be sure that deserved if have only be for what did for daughter said warmly several time while be getting mother down stair ran out to landing looked down at fight be terrible to see fierce face blow be struck with pole axe halbert marvel two young men must so firmly hold ground against such odds owe life assuredly madame van voorden said have not be for undoubtedly must have died day be very near to death a be have seen husband slaughtered before eye must have needed blow of knife to have finished chapter xiii starving town many of leading citizen hearing of van voorden arrival called in course of evening conversation of course turned upon state of public affair in flanders van voorden inquired particularly a to feeling in bruges side taken by leading citizen there be difficult to say one of merchant replied bruges have always be rival to ghent there have be little good will between city lower class be undoubtedly in favour of ghent among trader principal family feeling be other way be ghent in position to head national movement with fair chance of success doubt bruges must go with for must fear must be successful must suffer from domination of ghent at present however latter be in strait river be blockaded by earl ship town be sorely pressed by famine after vengeance taken by earl on place at commencement of trouble threw in lot with ghent can expect aid until show capable of again defeating prince army of course at present know little how matter stand van voorden said have be so long settled in england have hardly kept informed of affair here be thinking now of making flanders home again must not do so if land be like to be torn by civil war will therefore make business to sojourn for time in many of large town so to learn general feeling throughout country towards earl to find out what prospect there be of present trouble coming to speedy end france burgundy even england may interfere in matter if see prospect of gain by in case fighting might become general be feeling of england in favour of ghent one of burgher asked anxiously so far have heard little on matter english have have trouble of own have have little time to cast eye abroad nevertheless if struggle continues may remember that van artevelde be stout ally that ghent after murder again submitted to there be too bond of sympathy that flanders accepts same pope a england that in aiding aid pope cause strike blow at france with whom be always at dagger drawn therefore methinks more unlikely thing have happened than if france give aid to earl english may strike in for ghent trust not one of burgher said earnestly for sluys might well be landing point for english expedition then first brunt of war must fall upon say not that there be much chance of such thing van voorden said be mentioning complication might arise if ghent be able to prolong struggle on following morning party started from sluys made good show for van voorden have evening before engaged two mounted men well armed to ride with young knight a men at arm behind merchant party came two maid four retainer who have accompanied from england carried sword dagger defensive armour behind be two english men at arm two freshly taken on wearing breast back piece steel cap tarried day two at bruges van voorden finding among burgess trade animosity against ghent overpowered feeling of patriotism moreover be felt that success of town must give such encouragement to democracy elsewhere that city must become scene of riot civil strife learnt that unless fell in with one of party be stationed to prevent strong force of forager issuing from ghent to drive in cattle must find difficulty in entering town for citizen have shown such stout fighter that earl believing that city must fall by famine have drawn off greater portion of army travelling by easy stage party approached town on second evening soon after started that morning came upon body of troop of earl of flanders officer in command rode up to merchant asked for name object in going to ghent also who be two knight with a soon a van voorden mentioned name said that have for many year be established in officer at once recognized be well acquainted with name a one of foremost among countryman at king richard court that have several time acted a representative when complaint have be made of injury to flemish trader by english adventurer must still ask what do propose doing at ghent be over here for time with wife daughter be paying visit to friend business correspondent in various town may be that if trouble come to end may retire from business altogether settle down here knight have done signal service having saved life of daughter during riot in london therefore have asked of courtesy to ride with through flanders having desire to visit foreign country accepted invitation adieu then master van voorden know that be man of influence among merchant trust that will do best to persuade stiff necked burgher of ghent to submit to lord methinks from what hear merchant replied that if depended upon burgess trader there must be speedy end to trouble be overborne by demagogue of craftsman be true enough officer replied number of richer burgess have long since left ghent many have established in trade in other city where there be better chance of doing business in peace quiet party now rode on without further interruption arrived at ghent put up for night at hostelry in morning merchant have difficulty in hiring use of house for month for many of better class house be standing empty then called on several of leading burgess of whom be known to personally have long earnest talk with upon situation late in afternoon sent letter to philip van artevelde saying that have just arrived from england must be glad to have private parley with answer be received from van artevelde saying that must call that evening upon a must be more easy to have quiet speech together there than if visited at official residence at eight o'clock van artevelde arrived be wrapped in cloak gave name simply saying to retainer who opened door that be there by appointment with master van voorden received alone have met on two three occasion previously saluted other cordially think best that must meet quietly merchant said a shook hand know ghentois how greedily swallow rumour how magnify smallest thing how rage if desire be not gratified give wholly up to demagogue be for reason think well that have come to see privately have official mission to be charged by king richard rather by council when heard be coming over here on private affair to find out in first place how thing really stand here secondly to learn own opinion thought on matter in hand by time have seated by fire position be grievous enough in be straitened for food be reply indeed although have of late be fortunate in obtaining supply pressure can not be borne of one thing may be sure ghent will not tamely be starved out if can not obtain fair term man will arm sally out need be will sweep whole country clear of flock herd bring in such store a want from quarter carrying arm to gate of brussels malines in one direction to lisle in to ypres dixmuide south of lys earl though be louis can not bar road to forever keep up force sufficient to withstand already feudal lord have kept levy under arm far beyond time have right to require can not go on war cost more than peace whenever will can march with men in direction may please a to defending against assault have fear whatever thus then so long a ghent chooses can maintain war put emphasis on last word mean take merchant said a long a people be willing to go on fasting be so there be sore pinch food be distributed gratuitously for a trade be stopped there be little work to be have so long a must live in idleness obtain enough food small sum paid daily there be sign of discontent there be still plenty of money in coffer for good estate of many who have fled who be known to be favourable to earl have be confiscated money can not provide food thus seems to save for lack of food matter must go on a at present if fair term can not be obtained people will demand to be led against enemy will lead what will come after can not say a doubtless know be here by choice of own have naught to do with rising of ghent have be done hitherto when lyon died leader who succeeded be killed sent to to be governor for time refused be overborne be living quietly peaceably on estate with love for strife be pointed out that alone must unite faction that many of better class of citizen who held aloof from demagogue of street must feel confidence in that name must carry weight that other city might make alliance with when must have naught to say to butcher skinner such like that possibly earl must be more likely to grant term to than to whom considers a rabble took up position reluctantly having taken up will not lay down like enough will cost life a cost life of jacob van artevelde before may be aid will come from unexpected quarter be next point do look for aid from france france be never to be relied upon artevelde replied gloomily valois have of course made vague promise care for be that war must go on so that if burgundy come to blow flanders can give aid to duke have hope in quarter of late however burgundy berry have prevailed in council hear that have decided to join duke against have sent a doubtless know to king of england to ask to ally with 't be concerning that matter have charged be known when left england burgundy have promised aid to earl naught be known of france joining in king be well disposed towards council hold that so long a ghent stand alone england can make alliance with for must have to fight not only burgundy france rest of flanders if ghent make master of flanders england will gladly ally with will send troop money 't be reasonable artevelde said will bestir have done be possible to obtain peace in three day be going with twelve of principal citizen to bruges where earl arrived yesterday will offer to submit to mercy if will have pity on city if demand entire mastership will fight in earnest if will content with taking life be ready to give for sake of city know that have strong body of friend in town must come to blow methinks be not improbable that flanders will join if be supported by england may well hope to withstand france burgundy have two young english knight with van artevelde be young have already shown capable of deed of greatest bravery during late riot in london defended house against mob many hundred strong so gave time for wife daughter to gain place of hiding did many other brave feat so distinguished that though very young king have knighted invited to accompany in order that might see service must fain commend greatly to fact that be english knight must be of advantage to seeing that will in eye of people be taken a proof that sympathy of england be with must there be fighting occasion for use of brave men can rely upon to do utmost will gladly accept service van voorden a say people will certainly draw good augury from presence merchant left room returned in minute with two young knight be gentleman of whom have spoken to van artevelde said sir edgar ormskirk sir albert de courcy very valiant gentleman high in esteem of king richard greet gladly sir knight van artevelde said for own sake for of mynheer van voorden worthy friend who have presented right glad will be if will aid in sore strait into have fallen fear that aid will not be of much avail to sir edgar said such service a can render will right willingly give will be glad to see service for first time under one bearing name of great man who lost life because be so firm ally of england at present gentleman thing have not come to crisis here for few day must ask patience by time will know how matter be to go if be war gladly indeed will have ride with in field two day later philip van artevelde rode away with twelve citizen who like went to offer life for sake of city scene be affecting one crowd of haggard men half starved woman filled street most of be in tear prayed aloud that heaven must soften earl heart suffer to come back unharmed to city three day later returned a rode through street must see that news be bad that have returned because earl have refused to accept a sacrifice for rest enormous crowd gathered in front of town hall in few minute van artevelde companion appeared on balcony there be dead hush among multitude felt that life death hung on word told that count have refused altogether to accept twelve life a ransom for city that must give term save that must become master must execute such a be found to have taken part in rebellion against despairing moan rose from square below fellow citizen van artevelde went on there be now one of two thing for to do one be to shut gate retire to house there die by famine by such other mean a may choose other way be that man capable of bearing arm will muster that will march to bruges there either perish under lance of knight conquer drive headlong from land choose ye friend mighty shout arose will fight have chosen well van artevelde said have not before now defeated force of men at arm superior in number to ourselves be le brave than father will not fight a stoutly when know that leave famishing wife child behind who look to to bring back food return to home double ration of bread will be served out from magazine to two hour before daybreak will muster in company hour later start for bruges among who shouted loudest will fight be two young knight have a soon a be known that van artevelde party have entered town gone with van voorden to house of friend of in great square heard with indignation refusal of earl of flanders to accept noble sacrifice offered by twelve burgess who have followed example of governor of calais leading citizen in offering life a sacrifice for rest have met however with le generous foe whose term must if accepted have placed life property of citizen of ghent at mercy what be likely to be have be shown at ypres now young knight felt indeed that cause be righteous one that must draw sword for ghent with conviction that by so doing be fighting to save people from massacre by heaven van voorden exclaimed be younger too must go out with ghentois to battle care little a to right of quarrel though methinks ghent be right in resisting oppressive tax contrary to franchise earl have laid on city be nothing one have to look upon face of crowd to feel one blood boil at strait to lord instead of fighting boldly have like coward reduced by famine now when hear that have refused prayer for mercy refused to stay vengeance to content with head of noblest of citizen offered to instead must deluge street with blood must march with a to crusade will presently see van artevelde if for moment tell that will ride with ask where will take station late that evening van voorden returned have be present at council said gate will not be open to morrow on thursday five thousand men will set out early five thousand be small number edgar said to march against bruges city a large a having there earl doubt strong body of own troop be true most of men be so weakened that be thought that will be best to take small number of strongest most capable will carry with three hundred hand gun what little provision there be must be divided half will go with who march other half will be kept for here to sustain life until news come how matter have fared in field with only five thousand men without machine for siege can never hope to storm wall of bruges must be feat that a many veteran soldier might well hesitate to undertake have thought of doing so have be agreed that must be impossible force will camp near city seeing smallness of number people of bruges will surely sally out attack then will do best for victory if beat enemy men will follow on rear hotly enter city 't be bold plan edgar said at least there seems hope of success other plan methinks must give at rate two will do best being well fed well armed may hope to be able to cut way out of melee if must be lost fight for honour from good will be not case in must die rather than turn bridle a must be be fighting under banner of england command of king quite so edgar agree with entirely merchant said have not come to country to die in defence of ghent came to do if occasion offer knightly deed feeling pity for starving people here offer knightly aid will fight for a long a there be chance that fighting may avail beyond that must be folly indeed to go when see day hopelessly lost men at arm may well try to make way out of crowd of combatant to ride whither will say not to return here for must indeed be act of folly since ghent will have to surrender at once without condition a soon a news come that battle be lost therefore best plan must be to ride for sluys there take ship again a for will wait until news come then ride for liege remain there with friend quietly until see what upshot of affair be likely to be during day preparation be made for expedition five thousand of best able to carry arm be chosen store of provision be so small that there be five cartload of biscuit two tun of wine for who went

be speedily thronged moens took place with two young knight upon raised platform at end lifted hand for silence excited multitude be instantly still near door closed to keep out sound of bell then moens speaking at top of voice that might hear said be now mouthpiece of english knight to whom van artevelde have given honour of bearing news to since be ignorant of language have come with a interpreter first then have met army of bruges earl forty thousand strong have defeated with great slaughter with small loss to ourselves mighty shout rose from crowd be minute before speaker must

baker started at once with five hundred men to bring on bread a fast a be baked to spot where be to halt be not for later on knight with of men joined at camp with sufficient cattle sheep horse that knight have found straying to give man meal night one following morning next day drove in few more so be not until to day that touched store took with be food saved have be forced to eat scanty supply first night must have be fasting for well nigh forty eight hour when earl with knight men at arm townsman of bruges in forty thousand men marched out to meet chance must five thousand famished men have have against a be food got did wonder for man seemed to have regained full strength courage when came nigh to poured in one volley with gun put into confusion sun be in eye almost before knew that have moved be upon two knight four men at arm flung into crowd opened way for footman in five minute fight be over may be that many of craftsman of bruges be there unwillingly that be among first to throw down arm fly however be in five minute whole force be in full flight earl knight men at arm struck not single blow seeming panic struck scattered fled in direction earl forty men alone gaining bruges there closed gate against fugitive fled to other gate so hotly did pursue that entered mixed up with van artevelde committed to two english knight task of seizing gate of setting guard to prevent man from leaving while rest of under pushed forward to market place there be resistance thousand of men have fallen in battle flight thousand have failed to enter gate who did so be utterly panic stricken terrified thus five thousand men sent out have defeated forty thousand have captured bruges verily believe that not more than score have fallen methinks friend will agree with that governor have done well to give knight honour of carrying good news to ghent mighty shout answered question crowd rushed upon two young knight anxious to speak to praise with difficulty councillor aided by of colleague surrounded made way to small door at end of platform once beyond building hurried along by street to van voorden house to where on entering hall have charged men at arm at once to take horse to hand over a much of provision a be needed for immediate want of household then to carry rest to nun of convent hard by for be knew reduced to direst strait before expedition started welcome back welcome back fleming exclaimed a entered word be repeated by wife daughter men at arm told wife what have happened heard from lower end of town hall where arrived just a moens began to speak saw escape from platform hurried off have only instant arrived crush be so great in square that be difficult to make way through forgive if say nothing further until have eaten that food upon table for indeed have have one regular meal since left town tell first though for be too excited to ask moens question have earl be captured have not up to moment when left strictest search be being made for be known that must be somewhere in town for party not knowing that van artevelde be in market place well nigh fell into hand certainly must not have got through of gate before have closed have placed strong guard over van artevelde have given strict order that be to be taken uninjured purpose to bring here to make sign peace with trust that will be caught van voorden said a for peace must have faith in for be sure that a soon a be once free again must repudiate must at once set to work to gather with aid of burgundy force with must renew war wipe out disgrace have befallen take revenge upon city inflicted now let to supper will look on albert said with smile supped at bruges at past nine will be pleasure indeed to see eat must not eat much merchant said to wife daughter let take little now to morrow can do better might injure to give rein to appetite after well nigh starving for last two day a soon a meal be eaten sallied out into street young knight first laying aside armour a did not wish to attract attention bell be still ringing out with joyous clamour at house flag carpet curtain have be hung out torch be fixed to balcony great bonfire have be lighted in middle of street in open space market people be well nigh delirious with joy stranger shook hand embraced in street men woman forgot weakness hunger though many be so feeble hour before must scarcely drag along cathedral church be lighted up crowded with worshipper thanking god for having preserved in hour of greatest need then in truth sir edgar fleming said a went along people of bruges showed to be cowardly rabble fighting be poor indeed must scarce be called fighting at edgar said few blow from halbert bill few thrust of pike struck armour a charged among after that be matter of cutting down fugitive rabble down in kent fought with far greater courage for have to charge through through several time before broke doubt not very many be outside bruges against will have not dared disobey summons to arm be panic strange one have doubtless made up mind that when saw multitude must surrender without blow being struck sudden discharge of gun shook at first charge bolted away panic struck strangest part of affair be that earl who have strong following of knight men at arm made effort to retrieve battle have charged down upon flank when have become disordered in pursuit must have overthrown without difficulty how came about that did not do so be more than can say be clear that earl showed to be great coward disgrace day be far greater than of burgher of bruges since party fled without loss of single drop of blood while thousand of citizen have lost life be good that so behaved van voorden said story that so deserted men of bruges who went to fight in quarrel will speedily be known throughout flanders that with news of great victory will bring many city to side trust van artevelde will treat bruges with leniency have already issued proclamation that none of small craftsman of bruges will be injured exception be made in case of four guild have always be foremost against ghent member of be to be killed when found 't be pity one can scarce blame now friend that have seen ghent on wonderful night will be well that get home to bed wife daughter be still weak from fasting feel strain a to have done heavy day work indeed especially having to carry weight of armour young knight be indeed glad to throw upon pallet slept soundly until awakened by fresh outburst of bell sat up daylight be beginning to break 't be train of provision edgar said may a well go out see sight give such aid a can to council for famishing people may well be too eager to await proper division of food in few day there be abundance of everything in ghent for damme sluys opened gate at once in former there be vast cellar of wine of tun be sent by ship cart to ghent while at sluys there be vast quantity of corn meal in ship storehouse of foreign merchant be bought paid for at fair price sent to city besides food wine ghent received much valuable spoil gold silver vessel of earl be captured at bruges with much treasure great store of gold jewel be taken at palace at male near bruges philip van artevelde at once sent message to town of flanders summoning to send key of gate to ghent to acknowledge supremacy news of victory have caused great exultation in most of city with exception of oudenarde sent deputation at once to ghent to congratulate to promise to support in thing in meantime gate portion of wall of bruges have be beaten down five hundred of burgess be taken to ghent a hostage young knight remained quietly there until philip van artevelde returned be received with frantic enthusiasm have assumed title of regent of flanders now assumed state pomp far greater than earl have held have immense income for not only be private estate large sort of tribute be paid by town of flanders ghent for time presented scene of gaiety splendour equal to of capital in europe siege be presently laid to oudenarde where garrison have be strongly reinforced by large party of men at arm cross bowman sent by earl city in flanders sent contingent of fighting men to join of ghent le than hundred thousand men be assembled outside oudenarde went two young friend a soon a siege began have come out to see fighting not feasting have lost society of van voorden having be requested by van artevelde to return to england to conclude treaty between ghent flanders be indeed master of for earl be fugitive at court of son in law duke of burgundy who be endeavouring to induce france to join against flanders for time failed for king be much better disposed to fleming than be to earl when time later charles died burgundy became powerful with young king successor france also prepared to take field against flanders thus close alliance between latter england became of great importance to have not be for extreme unpopularity of duke of lancaster brother gloucester course of event might have be changed for war with france be always popular in england necessary supply must at once have be voted by parliament have not be thought that when army be raised lancaster must instead of warring with france use for furthering own claim in spain many english knight however came over on own account to aid fleming le than two hundred archer at calais quietly left town with acquiescence if not with encouragement of authority to take service with van artevelde one day two friend returned to camp after being away for time watching what be going on on entering tent albert who be first to enter gave shout of surprise pleasure edgar pushed in to see what must have thus excited friend so moved from usual quiet manner too be equally surprised almost equally pleased when saw albert standing with hand clasped in of father thought must surprise sir ralph said by coming over to see great gathering also to have look at heard of doings from van voorden be good enough after first interview with king council to ride down to tell how fared with gave small pleasure a may well suppose to hear that have already gained so much credit that be well in health went back to town with stayed three week there there be much talk in council be well content that there must be alliance with fleming seems to there be not much chance of english army taking field to help at present king be altogether taken up with marriage be thinking much more of fete pageant than of war then 't be doubtful whether common must grant large sum required present be bad time rebellion have cost much money what with destruction of property with field standing untilled expense of court be very heavy in truth people have reasonable cause for grumbling thereat then again if army be sent to flanders lancaster must most surely have command know how much be hated may say feared naught will persuade men that have not design upon crown for can see warrant assuredly love power gloucester overshadow king then again wish be certainly to lead great army into spain must oppose money being spent on operation in flanders thus fear alliance be like to be of little use to ghent flanders be black prince father upon throne thing must be different indeed must have stout army here before many week be over of old time feel hard indeed to see england playing so poor part there be reason moreover why baron press matter on in first place be jealous of influence that king favourite have with that who by rank age must be councillor meet with poor reception when come to court methinks even thing hinder much le than conduct of people of ghent since bruges be captured there have be a know party going through land a far a frontier of france plundering destroying house castle of knight noble under complaint that be favourable to earl in truth chiefly because knave hate of gentle blood be greedy of plunder noble deem methinks that have reason for doing so to be business something like have have in england save that with be country people while here be of town who must fain pull down destroy above in station certainly act be not like to win friendship assistance of english noble knight indeed see that sir ralph edgar said at first be greatly in favour of ghent seeing that be in desperate strait that reasonable term be refused of late have not be so warm in cause van artevelde be assuredly honest desirous of doing what be right methinks doe wrong in keeping up state of king bearing towards of other city of flanders a if ghent be conqueror laying heavy tax upon while be swayed by council of most violent of demagogue of ghent now tell how go on siege go not on at oudenarde be strong place be defended by many broad ditch have garrison of knight men at arm of earl who a know take upon defence knowing that there be men in town who must fain surrender fearing that must throw open gate to give such aid a must be there chance still more siege go on slowly rather may say go on not at for want of leader van artevelde know nothing whatever of business of war do of about men of town will fight bravely in pitched field a have often shown a to laying siege know naught of seems to that matter might go on for year yet be nearer end be far more occupied in making ordinance collecting contribution in doing can for honour glory of ghent than in thinking of taking oudenarde indeed when captured must be of great consequence to sir ralph nodded methinks be right edgar arrived here just a went out morning hearing from men that be not like to return till midday have ridden round to see what be being done to surprise saw in three month since great host sat down before oudenarde naught of use have be accomplished with such army if flanders wish to maintain freedom must have summoned burgundy to abstain from giving aid to earl on refusal must have marched with whole force against captured of great town met host in fair field methinks two be doing good to yourselves here that will be just a well for to go back to england for time until see how matter shape chapter xv crushing defeat two young knight be pleased to hear sir ralph counsel for have several time talked matter over together agreed that there be little prospect of aught being done for many month felt that be wasting time remaining before oudenarde where be frequently offended by overbearing manner of ghentois who on strength of defeat of people of bruges considered to be invincible have during four month that have be in flanders learned enough of language to make easily understood have paid visit to brussels other place of importance be likely to learn nothing from event of siege must already see be not going to be attended with success be first absence from home in lack of adventure excitement must be glad to be back again therefore after remaining three day only confirmed sir ralph in view took leave of van artevelde saying that hoped to rejoin a soon a there be prospect of active service riding to sluys took ship with follower at sir ralph suggestion retained in train two fleming whom have found stout useful fellow be glad to go home again hal sir edgar said well master must not be glad be there aught doing here though now that have granted pardon to concerned in wat tyler business can show face without fear have be dull time except just for score of blow in business with bruges people there have be naught to do since came over except to groom horse polish armour one might a well have be driving cart at st alwyth a moping about camp perhaps there will be more stirring time when come back again hal burgundy be arming be like enough that france may join in case there will be fighting enough even to satisfy may have few month at home before be likely to take place knight be landed at gravesend road lay together a far a st alwyth be late in afternoon sir ralph albert rode straight home telling edgar that must expect to see in morning edgar found father going on just a usual received son with pleasure without surprise a sir ralph have called before left have said that if found that naught be doing at oudenarde must recommend own son edgar to return home for while well sir knight mr ormskirk said smiling have not yet congratulated on honour believe be right glad when news have have little fighting hear none at father for affair near bruges must scarcely be called fighting be a naught to fight have down here before went away save for have not drawn sword have returned home somewhat richer for van artevelde gave albert rich present a share of spoil taken there have grown nigh two inch mr ormskirk said a edgar laid aside armour have done little else eat sleep ride for hour two day practise arm other two hour with albert for indeed there be few among fleming who knew aught of matter save to strike downright blow be sturdy fellow strong can doubtless fight well side by side in pitched battle can scarce be called men at arm seeing that take down weapon when be required hang up again until there be fresh occasion for use so have doubtless grown bit having nothing else to do for how long be home edgar know not father sir ralph will go up with to london next week say that will be well must present ourselves at court after that will hing until affair change in flanders till force go from here to aid edgar rode over to de courcys ' place next morning received warm welcome four day later rode to town with sir ralph king received with much favour philip van artevelde sent by master van voorden most favourable report of said told that be mightily beholden to for victory over men of bruges for have not be for collecting supply for men must have be too famished to have given battle that led charge into midst of rank be pleased to find that knight have borne so well how go on siege of oudenarde can scarcely be called siege majesty edgar said there be few skirmish beyond naught be done if majesty must send out good knight with skill in such matter might take oudenarde in ten day a be 't be like to extend to length of siege of troy unless burgundians come to relief must send good knight for have plenty of must obey methinks not sire edgar replied frankly just at present be so content with that must assuredly accept foreign leader have indeed small respect for own king laughed what thought of sir ralph 't be what might be looked for majesty be army of bourgeois craftsman stout fellow who must doubtless defend wall against attack might fight stoutly shoulder to shoulder have over weening conceit in deem that be necessary in war be to carry pike pole axe use stoutly party of child must do a well better be set to besiege town leadership there be none party go out to skirmish with garrison few life be lost then return well content with 't be mockery of war king asked many question about state of thing in flanders to replied frankly that flanders be united at present that thought that with five thousand english archer a many men at arm under commander of such station a must give authority not only over own troop over fleming might be able to resist attack of burgundy even of burgundy allied with france that by without military leader feared that matter must go ill with fleming king bade two friend come to court that evening when did so presented to young queen speaking of in very high term be said only men who did duty on day when rioter invaded tower during absence killing with own hand seven men who invaded apartment of lady de courcy carrying daughter safely through crowd have done duty tenth part a well disgrace rabble brought upon must never have occurred life of trusty councillor must have be saved king have already told of exploit here of other deed a notable done by mynheer van voorden also spoke to of service rendered queen said graciously have scarcely looked to see hero of story such young knight spoke to for time while king favourite looked on somewhat ill pleased at such graciousness being shown to new comer haughty de vere who have just be created duke of dublin who be about to start to undertake governorship of ireland spoke in sneering tone to young noble standing next to sir ralph happened to overhear touched on shoulder lord duke said methinks need not grudge honour have fallen to two young knight have achieved far greater honour without so far a know ever having drawn sword be best that if have aught to say against must say in hearing when warrant of must gladly give opportunity of proving valour skill indeed must be needed since must wager of to spit like fly within five minute must consider too young for so great noble to cross sword with must gladly take up quarrel favourite flushed hotly for moment hesitated have quarrel with sir ralph de courcy said after short hesitation word be addressed to friend here spoke loud enough for to hear lord duke must know that such word so spoken be insult be not meant a such sir ralph then sir will give advice to hold tongue more under government young knight have earned royal favour not by soft word mincing way by sword be best in future that remark may wish to make concerning must be in strict privacy openly in hearing so saying turned back on disconcerted young courtier who shortly afterwards left royal presence overcome by chagrin confusion for knight word have be heard by several standing round more than one malicious smile have be exchanged among rival for court favour de vere have fair share of bravery report of singular feat of swordsmanship by young knight convinced that must have small chance with of in duel even if came well out of there must be small credit indeed to in overcoming young knight who have not yet reached manhood while if worsted must be fatal blow to reputation that evening have private interview with king requested leave to start next day to take up new governorship sir ralph related incident to lad a returned to hostelry where have taken up lodging be heavy blow for pride said think not that be coward de veres come of good stock saw that duel must do great harm king if learned cause a must have done must have be greatly displeased queen equally so there must have be credit to have wounded while if have be wounded must have be deemed disgrace that duke of dublin governor of ireland must have be worsted by so young knight therefore blame not for refusing to accept challenge offered will make soberer more careful of speech in future be lesson needly greatly for have often heard among companion using insolent remark concerning men who be in respect superior save that stood not so high in favour of king remained week in london attending court regularly improving acquaintance with many whom have met there in troubled time there be scarce day that did not spend time at house of sir robert gaiton albert especially being always ready with pretext for visit there van voorden have left london sailing thence on very day before have arrived at gravesend summer passed quietly oudenarde still held out indeed serious attack have be made upon van artevelde have sent messenger to king of france begging to mediate between fleming duke of burgundy king have thrown messenger into prison without returning answer in autumn have summoned levy to aid duke in invasion of flanders seeing that fighting in earnest be likely to commence shortly knight took ship with follower early in october after fair voyage landed at sluys rode to oudenarde formal alliance have by time be made between two country step have be taken towards gathering army in two knight be however very cordially received by van artevelde have arrived just in time to ride with to morrow said be going to see that have be done to prevent french from crossing river bridge have be broken save at comines warneton peter de bois be appointed to hold one peter de winter other following morning twenty horseman started with van artevelde rode to ghent thence followed bank of lys most of bridge have be completely destroyed at comines warneton have be so broken up that handful of men at must keep against army may feel safe think sir knight van artevelde said to friend when brought tour of inspection to end on second day after starting assuredly be safe against french crossing by bridge edgar said must find boat may cross where please have ordered boat to be brought over to side of river sir edgar number of men have by order be engaged in doing so doubtless sir have kept look out whole distance have not seen one boat on other side of stream there be numerous channel canal by country folk bring down produce however sharp search may be boat may have escaped notice even sunken one might seem wholly useless must be raised roughly repaired in few trip must bring number of men across under shadow of night so far a have read be rarely that army have failed to find mean of kind for crossing river philip van artevelde be not now a have be year before ready to take hint from others simply replied carelessly have doubt that order have be strictly carried out sir knight rode forward again think thing will go well with albert edgar said with general who know nothing whatever of warfare army without officer tradesman against men at arm look out be not good van artevelde ought to have have horseman scattered over on other side of river who must have brought exact news a to point against main body of french be marching ought to have man posted two hundred yard along river bank for fifteen mile above below point then must have four body of five thousand men posted at equal distance three mile behind river so that one of must march with haste to spot where learned that french be attempting to cross must arrive there long before enough of enemy have made passage to withstand onslaught will wager that lys will not arrest passage of french for twenty four hour be peter de bois reasonable man must ask leave of van artevelde to ride take up post with be arrogant ignorant fellow with whom must quarrel before have be in camp hour two day passed quietly at oudenarde then news came that enemy have passed lys at comines seeing that bridge must not be crossed french army have halted of knight went down to river after search discovered boat in passed over with four hundred men at arm before unperceived by fleming then marched towards comines hoping that fleming must leave strong position near head of bridge to give battle in case doubted not that constable must find mean so far to repair bridge that passage must begin peter de bois however be not to be tempted to leave position french have to remain night on marshy ground without food for horse in morning however fleming fearing that others might cross reinforce party marched out against knight men at arm met so stoutly that in very short time fleming took to flight french at once set to work to repair bridge by great portion of army have crossed weather be very wet stormy french army have suffered much there be besides edgar albert other english knight in camp gathered together a soon a news came talked over what in opinion have best be done think said sir james pinder knight who have seen much service on many stricken field must be best to remain where be to throw up fortification behind can fight to better advantage while french cavalry must be able to do little against french troop must be worn out with marching with terrible weather will find difficult to procure food might even abstain altogether from coming against while from what see of rabble may fight bravely will never be able to withstand shock of french knight men at arm 't be like french will be three four day before come hither by time with fifty thousand men to work at must have work so strong high that must fearlessly meet moreover threescore english archer who still remain must be able to gall a pressed forward whereas in pitched battle must not be numerous enough to avail anything other six knight agreed with sir james who then said hear that van artevelde have summoned leader to consult a to best course will go across tell what in opinion have better be done returned in hour 't be hopeless said shrugging shoulder fleming be a obstinate a be ignorant not one of present agreed with proposal many indeed broke into rude laughter so left after crossing lys french came to ypres on same day fleming broke up camp before oudenarde marched fifty thousand strong to courtray on following day moved forward to ground van artevelde counsellor deemed good for fighting behind be hill dyke be on one wing grove of wood be on other french be camped at rosbecque four mile away that evening van artevelde invited principal men officer to sup with gave instruction for morrow said that be not sorry that large force of englishman have come to aid for have done so must assuredly have have credit of victory also gave order that prisoner must be taken save king whom must bring to ghent instruct in flemish language false alarm roused camp at midnight although proved to be ill founded fleming be so uneasy at thought that might be attacked unawares great fire be lighted meat cooked wine drunk until hour before daylight when arranged in order of battle also occupied heath beyond wood large dyke ran across in front of behind ground be covered by small bush philip van artevelde be in centre with picked men of ghent whom always kept near person a have little faith in goodwill of from other town beyond be contingent of alost grammont of courtray bruges damme sluys be armed with mace steel cap breast piece gauntlet of steel carried staff tipped with iron company craft have own livery colour standard with arm of town morning be misty sign must be seen of french after time fleming became impatient determined to sally out to meet enemy be just madness sir james said to english knight who with follower have gathered round have great hope that with dyke in front to check onrush of french might withstand attack come out victor now be throwing away advantage going like sheep to shearer by faith friend be well that horse have rested of late for will need speed if be to make escape from business a moved forward in mist caught sight of french knight who moved backwards forward along front then rode away doubtless to inform countryman that fleming be advancing against in french army be best knight leader of france a soon a heard that fleming be advancing divided into three body one carrying royal banner be to attack fleming in front two others be to move on side fall upon flank arranged moved forward with full confidence of victory central division fell first upon fleming be received so roughly that recoiled little several good knight fell in few minute however other two division attacked fleming flank english knight who be stationed on right seeing what be coming have in vain tried to get

sir james said sure never before be so dense mass 't be like sea raging round edge of black rock eating away piecemeal be there five thousand fleming might do better for now very number prevent from using arm ah here be party with whom may deal pointed to small body of french knight who be about to fall on rear of fleming now gentleman st george st george putting spur to horse seven knight follower dashed at french latter be also mounted unlike majority of companion who before attacking have dismounted handed horse to page party be fully double strength of english impetus of charge

invaluable sword blow fell harmless on lance glanced from polished face a put spur to horse edgar have dropped vizor down again for wanted to strike now not to have to defend with crushing blow hewed way through opponent other two english knight kept close men at arm fought a stoutly a master until party emerged from among assailant a did so knight next to edgar reeled in saddle edgar threw arm round supported until have ridden short distance then a halted sprung from horse lowered to ground thanks knight murmured a opened vizor be hurt to death leave here to die quietly look to yourselves

a rode off looked back behind be host of flying men many of be throwing away steel cap armour to run more quickly battle have lasted only hour by time nine thousand fleming have fallen of whom more than half have be suffocated by press flight however be far more fatal than battle for french a soon a fight be won mounted horse chased fleming so hotly that twenty five thousand be killed body of van artevelde be found after battle be without wound be so trampled on a to be almost unrecognizable body be taken hung on tree a galloped off edgar reined back to hal carter who be one of survivor see that be badly hurt hal a soon a get fairly away will halt will bandage wound be of great account sir edgar be worth coming over from england to take part in such fray worst part of be that did not last long enough lasted too long for many of hal saved life by warning shout gave for most assuredly must have be borne from saddle have blow struck unawares be cowardly trick to charge man when be otherwise engaged hal said paid well for master fairly crushed helmet in three mile on halted in wood to give horse breathing time when unhurt bandaged wound of others be found that sir eustace be so severely wounded that must not go much farther two of men at arm be in a bad case third be fleming be best to leave here sir eustace said can not ride much farther that will not do edgar said torhut

minute later edgar albert continued way followed now by hal carter alone latter have washed blood from face armour have thrown short cloak over shoulder so that must pas without being suspected that have taken part in desperate fray after riding for hour stopped at wayside inn avoiding bruges rode next day into sluys where found vessel sailing evening for england rumour of disastrous battle of rosebeque have a yet reached sluys two young knight calling upon merchant who have entertained at first landing informed of what have happened 't be well that be so said for in truth domination of craftsman of ghent other great city must have be far harder to bear than of earl of france of burgundy already tax impost be four time a heavy a laid upon by earl have gained victory people must soon have come to exercise tyranny altogether beyond bearing 't be ever thus when lower class gain dominion over upper chapter xvi war of church have be short time absent voyage sir ralph said a son edgar rode up to castle truly have be short time father albert said have seen much of course news have not yet reached army of flanders have be utterly broken by french whether van artevelde be killed know

one who rode to sluys with rest be dead so too might have be for strength temper of armour did not fleming fight sturdily then fought sturdily for time altogether without leader order took up strong position impatient of hour delay marched from to give battle being attacked on flank a well a in front be driven into close mass so that few must use arm be only to find breathing space have to fly 't be bad news indeed have prevailed alliance with must have brought about great thing for artevelde must have put flanders under english protection between must have withstood attack of france burgundy think that ghent will be taken edgar can not say sir ralph however great loss may be ghentois be like to make obstinate defence judging from way in withstood earl with flanders at back will know that have mercy to expect if yield believe that so long a there be man left to wield arm city will hold out a to other town of flanders be a fickle a wind will open gate to king of france who seeing that be by power alone flanders have be taken will assuredly hold a own in future now that have returned must be well edgar that son must practise with lance 't be knightly weapon knight must at least know how to use well there be piece of ground quarter of mile away have be looking at find that will make good tilting ground will teach know in matter edgar thankfully embraced offer after going into castle to pay respect to dame daughter went home with hal carter whose wound be still sore news came from flanders to england from time to time be bad be first heard how terrible have be slaughter of fleming after victory that in thirty four thousand have be killed then news came that courtray although opened gate without resistance have be first pillaged then burnt that bruges have surrendered have be only spared from pillage by payment of great sum of money none of other town have offered resistance ghent have shut gate french deeming that operation of siege must be too severe to be undertaken in winter have marched away return being hastened by news of insurrection in france king however have declared flanders to be portion of france earl of flanders have done homage to a liege lord news of merciless slaughter of fleming of cruel treatment of courtray aroused great indignation in england be increased when be heard that rich english merchant in bruges have be obliged to fly for life that other englishman found in town have be seized by earl of flanders thrown into prison good confiscated young knight practised at tilting daily under eye of sir ralph at end of three month must carry off ring skilfully must couch lance truly whether at breast piece helm be nigh two year since have first ridden to london have grown tall greatly widened edgar be still by far taller stronger be now exceptionally powerful young man albert be of fair strength stature from constant practice with edgar have attained almost a great skill with weapon when jousted always used lighter spear than when practised at ring for in charge edgar weight strength must have carried albert out of saddle that with such force a might have caused serious injury lance therefore be made so slight a to shiver at shock be like to be employing weapon to better advantage soon sir ralph said one day on return from london know of rivalry between two pope that hold for urban while france champion clement yes sir edgar said how be likely to give occasion for to betake ourselves to arm again urban be going to use a instrument against france spain bull be received yesterday of copy have also be sent to bishop calling upon richard to engage in sort of holy war to end have ordered that church property throughout england will be taxed that bishop will exhort person to give a much a can afford for same purpose to who take part in war give absolution from sin same to who staying at home contribute to church need sum of money thus raised doubt not will be great be to be devoted partly to expedition against france partly to one under lancaster against spain a be church war expedition to france be to be led by churchman urban have chosen sir henry spencer bishop of norwich who if will remember bore so stoutly against insurgent in diocese a nominal leader king have taken matter up heartily many of knight whom met at court be also well content seeing that war be to be conducted at expense of church not of doubt not that large number of knight gentleman will take part in expedition be of nature of crusade more than met old friend sir hugh calverley with whom have fought side by side score of time whose name be of course well known to be minded also to go partly because hate french partly because of pope blessing absolution seeing said to 'as be going sir hugh pray to do favour 'there be one must more willingly oblige old friend said bey son went on friend of whom regard almost a son be knighted more than year since a may have heard for valiant conduct in time of trouble here ' ' have heard story said 'it be well known to at court ' beince then sir hugh have be over in flanders where gained approbation of van artevelde by conduct fought stoutly at grievous battle of rosbecque hitherto have have knightly leader have gained such experience a must by must that must campaign in train of valiant well known knight like under whose eye must gain distinction a well a knowledge of military affair will take with gladly ' said must be young knight of rare mettle even apart from regard for must be right glad to have ride with ' young knight gave exclamation of pleasure be hard for knight unattached to train of well known leader to rise to distinction there be english knight living who bore higher reputation than sir hugh calverley so that to ride under must be honour indeed month passed before preparation be complete throughout england bishop priest preached incited people to what considered holy war promise of absolution of past future sin be in proportion to money given in diocese of london alone tun full of gold silver be gathered by lent total amounted to what at time be fabulous sum of franc thomas bishop of london brother to earl of devonshire be appointed by urban to go with duke of lancaster to spain a chief captain with two thousand spear four thousand archer money gathered be to be spent on expedition other half on of bishop of norwich expedition be to set out together one progressed far more rapidly than other bishop of norwich be very popular be of ancient lineage have personally shown great bravery be highly esteemed upon other hand duke of lancaster be hated thus great number of knight others enlisted eagerly under bishop while very few be willing to take service under duke five hundred spearmen fifteen hundred men at arm archer be soon enrolled under bishop banner great number of priest too followed example of bishop threw aside cassock clad in armour to go to war in spirit of crusader great number passed over from dover sandwich in party to wait at calais for arrival of leader at easter bishop sir hugh calverley two of principal knight attended king council swore to do best to bring to end matter on be engaged to war only against supporter of clement king begged to wait for month at calais promising that must send over many men at arm archer sir william beauchamp a marshal to army bishop promised king to do party sailed from dover arrived at calais on april young knight have gone up to town month before by invitation of sir robert gaiton have stayed with for week at end of time presented of with superb suit of milan steel richly inlaid with gold two fine war horse be gift have long promised said gave order to agent in italy year since to spare time trouble to obtain best that armourer of milan must turn out horse be of yorkshire breed be warranted sound at point be princely present sir robert edgar said indeed most timely one for truly have well nigh grown out of other suit although when got seemed to that must never be able to fill properly of late have be forced to ease strap to leave space between piece by lance arrow might well find entrance sir ralph have gone up with introduced to sir hugh who promised to give two day warning when be to join at sandwich dover during week edgar for most part went about alone albert at first to surprise then to amusement always making pretext other for not accompanying passing a found on return greater portion of time in house in discourse a said with dame gaiton a edgar shrewdly guessed chiefly with ursula who found obligingly kept friend company while dame be engaged in household duty seemed to too that on ride back to st alwyth albert be unusually silent depressed in spirit edgar however experienced something of same feeling when took last farewell from de courcys before starting for dover on occasion took with four men at arm stout fellow albert being picked men from among de courcy retainer while hal carter have selected three mate from among villager have during last three month trained assiduously in use of arm how long do think that be likely to be away edgar father asked evening before party started can not tell father think that will be long if expedition have started six month ago must have arrived in flanders in time to have helped fleming with aid french might have be driven flying over frontier can not see what two three thousand men can do can not fight whole strength of france by ourselves seems to hare brained affair altogether mr ormskirk said almost a mad only in different way a crusade of peter hermit church have surely trouble enough in day what with men like wickliffe who denounce error point out how far have fallen back from simple way of old time what with impatience indifference of small part of people pomp wasteful confusion of prelate laziness of monk have plenty of matter to look after without meddling in military affair what must say if score of noble be to take upon to tell to set house in order to adopt reform to throw aside sloth luxury yet church be stirring up war raising paying army of fighting men for what to settle of two men will be pope simple thing must be to hold high tournament to let urban clement don armour decide between in fair fight who must be pope might a well do that a set other men to fight for see not what good can come of edgar albert be of same opinion father certainly with two three thousand men can hardly expect to march to paris force king of france to declare for pope still will march in good company will be proud to do so under banner of so distinguished knight a sir hugh calverley say naught against edgar must rather see start with a knight errant willing at time to couch lance for damsel in distress day have passed for crusade surely have have experience enough to see that solid advantage be not to be won by religious enthusiasm men may be so inspired to deed of wondrous valour there be instance of permanent good arising out of such expedition a for in be going to embark seems to to be height of folly next day two young knight rode to canterbury thence to dover following evening bishop of norwich with train sir hugh calverley other knight arrived next morning embarked with following horse on board three ship sailed to calais who have preceded be already impatient to take field news that there be to be further delay of month until sir william beauchamp with reinforcement must arrive caused much disappointment vexation 't be unfortunate sir hugh said one evening few day later to knight of party that there be not more men here accustomed to war who have learned that patience obedience be a needful a strong arm if campaign be to be carried out successfully bishop of norwich be young fiery hath many like round so that fret openly at delay moreover sir thomas trivet sir william helmon be too full of ardour to act with discretion be ready enough to back up bishop in hot desire to be doing something regret that army be not like army fought at crecy poictiers composed of men well inured to war with great number of good archer led by experienced warrior instead of hasty gathering of men who have be fired by exhortation of priest promise of pope be small gathering may take castle defeat force that noble here gather against more than that can not do unless england arm in earnest foresaw spoke to council when prayed to go with bishop when pointed out that what said made more needful that one of grave experience year must go with prayed to accept office consented on th of may bishop of norwich took advantage of sir hugh absence having gone for two day to see cousin who be commander of guines to call other leader together said that be time did deed of arm rightly employed money with church have furnished agreed with bishop then proposed that instead of entering france must march to flanders be now portion of france to sir thomas trivet sir william helmon cordially agreed when sir hugh returned council be called matter be laid before sir hugh opposed altogether in first place have given word to king to wait for month for promised reinforcement in second place have not come over a englishman to fight french a follower of pope urban to fight of clement men of flanders be like follower of urban bishop answered very hotly a other knight present agreed with bishop sir hugh reluctantly gave way said that if be determined upon going to flanders must ride with accordingly notice be given through town that force must march next morning assembled at order to number of three thousand marched from calais to gravelines preparation for defence have be made there for there be war between england flanders however burgher defended place for short time then withdrew with wife family to cathedral be place of strength here defended for two day church be then stormed defender put to sword news excited greatest surprise indignation in flanders earl at once sent two english knight who be with to gravelines to protest with order to obtain from bishop safe conduct to go to england to lay matter before english king council when arrived at gravelines bishop refused request for safe conduct told to tell earl that be not warring against flanders be army army of england of pope urban that although greater portion of flanders be urbanist lord of bar in whose dominion gravelines stood be for clement so be people if must acknowledge pope urban must march away without doing damage paying for took unless did so must force to submit people of artois however who be french rather than fleming took matter in own hand twelve thousand men under knight from nieuport other town marched to dunkirk then to mardyck large village not far from gravelines edgar albert have taken part in attack upon cathedral remained with sir hugh calverley in house that occupied a soon a resistance of entry to town have ended on field will fight with rest said will have hand in matter there have be defiance sent to earl of flanders received from 't be not habit to fight burgher against whom have complaint who be defending home against two young knight be well pleased with decision be age when quarter be seldom given wholesale slaughter followed battle so that have naturally idea common to time still felt that attack be wholly unprovoked altogether beyond scope of expedition be well pleased that leader must have naught to do with be however different matter when heard that army twelve thousand strong be coming out against be quite ready to take share in fight while waiting at gravelines several other knight have joined army among sir nicholas clifton sir hugh cousin commander of guines sir hugh spencer nephew of bishop others force consisted of six hundred mounted men sixteen hundred archer rest foot men found that fleming have fallen back to dunkirk have taken up position in front of town bishop on approaching sent forward herald to ask whether be for pope urban clement that if be for urban have quarrel with a soon however a herald approached fleming fell upon killed excited most lively indignation among english for among civilized people person of herald be held to be sacred bishop knight at once drew up force in order of battle men on foot be formed into wedge archer be placed on two flank of unmounted men at arm while cavalry prepared to charge a soon a opportunity offered army be preceded by standard of church trumpet on side sounded a came within range english archer poured flight of arrow among fleming advanced boldly to attack of foot men again again horseman charged down upon be unable to break solid line for time battle be doubtful english archer decided fate of day fleming although resisted firmly charge of men at arm be unable to sustain terrible continuous rain of arrow front line fell back a soon a did so second line wavered broke then bishop with knight men at arm charged furiously down upon battle be over fleming broke fled in wild disorder english pursued so hotly that entered dunkirk with here again again attempted to make stand speedily gave way before onslaught of english one distinguished in battle more than did priest monk who be fighting on side of bishop be said among others that must have mistaken vocation have entered army instead of church must have made right valiant knight english loss be four hundred that of fleming be very much heavier there died however among knight person of quality for rising be one of people a yet earl of flanders be waiting for king of england reply to message have sent by two knight from sluys english however considered that absence of horseman knight be due to fact that remembered what terrible havoc have be made among chivalry of france at crecy

built up platform raising ladder on found that reached to within foot of top now edgar said follow a quickly a can try ladder too heavily have broken once so wood can not be over strong then followed closely by albert men at arm ascended wall so intent be defender upon strife going on round sir hugh calverley that edgar be not noticed until putting hand upon wall vaulted over held sword between teeth betaking to fell so fiercely suddenly upon enemy that several be cut down rest recoiled so far that albert four men at arm be able to join before enemy rallied moment added to strength of party

defending against tremendous odds sir hugh be seriously wounded two three of knight lay dead beside have not be for arrival of reinforcement fight must speedily have terminated for english be so penned up against wall that there be footing for more to join suddenness of attack drove enemy back little distance enabled score of upon ladder to make way onto rampart bravely done sir hugh calverley said a leant against wall utterly exhausted by effort loss of blood moment later must have fallen have not albert sprung to side must save sir hugh at risk said to two of knight companion

english archer who advancing to edge of ditch sent shaft thick fast among town bell be clanging fiercely drum beating horn sounding a alarm spread that besieger have gained footing on wall great number of garrison must be seen pouring along street leading to threatened point have there be more ladder so reinforcement must have arrived more rapidly place might have be won a be be evident that success be impossible edgar party still gained ground slowly saw that albert be being pressed backwards fall back men shouted slowly keeping face to enemy odds be too heavy for foot by foot fighting silently obstinately english fell back until party joined that of albert at spot where wall have be won exulting foe pressed hotly upon edgar sword heavy long handled mace wielded by hal carter did

ask king to give direction of westminster monastery abbey at rate must not make worse hand of than bishop of norwich be doing of say that de beaulieu promised to send armour on first opportunity be indeed generous action for armour of prisoner be always property of captor armour be of great value must that must do something to show good knight that appreciate generosity have chain edgar said of course did not carry about when must have to fight be very heavy of finest workmanship must gladly send to must not albert in token of gratitude though costly a be be of much le value than armour must gladly add something of own account sir hugh said seeing that be in train one doe not like to be surpassed by foreign knight a to matter of ransom doe not trouble indeed seeing that surrendered to that felt that must not give protection have to risk life in getting away be reasonable that must remit in matter of armour case be different will add to chain reliquary be presented to by pedro of castile when saved life in fight at najarra told that contained nail of true cross that be brought to spain by spaniard of royal blood who be knight commander of temple know how far be true for a one get older one loses faith in monkish story of reliquary however casket be set with gem of value there be with parchment setting forth history at rate be gift be worthy of even prince acceptance will send to a token sir hugh calverley recognizes chivalrous behaviour to knight who be captured while covering carriage from rampart of ypres therefore sends gift to in honour courtesy together with gold

speedily sir hugh have dismounted after saluting other latter held out mailed hand to fleming sir robert de beaulieu said have heard of a brave honourable knight have in matter proved to be chivalrous generous one in thus rendering up spoil fairly won by without ransom be not custom to be outdone in generosity armour be of ordinary value a knight of mine be made prisoner while covering removal when insensible helpless feel that debt be mine a well a theirs have begged to give two chain a see of value of best italian work to add a token of esteem for casket be given to by don pedro of spain when rode with black prince to aid in struggle with don henry a will see by parchment attached to casket contains nail of true cross brought from palestine by spanish grandee who be knight commander of spanish branch of knight templar pray to accept not a part of ransom for knight armour a proof of esteem for one who have shown flower of knightly courtesy must be churlish sir hugh calverley for to refuse so noble gift thus courteously tendered will prize beyond in possession not only for own value holiness a gift of so noble famous knight a to chain pray to return to brave young knight never did see men who bore more gallantly sir edgar especially withstood with honour score of for time at last yielded not because be conquered to save further bloodshed be young may like enough day be

sir hugh committed to letter to one to council prisoner king said with laugh that have got yourselves killed must not have surprised that must surrender never entered mind two young knight coloured can not be said that sir albert surrendered edgar said seeing that be insensible from wound a for majesty a one of men at arm stood alone on wall of ypres surrounded by foe trust majesty will see that be wiser for to yield so to have opportunity of fighting again day under royal banner than to give away life uselessly assuredly assuredly young king said hastily did jest sir edgar for know so long a chance of victory remained must not lower sword however let see what stout knight say know already that doe not approve of way in war be being carried on indeed have thought that headstrong bishop must have disregarded sir hugh counsel embroiled with fleming whom regard a ally must not have placed at head of army for though be a bishop maintains church army not english army europe will assuredly hold responsible for doings cut with dagger silk bound roll of parchment together king read letter carefully when concluded said truly young sir have borne yourselves right gallantly well sir hugh calverley speaks strongly indeed in favour say that owes freedom if not life to now tell think that ypres will be taken fear not majesty edgar said thought that siege of oudenarde be worse

in low agitated voice of land castle messuage tenement etc of cliffe sir ralph leapt to foot princely gift albert land be four time a large a mine a have heard fair castle have be rising there for month past art sure that there be mistake there can be mistake in deed father can accept such gift at hand of fleming that can son without hesitation van voorden be known to be richest fleming in england have on various occasion lent vast sum to king council noble a gift be be one that can doubtless well afford have saved life of wife daughter may well feel grateful told when gave that suit of armour that be recognition of what felt owed that hoped in future to discharge debt more worthily now edgar let see what be in box edgar have be quietly untying knot of silk box be already open word on top be similar to in albert box please read albert said handing over parchment can decipher character better than can albert read through to be similar to mine said assigns land manor castle right privilege thereto appertaining of hundred of hoo bravo bravo sir ralph exclaimed noble gift fully equal to of albert fleming be very prince congratulate edgar with heart have heard that sir john evesham have sold estate comprise whole hundred of hoo year since in order to live at court none seemed to know who be purchaser heard too that large number of men have be employed in building castle on height looking down medway past upnor to chatham why lad if ever win to rank of knight banneret will have land enough to support dignity to take field with two three knight fair following of men at arm in train have gained good sum for ransom of prisoner never have luck to save life of flemish merchant family seems well nigh impossible edgar said must remember edgar that rich fleming be banker of prince in europe who have be in house know that live in comfort luxury such a none of noble posse must find money for king ransom pay beforehand tax of country if king can grant estate like to favourite not only king many of noble can do so be not strange that one of richest of fleming must make such gift to who have saved life without feeling that have in way overpaid service must be

be must not have missed for anything chapter xix well settled well well well mr ormskirk exclaimed when edgar brought story of have happened since have be away to end indeed surprise know that many knight fit out party go to war not so much for honour glory a for spoil ransom may gain that after crecy poictiers there be not single soldier came back laden with booty with rich jewel gold chain costly armour gathered from host of french noble who fell on field while knight who be fortunate enough to capture count earl prince gained ransom enabled to purchase estate live without occasion to go further to war during life never thought that must benefit by such chance a be to mind more honourable to save life than to take rejoice that have come to fortune not by slaying of enemy by saving life of man wife daughter who be rich enough to reward assuredly if man like mynheer van voorden have fallen into hand of count of flanders latter must have extracted from a price of freedom sum many time larger than have expended on purchase of two estate building of castle well edgar congratulate heartily can now ride to war when king banner be spread to wind do duty to country there will be occasion for to become mere knight adventurer class detest ever ready to sell sword to highest bidder to kill men against whom have cause of complaint a indifferently a butcher must strike down

have time to think of love making aline shrugged shoulder have better ask sir ralph mother for view about albert be not for maid to make own marriage valiant knight like can manage own affair
