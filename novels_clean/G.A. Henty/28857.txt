solitude a head master have heard nothing of what have passed be until sixth took place in library began to construe that attention be called to fact that something unusual have happened sudden hesitation blundering of first put on inability of next to to correct be too marked to be passed over raised gold rimmed eye glass to eye looked round dr litter be man standing six foot two in height stately in manner somewhat sarcastic in speech very prodigy in classical learning joint author of great treatise on us of greek particle searchingly looked from face to face round library can not said with curl of upper lip cold somewhat nasal tone set nerve in boy body twitching when heard raised in reproof really can not congratulate on appearance thought that sixth form of westminster be composed of gentleman seems to now a if consisted of number of singularly disreputable looking prize fighter what doe mean williams asked addressing captain face appears to have met with better usage than of others mean sir williams said that a party from field be coming back yesterday evening be attacked by bekies mean by rough got terribly knocked about when news came to be up college fellow have just come back from water so of course sallied out to rescue did not occur to williams that there be body called police whose duty be to interfere in disgraceful uproar of sort if have waited for police sir williams said school must not have be fit to take place in form again before end of term doe not appear to dr litter said that great many of be fit to take place at present can scarcely see norris eye suppose boy be barkley a sits in place that usually occupies otherwise must not have recognised smart robertson barker barret be nearly a bad suppose feel satisfied with yourselves boy consider that sort of thing be creditable to to mind be simply disgraceful there want to hear more at present suppose whole school be in same state of who can see have better go back to school prepare demosthenes who can not have best go back to boarding house up college let doctor be sent for to see if anything can be done for doctor have indeed already be sent for for seven eight of younger boy have be so seriously knocked about kicked that be unable to leave bed for rest doctor must hing fight be not uncommon at westminster in day number of order for beef steak nearest butcher have received on previous evening have fairly astonished indeed have not be for prompt application of to face very few of party from field must have be able to find way up school unless have be led by comrade at westminster there be hour school before breakfast when nine o'clock struck boy poured out dr litter under master held council together be disgraceful business dr litter said looking a be wont at distant object far over head of others there be general murmur of assent boy seem to have be much to blame mr richards suggested in cheerful tone habitual to from what can hear seems to have be planned thing people gathered round gate before left field attacked without provocation there must have be provocation somewhere mr richards if not yesterday then day before day before dr litter said twirling eye glass by ribbon whole host of people gather to assault forty fifty boy without provocation sort of thing must not occur again see that can punish one boy without punishing whole school at rate for next week field must be stopped will write to commissioner of police asking that when again go to vincent square policeman may be put on duty not of course to accompany to interfere at once if see sign of repetition of business will request must there be fighting not belonging to school who commit assault may be taken before magistrate own boy can punish be of boy seriously injured do think hope not sir mr richards said there be three four in house there be ten at mr sargent two at carr who have gone on sick list sent for doctor may have seen by time seemed to have be knocked down kicked there be four of junior at college in infirmary mr wire who be in special charge of queen scholar put in have not heard about last night be in ignorance of what have taken place until list of who have gone into infirmary be put into hand then heard from williams what have taken place be very unpleasant dr litter said in weary tone of voice a if boy be problem far more difficult to be mastered than that greek author afforded that one can not trust boy to keep out of mischief for hour of course with small boy sort of thing be to be expected that young fellow like williams other senior sixth town boy who be on eve of going up to university must so far forget be very surprising even at university doctor litter mr richards said with passing thought of own experience town gown row take place worse dr litter replied worse of course there be wild young men at university dr litter be scarcely necessary to say have never be wild study of greek particle have absorbed thought why continued young men must condescend to take part in disgraceful affray of kind pass understanding mr wire will inform williams for rest of week boy be to go to field so saying strode off in direction of own door next to archway for conversation have taken place at foot of step leading into school from little dean yard there be grumbling when head master decision be known be nevertheless felt that be wise one that be better to allow feeling to calm down before again going through westminster between dean yard field for not even most daring must have cared for repetition of struggle several inquiry be made a to lad who have brought news of fight so enabled reinforcement to arrive in time have be discovered handsome subscription must have be got up to reward timely service one knew anything about following week when cricket be resumed molestation be offered better part of working class who inhabited neighbourhood be indeed strongly in favour of boy liked to see bright young face a passed home from cricket pluck too with have fought be highly appreciated so strong feeling be expressed against attack made upon that rough element deemed better to abstain from further

power altogether held on to edge of ice cast despairing look towards shore then gradually head disappeared under water frank be already half way towards few stride have taken through willow water swam with vigorous stroke through floating fragment to end of line of broken water then too disappeared for moment dead silence reigned through crowd when two head appeared above water together ringing

thing be a bad a frank said doe other replied emphatically what with injins want of food water fatigue journey across plain will want man to make journey four mean to get through be bound to do a for crowd see here god help do mean to go with one of caravan start alone there be lot going on to morrow will join may be of use for best part of be better than flock of sheep four good hand may keep out of mischief expect will have to push on by before journey be over be intending to go on to morrow also frank said hope wo mind giving instruction in way of wilderness be own altogether new to right young fellow will see on road if like to chum up with may for like look seems to be one of right sort frank said that must gladly chum with if must allow next morning at daybreak having said adieu to mr willcox saddled horse loaded up pony moved across to spot where new acquaintance be encamped be preparing for start have good riding horse while two baggage animal carried provision for party caravan intended to accompany be already far out on plain be off in good time frank said did not think must manage to move till midday more must one of hunter said chap a be bossing team moved off yesterday evening got mile out of camp so be able to start right off first thing morning in few minute be on horseback riding at easy pace for sake of baggage horse overtook caravan in two hour consisted of fourteen waggon four five light cart with tilt over waggon be drawn by ox having six eight ten according to size weight men walked by side of cattle greater part of woman child trudged along behind waggon while few with baby be seated within from time to time one of men boy must set up song must join in chorus one of be ringing out in air when hunter joined poor critturs eldest of hunter who be called abe by others said be a light hearted a if war going to camp meeting know what be afore party rode on to head of waggon where ox be led by man who be regarded a head of party have at one time be hunter have married settled down on farm two son nearly grown up walked by side have be chosen a leader by rest a being only one of party who have previous knowledge of plain danger difficulty well mate abe said told two day ago thought that must go on with lot here be say a how will go way with will depend upon circumstance at rate will stay with ye for bit now proposal be will hitch three baggage horse on behind waggon tell off one of boy to look after will hunt a go along what meat there be will be for service of camp if supply with meat will only be fair that supply with flour tea be bargain man said bring in meat will supply with everything else need tell how glad be to have with five extra rifle may make difference if be attacked have got about twenty rifle in camp ai much a with woman child count up to nigh sixty soul none of here except have have experience of indian way be fixed then abe said at rate need not be afraid of surprise so long a be with addition to party gave great satisfaction to whole caravan of flour bacon have ample store to last upon long journey prospect of supply of fresh meat be exceedingly welcome still more be thought that hunter must be able to warn against surprise by indian must in case of worst aid in defence hunter be equally satisfied supply be quite insufficient for journey be now free from necessity of accommodating pace to of baggage horse progress must indeed be slower than must have be have journeyed alone time be matter of importance to even in matter of indian surprise be better off than must have be have be alone in case of meeting marauder must have abandoned baggage animal prospect of flight defence must have be poor have met with large body when alone whereas force with caravan must defend waggon against even resolute attack of redskin there be occasion for hunter to set out in pursuit of game for first day two a supply of fresh meat have be brought from omaha therefore rode with caravan making acquaintance of various member one of woman have volunteered to cook for thus when encamped on bank of small stream have only to attend to watering of animal while meal be preparing walked about in camp gave many hint to woman a to best way of preparing fire be gratefully received for emigrant be wholly unaccustomed to cooking without usual appliance effort in many case have be very clumsy unsuccessful be surprised to find that by digging trench in direction from wind be blowing covering over with sod must get draught to fire equal to must obtain in grate while by building low wall of sod close to leeward of fire prevented flame from being driven away concentrated upon pot kettle doe not matter for to night abe said to leader for good many night to come if be must begin to morrow to make 'em arrange waggon in proper form same a if be in injin country ai no more trouble there be nothing like beginning right way be right man said to morrow night will pitch in good form for time there will be occasion for cattle to be driven in night longer have to graze better be so abe said will want condition for bad country further on following day hunter left camp early there be little chance of finding game anywhere near line be following for wild animal must have be scared away by constantly passing caravan after riding for ten mile began to keep watchful eye over country although flat to eye be really slightly undulating proceeding at easy pace rode on for upwards of hour then dick one of hunter suddenly drew rein what be dick abe asked illustration deer hunt on prairie saw horn over there to left be mistaken hunter said will see anyhow abe said fortunately be down wind now have better stop behind time young fellow watch in moment four men dismounted threw rein on horse neck signal horse on plain know to be order that be not to move away animal at once began cropping grass for short distance men walked forward then a neared brow over dick declared have seen horn went down on four finally when close to brow on stomach very slowly drew along frank looked on with greatest attention interest presently saw halt while abe proceeded alone lifted up head slightly immediately laid down again while other three crawled up close to there be moment pause then gun be thrust forward slightly raised moment later four rifle flashed men sprang to foot disappeared over brow frank rode forward at full speed to spot arrived there just in time to see number of deer dashing at full speed far across plain while four hunter be gathered round three dead stag in hollow hunter shot have told two have fired at same animal bullet hole being close to other behind shoulder dick be right see abe said be lucky caught sight of horn for might not have come upon herd to day now will make way on to camping ground can go easy for will be there long before team horse be brought up deer placed upon hunter then mounted took way in direction of spot where caravan must encamp for night understand how find way now because sun be up frank said can not understand how must do on cloudy day across flat country like without landmark be easier to do than be to explain abe said in first place there be wind most always blow here one only have to keep in certain quarter if there ai wind there be grass bush if look at bush will see that most turn little from direction in wind generally blow grass be in seed droop over same way then in course there be general direction of valley of little stream of be thing one go by at first get to come natural what call by instinct one know somehow be way to go without looking for sign will get to in time if be long enough on plain at present watch form of bush lay of grass 'cause see in hunting might get separated might miss way if must do so ai sure of direction fire gun three time a quick a can load if be in hearing will fire gun in reply come to will soon get to know sign of country if will pay attention keep eye skinned arrived at stream fixed upon for camping ground early in afternoon point at caravan must cross be plain enough for waggon travelled by same line trail be strongly marked by rut of wheel where ground be soft by broken bush trampled herbage saddle be taken off horse be allowed to graze at will of hunter be too well trained to wander far frank horse be certain to keep with others late in afternoon waggon arrived have be long march of more than twenty mile men beast be alike tired woman child have during latter part of journey ridden in waggon there be general feeling of satisfaction at sight of hunter spoil at blazing fire over portion of meat be already roasting ox be unharnessed watered waggon be ranged six on side two across one end other end being left open for convenience across light cart be to be drawn at night deer be skinned cut up divided among various family in proportion to number for two month caravan moved forward without adventure hunter kept well provided with game be now very plentiful very disquieting rumour be afloat along road be brought down by express rider who carried mail across plain for whose accommodation small station be provided twenty thirty mile apart a be placed where water be procurable be generally selected a camping ground by emigrant tale of indian foray have at first be little more than rumour be now confirmed express rider reported that indian be out in large number that many attack have be made upon party of emigrant sometimes successfully involving massacre of soul in caravan be still distance from scene of attack a indian ranged over whole plain must not be said that be beyond risk of assault acting under hunter advice caravan now moved in much closer order waggon advancing two abreast so that must be formed in position for defence at shortest notice rifle be always kept loaded strapped on outside of waggon in readiness for instant use frank have by time become adept in hunting though still very far behind companion in skill with rifle be able to make fair contribution towards provisioning of camp hunter now divided into two party three going out in search of game on one side of line of march two on other thus acted a scout on side must be able to bring in word must suspicious sign be observed several small herd of buffalo have be met with sufficient number killed to provide party with meat for time to come frank have never passed more enjoyable time than two month of travel air be clear bright exhilarating long day spent in saddle excitement of chase seemed to quicken pulse to fill with new feeling of strength life appetite be prodigious enjoyed roughly cooked meal round blazing fire of evening a have never enjoyed food before country be be true for most part monotonous with long low undulation bare sweep unbroken by tree bush there be always something new interesting to be seen for frank be fond of natural history habit way of wild creature of prairie be full of interest for companion although taciturn when on horseback engaged in scouting country in hunting be full of anecdote a sat round fire of evening frank heard many story of wild adventure with indian in chase when returned early to camp there be plenty of amusement in wandering about among waggon watching various group engaged at work a unconcernedly a if have be still in little farm among settlement instead of on plain with month of toilsome dangerous journey before of woman cooked while others mended clothes of husband child while men attended to ox made such repair a be needed to waggon harness a for child life suited admirably to be continual picnic without school lesson yet too have share of work for a soon a waggon halted save very little one started at once over plain to search for dried buffalo dung a be called chip formed staple of fire for wood be very scarce that in neighbourhood of camping ground be always at stream water hole have long since be cleared off by traveller who have preceded chip afforded excellent fuel burning with fierce steady glow making fire something like afforded by well dried peat source of fuel be bone lay in many place scattered pretty thickly sometimes marked spot where long before party of indian have come upon herd of buffalo sometimes be remains of cattle of caravan have preceded be often quite fresh herd of coyote stripping off flesh of animal fell by way leaving nothing in course of day two after death bare bone whenever caravan came upon skeleton upon line of march men broke up flung bone into one of waggon for night fire sometimes a got well on in journey came to patch of soap weed vegetable of soft pulpy nature grows to considerable height dy from bottom retaining greenness of appearance long after stem have become brown withered burn freely with brilliant flame woman of party rejoiced when clump of soap weed be discovered be always occasion of general wash a by immersing of in water have property of soap except that did not make lather distinguishes real article in place where soap weed be not to be found chip be scarce hunter did best to supply fuel must generally bring home large bundle of wood upon such of horse a be not carrying game child greatest delight be when camp happened to be pitched near prairie dog town be never weary of watching antic of funny little creature of town be of considerable extent ground within circle being quite bare of herbage from scratching constant scampering of little foot covered thickly with mound marked entrance to innumerable hole prairie dog be about size of rabbit seemed to frank from quick jerking motion habit of sitting up on hind leg to resemble squirrel more than other animal be a much interested in traveller a latter be with almost mound having occupant sitting up watching inquisitively there be four five dog with caravan until novelty have passed off became convinced of utter futility of chase dog exhausted in endeavour to capture prairie dog seemed to feel absolute enjoyment in exasperating dog sitting immovable until latter be within few yard of then suddenly disappearing like flash of lightning down hole popping head out again resuming position on top a soon a dog have dashed off in direction prairie dog be not only occupant of town with apparently on term of great friendship lived colony of little owl sharing abode sitting with on hillock there be also third specie of inhabitant presence of caused strict order to be given to child not to wander over ground be rattlesnake of on sunny afternoon many must be seen basking on sand heap yes always

go to sleep game most commonly met with be black tailed white tailed deer be generally met with in party of from six to twelve be usually stalked although sometimes by dividing taking wide circle must manage to ride down get within shot must seldom be done with antelope ran in much larger herd be so suspicious watchful that there be getting within shot while once in motion must leave horse behind with ease only way in must get must be by acting upon curiosity one two of hunter must dismount crawl through grass until within three four hundred yard of herd then must lie on back wave leg in air wave coloured blanket a lay concealed in grass herd must stop grazing look on curiously gradually approach nearer nearer to investigate strange phenomenon until came well within shot when hunter must leap to foot send unerring bullet among must hardly believe now peter said one day when frank have brought down two fine antelope by manoeuvre that coyote be just a much up to trick a be have got chance with deer when be once moving although sometimes may pick up fawn few day old stag have got injured when want deer meat just act same game a have be doing over over again have seen at trick two

something to do keep out of mischief talking of buffalo abe began a hunter be sitting round fire on evening of hunt reminds that be so very far from har spot that rube be nearly wiped out by ute ten year ago rube be young chap then have not be long out on plain war hunting with party of cheyenne have be with well nigh summer one day war in pursuit of buffalo be plentiful then think be plentiful now must see ten herd then for one see now be going expect in twenty year that man might ride across plain never catch sight of hump if gold turn out to be a rich a say there will be hundred of thousand of people cross plain like enough settlement be formed right across continent however there war plenty of herd ten year ago have come upon big herd be chasing have singled out old bull have pushed right into herd after rube be pretty close to well came up to bull put rifle ball between rib herd have rather separated a got amongst making way for right left a rode after bull a fell reined in horse looked round not cheyenne be to be seen five minute afore have be hanging on herd sending arrow in up to feather among buffalo now not soul be to be seen may guess staggered say to rube out rube there be something up a sure a fate ' well have scarcely spoken afore saw big party of injins come charging down across rear 'utes say 'by thunder be after cheyenne fling flat on horse rube get into herd ' buffalo war only fifty yard away yet yer may be sure spurred up pretty sharp till got up to seed at once be only chance horse war blowed for have have sharp chase afore caught herd there be chance of getting away from ute in open plain soon caught up herd charged in among brute be packed so close together that must hardly make room for managed to wedge in next to snuffed roared war too pressed by behind to do much by shouting waving hat managed to keep clear space three four yard on side of time war lying down on horse neck there war fear that one must see in midst of sea of tossing cattle war afraid must have caught sight of afore got among cussed for having fired that last shot must have heard must have known that of have seen coming must be somewhere among herd raised head little at last took look round sure enough there be dozen ute coming up behind herd put spur again into horse catching up old bull in front of progged with bowie knife rube did same to beast next to gave roar plunged on ahead through mass followed close to heel be tight work can tell for buffalo on side war touching one kept going about length behind beast next to so that horse shoulder war just behind shoulder of buffalo a know buffalo have got neck to speak of so although gave savage thrust with horn must get at horse beast be frightened near out of life war well broken managed to keep in hand thing be most afraid of be that must be knocked off leg in case must be trampled to death in minute a leaned forward kept one hand fixed on neck of buffalo next shouted to rube to do same so a must make shift to jump on to buffalo back if horse fell tell be beginning to fear that must see way out of with in middle ute yelling behind herd war fairly mad with fright there war saying where must go to for know herd of buffalo when fairly stampeded will go clean over precipice hundred yard high pile up dead at foot till there be not one left war bad fix bet for war sure that ute war after not after buffalo for kept on though must soon have killed a many of herd a wanted be may be four in afternoon when chase commenced so went on till be dark buffalo war going nigh a fast a when started horse must scarce keep leg be sure must run much longer so say to rube must get out of else will be done for ' so set to work probing buffalo with knife again started on ahead a hard a must bursting way through crowd followed close behind keeping up scare until find in front of herd then spurred horse on dashed out in front done a horse be knew have got to go for with herd coming like thunder upon heel be death to stop swerved away to right took hour afore war clear of front of herd went few hundred yard further then drew rein rube horse fell dead a stopped mine be worth much more for hour must hear herd rushing along then have passed have got out of biggest fix war pleasant position there war out on plain with only one horse between so done up that must put one foot afore other where cheyenne war there be saying band might have be wiped out by ute might have got away at rate there be counting on ute who have followed herd must be sure to be on trail in morning must follow night a long a herd ran when buffalo war fairly tired out must lay down ute must see then a war there then must set out upon back trail skirting along side of line trampled by herd until came upon trail dead horse be sign a must see mile away so be clear that must foot a soon a must gave horse hour rest did a much good a for can tell war pretty well used up drove afore until after six hour walking came to stream went up for hour then filled hunting shirt with stone fastened on horse then drove off what did put stone on back for frank asked to make ute think a be carrying double of load be about weight of man horse be so tired that staggered a walked so a must see track must see ours must naturally come to conclusion a war on back war likely a critter must go far before laid down perhaps not more than mile must do for went back few hundred yard in stream then struck off across prairie same side a have come from taking care to make a little sign a possible ute must be riding along by side of stream looking for horse print chance war that must see ours when came up to horse found out trick must gallop back again at least half of must go up stream half must take back track see a went up must have trampled across track must find mighty hard work to pick up again footed day prospect war pleasant one nearest settlement be nigh thousand mile away have horse dare fire gun for fear of bringing ute down upon have made up mind to strike for cheyenne country that being nearest where must expect to find friend for two day tramped on third day war sitting by side of stream eating prairie dog a have trapped when rube stopped eating suddenly said 'listen threw down put ear to ground sure enough must hear gallop of horse 'injins say chuck lot of wet sand gravel over fire be fortunately small one knew in course if came close way a must see if passed at distance must not notice then rube bounded into water laid down close under high bank where grass grew long drooped over to water so a to cover head heard redskin coming nearer nearer stopped at stream quarter of mile so above listened can tell for sound of going on again such luck after quarter of hour knew a be going to camp there felt pretty thankful a be late in afternoon for guessed in first place a must light fire cook food so none of war likely to be coming down way until be after dark waited waited till got quite dark then followed stream down for four five mile then took to plain again be three day afore fell in with party of cheyenne seemed a how most of have be with have be killed by ute others have taken news home whole tribe have be turned out war pretty well done up chief dismounted two of men put on horse set off at once knew pretty well line that party a be following have taken next night saw fire of camp bet not one of went home to tell tale be narrow escape indeed abe frank said war that war lucky that war late afore hunt began if have be early in day nothing must have saved onless of course horse have be fresh faster than of ute then must have made straight away instead of getting into herd seem to go a fast a horse abe seemed to keep up quite easily with bull shot yes for burst horse be faster than buffalo when once get going on downright stampede will tire out horse go well nigh a fast too tell have to be pretty spry even if be well mounted when downright big herd well on stampede come on be terrible sight make one tingle can tell especially a horse be pretty nigh mad with fear must be a bad a prairie fire worse lad ever so much worse can see prairie fire fifty mile away more at night ever so much have plenty of time to set grass afire ahead of clear ground afore come up though doe travel when wind be blowing much faster than horse can gallop have seen go thirty mile hour flame just leaping out ahead of setting grass alight hundred yard before main body of fire came up tell be terrible sight when grass have just dried be breast high a say there ai no cause to be afraid if do keep head just pull up band of grass couple of foot wide light ahead of wind naturally take away from look sharp with blanket legging to beat down prevent working back agin wind across bit of ground have stripped a go widens out right left have soon got wide strip cleared in front of in course go on to a long a can help not till be drove by other fire coming up give time to cool bit if must go on soon owing to being pressed from fire have lit working round agin wind a will do if grass be very dry best plan be to cut up legging bit of hide have got with rawer better wrap round horse foot leg ai often necessary to do a take long for ash to cool enough so a to stand on fortunately bottom with good grass have be found close at hand to place where encamped when caravan proceeded draft ox be better for two day rest will have to begin to look out pretty sharp for injin sign abe said a started early next morning fresh meat be good can do without there be enough pork jerked meat in waggon to last pretty nigh across plain be getting where may expect injins in earnest might in course have met anywhere a know caravan have got to come across ground stand to reason a must take trouble to travel very far east to meet 'em say a wo knock down stag now agin if come across le firing better have be hunting up till now must calculate that for rest of journey be going to be hunted if want scalp taken not to talk of woman child have got to look out pretty spry reckon can beat off in anything like fair fight be provided have got time to get ready before be on depends on whether do have time not illustration chapter xi how dick lost scalp two three day after have moved from last halting place when be sitting at fire one evening abe have be telling yarn of adventure said when have finished about closest thing a know be that adventure dick thar have dick take off thar wig of yourn hunter put hand to head lifted at once cap made of skin hair beneath showing to frank astonishment head without vestige of hair presenting appearance of strange scar mottled with deep purple a if be result of terrible burn see have be scalped hunter said suppose noticed few people do see never take off fur cap night day so that one can see a wear wig there be nought to be ashamed of in abe said for be a honourable scalp a ever man got do tell story dick know a well a do hunter replied ai good at talking well will tell then abe said seeing know almost a much about a dick doe affair occurred very year after what have be telling about dick be attached a hunter scout to fort charles be at time one of furthest west of station there be fifty infantry thirty cavalry there little enough too for war just on edge of dacota country dacotas be powerful tribe be one of most restless troublesome lot know several strong party of troop have be surprised cut to piece by a to settlement one born fool must dream of settling within reach of never must quite make out why wanted to put fort down so close to seeing a there war settlement to protect within hundred fifty mile suppose wiseacre at washington have sort of idea that redskin must be afraid to make excursion to settlement with fort in rear just a if must make sweep of five hundred mile if took into head come back into country on other side just at time there be trouble with hatchet be buried used to come into fort sell skin fur to trader there for tobacco bead after affair be telling ye of rube went back for spell to settlement then took fancy to hunt on line after knocking about for time found ourselves at fort charles be where met dick for first time commander of fort be chap named white captain have with wife daughter worse kind of man for commander of frontier station must hardly find be not bad soldier be well liked by men have doubt if have be fighting agin other white men must have done well enough never seemed to have idee what injin nature be like be never likely to learn first place despised now know redskin ai to be despised may hate may say be cussed lot of rascal thief there ai despising one a doe be sure to have cause to repent sooner later there be le reason with dacotas for have cut up stronger body of troop than there be at fort charles without letting soul escape then partly because captain despised suppose be always hurting feeling now chief be chief man who can bring three hundred horseman into field whether be redskin white be man to whom certain respect must be paid captain white never seemed to see just treated one redskin like just a if war dirt beneath foot well a told have with wife daughter wife be too fine lady for frontier fort still be not badly liked a to daughter there war man in fort must have died for war about fifteen year old a pretty a flower war always bright merry with kind word to soldier a rode past on pretty white mustang dick here worshipped like rest of if got particular good skin anything else if thought must like must put by for used in merry way to call scout well one day black dog one of most powerful chief of dacotas rode into fort with twenty of brave just a came in queen may a called came galloping up on mustang leapt like bird from saddle at door of commander house where father be standing war standing next to so saw black dog eye fall on a long a stood talking there to father never took off then said something to brave a be sitting on horse next to 'cuss ' dick said to must see hold on rifle tighten 'what doe look at queen may like for mark word abe trouble will come of be not long before trouble did come for hour later dacota rode out of fort with men in great wrath complaining that captain white have not received a chief that dignity be insulted war like enough that captain white be not a ceremonious a must have be to great chief for a told war short in way with redskin question if harm must have come of if have be that black dog eye fell on gal believe that there then made up mind to carry off did see redskin in camp for time then rumour be brought in by scout that there war going to be trouble with that council have be held that war decided hatchet must be dug up again captain white made light of affair be good soldier war to be caught napping so extra sentry be put on a rube did belong to fort of course war independent went away hunting must sometimes be away for week together one day when war forty mile from fort came upon trail of large number of redskin going east guessed a there must be nigh two hundred of might in course have be going hunting did think a be so sartainly have woman with have be travelling fast guessed trail be three day old thought have best push on straight to fort to let know about when got thar found be too late on morning of day after have started scout have arrived with news that strong war party of dacotas be on way to settlement captain white at once mounted infantry on horse with cavalry set out in pursuit leaving fort in charge of young officer with twenty four men just after nightfall there be sound of horseman approaching officer thinking be captain returning ordered gate of stockade to be left open in moment place be full of redskin soldier tried to fight be use war cut down only one man making escape in darkness at daybreak captain with troop rode into fort dick who have be with have when party be returning gone out scouting on own account have come across back track of redskin moment have brought in news horse be re saddled again party started back have gone nearly sixty mile day before be not until morning that utterly exhausted weary got within sight of fort then saw a war too late not roof be to be seen above stockade light smoke rising everywhere showed a fire have done rode into camp like madman there lay comrade killed scalped there be body of mr white servant nigger labourer trader clerk of who have be left behind in camp except captain little daughter of there be sign rube arrived hour later just a soldier who have escaped have come in be telling how came about war terrible scene can tell captain be nigh mad with grief men be boiling over with rage if must have got at dacotas then must have fought if there have be twenty to one against dick war nowhere to be seen man said that have caught fresh horse have broken rope stampeded through gate while massacre be going on that have ridden away on on indian trail if horse have be fresh captain must have started in pursuit at once man be burning to go be lucky a must for if have have doubt whole lot must have be wiped out by dacotas however there be possibility of moving for at least couple of day for horse war altogether used up after march so have time to get cool on afternoon captain who be in council with two officer who remained sent for rube asked opinion a to what be best to be done say at once that there be nothing 'you have lost nigh third of force ' say 'and have got little over forty left if be to go up into dacota country must get ambushed to certainty must have thousand of perhaps two thousand down on odds must be too great captain must be done besides even if licked tell a chance of doing so must be mighty small must disperse in direction then meet fight agin must be nearer getting daughter than war before 'if ask advice must be that must send back to nearest fort for more men that must at once get up stockade where have be burnt down for there be saying when will be attacked again tell captain that to lead party here into dacota country must mean sartin death for ' mad a captain be to go in search of daughter saw that be right indeed concluded have made up mind must hing before sent for only hoped suppose a might give sort of hope ' be afraid what say be true ' say 'at rate must wait till dick scout return will tell way have gone what be strength ' by soldier have buried dead just outside stockade have built temporary wall for there be stick of timber within mile across gap in fence at rube whose horse war fresh started for nearest fort four day afterwards got back with forty more horse soldier found that dick have not come back made up mind a have gone under when be away have heard that redskin have attacked settlement in dozen different place that there be doubt general injin war have broken out officer at fort where went to be major be bigger place than fort charles be sort of outlying post have in course told about captain daughter being carried off sent up letter with soldier to captain saying how sorry be to hear of loss sent up forty men ordered that unless captain white have received intelligence must in opinion justify undertaking expedition into indian country with so small force a must command be at once to evacuate place fall back with force on settlement a position be quite untenable man be needed for defence of settler when captain got order walked up down by hisself for four five minute yer see war hard choice for a father be longing to go in search of child a soldier saw that must be risking whole force under command if did so that at time when man be needed at settlement at last order be given that troop must take back track to settlement on following evening illustration escape of captain daughter captain told officer that must wait till then to give horse of men who have arrived with time to rest know in heart wanted to wait in hope of dick arriving with news next day at four in afternoon men war beginning to saddle horse when sentry suddenly gave cry of 'injins injins ' in moment man seized carbine sword shoved bridle on horse head buckled up jumped into saddle there be occasion for order climbed up on to stockade for country be pretty nigh dead flat lookout have be burnt with hut sure enough there in distance war horseman coming across plain war straggling not many of must not make head tail of war injins sure enough for even at distance must tell that by figure then saw a there be more of coming behind idea suddenly struck 'ride captain shouted 'ride with men for life be chasing one ' there war necessity for captain white to give order there be rush to gate a fast a must get through started out at full gallop rube dropped over stockade for critter war picketed outside did wait to saddle may guess pulled up rope jumped on to back galloped on war soon by side of captain white who be riding a if be mad must see little plainer now say suddenly there be white horse in front by gum ' sort of hoarse cry came from captain spurred horse agin although critter be going at best speed war two mile from yet must soon make out a white horse be bit ahead then came eight ten injins in clump hundred more straggling out behind seemed to a war going slow a if horse war dead beat what scared most be to see a clump of injins war gaining on two ahead of one of whom felt sure now be captain daughter other guessed be dick captain saw too for gave strange sort of cry bey god ' said 'they will overtake war still mile from when saw suddenly man in front chap dick here part sudden from white horse wheel straight round go right back at injins separated a came to saw two fall from horse wind presently brought sound of crack of pistol there war 'colts in day knew that dick carried brace of double barrelled pistol in holster then others closed round there be sort of confusion must see tomahawk waving blow given when be over there war four injins out of eight to be seen on horse white horse have gained hundred yard while fight be going on injins saw that war coming on like hurricane so turned horse galloped back again three minute later captain daughter rode up war a white a death captain have just time to leap off catch a fainted dead away rest of did stop bet just gave cheer on went dacotas got lesson day a will remember a long a be tribe horse be so dead beat have scarcely gallop in while ours be fresh think ten of varmint got away did draw rein till be dark next morning counted two hundred fifteen dead redskin on plain first thing in morning rube rode back to where fight began to give dick burial looked about must find there be black dog with one of bullet through forehead two others shot through body one with skull stove in with blow from dick rifle be lying there with stock broken so supposed captain have have carried to fort rode on there when got there found a be alive seems at moment captain daughter recovered from faint insisted on going back with captain to see if dick be alive found well nigh dead have got arrow through body two desperate clip with tomahawk have be scalped be still breathing there war one else nigh for man have ridden on in pursuit managed somehow between to get upon captain horse captain rode in saddle held in arm while daughter led horse back to fort there dressed wound put wet cloth to head watched night in morning be quite delirious fortunately captain considered that after way have licked redskin day before there be absolute necessity for evacuating fort so troop cut turf made hut party be sent off to nearest timber to bring in bough for roof there stopped in six week dick be about again with wig on head will wonder whar got wig from seeing a sort of thing ai product of plain be wearing own hair among fust of injins overtook killed be chap with dick scalp hanging at girdle when be known a be alive searched found one of soldier who be fond of collecting bird skin such like just preserved in same way when dick be able to go out again presented with own scalp so if one say to dick a ai wearing own hair dick can tell be liar lor how grateful that gal be to dick never be particular good looking young fellow be improved by scrimmage believe if have axed must have given up everything settled down a hunter wife dick growled angry denial well mate may be not quite that war very nigh be downright pretty to see way hung about looked after just for world a if have be mother sick child captain too did know how to make enough of dick a for men must have done anything for for having saved life of queen may heard three four year afterwards a married young officer who be in command of horse soldier at next fort tell frank said how did dick manage to get away from indian abe said 'd better tell seeing a concerning that part of business know more do now dick speak out there ai much to tell dick said gruffly taking pipe from mouth directly a got back to camp found have gone seemed to a have got to follow eye lighting on loose horse soon managed to catch critter shifting saddle to started a may guess there war difficulty in following trail have ridden all night though knew there be chance of being pursued about fifty mile from fort came upon first halting place have lit fire cooked food there have waited hour ash be still warm guess have left about four hour afore arrived so went on more carefully knowing that if threw away life there be chance of recovering gal guessed by direction be taking be going to black dog village after going bit further on trail to make sure turned off went round mile in case must have left one to see if war followed knew where village be for have be hunting near camped out on plain for night next day rode to within five mile of village be among hill left horse in wood where there be water taking rifle pistol went forward on foot to village arrived there after dark a expected found hull place astir big fire be blazing in centre on pole near hung scalp have taken be dancing round howling yelling did see sign of gal a there be two redskin with rifle hanging about door of wigwam next to of chief have doubt be there wigwam be in centre of village there be lot of old squaw gal about so must not for life of see way of stealing out next night went back to camp watched more thought on more difficult seemed second night catched injin boy who be wandering outside camp choked so that must hollo carried off when got far enough away questioned found that in two day there be to be grand feast black dog be then going to take white gal a squaw so saw a there be time to be lost strapped up indian boy tied to tree then went back to village time gal be sitting at door of tent crept up behind cut slit in skin got inside a expected there be one in there squaw a be watching be outside so crept up close to entrance say to 'hush move scout dick be here ' gave little tremble when began then sat a still a mouse say see plan for getting away secret be watched altogether too close only plan be to make race for there ai many horse on plain a can beat mustang of yours know can ride barebacked do take head of maize now walk across to where be picketed feed pat then to morrow morning early do same wo be watching very closely for will think be only going to do same a to night have put open knife down behind cut rope jump on back ride straight will join at bottom of valley may overtake wo hurt if do catch will just bring back here again will be worse off than be now will try ' gal nodded crept away out of sight few minute afterwards saw going along with ear of maize to where horse be tied up two indian followed at little distance walked across so natural that think have suspicion fed horse talked to petted then went back to village next morning before daylight mounted horse rode to mouth of valley quarter of mile from village hour after daylight heard yell almost directly afterwards sound of horse hoof in full gallop rode out along came a hard a horse must go three four mounted indian war just coming into other end of valley four hundred yard away 'all right queen may have got fine start say then galloped along together too fast ' told 'it ai speed a will win race there be long hundred mile between fort must keep ahead of varmint for mile two then will settle down ' for first five six mile have to ride fast for redskin tried speed of horse to utmost none of gained anything on indeed widened gap by good bit see at first only thought be wild scheme on part of gal first a started jumped on first horse came to hand be till saw that found be got up thing one of first lot galloped back with news by time alarm be spread chase really taken up in earnest be good mile away mile be long start black dog of best mounted brave rode too hard at first ef have only have short start must have catched perhaps mile start be too much to be made up by rush so black dog must have known reckon be too mad at first to calculate by hard riding best mounted brave got within mile of when war about ten mile from village by time a may guess steam be out of horse while have be riding at steady gallop first party have started have now tailed away be a far back a chief be safe to be long chase now felt pretty sure a gal must escape for mustang be beautiful critter captain have given long price for besides be carrying weight to speak of did feel so sure about for though horse be first class one have over over again when out hunting showed a fast a out there might be a good one better among redskin for anything knew when be fairly out on plain must see that pretty nigh whole tribe of redskin have joined in chase at first must make out why for although be wonderful for bottom of redskin horse ai much for speed many of must never have hoped to have come up with when thought over reckoned that seeing have joined gal might have thought have brought news that captain with soldier from fort be coming up behind expect be why chief brave rode so fast at first know a ever passed longer day than went at steady gallop always keeping just about mile ahead of redskin sometimes jumped off horse ran alongside of with hand on saddle for mile to ease bit gal rode splendidly mustang have beautiful easy pace set a if be in chair for first fifty mile think redskin gained yard on war pressing horse more than be for be question only of last now then little by little must see that small party be leaving rest gaining slowly upon dar press horse further began to give gal instruction a to course must keep 'what doe matter dick ' asked 'when be here to guide ' 'but may be with time say 'it air quite possible that redskin will overtake twenty mile afore get to fort critter can keep ahead of easy be going nigh a light now a when started when get bit closer to must go on alone ' sha leave ' say got into scrape to save be not going to run away leave to be killed if be taken will be taken too 'that must be foolish thing ' say 'and cruel one ef like to put so have risked life to save just a have risked score of time before on plain ef time have come will be comfort to to know a have saved ef be taken too must feel that have just chucked life away besides have got to think of captain now that mother have gone have got to be comfort to so see miss ef be to get taken wilful must be doing bad turn to yerself to to yer father ' be long time before spoke again then did say anything about what have be talking of began to ask whether thought be sure to find soldier still at fort in course must say for sartin to cheer up talked hopeful about though thought be likely enough have fallen back on settlement did long spell of running now got more hopeful for injins did gain anything to speak of war going very slow now for horse be pretty nigh beat have crossed two three stream by way at have have few mouthful of water be till be within ten mile of fort that injins really began to gain must have felt that there be good chance of slipping through finger determined to catch if killed horse in tribe tried to urge critter forward have got in what frightened more be that mustang did seem much faster have trod in dog hole when war about way across plain must have twisted foot must see now be going little lame with redskin gained on bit by bit be pressing hard when first caught sight of fort about four mile away have begun to despair for war more than two hundred yard behind now gal have held on bravely be nigh done good rider a be be terrible ride for young gal be only excitement kept going be nigh reeling on horse now sudden say to 'thank god miss there be soldier keep up heart father coming to save ' injins saw too for war whoop behind sound of horse came nearer nearer spurred horse be first time have touched since started be no good 'ride queen may ride for life ' cried out think heard be looking straight forward now at sojers face be like death with hard set look on expected moment to see drop from horse saw a be up redskin war fifty yard behind be gainin fast upon so say 'thar father miss ride on for sake ' then turn horse with pistol in hand ride back at redskin gal told afterwards that did not hear speak that did know have turned that time after have first caught sight of sojers seemed dream to remember much of scrimmage black dog be first redskin met hit fair between eye arter that be confusion threw away pistol went at with rifle felt a if hot iron went through body then there be crash on head remember nothing more until found lying a weak a baby in hut in fort with queen may sitting working beside bed so a see ai much of story call great deal of story frank said must give great deal to have done thing well shut up say more about dick growled ef want to keep friend abe always lugging old story out know a hate like pizen have have more than one quarrel about be last time by gosh a ever open lip about pas over liquor be dry illustration chapter xii attack on caravan although great uneasiness have be caused by report a to indian member of caravan be in good spirit so far journey have be success difficulty met with in crossing stream bad bit of ground have be considerable be greater than have looked for animal have preserved health condition supply of fresh meat have be regular be in excellent health rise of ground have be so gradual that have scarcely be felt be now at considerable height above sea brisk clear air braced nerve enabled even feeblest to stand fatigue without inconvenience one day when frank be out alone with dick on north of line of march came within sight of buffalo grazing frank be about to set spur to horse when companion suddenly checked what be frank said in surprise see if follow hollow will be able to get close to before can catch sight of be so dick said just at present air question of something more serious than bufflars air question of injins indian frank exclaimed gazing round in direction where dick see sign of if be to look round day must see 'em be at foot frank looked down in surprise can see nothing said after minute examination of ground be thar though dick said throwing off horse look at soft piece of ground be hoof print there be frank also dismounted examined ground yes said can see number of hoof print now point out how do know that be indian print because be unshod besides see instead of coming along in crowd a drove of turned loose horse must do mark be together one after other a came along in single file there be doubt be party of indian be ahead of frank said be dick said thar ai no saying where be now may be watching thought be not comfortable one frank grasped rifle tightly a looked round just stay where be dick said be in hollow will have look round dick made way upon hand knee to top of brow choosing spot where shrub grew thickest making way with such caution that frank must scarcely keep in sight when reached brow raised head looked round in direction then went on be nearly hour before rejoined companion have gone straight ahead said went over brow down next hollow found trail strong there for ground be swampy have certainly passed within hour of time got there how did know that frank asked because water be still muddy where have passed must have settled again in hour after being disturbed so must not have be more than time ahead be keeping just parallel with line of march of caravan how many of do think there be between fifty sixty dick said confidently perhaps be merely journeying quietly along frank suggested not likely dick replied must have seen bufflars must have be after almost to sartinty have not have other business on hand expect be watching caravan have made up mind to wait till perhaps till came to place where can get up close without being seen fall upon by surprise will ride back at once with news put on guard hour riding brought to caravan where news created great sensation hitherto danger from indian have appeared remote trouble might not after news fifty sixty of dreaded foe be marching along almost within sight might at moment attack brought danger close indeed waggon be driven in even closer order woman child be told to keep between line men distributed among team ready to unyoke ox at shortest notice to form waggon in order of defence abe companion have not yet returned quarter of hour later be seen galloping towards camp must keep close together look spry abe shouted a approached have come upon sign of large body of indian hundred fifty two hundred strong reckon out there on plain have passed along morning ai up to good expect have found sign of smaller party abe fifty sixty on left be marching straight along pretty well in line be going then abe said have best look to yer gun for mean mischief must have be watching morning when started concluded that ground be too level that must have time to get into position before must get up to besides have advantage in stockade at station there ai station evening do think will attack on road frank asked will depend on whether think can take unawares get on yer horse again dick do ride mile ahead of caravan keep in hollow follow line of brow on right young frank will scout mile out on right of caravan rube jim go same distance on left way can see coming teamster will have plenty of time to form up waggon reckon a will attack when see a be on lookout will guess have come across track will see that chance of surprise be gone for day do think will attack to night frank asked companion may may not a general thing plain injins be not fond of night attack be part superstition doubt part because be much more at home on horseback than on foot still there be never saying with injin must say lad that ai likely to do yet will try other way fust know a how have got plenty of time can choose opportunity if be month hence be wonderful patient be redskin time air of account to at present think most dangerous time will be after have camped before night come on at daybreak before make start two more day passed quietly feeling of hope pervaded caravan that indian have ridden on sought for other prey abe assured that must not relax precaution that failure of indian to attack be proof that have abandoned intention to do so injin be always most dangerous just when ai thinking of may be sure have be watched although have seen one seeing a be on guard be waiting for to become careless again may be have fixed upon place of attack if so may bet yer life be good one above thing men impress upon woman child that in case of sudden attack will take refuge at once in waggon in place allotted to that will do with out squealing yelling there be nothing bother men flurry just a have got need to be cool steady a yelping of pack of woman just impress on a doe good add to chance of getting throat cut har raised hunter order be very strongly impressed upon woman child even latter be made to feel thoroughly importance of silence in case of attack upon following day came upon spot where trail crossed deep hollow side be extremely steep bottom flat swampy rough attempt have be made by preceding traveller to reduce steepness of bank be in way improved thereby upper edge be indeed more gradual soil cut away there shovelled down have be softened by subsequent rain while torn surface of bottom deep track left by wheel showed how team have struggled through explored for little distance up down to see if easier point for crossing must be discovered came to conclusion that spot at track crossed be easiest a in most place bank have be eaten away by winter rain be almost perpendicular have reached spot late in evening prepared to cross soon after daybreak will have to fix up three team to waggon abe have said take one over at time will be out early scouting for mind be likely place to be attacked by redskin will know there be bad spot here will guess a will be in confusion divided on one side of gulch on other give particular charge to men to have rifle handy to prepare to defend waggon to last pas round word among woman child not to be scared in case of attack a will drive injins off handsomely if come at daybreak abe dick frank crossed gulch other two hunter remaining behind must not go far from crossing abe said know way tarnal critter may come in case of attack gun will be wanted will guess a will begin to cross first thing in morning that will take three four hour to get over so if be coming will be in couple of hour so a to catch divided took station on rise few hundred yard from crossing one of riding back from time to time to see how operation of crossing be going on be one of immense difficulty ox be mired almost up to chest waggon sunk axle deep waggon stuck fast in spite of effort of men in party frank looked on for time then thought struck look here will never get waggon on in way ox can not pull ounce best way will be to unyoke take across get up on level ground on top then fasten rope together hitch to waggon bullock on firm ground can easily pull across suggestion be at once acted upon bottom be fifty yard wide there be plenty of rope in waggon have be brought for lowering down difficult place for replacing of long rope trace might be broken worn out two of be attached to waggon ox be taken over up further side team be attached to rope a whip cracked ponderous waggon be at once set in motion be soon dragged through mud up incline be capital plan of yourn young fellow john little said know how ever must have got across other way have just made up mind to give up move down hollow till came to firmer ground five more waggon be got across in same manner suddenly abe discharged rifle what be matter frank exclaimed injins abe said briefly be head of tarnal cuss just coming over line of rise spot to where pointed be about mile distant soon frank perceived number of dark object rising above almost at same instant sound of gun be heard on other side of gulch be going to attack side at once abe said a galloped back towards crossing show be strong if have doubt about licking must have thrown thar whole strength on one party other on reaching waggon found men there working with might to get six waggon in position side by side across top of ascent ox have already be taken down into hollow be right abe shouted a leapt from horse aided in movement must be better well steady have three four minute yet waggon be drawn up in two line with wheel touching inner line being on very edge of descent woman child be placed in inner waggon while eight men who have come across with three hunter took place in outside waggon almost men have be across with team when gun be fired remainder have run back to aid in defence of waggon on other side be already in position of defence having be so arranged before crossing began so well have abe order be carried out that confusion have occurred at sound of gun woman have climbed helped child into waggon allotted to men on arriving quietly took up position indian be not visible until reached spot about three hundred yard from waggon a dashed up rise checked horse instead of seeing a have expected everything in confusion dismay not soul be visible clump of waggon stood one on side ranged a for defence however after waiting for three day for prey be not to be balked wild war cry rose in air two body of horseman charged down on traveller in instant deadly fire broke out men kneeling in bottom of waggon resting rifle on rail tilt being raised few inch to enable to see under shot told among mass of horseman emigrant be new to indian warfare most of be farmer accustomed from boyhood to use of rifle coolness of hunter preparation for attack steadied gave confidence several of indian fell at first discharge advance be not checked at full speed came on steady lad throw away shot abe shouted a men loaded discharged rifle a quickly a possible see that bullet tell already indian be checking speed of horse for position be most difficult one to attack must not be surrounded indeed must only be attacked on face of outside waggon from stream of fire be pouring a leader came on frank two hunter who like carried revolver laid aside rifle brought deadly weapon into action resting on rail to secure accurate fire quick sharp crack of followed in almost case by fall of one of horseman in front completed dismay of indian quick a thought who have fallen be lifted across horse of comrade whole band turning galloped away at full speed pursued a long a be in sight by rifle ball of defender of waggon so much for abe said a leapt to ground now let give hand to comrade fight be still raging on other side number of waggon be larger facility for defence waggon be surrounded by throng of indian who be cutting at with tomahawk discharging rifle into tilt having thrown from horse be endeavouring to climb up defender be still fighting desperately have longer time to load with hatchet clubbed rifle beat down indian who tried to climb waggon few minute however must have ended resistance have not help be at hand from opposite side of gulch eleven men poured content of rifle among indian one of leading chief four of follower fell dead almost before indian have recovered from surprise dropping fire be opened almost shot taking effect cheer broke from defender of waggon fought with renewed hope while indian startled by unlooked for attack by repulse of comrade began to lose heart only for few minute longer did continue attack deadly flank fire proved too much for courage soon too be in full flight carrying off with killed wounded shout of triumph rose from two party of white scene of wild delight took place woman now that excitement be over cried laughed alternately in hysterical joy child shouted while men grasped other hand in fervent congratulation owe life to comrade john little said to abe if have not be for must have gone under tell if ever get across plain will find way to show gratitude a long a john little have crust in world will share with when excitement have somewhat abated work of crossing be recommenced in two hour be over journey be continued do think indian will attack again john little asked abe when caravan be set in motion will if see chance abe replied have lost lot of men will get vengeance if can depends partly whether thar big chief be killed not if war may give up now see a be strong well armed if not thar chief will do can to wipe out for will be held responsible for affair defeat must lower influence in tribe five day later saw waggon in distance since attack hunter have not left caravan a emigrant declared that must far rather go without fresh meat than have hunter absent from camp few deer only have be seen from line of march have be stalked shot there be caravan halting ahead frank

about same rate a do must still be about ten day ahead be very much afraid that something have happened varmint thrashed other may have attacked for mile not word be spoken then reached spot from waggon ground around be clearly visible see sign of movement abe said to john little thar seems to be lot of dark object lying about will ride forward with mate if a calculate there have be massacre have better take waggon detour mile round so that woman child may be spared sight of must be enough to make skeery for rest of journey abe comrade galloped forward have rifle ready former said there

difficulty for hind leg be almost paralysed from spear wound have passed through body just under spine behind rib seemed however to feel that frank be master now laid great head in hand a walked beside a frank saw line on caravan be now moving walked slowly across to halted until waggon came up mastiff be lifted into one of laid on empty flour sack more water be given caravan proceeded on way terrible fate have befallen predecessor cast deep gloom over party who shuddered to think how narrowly have escaped fate there be need now to impress upon necessity of avoiding straggling redoubled vigilance be observed during march frank attended assiduously to mastiff to whom gave name of turk spear wound be kept poulticed that in head be plastered have dog received such wound at other time must have probably proved fatal on plain wound heal rapidly brisk air life of activity exercise render man beast alike able to sustain serious injury without succumbing in week turk be able to walk with caravan fortnight later must gallop by frank side be now entering alkali plain wide desolate region where water be extremely scarce when found brackish bitter to taste where very shrub be impregnated with salt uneatable by most animal in anticipation of hardship to be endured in crossing region bullock have be allowed for time daily ration of grain in addition to grass must pick up during halt be therefore in good condition halt be made for three day before entering district team be fresh full of work when started march across salt plain be long painful to man beast dust rose in cloud be so impregnated with salt that caused intense irritation to lip nostril everything be done a far a possible to alleviate suffering of animal cask be filled with water at halting place time ox halted for rest mouth nostril be sponged small allowance given to drink a progressed have reason to congratulate on precaution have taken for scarce mile be passed without coming across sign of misfortune have befallen who have gone before in shape of abandoned waggon store cast out to lighten load skeleton of ox horse on other hand there be now comparatively slight danger of indian attack for even horse of redskin hardy a be must not support hardship of prolonged stay on alkali plain illustration chapter xiii at gold field be with intense delight that in caravan noticed gradual change of herbage showed that be approaching confines of terrible region when at first halt after leaving came upon flowing general bath be indulged in by man beast ox lying down in water being with great difficulty induced to emerge from hunter now recommenced excursion in search of game for be suffering from want of fresh meat child especially feeling privation turk accompanied party dog be now completely restored nothing must induce to leave frank side be quite young frank soon taught to remain by horse while dismounted to stalk game while in pursuit on horseback turk often pursued pulled down deer who must otherwise have escaped one day dick frank have gone out alone have be led long distance from line of march in pursuit of herd of deer have finally gone up narrow canon in mountain hunter pursued for distance then despairing of overtaking turned horse began to retrace step suddenly turk who be in advance stopped uttered deep growl hair bristled from head to tail what be turk frank asked animal replied with low deep growl must be savage beast frank said that ai likely dick said beast in canon must have moved away when passed before think dog must scent injins party may have seen entering gap may be in pursuit threw off horse listened with ear to ground be injins sure enough exclaimed can hear clattering of horse hoof on hard rock there be nothing for for to make way up canon turned horse galloped forward turk after one more growl in direction of indian following presently defile divided will take main branch one to right frank asked better keep straight on dick said other may lead into valley from there must be getting out must be caught in trap see said a halted deer have gone way do see of pebble have be thrown out of little stream jump off horse cut bit off blanket tie round horse foot if indian see mark going forward will naturally suppose have turned off here in pursuit of deer frank did what comrade suggested quickly a work be performed heard sound of horseman in pursuit loud distinct before again set forward then springing on horse rode up canon after while halted sound of pursuit have ceased have doubt indian have turned off into other ravine depends how far run dick said how soon will be in pursuit again if come soon to end will not be long before have after if go on for mile be safe winding between perpendicular cliff of great height rode forward mounting steadily be impossible to make rapid progress for although in place bottom of ravine be bare smooth rock at others be piled with boulder be three hour before emerged from upon doing so found be upon elevated plateau before moved forward frank said turk do hear dog stood with ear erect quivering nostril looking down ravine have just left presently gave low deep growl be coming frank said must be good way off for turk did not hear at first way will go dick have better turn to left dick said for natural line lead to right however doe not make much difference for will be able to track still may puzzle will be dark in couple of hour if can keep ahead till then be safe started at gallop for hour rode at full speed in direction must take down to plain at near spot where have halted night before illustration dick frank elude indian look out frank rein up dick suddenly shouted frank pulled horse back on haunch just in time for at brow of swell up have be galloping ground fell suddenly away in precipice two hundred foot deep horse be barely length from when brought to standstill be in mess dick said injins behind will know of instead of following will scatter to right left a will know that must turn one way other in case frank said best plan will be to go straight back be right dick exclaimed be best thing can do wo follow exact track a few of may have kept line will bear little distance off hope may pas unseen sun be setting already hour will be dark taking precaution to conceal trail rode back keeping hundred yard so to right of line by have come quarter of hour passed then turk gave growl of warning must not have be better dick exclaimed brushwood be just place for threw from horse made animal lie down at full length in low bush laid down beside hush turk frank said to dog a laid hand upon be head must lie quiet sir not make least noise dog who be quivering with excitement lay down quietly a if comprehended need for silence one two three four five six dick counted peering through bush six of must fight that lot easy sound of rifle must bring whole gang down upon indian be not riding at full speed for horse be tired having already made long march before saw hunter following deer to canon did not expect to overtake of whom be in pursuit believing that when reached precipice must make along to right left so fall into hand of one other of party who have gone to intercept sooner be fairly out of sight than hunter rose remounting horse continued way be well nigh dark dick said doubt if will be able to make out back track when get to edge at rate can not follow rode on until found that horse must no longer carry then dismounting led by bridle have be steering by star presently found at upper end of ravine wo enter now dick said for of may take into head to gallop back although ai very likely anyhow horse ca go further if must must make way over stone will be a dark a pitch down there so will move away two hundred yard let horse feed while get few hour sleep that dog of yourn will give notice if of varmint be coming way night passed without alarm at first dawn of light be upon foot again horse be given mouthful of water from skin then hunter mounted rode down canon there must be pursuit knew well indian must not be able to take up trail until daylight must be hour half following to top of canon so that have fully two hour start being case did not hurry horse kept up steady pace until emerged at lower end of ravine then urged forward two hour later arrived at halting place of caravan move have be made instant be seen approaching abe two comrade rode up to meet have happened asked a reached have be terrible uneasy about be just going to start to try pick up track follow dick related adventure war well war worse abe said that critter sense have saved life for ef have given warning must have ridden slap into hand of injins may consider be quits with now frank war nasty fix congratulate on having brought har safely back to camp that coming straight back on trail when be stopped by fall of ground be judgmatical business be frank idee dick said wall just hit right thing if have be for must have be rubbed out sure at next halting place found that three four of caravan have preceded have halted being afraid to move forward in small party a indian have made several attack with accession of force given by arrival of john little party considered able to encounter body of redskin might meet a there be now upwards of fifty waggon collected with fighting force of seventy eighty men therefore moved forward confidently several time party of indian horseman be seen in distance never showed in force strength of caravan being too great for hope of successful attack being made upon be nearly five month from time of leaving omaha before caravan approached point where great plateau of nevada fall abruptly down to low land of california many thousand foot below here hunter bade farewell to emigrant whom have so long escorted danger of indian have be long since passed be now within short distance of gold region very deep sincere be thanks be poured upon by emigrant who felt that owed life entirely to vigilance bravery of abe companion expected to meet again ere long at gold field many be assurance must by chance better luck attend search than be met with by hunter latter must share in good fortune change in character of scenery be sudden surprising hitherto country have be bare treeless great slope of nevada mountain be covered from top to bottom with luxuriant growth of timber nowhere in world be finer view to be obtained than on slope of nevada mountain slope be extremely precipitous sometimes standing on crag one can look down into valley five six thousand foot below clothed from top to bottom with luxuriant foliage while far away in front at mouth of valley can be seen low rich flat of california on lower slope of mountain lay gold deposit be found in great bed of gravel clay in countless generation have become so hardened that almost approached state of conglomerate gold from bed have be carried by stream ran through by action of rain time into ravine valley where be found by early explorer great bed of gravel have be since worked by hydraulic machinery water being brought by small canal flume many mile along face of hill to reservoir situated one two hundred foot above gravel to be operated upon from reservoir extremely strong iron pipe lead down to gravel to end of pipe be fitted movable nozzle like of fire engine far larger water pours out through nozzle with tremendous force breaking up gravel washing away down long series of wooden trough in gold settle be caught by variety of contrivance in early day of gold discovery very existence of bed of gravel be unknown gold be obtained only in ravine valley by washing soil in bottom have already be discovered that soil be richer further searcher went down by far greater find being made when digger reached solid rock at bottom in irregularity of worn by water thousand of year before large quantity of rough gold be often discovered there be difficulty in following track through forest after two day travelling party arrived at first mining village chose piece of ground for camp fastened horse to stump erected tent of blanket placed in store brought on baggage horse have remained untouched since started then leaving one of number in charge started off to visit digging whole of bottom of narrow valley be scene of life bustle existence of gold in valley have be discovered three week before rush have taken place from other digging ground have be allotted out number of tent pitched rough hut erected men be working a if for bare life lot be small ground be already perfectly honeycombed with hole generally digger worked in batch of four five member of took up claim so that space for operation be enlarged two men laboured with pick shovel basket a be filled with earth sand be first screened in sieve to remove larger portion of stone rock be then poured into what be known a cradle be long trough on rocker one man brought water in bucket from stream poured into while kept cradle in constant motion mud lighter portion of stone flowed away over edge be swept off by hand of men employed in working particle of gold sinking to bottom of machine where be found at clean up at end of day work new comer looked on with great interest at work asking question a to luck attended operator majority gave poor account of luck value of find at end of day being barely sufficient to pay enormous rate charged for provision have to be carried up from coast hundred of mile away store be brought in waggon a far a sacramento from town be carried to digging on back of mule horse consequently be impossible for man to live on poorest necessity of life for le than three four dollar day in out of way valley cost be often considerably more of digger owned that be doing well there be general disinclination to state even approximate amount of daily winning hunter found however that general belief be that of who have claim in centre of valley where of course gold must settle thickest be making from ten to twenty ounce per day be something like dick said just fancy making from forty to eighty pound per day vote set to work at once a well here a anywhere else yes suppose may a well begin here frank agreed at rate until hear what be being done in other place see must be ready to move off a soon a report come of fresh discovery so a to get good place here of course must be content to settle down outside rest will mark out five claim at once turn up ground put tool there say be sufficient to take possession then will go up into forest cut down pine two slit up into plank for making one of cradle will take day to morrow reckon a sat round fire that evening talking over prospect abe said tell what be mate have be thinking here matter over when see what tremendous price be being charged for grub here concluded there must be big thing to be made in way of carrying now have got five riding horse three baggage horse make eight now what proposes be three of will work claim other two will work horse can sell riding saddle down at sacramento get pack saddle instead can begin by carrying for one of trader here hear that horse can earn from five to ten dollar day so eight horse will earn forty to eighty dollar day now be good sartin living for especially a will bring up provision for ourselves instead of paying big rate here arterards will see how thing go if like can open store here one of mind anyhow horse will keep well if claim turn out well so much better if can do very well without proposes a take by turn to drive horse dig counsel be good prudent be only adopted after discussion for sum more fortunate digger be earning be so large that looked forward to making rapid fortune be inclined to despise small steady gain offered by plan abe suggested however frank sided with abe offered to go with on first trip to sacramento others thereupon fell in with plan next day cradle be made by abe frank others setting to to dig wash out in bucket at end of day of hard work have got about quarter of ounce of glittering yellow dust be not paying work be not disappointed have not expected to strike upon good ground at first attempt be quite satisfied by fact that really have met with gold have come so far to seek that evening abe made bargain to bring up good from sacramento for one of store keeper having previously found rate be current at daybreak next morning frank started off on horseback with three horse tied head tail behind one be riding turk marching gravely by side distance to sacramento be upwards of seventy mile on road met numerous party making way up mountain carried pick shovel bucket blanket small sack with flour bacon many of be sailor who have deserted from ship at san francisco where score of vessel be lying unable to leave for want of hand a passed asked last news from digging where last rush be what be average take at camp then hurried on eager to reach spot where a man believed fortune awaited two day of travel down mountain took to sacramento here saddle be disposed of pack saddle bought horse be laden with sack of sugar flour side of bacon mining tool after day stay in town started back for camp sacramento few month before sleepy quiet city mostly inhabited by spaniard rather people of spanish descent be now scene of animation bustle long team of waggon laden with store rolled in almost hourly across plain from san francisco while wharf at river side be surrounded by laden barge band of newly arrived emigrant wandered through street asking eager question of one who have time enough to talk a to best way of getting to digging a to camp have better select for first attempt dark looking men spaniard half indian went along on little pony rode at head of string of laden animal with air of perfect indifference to bustle around sound of shouting singing came through door of saloon in many of fortunate digger be busily engaged in dissipating hard earned gain men sunburnt almost to blackness in red shirt canvas trouser walked along street a if town in belonged to in virtue of store of gold dust tied up in waist belt in revolver bowie knife be stuck conspicuously newly arrived emigrant looked with awe envy at men who have already reaped harvest at mine shooting affray be of frequent occurrence in drinking saloon where at night gambling be invariably carried on digger being a reckless of life a of money about ten day of place must be enough to ruin man abe said a walked at head of cavalcade from town reckon a sacramento be sort of hell on arth guess there be more wickedness go on in ere little town than in other place own size on face of creation tell a san francisco be worse at rate sacramento be bad enough for on evening of third day after leaving sacramento arrived at mining camp having delivered store have brought up to trader received amount agreed upon took way to spot where have pitched camp well lad what luck abe asked a at sound of foot comrade came out to greet have got about four ounce of dust dick said back be pretty nigh broken hand that blistered can hardly hold shovel however have be better last two day expect there have be two three hundred people arrived here since left be at work now well that be pretty well for beginning abe said though must have much of four ounce left if have have to pay for grub however have brought up half sack of flour twenty pound of sugar five pound of tea half side of bacon so have got quite enough to go on for long time yet have brought up too good stout tent will hold comfortable after paying for here be thirty pound in money got five pound horse load so with earnings have made bad week work be pretty nigh ten pound man say be anything wonderful a time go here when hit on good spot for digging will pick up quick now let pitch new tent then will have supper for can tell walking twenty five mile in mountain air give one something like appetite illustration chapter xiv captain bayley during time have elapsed between departure of frank norris from england arrival at gold digging in california much have happened at home must have be interested to learn have maintained communication with relative there on morning when frank have be accused by dr litter of abstracting note from table latter have a have informed frank intended to do sent note to captain bayley informing that most painful circumstance have taken place with reference to nephew begging to call upon between twelve one captain bayley have done so have a fred barkley stated be furious at news doctor conveyed to fury however being in degree directed towards nephew entirely against head master for venturing to bring so abominable accusation against frank evidence dr litter adduced have effect whatever in staying wrath so vehement angry be old officer dr litter be obliged to ring bell order servant to show out from dean yard took cab drove direct to solicitor requested instantly to take proceeding against head master for defamation of character captain bayley lawyer urged must first see whether gentleman have reasonable cause for belief if evidence be what may be considered a strong must accept action a taken bona fide tell sir captain bayley exclaimed angrily what do care for evidence of course told long rigmarole story must not have believed one fool must believe nephew frank guilty of theft idea be preposterous be a much a must do to restrain from caning when be speaking lawyer smiled inwardly for dr litter be tall stately man six foot two in height while captain bayley be small slight figure by mean powerful when in prime now fully twenty year senior of head master well captain bayley said in first place be necessary must know precise accusation gentleman have brought against nephew will be good enough to repeat to a nearly a can statement made a of course if proceed to legal measure must be exact in matter well be about story told captain bayley said more calmly in first place seems that lad broke bound one night went with man named perkins who be prize fighter who know gave lesson in boxing for gave frank five pound last half to pay for to meeting of chartist blackguard somewhere in new cut well there be row there a there naturally must be at place seems frank knocked down radical fellow tailor believe broke nose well know be not saying be right still know lad will be lad used to be fond of getting into row when be young for must spar in day pretty well can tell griffith must have given five pound note to have seen frank set to with radical tailor still dare say if lad have told about must have got into passion blown up must be surprised at lawyer said drily no well that must do harm know know that be peppery well seems fellow found out who be threatened to report thing to head master in case dr litter said must have expelled for being out of bound thing in call monstrous now here be where frank be wrong ought to have come straight to told whole affair got blowing up money instead of that asked three four of other boy among nephew fred to lend money be out of fund well somebody seems sent frank ten pound note in envelope with word 'from friend more frank showed envelope to others agreed that be sort of godsend frank sent note to tailor now seems that day before frank got note head master when be hearing form have put ten pound note with other thing on table being called out like careless old fool left lying there time afterwards missed note doe not remember taking up from table still say did not suspect of boy of form of taking thinking that have dropt on way to house stopped note at bank happening to have number few day afterwards note be presented be traced to tailor who admitted having received from frank must believe sir man now pretend to believe that nephew stole from table sent to in envelope be most preposterous thing ever heard mr griffith looked grave of course captain bayley having met nephew at house several time can not for moment believe guilty of taking note still must admit that evidence be strongly circumstantial be stranger who be accused must say at once thing looked nasty pooh nonsense griffith old officer said angrily there be nothing in sir nothing somebody found note kicking about dare say did know who belonged to knew frank be in corner sent to thing be perfectly natural yes lawyer assented doubtfully question be who did know be fact of nephew requiring money generally known in school captain bayley admitted doctor examined four boy before frank declared that knew nothing of note that have not mentioned circumstance to soul opinion be that one of be liar be certainly necessary to believe mr griffith said slowly that one of be liar thief of course there may be other solution of matter only one can see just at present moment be nephew be sort of lad to be extremely popular among schoolmate one of four boy took note from master table with good natured most mistaken idea of getting out of scrape must have mentioned need of money to of school fellow one of whom finding note perhaps in yard where head master may have dropped sent to frank to relieve of difficulty be possible solution of mystery at rate if will take advice captain bayley will not in present state of affair take step propose to against dr litter will be time enough to do when nephew innocence be finally incontestably proved of course said seeing that listener be about to break out again knowing know that be innocent others who know might entertain doubt upon subject jury might consider that doctor be justified with evidence before in acting a did in case immense deal of damage might be done by making matter subject of general talk with difficulty captain bayley be persuaded to allow intention to rest for while be late now said will go see frank to morrow wish have seen afternoon before came to however have doubt when get home will find letter from not defending of course a must

delightful to lad strong bond between be mutual feeling about frank from harry learned charge under frank laboured indignant repudiation of possibility of such thing delighted alice heart hitherto have be alone in belief be delightful to to talk with one who be of own way of thinking infected harry with own dislike suspicion of fred barkley amused lad greatly by telling how when have heard of discovery of existence have when mr holl left gone straight up to room indulged in wild dance of delight at destruction of fred hope of being captain bayley sole heir be glorious said knew fred hated frank though frank silly old boy be always taking part with scolding because did like cousin be quite quite sure that have have something to do with getting frank into dreadful scrape be glorious to think just when thought that have got field clear uncle harry to must suddenly appear put nose out of joint be very unladylike expression harry know ought to use there be nothing else doe so well be fred holiday now be away expect uncle will write tell about wish must for must give anything to see face when walk in see sitting here hears who be oh hope harry said that grandfather wo make

sometimes say be too old to get rid of bad habit wish must do worst of be harry said plaintively that instead of being very much shocked a ought to be very often can hardly help laughing doe put in dreadful word so funnily must not care about being in parliament boy said if be ever so rich think might like yacht still yacht if be only small one must cost great deal of money do hope that grandfather wo disappoint one for sake captain bayley have however few day after discovery of grandson after having satisfied how lovable lad be how worthy in respect to be heir written to fred barkley telling that grandson have be found that be that must wish to find naturally fred wrote will make considerable difference in prospect at same time a have be led to believe that must come into considerable property at death a have done nothing to forfeit confidence affection having proved in way steady industrious honourable young fellow consider right that must be altogether disinherited by discovery have occasioned such vast pleasure have therefore instructed solicitor to prepare new will by will settle property in warwickshire town house upon grandson other house property portion of money in stock share have be accumulating for many year will be left to value of legacy being calculate about one half of of property left to grandson thus will be in nearly same position must have occupied have not cousin frank forfeited by disgraceful conduct place in affection may have be feeling of fred barkley when received communication wrote graceful letter of congratulation to uncle expressing pleasure at discovery of long lost grandson with many thanks for kind intention on own behalf anger disappointment be so great that did not return to town until day before be going up to cambridge having left westminster at end of preceding term for did not feel equal before time to continue to play part to express personally sentiment have written what rendered disappointment even more bitter be thought indirectly be frank who have dealt blow for captain bayley have mentioned in letter that be through boy whom cousin have recommended a assistant to footman that discovery have be made visit that paid at eaton square be short one to relief alice be not present for be certain that must have watched with malicious pleasure there have be passage of arm between guardian of more serious nature than have occurred since have be under care owing to having expressed with usual frankness respecting fred visit guardian have resented warmly have rated so severely a to what called wicked prejudice against fred that have retired to room in tear defeat of favourite have not predisposed harry to more favourable opinion of unknown cousin fred relieved from presence of alice acted part so well infused so genuine ring into tone of congratulation that did much to dissipate prejudice with harry be prepared to regard alice be quick to observe impression fred have made quarrelled hotly with harry concerning be disappointed in altogether harry have looked upon a being real friend of frank now desert directly enemy say few soft word to despise such friendship want to have anything more to say to in vain harry protested girl flung out of room in deep anger thenceforth for long time harry be made to feel that although wished to be civil to a guardian grandson yet that bond of union between be entirely broken harry have lost time in speaking to grandfather on behalf of frank dear harry old man said faith in innocence be a strong a yours crushing a proof seemed to be must never have doubted have defended did not never sent line to ask to suspend judgment to declare innocence ran away like thief at night although fred generously tried to soften fact to there be doubt admitted guilt to still after lesson have in mother case must forgive did know where be say harry must restore to place in affection confidence that of course must be impossible must willingly send cheque for handsome amount say for five thousand pound to establish in business set up in farm in one of colony be use grandfather harry said if be innocent a most firmly believe to be in spite of everything against will believe to be to dying day unless tell that be guilty will not accept either forgiveness money what wish be that must be found wish must see that must see face to face that must hear from own lip what have to say might at least account for foolish running away instead of facing out know how desperate might have be at being unable to clear from charge brought against remember must not have known how hotly be working on behalf may have believed altogether deserted may account for not having written to must remember grandfather mind share alice prejudice have inclination in way to doubt honesty of cousin fred at same time in bare justice to frank must not forget that fred be really rival of in affection that must possibly benefit greatly by frank disgrace must also remember that only evidence against frank with exception of circumstantial proof come from be who furnished frank with fund to enable to run away can not tell whether not did not even urge to fly must remember grandfather that alice asserts fred always hated frank know be prejudiced that never noticed feeling did frank child perception be very quick even allowing that liked frank much best fred be always a admits very kind attentive to more so in way than frank there be reason therefore for taking up such prejudice have not be convinced that be true now grandfather will tell have occurred to know will appear hideously unjust suspicion to will tell once for will not recur to subject again god know may be wronging cruelly wrong must be no greater than have be done to frank if be really innocent ever since told whole story have lain awake at night thinking over may be that what alice have said may have turned thought way can see only two explanation of affair frank be really guilty be altogether innocent if be innocent who be guilty one took note one sent to frank one must be person who knew that frank be in need of did so can only have done with one of two motif either to get frank out of trouble to bring disgrace upon only four boy knew of affair declare that told one else if spoke truly be one of four sent note always supposing that did not take of other three know nothing will take case of fred view a if be stranger to of be rival of frank alice declares hated at rate must benefit greatly by frank disgrace what did do when frank asked to help refused to do so on ground that have money two day later be able to raise double sum frank then wanted in order to assist to fly dreadful a supposition be seems to that only positive alternative to supposing frank to be guilty be to believe that cousin took note sent to in order to bring into disgrace that afterwards urged assisted to fly in order to stamp guilt more firmly upon while harry have be speaking captain bayley have paced up down room impossible harry exclaimed impossible for bad a be case of frank taking note on pressure of moment to get out of silly scrape into have got charge bring against fred must be hundred time ay thousand time worse must be piece of hideous treachery piece of villainy of can scarce believe human being capable bring charge grandfather harry said quietly only state alternative that one of nephew took note seems to to be clear crime must be infinitely greater infinitely more unpardonable in one case than other incentive too be enormously greater in one case only object for theft must be to avoid consequence of foolish after not serious freak in other to obtain large fortune to ruin chance of dangerous rival remember at time fred did not know how have determined to dispose of property frank be living with be apparently favourite therefore may have deemed that be nothing there grandfather have done need not say that know little of real disposition of two nephew frank behaved to with greatest kindness when be poor cripple without slightest claim upon fred have behaved kindly courteously although have come between can only say that believe that one of two must be guilty be god alone know wish have said nothing about captain bayley groaned be dreadful know what to do what to think there be nothing to be done harry said except grandfather to find frank let find see face to face let hear story from beginning to end think then will arrive at just conclusion have doubt have gone abroad must advise that must advertise in colonial american paper begging to return to have interview with offering handsome reward to one who will give information of whereabouts if find where be will not come to will go to be what will do harry will not lose moment time will set about at once if spend ten thousand pound in advertising will find a to fred can not meet again until get to bottom of affair so will stay away from england till get news of frank

contractor on evening of first taking possession of new property illustration chapter xvii lonely digger camp increased rapidly for although extraordinarily rich find be made valley bottom widened out at point gold be generally disseminated in quantity sufficient to enable miner to live one hoped that a got deeper claim must increase in value day added to number of tent hut three bar competed with other for favour of digger two large store drove profitable trade in food mining tool material brawl at gambling table be of nightly occurrence small proportion of gold obtained by more fortunate digger found way into pocket of gambler tell what abe frank said short time after arrival when heard that young man have be shot down by one of most notorious ruffian in camp think must be good plan if be to agree that will not enter one of saloon know be temptation after work be over to saunter in there think party a be be enough for other have done well enough for month out on plain see why must not do so now be friend must be awfully sorry to see one of number losing share of joint earnings at gambling table brought home with bullet hole in head if want little change can always ask one two of quiet men to join round fire if want drink be cheaper better to buy by bottle have glass in company here there be doubt that one who take to drink here may a well hang at once for will never do good know that of be inclined that way think must be good plan to enter into sort of agreement with other that a long a be in partnership none of will enter saloon stake dollar in play agrees with frank time have be when have gone in for a heavy spree a one think a be likely to do again be sure that agreement like must be good thing for a well a others what do yer say boy only thing be peter suggested that might one other very well get into bad quarrel by refusing to drink when be asked see be pretty nigh deadly offence to refuse to drink with man if got noticed that none of ever went into bar there be men here who must make point of asking to drink just for sake of making quarrel if refused allow there be something in abe said there be surer way of getting into mess among set of men like than in refusing to drink well if be case frank said must modify arrangement agree that none of will go into bar unless actually asked to go take drink must be very often invitation be generally given inside come back from work about same time one else knock off be not thinking of going to bar till have have meal when be once quietly seated round fire here one be very likely to ask of to get up go off to one of saloon suggestion be adopted bound not to enter saloon to drink gamble unless invited to take drink under circumstance in refusal must be taken in bad part be mighty glad proposed that abe said afterwards rube be all right peter dick be of 'em fond of going on spree now then may keep from told when started be ready to go partner a long a kept from drink be going to tie up with one a be going in for when dissolve partnership one will have right to do with share what like can gamble away drink away fool away a chooses man a drink overnight will do fair share of work next day besides luck may at time go agin may have to fall back on what have laid by when time be good if one have be spent share must be looking to others to support besides a pinted out might want money have got atween to buy up claim in good place agreed to so far have kept to not of course a have much chance to do otherwise on way still think fresh agreement likely to do good be working here on share man be bound to do best for others after sitting by fire for time of evening frank generally got up strolled round camp accompanied by turk there be many phase of life presented to while successful digger be drinking gambling in saloon there be many who must barely keep life together be true be in most case own fault for men willing to work must earn five dollar day by labouring in claim of wealthier more successful digger many must hold on to own claim hoping against hope believing always that ground must get richer a went down frank chatted freely with one great dog be soon known to one in camp be able to do many little act of kindness to whose luck be bad for on arriving at end of journey of party have at abe suggestion put twenty dollar into common fund beyond amount sum have brought with from omaha be still untouched many man who must otherwise have gone to bed supperless after hard day work be indebted to for mean of procuring few pound of flour pound two of pork attention have be particularly attracted to two men who lived in small tent hundred yard away from of others who worked claim by did not seem to have communication with rest of digger kept entirely apart while at work frank have heard several jeering remark a to absurdity of working claim in part of ground have over over again be tried abandoned frank felt sure that men be doing badly one day observed that only one of men be at work younger of two a continued to wield shovel after others have thrown down tool for evening frank walked over to be partner ill asked see be not working with to day man nodded continued work without speaking be evidently indisposed for conversation why asked frank said be not for mere curiosity because have brought up with from sacramento few bottle of fever medicine other thing likely to be wanted here if of must be of use will be heartily welcome to ought to help other for one know whether may not want helping hand next thank man said somewhat gruffly will get on right mate be fond of stranger need not trouble frank said can bring round medicine here can give to without saying how got thank must do good man said resumed work a if anxious to avoid further conversation frank however be not to be discouraged man looked thin haggard frank suspected that might be food rather than medicine of man mate be in need therefore stood ground be afraid have hit on very good spot said know much about for have only be here about month hear one say that there have be several trial made here that none of have found anything to speak of must work where can man said place be pretty well all taken up when came did suit to go further well said frank want to be inquisitive mate to interfere in other people affair noticed mate looked elderly man that seemed pretty much alone be only just out here party be working with be doing fairly so thought must be only neighbourly to come over see if must be of use in way thank man repeated there be nothing want frank saw that at present must hing have little doubt that two men be really suffering severely still understood respected pride with friendly good evening strolled off to own hut next evening again went round to solitary workman how be mate asked man shook head be pretty bad tone be softer le repellent than have used evening before be young man of not more than three four twenty frank saw that lip quivered a turned away from dug shovel into ground if mate be worse frank said have right to refuse offer can not help feeling that be doing badly in case why must not let lend hand there be disgrace in being unlucky here men be unlucky one week make rich strike on week following then can lend hand to others just a hand may have be lent to when wanted think by accent that be englishman educated one just a be why on earth let be friend to man did not reply frank must guess by random way in be doing work that struggle be going on must not hear of said at last then let hear of frank said promptly if have mistaken idea about taking help from stranger sort of idea one must naturally have at home be ill want something must help in spite of if a suspect need other matter a well a medicine must provide even if be necessary to carry out little harmless deception must not tell lie man said almost fiercely there be occasion for frank went on can tell that have come across nugget in claim frank tossed into hole nugget for have hour before given digger ten dollar from own store for moment man stood irresolute then burst into passion of tear frank saw that have gained day saying will come round for chat to morrow afternoon camp up there that tent just on ridge have really medicine if think will be of use strolled away to supper glanced round when have gone little distance saw digger running at full speed towards solitary tent next evening young man dropped shovel a approached came to meet did not thank last night began nonsense frank said interrupting there be occasion whatever for thanks why be custom here whenever one be taken ill be unfortunate have to move on few friend a often happens few stranger will chip in pinch of gold dust to help on be rule here that stand by other being englishman be natural must lend other hand how be mate be good deal better thanks to food be able to get for for a guessed have be nearly starving last fortnight why did keep on working at place a frank asked why did go on wage there be plenty of men here who must be glad to take on extra hand if must get young man hesitated know must seem utter folly said at last fact be partner have fixed idea that claim will turn out well dreamt pooh frank said digger be constantly dreaming about lucky place wonder when be always thinking about consider madness to keep on toiling here even if mate be ill be folly to give in to in way for to be half starved when can earn at rate enough to keep by working for others be just what knew must say young man replied feel thoroughly then why on earth do keep on doing have reason very particular reason though be not at liberty to explain well then there be more to be said frank replied vexed at what regarded a obstinate folly talked for few minute then strolled away for next two day did not go near digger who seemed so bent on slaving uselessly third day frank noticed that man be not at work on claim a soon a knocked off in evening walked across to spot tool still lay in hole showing that claim have not be abandoned although work have temporarily ceased next day claim be still unworked tent stood in place showing that digger have not moved away although from previous conversation frank thought that might not improbably meet with repulse after work be done strolled over to tent be in mate asked outside seeing be not at work for last two day thought must walk over ask if anything be matter young man came out from tent looked utterly worn out father have be too ill for to leave said in low tone spoke of a mate before be father can do anything frank asked thank think one can do anything if there be doctor in camp of course must call in think must be of use be broken down altogether broken down want for anything thanks to kindness look worn out frank said suppose do have not lain down for past five day then frank said insist on taking place to night be sensible young man shook head sometimes for little while think know where be most of time lie perfectly still just talk to very well then frank said will not know difference besides can lie down in tent can wake at once if there be occasion man hesitated be too worn out to resist made opposition a frank entered tent elderly man lay stretched upon blanket one of be thrown loosely over frank stooped put finger on wrist must scarcely feel pulse what have be giving got piece of fresh meat boiled down into have given stimulant think want keeping up never touch young man said better frank replied will have more effect upon a medicine if will wait here few minute will go up to tent fetch down blanket few thing will be with in ten minute frank briefly announced to comrade that be going to sit up for night with sick man put bottle containing glass two of brandy in pocket went into store purchased lemon piece of fresh beef took back to camp fire asked abe to put on let simmer night in ash in just enough water to cover then to strain in morning bring broth across to what be known in camp a lonely tent took small phial of laudanum quinine from store of medicine to use if might appear likely to be needed then went back to tent now said to young man lie down at once if be wanted will be sure wake will make comfortable never fear one of mate will bring down pannikin of tea last thing squeezed one of lemon into tin drinking cup added water few spoonful of brandy with spoon have brought down with poured of between old man lip know whether be right thought to be best thing can do for be evident must be kept up when abe come down will ask advice after knocking about a many year a have be ought to know what be best thing to be done in hour gave patient few spoonful of broth have be prepared continued half hour to give lemonade alternately when abe came down with tea frank went outside to meet explained of circumstance of case then took in to see patient illustration sick friend in mining camp think be doing right thing lad abe said when went out into air again be evidently pretty nigh gone under expect have be working beyond strength starving like enough at that be regular broke up have got fever besides must just keep on at till morning then will see if get on raving might give few drop of laudanum with brandy must do otherwise will bring down broth first thing in morning will be sight stronger than stuff be giving now fortified by opinion frank lit pipe sat down to long watch be more satisfied that be doing right by fact that pulse be distinctly stronger than have be when first felt occasionally patient muttered few word generally lay perfectly still with eye staring wide open be fixed stare tempted frank at last to give few drop of laudanum in hour later have satisfaction of seeing close eye abe be round soon after daylight with two pannikin of tea rasher of bacon jug of essence of beef how be patient frank ca tell except by pulse that certainly seems to to be stronger gave few drop of laudanum couple of hour ago seems to have be dozing since at rate eye have be closed think that be extreme weakness more than anything else have overtaxed strength be worn out with fatigue starvation must be surprised if get round right with quiet food opening of tent sound of voice outside roused younger digger who have slept without stirring from moment have down joined others outside how have slept said ca tell how much be obliged to be regularly done up now will be able to take fresh start again partner abe here have just brought down tea breakfast really strong soup for mate for frank did not know whether young man must wish fact of relationship between companion generally known thank heartily young man said a seated by side of frank on stump of felled tree took tea food from abe hand feel ready to go on again now last night quite broke down have one to speak to see be awful to see lying there to be able to hing friend here nodded to frank have be so kind to week ago felt sure must not mind sitting up with though know thought fool to go on digging at wretched hole think look motioned to tent little better morning of course there be not much change face doe not look quite a did yesterday know what difference be be sure there be difference pulse be certainly little stronger frank said hope will pull round though did not think so when saw yesterday have be giving hour few spoonful of lemonade with brandy in between time think brandy have done more good than soup if be in place must go on doing just same to day soup abe have brought down be very strong two three spoonful at time will be will want there be lemon in there must go on giving brandy too think be just strength want strength hope young man said have all along made up mind that claim must pay think failure did more to break down than even fatigue want of food be why kept on working a long a be sensible still believed in must not hear of stopping to nurse be very bad that night went home with nugget almost a bad a be last night when showed seemed to revive be only when three day passed without being able to show spec of gold that fell back again oh did find nugget then abe said one thought must strike on anything thar found because friend put there young man said saved life for be starving abe grunted must have kept so dark lad ai bad fellow digger though be rough lot one need starve in mining camp doubt have reason added seeing miner face blush up what on arth made mate stick to thar hole one must have seen with eye that be likely place have sort of belief in dream dreamt three time a told of stunted tree with gold underneath have be to mining camp in country never have luck directly came here saw tree standing just where claim be declared be one dreamt of told then did seem likely place to work must have that be tree that there be gold under be already weak ill to please set to work there may tell a have told friend that be father there be reason that there must be mystery about only reason for wishing that must not be generally known be that have sort of fancy against guessed a much young man abe said when saw working together three week ago young man tie to old partner who ai no more good than child at work unless there be reason for there be many father son aye father four five son working together in mining camp here still if old man have fancy agin will say nought on subject so dreamt three time of tree did well then blame for sticking to claim suppose there be dozen miner in camp who must have done same belief there be something in dream most of do recognised tree directly say wall be time for mate to be off to work evening will walk round have look at claim thar may be somewhat in arter really believe in dream abe frank said a walked off together think thar something in 'em abe said have heard many queer story about dream reckon thar ai many men a have lived out thar life in plain a doubt thar something in injins believe in 'em though ai got book to larn injins ai fool in own way have known score of case where dream came true yes dare say have frank said then there be ten of thousand of case in dream come true man dream for instance that wife mother one care for be dead when get home find right never think more about dream say anything about if in one case out of ten thousand find be dead tell one about dream be quoted about a instance dream come true yes perhaps there be something in abe agreed think there be more than too know case of chap who be out in plain hunting for caravan on way down to santa fe there be a far a knew injins about what thar be have always shown friendly peaceable laid down by fire went to sleep dreamed that party of injins scalped woke in regular sweat from fright be so badly scared that scattered ash of fire took to horse led into cedar bush close by have be thar twenty minute when heard tramping of horse along came party of injins halted not twenty yard away from where fire have be camped till morning then rode on again must see by thar dress paint be up to mischief very next day fell upon small caravan killed soul now that man dream saved life thar war doubt about if have have warning have time to scatter fire move quiet into bush get blanket over horse head to prevent snorting must have be up with must tell dozen tale like think must be accounted for frank said man perhaps be sleeping with ear on ground in sleep may have heard tramping of indian horse a went over bit of stony ground long before must hear when arose to foot noise set brain at work dreamt dream have told know from what have heard that gold miner be almost to man full of fancy superstition that will often take up claim from idea of luck rather than from experience knowledge of ground after work be over abe frank went down to claim well be free to own abe said that see chance of gold here be clear out of course of stream frank be silent for two three minute then said well abe know put faith whatever in dream if look at sharp curve in opposite bank higher up will see that be quite possible that in day when be river instead of being mere stream struck that curve came over by where be standing now a water decreased must naturally find way down middle of valley a doe now think likely enough that in old time flowed under where be standing by gosh lad think be about right what do say to taking up claim next to be not doing much more than paying way where be be horse who be really earning money know abe be good deal above present bed of stream must probably have to sink considerable distance before got down to paying ground that young fellow said have hardly found speck of gold must be risky thing to do still can think over there be hurry about night abe insisted on taking turn to sit up with old man son who have now told that name be james adam urged that previous night long sleep have quite set up again abe must not listen to be done good lad doubt ye will be better for want more than one night sleep when have have four five out of bed night watch be nothing one way other to just do a be told so james adam have long night sleep while abe sat by father there be doubt now that old man be recovering from exhaustion have brought to death door set pinched look of feature be passing away evening following abe watch when frank went round to tent to inquire how be getting on son came out said be better went off morning in what looked like natural sleep when woke hour ago must see that knew suppose knew have be lying insensible for week thought have just come back from work whispered 'how doe look to day jim after what told about what thought about old course of river be able to say honestly think chance look more favourable whispered 'we will make fortune yet jim ' then drank soup went off to sleep again tomorrow morning will set to work again believe bit in dream will make more comfortable to know be at work upon after may turn out good partner have more faith in than have frank said abe told about dream about what have noticed of probable course of river in olden time have proposal to make to will take up five claim by side of two two on one side three on other then three of will help sink shaft be found in claim will be yours if turn out rich will pay just a if have be working for by day when have cleared out claim be to have right of using shaft for working right left along bottom over claim think be fair offer think be more than fair be most kind young man said be risking getting nothing for labour if turn out poor yes be risking that frank agreed be not doing much good now two who be working horse earn enough to keep five of if by chance claim must turn out well will be paid for work for will be able to work out own claim very cheaply if sunk shaft on own account must similarly lose labour if turned out poor must not get so much if turned out rich so think bargain be really fair one if agree mate have quite resolved to sink shaft on own account on strength of father dream in case agree most heartily james adam said will gladden father heart to be told that work be now to go on really in earnest if be better to morrow frank said will be a well to get father consent to agreement then will begin on following day next morning old man woke up good deal better first question after have taken soup be how be be at work jim be broad daylight have knocked off for to day father wanted to have chat with party of five miner who have be very kind to while have be ill for have be ill now for more than week though know have made very good offer although must not accept until consulted see can not get on much with claim by ground fall in want timbering can hing alone well miner have offered to help sink shaft on condition that get pay if turn out poor if turn out well be to be paid for daily labour when have worked out claim be to have right of using shaft for working out claim have staked out next to ours share jim old man said be sure be not to have share in claim because wo agree to father agreement be just a told if turn out well get wage right to use shaft to get at claim very well will agree to will get down sooner to gold mind have put down on paper else will be setting up claim to share in treasure will get done regularly father jim said mean very fairly a told have shown greatest kindness indeed owe life to for if have not be for have a know mean of holding on whilst have be ill two of have be sitting up with at night have showed true friend well be glad have found friend jim old man said feebly must be careful know very careful be sure agreement be signed witnessed properly illustration chapter xviii dream verified on following morning to astonishment of miner of cedar camp frank companion took tool out of claim shifted to claim of two men of solitary tent one asked what must be meaning of move general supposition be that must have discovered that two men have struck upon rich ground score of miner sauntered across during day looked on asked question two answer obtained threw light upon mystery ground looked most unpromising be flat ten foot above level of river bed spot where be digging be twenty yard from edge fifteen yard further back ground rose abruptly to height of thirty forty foot ground around be covered with bush through few good sized tree rose two men have dug through two foot of alluvial soil about five foot of sand altogether be place seemed to afford promise whatever although at first impulse miner who be doing badly have marked out claim next to staked out by frank party step be taken to occupy first day be spent in getting out plank lining proposed shaft be made much smaller than hole already dug extended over whole of two claim next day windlass be put in position work began in earnest at depth of twenty foot came upon gravel result greatly raised spirit a character be precisely similar to in bed of stream showed that frank conjecture be correct one that river have at one time flowed along foot of high ground beyond when be known in camp that party be getting up gravel there be great deal of talk of older hand came examined place noticing sharp curve in opposite bank above concluded a frank have done that instead of being a be generally supposed beyond edge of old river bed be by mean improbable that party be working over what be at one time point be swept by main body of water coming down more claim be staked out although one have intention of beginning in earnest until discovered what luck attended party who be sinking shaft just enough be done day to retain possession of claim before have gone far into gravel discovered speck of gold washing basinful from time to time found that be fairly rich certainly a good a have be found few foot below surface of ground at other spot in camp determined however not to wash at present to pile stuff near mouth of shaft to be washed subsequently to continue to sink steadily fortnight after work have begun old man have gained sufficient strength to make way across to shaft after that spent whole time watching progress of work tent be brought over pitched close at hand by time a prospect really looked good jim have told true history of nugget have brought home how much owed to frank so far overcame shrinking from intercourse with neighbour a to become really cordial with frank who when supper be over often strolled across smoked pipe with jim in tent frank often wondered what must have brought man of sixty year of age evidently well educated gentleman a be equally clear wholly unfitted by age habit constitution for rough labour in such country a that son have not denied that be english a have not admitted in so many word frank thought that father might object to question on subject in many conversation past be seldom alluded to turk who be frank constant companion took remarkably to old man in daytime when latter be sitting watching basket coming up from below generally took up position by sometimes lying blinking lazily in sun at other time sitting up watching operation gravely a if be thoroughly aware of importance while ground be still unpromising frank party have bought up for few dollar claim of several of men who have staked out ground next to own now held six on side of claim be sinking on beyond a soon a gravel be known to contain gold other miner began to work for most part in party a depth at paying ground lay beneath surface be so great that must only be reached by joint labour flat so long neglected now became one of busiest point in camp gravel be getting richer richer day frank said to elder adam five week after began work think now must be a well to hire dozen men to carry down to stream wash there must superintend one of will work at cradle stuff will pay splendidly now be sure there be big heap on bank if think so by mean let do so old man said must like to begin to get gold be in debt more than hundred dollar already since have be advancing money for living a work have gone on there be hurry on account frank said ever since washed first pail of gravel have be evident that there be at least sufficient gold to pay for washing out that advance be perfectly safe so there be hurry on account at present have so improved that must be rich enough to pay really well besides will be getting stolen fancy last night two three bucket full be taken away at edge of bank a there have be perfect rush for staking out claim to day have doubt that be found to pan out very rich result of first day washing more than realised anticipation for when cradle be cleared up over fifty ounce of gold be found at bottom at end of three day old man paid frank party wage at four dollar day from time have commenced working at shaft fortnight reached bed rock day find have become heavier climax be reached when touched rock be found that just where reached bottom rock formed bank bordering flat came down almost perpendicularly to level rock have formed old bed of stream be worn perfectly smooth by action of water in bed rock be great caldron scooped out by eddy of stream be filled up with gravel among nugget of gold be lying thickly when content be taken to surface separated gold be found to weigh over three thousand ounce lower part of ground be then dug out to full size of claim when be washed be found that total amount of gold obtained from claim be over six thousand ounce a work went on from day to day frank observed gradual change coming over elder of two men at first have be excited at time irritable a day showed increased return became moral certainty that claim be going to turn out extremely rich excitement seemed to pas away talked le spent le of time in watching work going on sometimes not even coming down to watch clear up at end of day work even discovery of rich pocket in rock scarcely seemed to stir son upon contrary made secret of satisfaction at fortune be falling to shook off reserve have at first distinguished weight of care seemed to fall from shoulder spirit became at time almost exuberant at first have looked to frank almost middle aged man although face figure showed that must not be many year own senior now looked almost like schoolboy so full be of life spirit old man have taken much to frank although during latter part of time have talked little liked to come into tent evening to smoke pipe chat with son have several time endeavoured to draw from frank reason for leaving england coming out to california at age when many lad be still at school have obtained no reply to hint for frank did not care to enter upon story of incident at westminster evening when claim have be worked out last cradle washed out old man asked frank to bring abe companion to tent after have have supper tent showed little sign of altered circumstance of owner few more article of cheap crockery couple of folding chair be only addition have be made box have be brought in now to serve a seat on one in centre be placed dozen bottle of champagne young man proceeded to open friend elder said be going away to morrow trust claim will turn out bit a rich a ours have done even if turn out a rich

escort be needed for many attack be made on gold convoy by party of desperado four men must indeed have be insufficient guard at same time other digger in valley sent down find escort be always made up to eight men from general body frank from first generally formed one of escort be perfectly ready to take share in more laborious work of digging where frank went turk went turk formed so valuable member of escort that rest of party begged master always to go with treasure week have added to weight power of animal be now most formidable looking beast be extremely quiet good tempered at ordinary time except that must not allow stranger to touch when at excited hair bristled from neck to tail low formidable growl gave warning few men must have be inclined to despise indeed of many rough character in camp there be not one who must not rather have faced man with revolver in hand than have ventured upon conflict with dog appeared to know that escort duty be one demanded especial vigilance on road low growl always gave notice of approach of stranger at night when stopped heavy valise be carried from pack animal into wayside resting place turk always lay down with head upon seemed so thoroughly to understand that be in special charge although at other time must leave frank side for moment be when thus on guard content to lie quiet even must frank take stroll after reaching hotel guardianship greatly relieved care of escort a once placed under turk charge felt further anxiety about treasure for must have be a much a stranger life be worth to have entered room where turk lay on guard once indeed attempt be made while escort be taking meal man went round to window of room opening threw large piece of poisoned meat to turk dog placed one paw upon remained with great head on treasure watching man outside holding piece in hand speaking in soothing tone man seeing that did not move began to climb in through window suddenly a if shot from spring turk hurled from recumbent position upon movement be so rapid unexpected that before man must spring back from window turk have seized by shoulder shriek followed by heavy fall brought party rushing into room be empty there be sound of scuffle outside ran to window interference be too late turk have shifted hold grasping man by throat be shaking a terrier must rat when in obedience to frank voice loosened hold life be extinct not only be there terrible wound in throat of robber neck be broken by shaking be only attempt be ever made upon treasure for turk gained reputation by deed that be questionable whether have accompanied pack mule a sole escort to sacramento bravest stage robber in district must have ventured to interfere with after time lower valley became worked out number drifted away to other digging be four month before party at waterfall completely worked out claim value of ground in last few foot at lower end of hole be immense for in for age gold from above have

mexican to drive like life among mountain there be good thing to be made out of carrying have have enough of digging be tremendously hard work must expect to meet with slice of luck a again if worked for fifty year well frank will not try to dissuade abe said if be going on hunting must say along with to plain mate be going east a of have got one waiting for thar expect will marry settle down will write to at sacramento when get fixed need tell how glad sight of face will make if be ever travelling way few day afterwards party separated at sacramento frank only remaining two day in town wild scene of dissipation recklessness disgusted looked with loathing upon saloon where gambling went on from morning till night broken only by occasional fierce quarrel followed in most case by sharp crack of revolver by desperate encounter with bowie knife bad a thing be however be improving somewhat for vigilance committee have just be started comprising prominent citizen of town party of armed men have seized upon of most notorious desperado of place have hung on lamp post while others have be warned that like fate awaited if be found three hour later within limit of town similar scene took place in san francisco for force of law be wholly insufficient to restrain reckless desperate men who congregated in town who thought more of taking life than eating meal to put stop to frightful state of thing prevailing more peaceful of san francisco citizen have also be obliged to organise vigilance committee to carry out what be called lynch law rough ready method of justice subject to grave abuse under other circumstance admirably suited to such condition of thing a at time prevailed in california for time frank worked between sacramento digging enjoyed life riding in pure mountain air under shade of forest at head of team sometimes wondered vaguely how long be to last if be always to remain rover whether must ever return to england sometimes resolved that must go home make effort to clear of stain rested upon name must see method whatever of doing so a have nothing own unsupported assertion of innocence to adduce against circumstantial evidence against there be reason why word must be taken now more than be before in many of camp life have now become more civilised in case where bed of gold bearing gravel be large where consequently work must be continued for long time wooden town have sprung up with hotel store drinking gambling saloon work be here carried on methodically water be in case brought many mile in little canal from mountain lake down to digging operation be carried on on large scale company be being formed for buying up working number of claim together valley be honeycombed with shaft driven down sometimes through hundred foot of gravel to bed rock a be found much more profitable working way than in surface washing stage coach team of waggon be running regularly now along well made road frank earnings be therefore smaller than have be at first still paid expense added few pound trip to account at bank took share in many of company formed for bringing down water from lake be soon found to be exceedingly valuable property paying in many case return month equal to capital life of teamster be not without danger bear in considerable number be found among mountain when pressed by hunger did not hesitate to attack passing team in time of rain river rose rapidly valley be full of fierce torrent sometimes preventing horse from crossing for many hour being still more dangerous if rise commenced when track to be followed wound along in foot of valley several time frank narrowly escaped with life when thus surprised in case managed to reach spot where horse must climb side before water took off foot greatest danger however of road arose from lawless men frequented coach be frequently stopped plundered even gold escort be attacked with success strong party of miner sometimes went out in pursuit of highwayman be very seldom that success attended for great forest extended so vast distance over hill that anything like thorough search be impossible frank however treated danger lightly never carried money with save what received on arrival at camp for carriage of good while flour bacon other store carried up offered temptation to robber illustration attack on gold escort one evening however having be detained hour before must cross river swollen by thunderstorm be travelling along road much later than usual moon be shining brightly a long team of mule descended hill meditated camping for night at foot suddenly heard pistol shot ahead followed by five six others ordering men to follow slowly put spur to horse drawing revolver galloped on firing have ceased just a caught sight of coach standing at bottom of hill three body be lying in road passenger be in act of alighting under pistol of four mounted men who stood beside rode up at full speed turk bounding beside highwayman turned two pistol shot be fired at new comer ball whistled close to frank did not answer fire until arrived within three pace of nearest highwayman whom shot dead other three fired frank felt sensation a of hot iron crossing cheek while left arm dropped useless by side of highwayman fell under next shot at same instant turk with tremendous bound leapt at throat of one of others who be in act of levelling pistol impetus be so tremendous that man horse rolled in road pistol exploding harmlessly in air struggle on ground lasted few second then turk having disposed of adversary turned to look after fresh foe field be clear for remaining robber have on seeing turk turned horse with cry of alarm ridden away at full speed passenger crowded round frank thanking for rescue be glad to have be of use frank said to have arrived just in time now will one of help off horse for left arm be broken think driver of coach have be shot through heart by first shot fired by robber there be two armed guard one of whom have be killed other wounded while two of passenger who have left coach to take part in defence have also be killed wounded guard be helped down from coach have done good night work said to frank there be nigh ten thousand ounce of gold in coach doubt fellow got wind of intention of bank people at yuba to send down to sacramento be kept very dark too believe that one of passenger knew of must have sent more than two of to guard if have thought that have be let out there must have be one in secret who gave notice beforehand to chap now gentleman if one of will take ribbon will be moving on will get up beside will trouble of who have got colt to take place up behind there ai chance of attack to night still may a well look out now sir if will take place inside will take on until get to place where arm can be looked to will hear from director of bank a to night work frank team have now arrived on spot directed men to complete journey deliver store then to go down to stable where put up at sacramento there to wait arrival frank be left behind at next town fellow passenger overwhelming with thanks many having considerable amount of gold concealed about result in case of month work at digging one of proposed that man must contribute one fourth of gold carried to reward rescuer proposition be at once accepted frank however assured that although leading team of mule be well off in need of kind offer seeing that be in earnest fellow passenger again thanked cordially took place in coach be not to be balked in gratitude three day later very handsome horse with saddle holster with brace of colt revolver arrived up from sacramento for frank with best wish of passenger in coach on same day letter arrived saying that at meeting of director of bank have be resolved that a have saved from loss of fifty thousand pound by gallantry sum of two thousand pound must be placed to credit at bank in token of appreciation of great service have rendered illustration chapter xx message

course differ wholly entirely in style comparison can be made between only resemblance be that be built of white marble of two own prefer taj be afraid will never see that alice hardy said be quite content with milan must stop here for month month dear captain bayley exclaimed in consternation three day will be ample know agreed to stop here till friday then to go on to como well perhaps will let go on friday will have to dawdle about lake for time ca rush through a have be rushing through grand old italian town must have long rest there know yes suppose so old officer said reluctantly

at whole case matter really lay between that be just a probable that took note sent to a that must have taken sent to yourself harry urged indeed that fred have far greater motif for doing so than for whereas have only to get out of stupid scrape must be playing for money be to leave be heavy stake on other hand admitted that crime of stealing note for purpose of ruining must be infinitely greater than taking of money in case have nearly worried into lunatic asylum over matter have be away from england for upwards of year partly for sake of harry here who have got rid of box long ago now get

home without adventure next morning captain bayley took frank to mr griffith told story a have learned from frank there griffith said triumphantly when have finished if be not ready to admit that be most obstinate pig headed fellow that ever lived give up altogether be wrong be glad to see lawyer said smiling can not admit be wrong a far a evidence be before went certainly with light young friend have thrown upon matter can not doubt that view took be correct one still remember there be still actual proof such a court of justice must go upon morally may be convinced unless obtain further evidence think be in position openly to charge fred barkley with stealing ten pound note do see how be to set about getting such evidence be going to try anyhow captain bayley said frank be going down to westminster to morrow to open investigation again with what know now be hard if manage to get something illustration chapter xxii cleared at last following day after lunch captain bayley frank drove round to westminster football be going on in dean yard frank recognised among player many face that knew seemed strange to to think that while have gone through so much have grown from boy into man that have changed so little have be working away regularly at old round of euripides homer terence virgil carriage stopped at entrance to dean yard alighting walked across to mr richards captain bayley have written line to master asking if possible to remain at home a wished particularly to see frank be ushered straight into master study shook hand with captain bayley whose acquaintance have made while frank have boarded with then looked at frank for minute did not recognise then exclaimed in surprise frank norris yes be sir frank said ask to take hand for believe guilty of crime of be accused here can only say now a said then that be innocent know now be fool to run away instead of facing out be desperate because one thought guilty schoolfellow did not norris mr richards said think that did even at first few hour afterwards almost knew be innocent have not run away must have gone far to prove frank gave exclamation of joy captain bayley exclaimed indignantly then why did not prove sir why did allow nephew to remain with foul disgrace on name did not act without consideration mr richards said calmly norris have gone resolved if returned again to say what have learned proof be not absolute have made seemed to terrible mistake did not wish to cause ruin to boy unless be absolutely necessary to do so to clear norris now that have returned can no longer hesitate before begin must ask whether suspicion have fallen on one else be not suspicion sir be certainty captain bayley said have doubt that whole thing be work of frank rascally cousin fred barkley be know sort of rival of frank for favour have reason to believe have determined that frank must inherit larger portion of property thus have motive for bringing disgrace on be just a probable that must have stolen money sent to frank a frank must have stolen so far seemed to that might lie between of have settled case in mind be have learned that fred be intrusted with letter by frank to declaring innocence a know never doubted until frank left without writing to that letter never received believe that be suppressed in second place be fred who persuaded cousin to take ruinous step of running away pressed upon money to enable to do so although have refused to lend halfpenny when frank required to pay broken nosed tailor to hold tongue very well mr richards said then can speak freely silence be caused to considerable extent by regard for feeling have lost one nephew who have gone away with cloud of disgrace surrounding for aught must tell norris in despair might have committed suicide might have so cut off from that might never have heard from again thus then felt that must be cruel indeed to prove that other nephew be villain unless by so doing must restore norris to so after much thought deliberation determined to hold tongue until heard that norris have returned have be heard of on morning when be discovered that frank have fled called up one by one whole of boy in house even after flight must not believe that norris have done thing be so absolutely contrary to knew of disposition determined to sift matter to bottom from elder boy learned nothing although questioned most closely a to everything have taken place in house during past week be not disappointed for have hardly expected to learn much from be from four boy who be fag of four who have be in frank secret hoped to learn something be not mistaken from three in house learned nothing when came to pearson who be barkley junior fag met with even more success than have expected at first of course boy did not like to say anything told that unless answered question freely must have up before doctor litter then told knew about more willingly for like most other boy in school be fond of norris while barkley be by mean kind master said that twice barkley have got into rage with about thing did seem of importance first occasion be week previous have gone into barkley study to ask to explain difficulty in caesar door be not fastened a have be working with shoe off barkley did not hear till be close to table boy noticed that have sheet of writing paper before on be writing not in usual hand in printed character must have thought nothing of have not barkley on looking up seeing standing there jumped up in sudden rage boxed ear furiously calling prying little sneak boy must not fix to day be certainly just about time when letter be posted to other affair have happened day previously have gone into barkley room with book on coming down from school at twelve o'clock seeing on table letter stamped ready for post supposed that a usual be to post be running downstairs with in hand when met barkley coming up 'what have got there ' asked ' be taking letter to post said whereupon barkley flew into rage called officious little beast gave box in ear took letter from asked boy if noticed to whom letter be directed said have that be to knowing nothing about suppression of letter of norris thinking that perhaps barkley have written to uncle about matter have then changed mind about posting second affair did not strike a having importance whatever first matter however seemed important for just at time when letter be sent to norris written in printing character barkley must have be seen writing letter of sort struck a most remarkable although did not know exactly how two lad stood in reference to yourself struck at once that be at least possible that have be wrong that be barkley after who took note have suspected for instant that have done to bring disgrace upon cousin must at once have communicated with dr litter have probed affair from bottom thought that have taken note with intention of helping cousin out of difficulty that when note be traced matter became public have in base cowardly manner allowed frank to bear blame must have be bad enough in conscience although comparatively venial to deliberate attempt to bring disgrace upon norris however matter seemed bad enough to a stood a said shrunk from causing ruin of young fellow unless be necessary to clear norris hesitated for long time whether knowing a much a did ought not to take step in matter for reason have told determined to wait hoping that must soon have norris back again knowing must hear of return from of boy who be special friend barkley must have seen from manner that there be something wrong between never asked reason for change in manner to completely ignored coolness be relief to when time came for going up to university for then felt that of responsibility be off shoulder be longer shirking duty to expose be captain bayley think that with what have told be quite sufficient to bring guilt home to true party to completely clear norris quite sufficient captain bayley said be thankful indeed that obtained one missing link of evidence necessary to prove frank innocence be greatly obliged to mr richards for kind thoughtful manner in acted be indeed in way for best for have
