returned be able to start anew upon something like old footing be not at house however a much a have before be for london season be now beginning in earnest be out nearly night captain bradshaw alice too be good deal out for although old man must have greatly preferred to remain quietly at home yet for alice sake went into society when there enjoyed perhaps more than did must have quiet rubber for while must then go into dancing room look on with pleasure at admiration alice attracted indeed alice have many admirer for be strikingly elegant girl heiress not few of government clerk who form so large proportion of dancing men of london must have willingly enough exchanged arduous duty of copying endorsing letter for charge of alice heathcote fortune alice gave slight encouragement to of be one of girl with whom partner very soon get upon pleasant term be perfectly natural straightforward unaffected sensible herself expecting amount of sense from others sort of girl with whom flirtation be next to impossible upon evening when have engagement be captain bradshaw alice often alone for in proportion a visit of frank have decreased in frequency during last three month of fred bingham have increased very pleasant did make upon evening full of amusing anecdote rattling on with constant stream of fun nonsense aroused alice kept captain bradshaw in state of good temper indeed alice felt really grateful to fred bingham for rather dreaded evening alone with uncle amused interested too with talk for fred be undoubtedly clever yet must hardly explain to herself why did not like be partly old standing feeling from day when have first come to house lad of sixteen child of twelve have felt sort of jealousy of for playfellow frank sake frank have never felt for own from passing remark have heard from servant from other reason have come to entertain feeling that have interfered with frank position child be keenly jealous have always looked upon frank a guardian son heir considered new comer to be rival of frank along have cherished impression along have thought that fred be trying to supplant cousin in captain bradshaw affection must scarcely have given reason for belief be not what actually said did be way true fred bingham never spoke ill of cousin in way on contrary frequently praised in alice jealous ear there be current of implied blame in very praise must rather that have abused frank openly to uncle than praise a did then too be always fond of drawing frank into argument when uncle be present frank never showed to advantage in wordy conflict be greatly deficient in quiet suavity must not hear view considered vicious expressed hold peace dissent quietly frank gave opinion with energy heartiness even with vehemence plunged into argument a if be personally aggrieved by opinion stated upon other side denounced scouted a heresy dangerous to mankind strong conservative hated radicalism with personal hatred must willingly have buckled on armour have settled matter by combat to death between champion of other party in conflict then fred be constantly provoking fred with quiet sneering manner must greatly gain advantage straight thrust must be too fine delicate for cousin slashing two handed blow not unfrequently ended by frank losing temper during frank absence abroad fred have be great deal at lowndes square have at least so alice thought tried hard to gain place of first favourite with captain bradshaw in have not succeeded at present however while uncle be still smarting under overthrow of pet plan alice have fear that fred bingham attention adroit flattery be attaining effect indeed for time being became prime favourite with uncle in absence captain bradshaw must sound praise loudly to ward generally coupling with disparaging remark of disgraced frank at first alice have listened in silence finding that be becoming favourite theme with uncle spoke out warmly in frank defence declaring roundly that there be more truth honesty in little finger than in cousin whole composition uncle a be wont although nowise convinced be yet fain to let matter drop for present in addition to championship of frank alice have reason for speaking out so decidedly have for time felt that fred be endeavouring to make specially agreeable to now thought that uncle be inclined to favour effort now alice have a have be said positive dislike to fred bingham although must not help being amused by talk yet believed that jesting fun be mere cloak concealed scheming crafty disposition after year of careful watching be convinced be playing deep game for uncle fortune now saw at once that in same way be wishing to add fortune to pile that cared in slightest degree for did not for moment believe now of thought suspicion opinion on part of alice heathcote fred bingham have not remotest conception shrewd a be keenly alive to everything concerned own interest be yet completely in dark a to alice heathcote sentiment regarding woman in general knew little of understood even le beside be intensely vain have be made little god of at home mother sister looked up to a best of human being be never tired of doing homage over over again mother have said in hearing that freddy ought to marry well for girl must feel flattered by attention fred own experience when did go into society be that girl be amused by fun caustic humour be profoundly ignorant of fact that girl very seldom do fall in love with men who amuse fred bingham then have long looked upon success with alice heathcote a certainty only awaiting making up mind before frank have left england indeed fred have rather doubted whether alice heathcote did not prefer cousin to believed that long absence have quite put beyond pale a rival when upon frank return have observed that there be sort of reserve on alice part towards that reserve apparently increased rather than lessened with time considered own success a secured then too with great pleasure have seen that frank be somehow in disgrace took opportunity of absence to make greatest progress possible what be cause of frank disgrace fred be ignorant a captain bradshaw have upon occasion even hinted cause of displeasure have done so fred must have done in power to keep apart a be be obliged to let matter take course sole reason why fred bingham have not long before proposed to alice heathcote be because be doubtful about not doubtful a to whether loved for upon point have question at indeed have belief whatever in love looked upon a absurdity quite out of place in business if two people liked other must get on well together match be mutually advantageous what more must be desired question in mind be must get on well with alice heathcote liked well enough yes really liked very much match must be advantageous one be not quite so easy in mind a to whether must get on well with now fred idea of wife who must get on well with be woman who must do just a be told who must never set up opinion against who must in fact be specie of bond slave to will now have great doubt whether alice heathcote must do be in fact little afraid of there be quiet decision firmness about made feel uncomfortably that combat between must be hard fought one then too be tall fred did not like tall woman fancied sometimes that if got into passion with herand allowed that have hasty tempershe must look down coldly contemptuous at there be difficulty presented have for time kept fred bingham in state of uncertainty alice heathcote fortune be knew about also that be own absolutely fred felt certain that captain bradshaw must see that greater part if not whole of be settled upon at marriage now fred bingham be very much pressed for ready money be embarking with father in several extensive affair in capital be essential more than once thought have turned to young lady have met near manchester who have lost father whose mother be old weak who have fortune of about amount of of alice heathcote at own disposal miss farrer be pretty with weak prettiness must not stand time appearance did not belie character be affectionate amiable weak girl fred have be very

singular unreasonable in extreme bless carry said surprise why must mr maynard come again came over to see after be very glad that did come that might thank why in name of goodness must come again carry have particular reason to give so only said generally that thought must come again now carry be not at like call unreasonable why because mr maynard saved life afterwards took trouble to come down to see must be bound to come again to place like to talk to people like really ca conceive carry for once in life be wrong be sure will own carry did not own tossed head little in dissent at light in father put father be sure mr maynard be pleased with very pleased chatted together like friend upon travel sort of thing be sure did not look down upon at not for time being carry stephen walker said gravely mr maynard be gentleman treated under own roof a gentleman found that have topic upon must discourse in common be doubt surprised perhaps a say pleased carry there be thousand of men of own class in life with whom have not only that hundred other topic in common why must come down here to talk to carry be really not reasonable carry be silent must not explain that be angry that frank maynard have not come down to see be therefore obliged to let matter drop still upon subsequent reflection carry did not feel le piqued be hurt be angry with for being so if did not care to see certainly did not care for seeing there be plenty of other gentleman same a be who must appreciate be eager enough to talk with if mr maynard came again must take care to let know that there be other people just a good a be who be not too high mighty to admire there be mr bingham for instance be always there always kind pleasant cheerful evidently cared for here carry thought wandered off yes must be very nice to be lady more living in little shop selling newspaper tobacco real lady with nice dress servant perhaps carriage above home for dear old father after trouble care oh how nice must be how very happy carry thought have be gloomy enough at commencement of reverie ended by drawing very bright picture indeed carry thought once fairly directed to subject returned again to very frequently by what father have said must have be lady have not be unfortunate why must not regain position for herself indeed have felt strongly attracted by fred bingham liked merry good tempered cheerful young fellow be so attentive so evidently fond of indeed be only strong influence one visit of frank maynard have exercised over have hitherto kept feeling in check now smarting with pique resentment against frank feeling returned with redoubled force why asked must throw away honest love for chimera why must not make happy with fred bingham so from time relaxed in stiffness with visit to tobacconist became longer more frequent conversation between more interesting confidential there be le of badinage now more of blushing on part carry be very simple innocent girl brought up under father wing have absolutely thought of evil a soon a really felt fred bingham loved have little hesitation in giving whole heart to in feeling very happy in so doing so time went on gossip of street began to remark how very often that fair young gentleman be in at walker shop ill natured one soon began to shake head to say be pity carry walker have not mother to look after indeed be be ignorant unsuspicious of harm a una only unfortunately have lion to protect mother must have told that even if considered engaged to fred bingham a in two three month did must yet be much wiser not to meet accidentally so often during walk at father wish be in habit of taking daily carry have such adviser never dreamt on edge of what precipice be walking chapter vi losing glove tell what frank be getting extremely snappish disagreeable prescott said one day to friend sooner go out of town better do know prescott quite agree with be be sick of sort of life want change be talking of buying yacht

must really write to mr drake not formal letter know friendly straightforward one say that be desirous of paying address to niece that in confusion number of people in house have not opportunity of doing so before that be perfectly unaware of feeling towards that be desirous of being short time in society again before speak to therefore ask if will again extend hospitality to think be about way

if knew for certain have come down to make formal love to prescott must destroy chance altogether must request absolutely that katie will know nothing about may guess what like ca take high ground

towards katie when recovered from astonishment be most delighted have given one long whistle of surprise when have arrived at second line have read on to end in silence without heeding question of girl a to what be matter with now teddy what be sarah asked a finished what doe frank say to surprise so for teddy have apprised who correspondent be before have begun to read be what doe say teddy repeated in order to gain time to invent answer yes of course teddy how tiresome be frank be thinking of becoming monk joining holy community no be talking nonsense teddy well sarah be talking of going out to arabia becoming dancing dervish ask sarah katie said indignantly if doe choose to tell sure want to know come along will go practise duet when have left room teddy turned to father mother

be a serious a possible time teddy said read out portion of frank letter be very glad mr drake said to think have never guessed be so glad be such nice fellow will be very good thing for katie think so robert yes dear see objection in way mr maynard be little too rackety to suit know that will be objection in katie eye by mean teddy write ask to come down try do anything foolish if can help speak about coming if have not made sort of mystery about letter morning must have mentioned naturally enough that be coming down for short time for change of air must have made excuse other a be will be better to say nothing about leave to explain matter for a best can ask to come down say on tuesday there be gig at door be ready teddy upon reaching office teddy drake sat down to write to frank maynard dear frank be delighted at hearing that be smitten by archer boy be that delicate way of putting especially that person by whom be so smitten be cousin katie by way according to way of putting katie must be archer boy be absurd so metaphor be wrong somewhere after reading over several time ca for life of see where however see what mean katie archer boy have somehow have to do with business have got mixed up together till ca tell be seriously be awfully glad frank to think of falling in love with katie never dreamt of such thing elder be equally surprised now that have told about fancy that sarah may have have suspicion that there be weakness somewhere for sometimes when name have be mentioned have be rather inclined to chaff katie katie have resented very seriously father sends word that will be very glad if will come down stay with again named next tuesday come by ten o'clock train in morning get here at three will meet at station have read a much of letter a be necessary to elder a well a be pleased at thought of katie coming together will strictly obey injunction say nothing to girl about object of coming indeed will not say be coming at for be too surprised when got letter to invent excuse at time if be to say anything about now must think be odd did not mention at time must suspect something be up if however must rather not take by surprise line by return of post then will say that have written to say be coming for few day on way say to ireland on reading over letter find be barely coherent dare say will understand very truly e drake katie o'byrne have thought more often during two month of frank maynard than be at satisfactory to herself have so repeatedly asserted that did not like that assurance lost power even with at last however must no longer shut eye to fact be forced to own that have be deceiving along that did like yes like frank maynard very much be with deep mortification that katie made confession even to herself because in spite of what sarah have said did not believe that frank have ever thought of because have so teazed made fun of that told ought to hate still when thought over sentence about sea quiet tone in have said yes katie will believe day colour must mount up into cheek must think that perhaps after did care for although miss o'byrne came at last to own to herself that have be wrong that liked frank maynard very very much be by mean disposed to make same concession to sarah so whenever cousin turned conversation to subject said how missed frank wondered whether must ever come again katie manifested such perfect indifference upon point sarah at last came to conclusion that have made mistake that there be chance of ever winning glove on tuesday afternoon girl be together in drawing room looked over lawn teddy have gone down to station have not katie asked yes ordered dog cart to be at office at three in time to take to meet train wonder what can be up to for when said so winked at mamma shook head frowned smiled too wonder what can be about indeed know katie said suppose be worth guessing about know sarah said there have be something going on for last two three day between teddy mamma quiet joke be not sure papa be not in too for have seen smiling two three time to when there be nothing going on to smile at do know katie have idea that be something about faith be not curious sarah katie said composedly teddy will be back in few minute secret will keep till then presently heard sound of wheel in drive sarah said come along katie will catch in hall see what be brought went out followed by cousin a went into large front door be opened teddy entered followed by frank maynard sarah uttered exclamation of surprise hurried forward to meet a did so katie whispered indignantly sarah hate will never forgive why frank sarah said warmly be surprise be glad to see again be glad to be back again sarah then frank turned to katie who be coming forward slowly rather reluctantly for felt that cheek be telling unmistakably that be not uninterested in unexpected arrival frank greeted with how be miss o'byrnebut need not ask be charming be looking way flatter that be from pleasure at seeing again mr maynard say that miss o'byrne be downright cruel have be picturing to myself sitting with watch in hand counting minute to arrival be wrong anyhow katie said with indignant triumph for did not even know be coming teddy said turning to cousin why did not tell mr maynard be coming down asked not to say anything about miss o'byrne frank said seeing katie be really indignant to sister thought must be surprise hoped pleasant one really truly did not know sarah katie asked for up to time believed that have be plot on part of others to keep in dark that sarah especially have endeavoured to surprise by bringing suddenly upon frank really truly katie have more idea than have well katie said mollified in case forgive teddy thought be tricking did mean to be cross mr maynard said frankly only thought be being made fool of hate shook hand with again looked up unflinchingly at with honest eye be not until evening that when sarah be playing frank have opportunity of speaking alone to katie be sorry vexed miss o'byrne be stupid of to be vexed katie said always hate surprise thought sarah have known along be trying to make look ridiculous be sorry for mr maynard then be not really sorry to see again katie be not that katie said gently be not have be looking forward so much to seeing again frank said oh yes girl answered suppose wanted one to plague do really dislike being plagued katie honestly now wo do more if do be silent awhile then said did not like at first now begin to understand mind only ca help being vexed then be ashamed afterwards yes katie frank said know used to teaze abominably remember what told about sea well mr maynard talked so much nonsense can hardly remember one part more than katie rose to go to piano frank must see by face that did remember for katie did not go into sarah room night kissed at door sarah said katie dear kid glove will be mine after cousin did not answer went on into room shut door be happy felt that need not check now really have cause to think that frank loved herand although have laughingly turned off word felt be in earnestshe longer struggled with feeling acknowledged to herself that along have loved next week passed very quietly frank still teazed katie katie fought sturdily felt battle be lost there be mistaking quiet tone in sometimes spoke to so different from general strain of light jesting with way in spoke to others fought because be nature to fight be no longer indignant at salliesfought a beaten enemy surrounded outnumbered fight a matter of honour not of hope resisted occasionally tried to struggle against influence exerted over bird be in net knew beat wing fluttered in vain ere fortnight be over frank held to heart struggle be over be content to nestle there quietly answered a wished to question do believe at last dear katie chapter vii gathering cloud cloud have fallen upon little shop in new street stephen walker be restless anxious for feel that something be going

who used to be so lively gay who be always humming scrap of song over work have now become silent abstracted if noticed that father be watching must break out in burst of fitful merriment talking laughing in forced unnatural way be even more painful than silence stephen walker be long time before arrived reluctantly at conclusion that there be something wrong with carry at first tried hard to persuade that change existed only in own imaginationthat be little poorly perhaps nothing more at last must no longer deceive there be evidently something mentally physically altogether wrong with very sadly old man pondered over matter wearied with conjecture a to what must be cause have bodily ill quite repudiated suggestion made to effect be perfectly well said stephen walker at last came to

frequently interposed in favour of defaulting tenant have endeavoured to mitigate severe measure fred be disposed to put in force against at other time must have be greatly shocked at news have heard now quite lost sight of heartlessness cruelty of fred conduct in imminence of danger whole thought be devoted to consideration of best course to be pursued under circumstance must arrive at conclusion however except that have better summon fred back to town at once at last therefore sat down in earnest to write saying solemnly a did so well after will believe anything to think that son fred bingham must have acted in such insane way a thiswith girl too in own neighbourhoodand above must have allowed connection with captain bradshaw to be known to be beyond human comprehension with reflection drew paper towards wrote in beautifully neat handwriting in one must have detected least sign of haste agitation a follows dear fred if anyone have asked hour ago whether considered capable of acting like fool madman must have given one answer if be asked now must give altogether one mr walker have be here having previously visited captain bradshaw to whom mentioned that daughter have drowned in thames that be not altogether unconnected with circumstance to announced intention of devoting rest of life to occupation of keeping friend acquaintance work people au fait in matter must say that be

bingham be staying at cromer when letter reached be laughing talking to young wife a opened father letter first glance at content froze word on lip never have colour to speak of face turned ghastly pallor first thought shot through be horror at news of carry death second be consternation at consequence to wife be startled alarmed at face made gesture to not to mind even in short fortnight have elapsed since marriage have learnt that must be obeyed fred bingham rose from table walked to window then came back again said have got troublesome news from town margaret will go out for walk think over take breakfast will have mine when come back for hour fred bingham paced up down upon sand here be plan hope destroyed by own carelessness how must have be fool enough to tell carry walker about uncle still have promised not to tell father even have supposed that father might have found out who must have dreamt that old imbecile must have ever turned round become dangerous everything have turned out unfortunate there be carry well yes be very sorry for very sorry indeed what did do for really looked a if be just out of perverseness when have intended to have acted kindly to made comfortable thus to upset everything drive father into sort of madness destroy chance in life be too provoking however one thing be evident must take father advice go up at once to london must see captain bradshawof course must be most terrible interviewbut must be got through perhaps after time might be able to put matter in better light of course promise of marriage must be denied there be proof whatever of except last letter of assertion carry might have made must of course plead temptation yes be terribly bad business something might be got out of fire thus thinking at last went back to hotel ate hearty breakfast told wife that must go up to london on imperative business for twenty four hour said that must stay where be for house must not be ready for for week must only be in way

section of railway rail model of bridge tunnel many other engineering odds end mr bingham be standing in favourite position on hearthrug with back to empty fireplace when fred entered well fred must congratulate on having made a nice mess of affair a must well be imagined there be too late to talk about now fred said shortly have made fool of ca tell that more strongly than feel question be what be to be done own idea be that have better go see captain bradshaw at onceof course knowing nothing about what have taken place will do indignant must be penitent then of course will urge youth inexperience artful woman crafty old father so on create a good impression a can profess regret for loss of good opinion more than of future fortune take leave much depressed leave thing alone for few week before approach again suppose be about line recommend yes fred know that want much advice from father said dryly by way must say same sort of thing to mother when see be in room heard have be terribly put out of course doe not blame fred looked annoyed be sorry old lady heard must talk over best way to shut madman mouth well will go get business over at once will come in to han place after leave let know result be not with very comfortable feeling fred bingham knocked at captain bradshaw door for felt that be by mean improbable that order might have be given that be not to be admitted footman however opened door admitted a usual how be james uncle in yes sir be in be not wellsomething wrong sir added with privileged loquacity of old domestic oh indeed fred said carelessly miss heathcote be in be in wo see sir be poorly tookept room yesterday to day master be in study sir fred bingham braced up for scene a followed footman to study servant opened door announced mr bingham fred entered captain bradshaw appeared to have be dozing in easy chair looked up to fred astonishment instead of saluting with torrent of invective merely said why fred be soon back again in town tired of honeymoon already fred be too much surprised to answer at once be rapidly revolving in mind whether manner be mere mask assumed by uncle however after moment pause answered not tired at uncle have to run up to town for day on business go down to cromer to morrow again think might have told be going to be married fred well uncle hate fuss about thing be married a quietly a possible so thought must say nothing about until must tell that be over well well one to taste one to taste captain bradshaw said evidently thinking of something else then sat in moody thought fred bingham looked at in astonishment what must mean did uncle intend to keep in ignorance of knowledge of affair of carry be possible that did not know after stephen walker have only intended to frighten have not be to captain bradshaw at hope be dispelled by old man next remark fact be fred be out of sort have heard piece of news have upset terribly indeed uncle be fred must say yes fred very bad affair so bad that can hardly realise paused again what be uncle fred asked with effort for be far more alarmed at tone of quiet sadness on part of uncle than must have be at most furious burst of passion yes fred will tell circumstance old man called upon night before last be half beside with grief anger man name be walkerstephen walker remembered name because have heard before under peculiar circumstance one day last winter seems slipped down in knightsbridge cousin frank picked up just a omnibus be going to run over perhaps remember hearing of fred must only nod uncle have mentioned fact to with great glee at time have not mentioned name be until now ignorant that be stephen walker whom frank have rescued did not however speak be too anxiously preparing for blow felt sure uncle be reserving a climax for prolix story little time afterwards frank came in one evening told have be to see man that have pretty daughtera very pretty daughter told frank have better not go there againit be dangerousand frank saw promised not to go again drop of perspiration stood on fred bingham forehead a uncle went on slow approaching to catastrophe be almost more than must bear have great mind to throw at uncle foot cry for mercy before must determine upon expediency of move uncle went on night before last a told man came here to cry for justice vengeance have just come up from gravesend where have be to see body of daughter who have drowned in thames who have be seduced under promise of marriage by infernal scoundrel frank maynard fred bingham have half risen from seat with intention of throwing at uncle knee when substitution of frank name for own astonished into sharp cry of surprise frank maynard ah may well be astonished fred must not have believed itno must not have believed possible there be doubting man be too terribly in earnest fred bingham sat in stupified astonishment shock be too great too sudden for even constitutional coolness first thought when did think waswas mere ruse on part of uncle be really deceived a looked at old man serious face remembered perfect simple mindedness frankness saw at once that uncle be acting double partthat really believed be frank not who have be offender fred remembered too that servant have said alice be ill keeping room be very certain that news of own downfall must not so affect be evident that frank be really looked upon a offender once conscious of whirl of thought flashed through brain how must extraordinary mistake have occurredand more important still must profit by keep up error must confess fault be own throw on uncle mercy while be yet debating question captain bradshaw went on old man asked for justice punishment on destroyer of child will have until now fred tell fairly frank have be favourite nephew from time be child have looked upon a son heir have left two third of property remainder to yourself yesterday wrote to solicitor requesting to draw out new will leaving everything to yourself fred be decided now must risk be evident that if confessed fault must get nothing if must keep up extraordinary mistake must get really risked nothing for if be found out must be worse off then than if confessed now be worth trying for at rate host of danger rose up before put aside to consider meet a might occur be great stake be playing for whole of mr bradshaw estate nothing for if confessed must certainly get nothing spoke coolly collectedly thank for kind intention uncle can hardly think of now be so surprised so shocked at terrible story must not have believed that frank must do thing knew be rash headstrong heard indeed story whispered about at cambridge must neverno not for momenthave believed capable of such cold blooded villany a seems to have be oh uncle there must surely be mistake fred there be mistake be too true there be mistaking man manner be terribly in earnest fred bingham said more for while sat thinking deeply on course to pursue at last said what do mean to do about frank uncle do mean to write tell what have discovered have be writing afternoon have not sealed letter there can read what have said if have excuse to offer for himselfnot that can possibly have anyhe will write urge fred bingham took letter read through very slowly in order to give more time to think letter recapitulated incident connected with frank first knowledge of tobacconist recalled warning given to respecting pretty daughter promise not to call there again then recited stephen walker visit terrible charge brought against concluded by cutting off connection with forbidding ever to speak to uncle again fred saw at once that frank upon receipt of letter must insist upon explanation must go to tobacconist bring round in triumph to prove innocence that own guilt must infallibly appear well fred what do think of letter uncle asked at last be conclusive be not quite so uncle nothing must be better what fred captain bradshaw asked well uncle agree with of course that nothing can be more base heartless than frank conduct stillstill see have only just married be not attempting much a wish must do so to urge point in frank favour at same time uncle think of misery of wife if get that letter first day return home open before might for instance laughingly ask to open letter tell what be about letter especially knowing handwriting must suppose must contain nothing might not read imagine poor girl feeling happiness must be destroyed for life surely uncle frank punishment must be too severe now if be to write letter using language like towards himabusing a much a please telling have forfeited place in esteem be henceforth to be strangersuch letter must not have same effect upon doubt must be able to make excuse must satisfy at same time conscience must tell cause of indignation must be able to write make excuse must for conduct if did not write must know be because have nothing whatever to urge in palliation very right very kindly thought of boy captain bradshaw said warmly god know there have be mischief enough done already wish to wreck young creature life yes will write exactly a advise a say will leave open for to make plausible explanation like to own conscience will tell what mean a for making excuse to be afraid be altogether out of power old man sighed deeply be indeed most distressing affair uncle be indeed sorry for sake for of alice also for know be very fond of frank doe know of sad business yes fred be obliged to tell must have be informed why connection with frank be to cease be terribly cut up cling to hope that frank may have sort of apology explanation to make confess see that be possible must hope that will uncle be sad business be truly sorry for sake good night now will be up again in week so will then bring wife to see do fred do will be very glad to see new niece fred bingham did not go straight to han place walked several time round lowndes square thinking deeply over new unexpected state of affair there be doubt have difficult dangerous game to play must not have willingly embarked upon have be in way forced upon accepted risk without flinching have confidence in excitement intrigue exactly suited stake be worth playing for have double value in eye in be to be won at expense of frank at rate have consolation that if be beaten must be worse off than if have thrown up card a hopeless at first uncle must have cast off at once must do more if ever found out truth there must be doubt then that have chosen only possible course to think that affair have seemed destruction to hope must now turn out to have established a uncle sole heir whereas be previously to have have only third seemed almost too good to be true how blundering old idiot walker must have made mistake fred must not at first imagine came to correct conclusion that must have said nephew only without mentioning name captain bradshaw have jumped to conclusion that nephew be frank now a to future there be two risksthe one from frank other from stephen walker a to frank have already achieved great point of having letter worded ambiguously if frank wrote to demand explanation must somehow intercept letter prevent reaching captain bradshaw then must see frank do what must to keep asunder then a to madman walker must not be likely to go again to captain bradshaw be most unlikely must captain bradshaw be likely to go to a to threat to dog tell everyone about affair be unpleasantvery unpleasantand must if possible be put stop to at rate must not be likely to come to captain bradshaw ear none of fred friend be acquainted with uncle if walker be to see tell story uncle must not come to hear of from what other danger be therealice yes alice be certainly danger did not exactly see how disliked be very fond of frank be thoughtful earnest girl must be very likely to take step to inquire further be even possible that might go see stephen walker yes thought alice be quite capable of if doe so be up with fred stopped in walk at new thought be indeed dangera danger against saw prevention in vain did think over possible plan nothing satisfactory must be imagined said at last a walked on again if doe that be lost only hope be to get out of way how be to be done see chapter xiv shop to let one thing fred bingham quite settled in mind a walked slowly in direction of han place be that must on account tell father of mistake have occurred mr bingham might be sharp practitioner fred felt that even to shield be possible that father might refuse to have anything to do with scheme of laying blame upon frank maynard shoulder even must consent to conceal truth hold knowledge of such secret a must give must be most unpleasant be quite possible that father might not always get on well together for latter fred thought be hardly sharp enough for time might become drag certainly mr bingham must not be told well fred what news mr bingham asked a fred went into study better than must have expected fred said cheerfully old gentleman of course did savage be extremely penitent made impression on of course gave long lecture upon heinousness of offence parted pretty good friend fancy will come right in long run perhaps may seem friend fred when dy may find have left penny to frank perhaps so fred said in thoughtful voice dare say must if be to die to morrow now have once made footing good think will be able to work into old place in time from hint threw out too believe be not satisfied with frank be angry fancy because frank did not marry alice heathcote at rate there be coolness make le disposed to be severe with think will come right in end there be silence for minute two mr bingham being greatly surprised at fred easy escape for remembered how vindictive unforgiving captain bradshaw have be in wife case presently fred spoke again think something must be done to stop madman mouth have done mischief enough already if be to go about a threatened telling story to one will be horrible nuisance mr bingham thought for time then shook head be very much in earnest fred meant word said there be offering moneyit must make worse fred thought for time one must not begin by offering money still be poor money must be object to look here father must see what can do go round to in morning try talk over put to misery have caused in own family can pitch in strong know about old lady point out that be punished besides by losing hope of uncle money then talk about wife say be very delicate that if come to ear consequence will be most serious ask if wish to destroy happiness of innocent creature beg to be

conversation upon business matter then fred bingham started again for cromer in very much higher spirit than have felt on journey up day before fred bingham have not calculated erroneously when considered alice heathcote to be most dangerous enemy at first have be completely stunned by blow upon leaving uncle have gone up to own room have thrown upon bed too bewildered too stricken down even to cry lay there quiet white with hand pressed to forehead frank wicked scoundrel must not be must not be yet uncle who knew far more of world than did who have loved frank too seemed to have doubt question upon subject a thought over over did single ray of hope present to that have loved in vain that have married have be hard to bear be a nothing to to know that man in whom have put all faith trust love be after bad base man be almost bewildering if be false who must be true yet although in vain tried to find solutionany escapefrom dreadful accusation did not really believe instinct seemed to tell frank must never have acted altogether in way might have be wicked wrongshe feared there must be doubt about thatbut never must have be so deliberately base a said yet there be one explanation must in way lessen offence explanation involved grievous suspicion of that other now lying dead still alice did not know believed even now that knew something of frank woman like be disposed to throw blame anywhere so that weight upon might be lightened repeated to herself woman usual cry under circumstance must have be fault frank may have be wrong foolish weak never never must be so deliberately wicked a say be poor thing alice thought be very sad to think thing now be dead must have be partly to blame to shield have invented story of frank promising to marry at uncle death story alice elaborated gradually in interval of throbbing pain in temple having once elaborated clung to not a told that must make difference to be married must never see again for be certain that uncle must keep word still now might think of sometimes with sorrow regret pain without absolute horror idol be terribly cracked flawed indeed have not absolutely fallen to piece having at last persuaded that must be so fell asleep just a morning be breaking for next three day alice kept room completely prostrated with headache feeling altogether unequal to going downstairs to talk upon different matter with uncle still clung to belief that version of story have imagined to must turn out to be correct frank must not have be to blame a uncle believed more thought of character ever since have known more positive felt of at rate comparative innocence oh if must find out truth to do there be one waynamely to see stephen walker might then find out what foundation have for charge whether have absolute proof that frank have promised to marry daughter whether be merely poor girl own assertion be strange step perhaps for to take alice rather despised conventionality determined that must not allow frank to rest under dreadful accusation if must clear up besides must be fortnight before frank must arrive have opportunity of clearing alice in state of restless anxiety felt that must not wait for fortnight resolved upon saying nothing to uncle so after have gone to club went up put on thing telling footman to follow started for new street greatly disappointed be upon finding shop shut up being told that

of men spoke to have met within last day two said seemed a usual except perhaps that have not be very lively lately be perfectly astounded when asked whether anyone have noticed anything queer about evidently thought must be mad to ask thing no seems right enough that make whole affair more strange than ever what be to be done katie what do advise must say frank that can hing if be not mad how dare write to in way be infamous katie said very indignantly must not condescend to take notice of katie ca do captain bradshaw have always be very kind friend to be old man dear ca put up with

besides know much better what uncle be like than can know must not keep temper with think must katie frank laughed always said be terrible little spitfire know chapter xvi intercepted letter house in lowndes square be hardly pleasant abode about time captain bradshaw be irritable beyond measure servant led dreadful life with even alice heathcote have to take refuge in own room for alice herself be scarcely able to withstand excessive fractiousness ill temper of uncle be looking very ill be really unhappy alice have truly ceased to love frank maynard from day when have heard from own lip that did not love have striven hard against own feeling be not until knew that be engaged to that be able to quite win victory over have be mercilessly severe with have pictured frank a sharing home love with have insisted upon rejoicing over happiness have frequently brought subject round in conversation with frank so be that by joining in cousin talk a to future plan by entering into happy anticipation alice gradually conquered came to feel that must look upon frank quite a brother rejoice in seeing happy with a thus gradually conquered love became more a be before first destruction of hope grew calm possessed again step regained elasticity eye steady light when frank have come to say good bye before going down to wedding almost regretted that have refused earnest request to be one of bridesmaid for felt that must now have seen married with hardly pang new trial have once again broken down must not bear to think that frank who have be idol whom have looked up to a model of be good honest honourable must have done thing did not think clung to belief that must clear up on return at rate only from frank own lip from frank own handwriting must believe counted day to return when must get uncle letter must be sure repel accusation captain bradshaw too be longing for frank return not that doubted fact to mind be clearly established hoped that frank might be able to offer sort of palliation excuse might somehow put conduct in more favourable light might plead guilty to imprudence deny evil intention even when confessing fault might in fact in way other enable to forgive after due amount of scolding lecturing to restore to at least portion of old share of affection fred bingham too grew nervously anxious a time for frank return approached came back to town few day before frank be expected only called once upon uncle felt that must look better if be not to seem too anxious to step into place of favourite have be very careful during one visit to say nothing against frank knew that cousin have not yet received captain bradshaw letter for have said on leaving that must give address upon continent for that did not know where must go did not mean to be bothered with letter writing while be away there be therefore no danger until frank return then fred knew must at once write to demand explanation felt sure that uncle letter contained direct allusion to circumstance of frank be accused that therefore must produce proof of innocence indeed now that stephen walker have left new street be impossible great step then be to prevent captain bradshaw from receiving frank letter demanding explanation once done fred bingham felt certain of ground be playing difficult game for high stake felt pretty confident in own skill one fear be that frank in indignation might rush down to lowndes square personally demand explanation from uncle letter have be so extremely offensive that fred bingham hoped believed that frank must write on day upon knew
