effort hundred fifty thousand men into field a be exhausted have small reserve to draw upon while ally must with comparatively little difficulty put five hundred thousand men into field replenish a there be occasion that struggle be successfully carried on for seven year be due chiefly to military genius of king to indomitable perseverance to resolution that disaster must shake situation although apparently hopeless appall something be due also at commencement of war to splendid discipline of prussian army at time a comparatively few of who fought at lobositz must have stood in rank at torgau quickness of prussian people to acquire military discipline must have be great be aided by perfect confidence felt in king enthusiasm with inspired although be not nominally war for religion

expressed surprise even indignation that brother who have taken so prominent part in first rising must not have hastened to join prince charlie more thoughtful men felt be bad omen that did not do so be certainly not from want of adventurous spirit of courage for wherever adventure be to be obtained wherever blow be most plentiful james keith brother be certain to be in midst of maggie drummond knew reason for holding aloof for have shortly before coming over of prince charlie received short note from field marshal say that prince charles edward be meditating mad scheme of crossing to scotland raising standard there if so do what can to prevent husband from joining made poor hand of last time chance of success be vastly smaller now then be comparatively short time since stuart have lost throne of england there be great number who wished back now hanoverian be very much more firmly seated on throne present man have considerable army troop have have experience of war on continent have shown rare soldier be not brother lord marischal of scotland name somewhat widely known must not hang back from adventure however desperate example might lead many who might otherwise stand aloof to take up arm must bring think sure destruction upon therefore will restrain own inclination will watch what feel sure will be terrible tragedy from distance striking perhaps somewhat heavier blow than usual upon head of turk moor frenchman others to make up for not being able to use sword where inclination must lead king of france will assuredly give efficient aid to stuart have all along used a puppet by whose mean can when chooses annoy coerce england have belief that will render useful aid either now hereafter use then cousin influence to keep drummond at home knowing a do have great hope that will avail for know that be jacobite to backbone that if prince land will be one of first to join maggie have not carried out keith injunction have indeed told husband when received letter keith believed enterprise to be so hopeless one must not join in be a ardent in cause of stuart a be husband said single word to deter when hour after heard news of prince landing mounted rode off to

against turk tartar received two three of letter so long a remained in service of russia when however displeased empress elizabeth at once left service entered that of prussia letter again reached connection between france scotland have always be close french be language familiar to most of upper class since civil trouble began such number of scottish gentleman be forced either to shelter in france to take service in french other foreign army that knowledge of language became almost matter of necessity in one of short letter keith have told that of thing be necessary that lad must speak french with perfect fluency master a much german a possible be to point that education have be almost entirely directed a to french there be difficulty when recovered portion of estate maggie drummond be lucky in hearing of hanoverian trooper who having be wounded left behind in glasgow term of service having expired have on recovery married daughter of woman who have nursed be earning somewhat precarious living by giving lesson in use of rapier in teaching german gladly accepted offer to move out to kilgowrie where be established in cottage close to house where wife aided in housework became companion of fergus in walk ramble being honest pleasant fellow lad took to after few month conversation at first somewhat disjointed became easy animated learned too much from a to use of sword scotch clansman used claymore chiefly for striking under rudolph tuition lad came to be a apt with point a have before be with edge fully recognized great advantage of former by time reached age of sixteen skill with weapon be fully recognized by young clansman who on occasion of festive gathering sometimes came up to try skill with young laird from rudolph too came to know great deal of affair of europe a to have hitherto be profoundly ignorant learned how by capture of province of silesia from empress of king of prussia have from minor principality raised country to considerable power be regarded with hostility jealousy by neighbour be only small territory now rudolph fergus said 't be small master fergus position be very strong one silesia can not well be invaded save by army forcing way through very formidable defile while on other hand prussian force can suddenly pour out into saxony hanover prussia have perhaps best drilled army in europe though number be small in proportion to austria can put in field be compact force while austrian army be made up of many people must not be gathered with speed with frederick must place force in field king too be above thing soldier have good general troop be devoted to though discipline be terribly strict be pity that king of england be not good friend be natural ally country being protestant to say truth in hanover must be well pleased to see make common cause together must feel much more comfortable with prussia a friend than a possible enemy however 't be not likely that at present prussia will turn hand against hear by letter from home that be said that empress of russia a well a empress of austria hate frederick latter because have stolen silesia from former because have openly said thing about such a woman never forgives saxony poland be jealous of france none too well disposed so at present king of prussia be like to leave neighbour alone for may need to draw sword at time in self defence be few day after maggie drummond received short letter from cousin marshal james keith dear cousin by letter received few day since learned that fergus be now nearly sixteen year old be say a well grown strong a

foreign army did not contain considerable contingent of scottish soldier officer formed nearly third of army of gustavus adolphus service of protestant prince of germany have always be popular among then own cousin being marshal in prussian army seemed to mr drummond almost matter of course when time came that fergus must go to have for many year devoted to preparing lad for service nevertheless

that matter be comfortably settled lindsay said now be free men liberty wo last long will have to go on duty again in hour at rate there be time to go first with to tailor put uniform in hand wish to be measured for uniform of rd royal dragoon guard fergus said a entered shop proprietor came up to yes herr tautz excellency marshal keith lindsay put in wish to know that dress suit must be made instantly quicker if possible for majesty may at moment order mr drummond to attend upon mr drummond be appointed one of marshal aide de camp a therefore will often come under king eye may well believe that fit must be of best be likely to hear of a well a mr drummond will put in hand at once lieutenant will be cut out without delay in three hour if mr drummond will call here will be tacked together in readiness for first trying on by eight o'clock tomorrow morning will be ready to be properly fitted unless men have bungled very seldom do will be delivered by midday mr drummond lodge in next room to myself lieutenant said servant be looking after till get one of own so can leave with while conversation be going on two of assistant be measuring fergus will have uniform complete with belt helmet equipment everything except sword fergus said at least suppose lindsay can carry own sword yes king have made that concession be wonderful one for scottish officer in service may carry own sword see ours be longer straighter than german one most of have learnt exercise with certainly must not fight so well with others besides iron basket protects one hand wrist vastly better than foreign guard concession be first made only to general field officer aide de camp keith persuaded king at last to grant to scottish officer pointing out that be able to do much better service with own claymore than with weapon to be altogether unaccustomed scottish men be accustomed to fight with edge to strike downright sweeping blow whereas sword here be fitted only for point although doubtless superior in duel be far le effective in general melee must certainly be sorry to give up own sword fergus said be one of father since day when be big enough to begin to use have always exercised with though too have learned to use point great deal a have german instructor a well a several scottish one except in duel lindsay said must doubt if skill go for very much have never tried for have never have luck to be in battle fancy that in cavalry charge strength go for more than skill man who can strike quickly heavily will do more execution than one trained to sort of nice point feint grant that be useful when two men be watching other in heat of battle when one be cutting thrusting for life can not think that there be time for fooling about with weapon have by time left shop be strolling down street be there much duelling here be strictly forbidden lindsay said with laugh need hardly say that there be good deal of of course pain be taken that affair come to majesty ear fever fall from horse account satisfactorily enough for absence of officer from parade even total disappearance from scene can be similarly explained must affair come to king ear be best to keep out of way until have blown over of course with doe not matter quite so much a with prussian officer frederick be not only service open to good sword be welcome at russian austrian court to say nothing of of dozen minor principality at of be sure to find countryman friend if england really enters upon struggle seems to that if there be general row can scarcely stand aloof men who have learned drill seen service might be welcomed even if father wielded arm on losing side ten year ago of course to prussian officer must be practical ruin to be dismissed from army be so thoroughly well understood that in case of duel there be sort of general conspiracy on part of officer surgeon of regiment to hush matter up still if officer be insulted think that be insulted be about same thing fight take consequence be not altogether sorry that be aide de camp think that can congratulate on same fact for be not thrown a be regimental officer into company of prussian there be therefore far le risk of getting into quarrel have doubt marshal will give few lesson shortly be considered to be one of finest swordsman in europe in many respect be a young a be a fond of adventure gave few when first came to said that be time thrown away for must put in hand of good maitre d'armes before must teach anything must be useful have be working hard with one since know good deal more about than did teacher say that be too hot impetuous to make good swordsman that though must do well enough in melee will never be able to stand up against cool man in duel of course marshal have idea of teaching arm merely a said of showing few pass might be useful to on occasion in reality love to keep up sword play once twice week van bruff who be best master in berlin come in for hour practice with before breakfast after lindsay have left at entrance to palace fergus wandered about town for hour then went to tailor have uniform tried on merely run together though be coat fitted admirably be easy figure to fit herr drummond tailor said there be credit in putting together coat for breech be little too tight have much more powerful leg than be common however be easily altered here be dozen pair of high boot noticed size of foot have doubt that will find of to fit be indeed case among similar collection of helmet fergus also have difficulty in suiting think that will find everything ready for by past eight tailor said trust that further alteration will be required six of best journeyman will work night at clothes even must majesty send for by ten trust that will be able to make proper appearance before though at present can not guarantee that trifling alteration will not be found necessary when try uniform on fergus supped with marshal who have now time to ask many more question about home life state of thing in scotland 't be sore pity said that scotchman irishman who be to be found in such number in european army be not arrayed under flag of country methinks that time be not far distant when will be so be a know jacobite there be shutting one eye to fact that cause be lost one expedition of james third still more that of charles edward have caused such widespread misery among stuart friend can not conceive that further attempt of same kind will be made in fact there be one to make prince have lost almost friend by drunken habit quarrelsome overbearing disposition have gone from court to court a suppliant have everywhere alienated sympathy of most willing to befriend may say that a king of england scotland be now impossible own habit have done more to ruin cause than even defeat of culloden there be doubtless many in country who consider jacobite be matter of sentiment not of passion at rate there be head to cause now can not possibly be unless prince have son therefore for at least five twenty year cause be dead even if prince leaf heir must be absurd to entertain idea after stuart have be expelled from england hundred year scotchman englishman must be mad enough to risk life property to restore to throne generation hanoverian will have become englishman sentiment against a foreigner will have died out then there will be reason why scotchman irishman must longer go abroad who wish will be able to find employment in army of own country indeed might have happened long before have george forgotten that be elector of hanover a well a king of great britain have surrounded with englishman instead of filling court with german whose arrogance greed made hateful to englishman kept before eye fact that king be foreigner hanover be source of weakness instead of strength to great britain loss must be unmixed benefit to for a long a remains under british crown so long must britain play part in european politics part too sometimes absolutely opposed to interest of country at large after supper be over two general officer dropped in for chat with marshal introduced fergus to latter then retired joined little party of scottish officer at lindsay quarter lindsay introduced to be very heartily received be not until very late that turned into bed at half past eight next morning fergus went to tailor found that have kept promise to letter uniform fitted admirably be complete in particular a marshal keith have evening before informed that have received appointment to rd royal dragoon guard have hesitation in putting on uniform when quarter of hour

that great concentration of troop be taking place at halle under command of prince ferdinand of brunswick under duke of bevern at frankfort on oder nevertheless public announcement that war be declared with austria that army must march for frontier in three day time came a sudden shock proclamation stated that having be discovered that austria have entered into secret confederacy with other power to attack prussia king having after long fruitless negotiation tried to obtain satisfaction from power resource remained to declare war at once before confederate must combine force for destruction of kingdom something like dismay be at first excited by proclamation war with austria be in serious undertaking if latter have powerful ally such a russia france saxony be well known that three looked with jealousy on growing power of kingdom position seemed well nigh desperate among troop however news be received with enthusiasm confident in strength discipline question of odds might be assembled against in way troubled conquest of silesia have raised prestige of army troop felt proud that must have opportunity of proving valour in even more serious struggle never be there more brilliant assembly than at palace evening before troop marched general officer staff be assembled together with lady of court of nobility army king be in high good humour moved about room chatting

bound knew nothing more of what happened until next day after chatting for short time longer fergus took leave well pleased to have got through visit have somewhat dreaded king remained for nearly month at dresden engaged in carrying on negotiation with elector by delay lost most of advantage that sudden movement have given be most anxious to detach saxony poland from confederacy against a must then be able to turn attention wholly to austria aided by saxon while pole must aid army in east to keep russian in check elector of saxony who be also king of poland however be only negotiating in order to give time for austria to gather army in bohemia so to relieve saxon who be watched by eastern column have crossed defile into bohemia taken post near koeniggraetz while of prince maurice of brunswick pushed forward farther to threaten line of retreat from west king at last became convinced that king of poland be trifling with in last week of september started to take command of centre be facing entrance to defile at pirna marshal keith have be sent week after fergus be wounded to assume command of western column hitherto commanded by prince ferdinand of brunswick fergus remained behind for ten day at end of time felt perfectly fit for service again still carried arm in sling generous diet good wine have filled vein again upon day king left rode with karl to rejoin marshal have be several time over to chateau have on last occasion seen count who although still terribly weak be now out of danger able to sit on couch propped up by pillow thanks be a earnest a of countess have be having heard that fergus be to start on following morning to join army on frontier said to there be saying how far king may carry arm where may find countess will therefore write letter addressed to intimate friend at various large town telling that have placed under vast obligation praying to do for sake in power for under circumstance may arrive there will write on small piece of paper with name address on back so that will make small compact packet not much bigger than ordinary letter trust when return to dresden lieutenant will be able to do best to prove gratitude for service after taking leave of count wife daughter fergus rode back to royal quarter a karl took horse said herr lieutenant know not how be going to manage in what way karl two magnificent horse complete with saddlery holster pistol arrived here hour since man who brought said be from count eulenfurst handed note 'pray accept horse send a feeble token of gratitude may by speed staunchness carry unharmed through danger well nigh a great a faced for ' fergus walked by side of soldier a led horse round to stable there sir karl said pointing to pair of splendid animal be fit for king 't be noble gift indeed doubt whether king have such horse in stable question be what be to be done with present charger be excellent one a gift of marshal must not part with a to others be out of question can take must be altogether contrary to rule be entitled to forage for two horse be when forage be to be have ah see what have best be done come to room with will give letter to count wrote a follows dear count eulenfurst can not refuse noble gift that have made thank countess for with heart at present however place in difficulty aide de camp be allowed to take only two horse indeed orderly must not take with more than one led horse animal have be gift of marshal keith that being so will see must not part with only solution therefore occurs to be to beg to add to kindness by taking care of one send back to by bearer until return to dresden find mean to send for in event of one of others being killed only fault with gift be that ought to be kept for state review grand occasion for seems wrong to take such noble creature into midst of heavy fire be sure that will feel more nervous lest ball must injure horse than will do for own safety when have folded sealed handed to karl who have followed shortly after be sending back one of horse karl asking count to take care of for until return send for do see difference between must be hard to pick best lieutenant struck a being perfect in point be four year old well then must take one at random karl have one be better than other must have left behind a be take whichever choose man who brought told sir that be bred on count estate that prided on having of best blood in europe for beauty stamen thought pair be pick of stable almost wish must leave behind must not do so without hurting feeling of count countess be too good for aide de camp work think anything can be too good for sir aide de camp want horse will stop at nothing sometimes have to ride for life pursued by enemy cavalry will be envy of division on one of horse karl returned hour later with message from countess saying that must not disturb husband who be then resting that understood mr drummond difficulty must be very glad to take care of horse for until wanted did not see countess suppose karl yes sir saw have taken upstairs to room asked if be servant when said yes told that hoped must take great care of said that be duty do more than duty ' said 'his life be very precious one to 'be not thirza ' young lady nodded 'here be five gold crown for yourself ' went on handing money 'they may help to make bivouac more comfortable 'and now said 'there be something else wish to tell master ' what be to do honour have better keep to karl fergus laughed daresay will hear of someday very well lieutenant then be there be to report next morning fergus started early two day previously prussian governor have be appointed to dresden three thousand men be left under command similar appointment be also made to fortified town in saxony for now that negotiation be broken off king of poland have declared finally for confederate saxony be to be treated a conquered country nevertheless strict injunction be given that cattle wheat other provision taken for use of garrison for storing up in fortress whence might be forwarded to army be to be paid for that act of pillage ill treatment be to be most severely punished a king be still most anxious to gain goodwill of mass of population chapter lobositz in dresden feeling be far from hostile to invader discontent with vicious government have be extreme impost now levied be le onerous than have be wasted in profusion extravagance conduct of troop have be admirable in case of count eulenfurst personal visit of king to express regret generosity to family of servant have produced most excellent effect a fergus rode into camp mounted on new acquisition at once caught marshal eye why fergus exclaimed have be robbing king of poland stable be noble animal indeed be present from count eulenfurst marshal fergus replied sent two one of be going to keep for until return for must not part with rollo who be a good horse a anyone can wish to ride know pace be right lad for be always well to accustom to horse before want to use in action in faith will be pity to ride horse a through heat of battle feel that sir a count in letter with horse said that hoped must carry safely through danger a grave a have encountered at house feel that must be hurt if on return admitted to have saved for show occasion be right keith said approvingly be more reason that must accustom to before use for such work a horse rider must be a one on field of battle unless horse have absolute confidence in rider be very difficult to keep steady under fire suppose will not see king for time marshal fergus said later a keith be chatting with on contrary will be with tomorrow ride today to have look at saxon position to give order there will tomorrow morning join be who be likely to have first fighting for austrian must come to relief of saxon who be shut up a in trap by division made great mistake in not retiring at once into bohemia must have done without difficulty have lost time there be greater mistake than shutting large force up either in fortress intrenched camp unless fortress be absolute obstacle to enemy be not case with mountain can be crossed at many other point by leaving five six thousand men in strong position at end of defile must disregard altogether march on southward have already be three week there believe that can not hold out very much longer however be probable that may be able to do so until austrian force come up try to relieve from what hear two army have already entered bohemia may expect that first battle will not be far distant do block only line of retreat sir fergus asked indeed absolutely close direct road position that of marshal schwerin facing koeniggraetz so menace line of retreat that dare not venture from shelter cavalry render impossible for supply to be thrown in unless convoy be supported by army there be know path across hill by infantry might effect passage a there be nowhere place for to retire to must easily overtake force to surrender only hope be in coming of relief few hour later king rode in in evening order be issued that force of cavalry infantry be to march at daylight that rest of army be to follow two hour later be soon known that king have received news that marshal browne irish officer of great distinction who commanded austrian force gathered at budin on eger be expecting arrival of artillery pontoon from vienna in course of day two be preparing to cross river be evident then that intention be to relieve saxon army in first place road through defile be very heavy difficult afternoon advance force reached termitz late in evening rest of army arrived there squadron of cavalry have be sent off a soon a vanguard arrived to ascertain movement of enemy returned at ten at night with information that austrian have crossed eger day be to encamp at army at once moved on across mountain after very difficult fatiguing march arrived near lobositz lay down for hour in order in have marched taking up position a soon a be light map battle of lobositz infantry be in two line left be posted on steep hill known a lobosch part of whose lower slope extended to village of lobositz battery with infantry support took post on hill called homolka commanded whole plain between two army centre stretched across valley between hill on low hill on stood little town austrian have thrown up intrenchment posted very strong artillery force whose fire must sweep greater portion of prussian position except at point ground between two army be low swampy austrian force be greatly superior in number consisting of squadron of horse battalion of infantry gun while prussian have squadron battalion gun be evident to commander that village of lobositz be decisive point indeed nature of ground be such a to render operation almost impossible in marshy plain intersected by rivulet in many place formed large pond at seven in morning prussian action began by heavy fire between left on slope of lobosch croat several battalion of hungarian scattered among vineyard stone wall dividing heavy fog covered whole country until full view must be obtained of position of enemy neither of commander deemed prudent to move at twelve o'clock however fog began to clear up main body of austrian be still invisible king seeing comparatively small force in plain near lobositz thought that must be rear guard of austrian who imagined having found line by intended to succour saxon occupied in force have retired having thrown up battery left strong force at lobositz to prevent prussian from advancing to ascertain twenty squadron of cavalry be ordered to advance on doing so be received by so tremendous fire from battery of village from others at sulowitz village in plain on right that fell back with much loss pursued by austrian cavalry by time have resumed position behind infantry fog have entirely lifted king marshal keith obtained full view of austrian position from spot where have stationed on hill agreed that attack must be made against enemy centre left that must be assailed only on right troop on lobosch hill be therefore largely reinforced whole army advanced inclining towards left so a to attack lobositz from side of plain a well a from that of mountain tremendous artillery fire from gun on hill heralded advance troop on lobosch hill made way forward rapidly ground be so steep that commanded view down into vineyard fire be so heavy that croat hungarian fell a fast a raised head above stone wall to fire although general browne reinforced by of best austrian infantry be rapidly driven down towards lobositz at foot of hill be supported by several more battalion brought from austrian centre general lacy who commanded be wounded prussian halted at foot of slope be reformed having fallen into disorder from irregular nature of ground over have be fighting gun be brought forward so a to cover next advance while very strong force be sent to support battery on homolka hill so a to check enemy centre left must attempt movement across plain in meantime marshal browne be reinforcing defender of lobositz with whole of right wing village be defended with desperate bravery owing to position king be able to reinforce assailant very much more rapidly than austrian commander must bring up distant troop prussian artillery concentrated fire upon place set in flame from end to end when defender be forced to abandon retreat with precipitation on cavalry in order to cover withdrawal austrian left moved down to village of sulowitz endeavoured to pas dam over marshy rivulet in front of fire from battery on homolka rendered impossible for to form also set village on fire be therefore called back austrian centre moved to right occupied ground behind lobositz a soon a defender of village have fallen back then marshal browne formed up whole force afresh position be now a strong a have be when battle first began for prussian must not advance except between swampy ground river must have be exposed while doing so to fire of battery in front in flank austrian be still greatly superior in number advantage have be gained might have be lost by renewal of action total loss in killed wounded prisoner on part of austrian be that of prussian be about same although indecisive indeed claimed a victory by party consequence showed that advantage lay with prussian marshal browne object have be to relieve saxon frederick to prevent for moment have wholly succeeded on other hand be fact that marshal browne have drawn off army practically intact that be impossible for king to winter in bohemia a must have done have austrian army be defeated dispersed latter be still in position to make fresh attempt to rescue saxon to prevent king despatched duke of bevern with large force a if to get between austrian river eger movement have desired effect marshal browne at once fell back recrossed river took up position at former camp at budin from there opened communication with saxon be arranged that must pas elbe that with men must also do so march to meet saxon however be detained owing to terrible weather enormous difficulty of defile only crossed on th in meantime prussian have taken up position to cut off saxon retreat after crossing found hemmed in road so commanded by newly erected battery that being utterly exhausted by fatigue hardship have resource to surrender term enforced be hard officer be allowed to depart on giving parole not to serve again whole of rank file be incorporated in prussian army fergus drummond lindsay stood by horse with other member of staff short distance behind king marshal keith a anxiously endeavoured to discover whereabouts intention of austrian army while crack of musketry between croat troop who be gradually pressing down hill continued unabated be slow work drummond lindsay said a hour after hour passed must not like to have anything to do with king just at present be easy to see how fidgety be wonder for aught know there may be only three four thousand men facing while be waiting here whole austrian army may have crossed over again be marching up river bank to form junction with saxon may have gone by defile traversed last two day may come down into saxony fall on rear of camp watching pirna while saxon be attacking in front wonder majesty pace backwards forward like wild beast in cage from time to time aide de camp be sent off with order involving movement of battalion farther to right left addition of few gun to battery on homolka hill fergus have taken turn in carrying order have two day before abandoned sling scarcely felt inconvenience from wound indeed must have be of slight consequence have not be for excessive loss of blood movement mean nothing lindsay said a returned from one of ride marshal make change simply for sake of doing something partly perhaps to take king attention off confounded delay partly to interest troop who must be just a restless impatient a be message be taken alternately by king aide de camp marshal at length a fog began to lift interest in scene heightened king keith talked long earnestly together a watched village of lobositz have got strong battery there lindsay said a far a one can see there doe not appear to be large body of troop suppose be meant that troop on slope will retire there make strong stand be bound to say that look very much a if browne have only left strong guard here to keep from issuing from defile that whole army moved away last night may now be thirty mile away on march towards saxony a fog lifted still more must see stream running right across plain little village of sulowitz on bank apparently still deserted presently keith wrote order on tablet lindsay be sent off with to general commanding cavalry something be going to be done at last drummond said a mounted be order to cavalry order be then despatched to battery on homolka hill to battery on left two more battalion of infantry then moved up to press croat more quickly down hill fergus watched lindsay saw ride up to general several officer at once galloped off there be movement among cavalry then twenty squadron passed out through interval between brigade of infantry trotted out through mouth of valley went on without interruption until abreast of lobositz then great number of men ran suddenly up from house of village to battery minute later thirty gun poured fire into prussian cavalry while at same moment gun of heavy battery hitherto unseen poured in fire from sulowitz on left flank while from rising ground not visible behind came roar of thirty more piece so rapidly have aide de camp be sent off fergus be only one remaining available king spoke few word to marshal then said to fergus ride sir with order to officer commanding cavalry out there tell to retire at once fergus ran back to where karl be holding horse follow karl said a sprang into saddle then rode rapidly down steep hill a soon a reached valley dashed off at headlong gallop have order karl to recall cavalry who will be destroyed unless return must fall carry order to commander din be now prodigious whole of prussian battery have opened on lobositz sulowitz between thunder of gun came incessant crackling of musketry on hill to right passing through infantry fergus dashed across plain be mounted on horse marshal have given a other be not yet accustomed to stand fire noble animal a if delighted to be on level ground again excited by roar of battle carried along at top of speed without need of urging fergus knew on height behind king keith must be anxiously watching for peril of cavalry be great concussion of gun be now causing fog to lift rapidly a rode must dimly make out dark mass of men along rising ground behind sulowitz knew that austrian cavalry might at moment sweep down on prussian be drawing abreast of lobositz when suddenly squadron of cavalry dashed out from village object be evidently to cut off prevent message that might bear reaching prussian cavalry be now halted mile ahead officer be endeavouring to reform from confusion into have fallen from speed at have ridden heavy loss have sustained saw at once that austrian must cross line reined in horse to allow karl to come up to have not trooper be exceptionally well mounted must have be left far behind a be while pressing charger to utmost be still fifty yard in rear of fergus a soon a came up latter said must cut way through austrian ride close to will ease horse little until be within fifty yard then go at at full speed if fall get through carry order to retire to general commanding cavalry austrian cavalry have formed up in two troop one twenty yard behind other in line two deep extending across road by fergus be riding seeing by speed at be travelling that prussian staff officer have intention of surrendering austrian in command gave order to charge when be fifty yard away now karl boot to boot go right at with pistol in left hand sword in right sent horse at full speed against enemy have scarcely got into motion when like thunderbolt fergus orderly burst down upon illusgtration not blow be struck horse rider went down before shock be irresistible horse be much heavier more powerful than of austrian weight impetus carried before not blow be struck horse rider went down before be swept aside be scarcely conscious that be through before encountered second line here fight be much more severe fergus cut down two of opponent with pistol shot rid karl of antagonist who be pressing hard after minute of wild confusion be through line riding at headlong speed towards prussian pistol cracked out behind before austrian have time to turn aim be already fifty yard away going at speed soon left pursuer behind a soon a latter saw drew off trotted back to lobositz fergus rode up to officer commanding cavalry bear king order to general to retire at once with command be time for body of austrian cavalry of much greater strength must be seen galloping towards from high ground mile distant in minute prussian be in motion a returned storm of fire from two village burst out again with redoubled violence men horse rolled over closing up quickly squadron swept on general remained stationary until last squadron thundered by then galloped forward again took place at head fergus have followed when there be sudden crash be thrown with tremendous force over horse head there lay stunned with shock when recovered staggered to foot saw that be surrounded by austrian cavalry having halted just where fell a pursuit of prussian be hopeless ball from prussian battery be falling thick be prisoner sir officer said to so see fergus said bitterly be hard luck just at beginning of campaign be fortune of war austrian said with smile indeed think that have reason to grumble for have shot struck few inch farther back must have carried off leg sharp order be now given to retire one of trooper be ordered to give horse to fergus to mount behind comrade rode back to austrian main position on rising ground fergus be at once taken to marshal in command of austrian what be name sir latter asked fergus drummond have honour to be aide de camp on marshal keith staff scotchman suppose marshal said breaking into english yes sir what force be there opposed to can not say sir only joined army two day ago

soldier to see that be not annoyed interfered with in way fergus be led away captain wingratz called up two trooper choosing elevated spot of ground told to dismount allow one to speak to officer from here said courteously to drummond will get view of field of battle fergus sat down on grass remained spectator of fight to end of day marked at once that combat have rolled down hill that prussian be making way in force towards lobositz then saw heavy mass of infantry from austrian right move forward to aid in defence for two hour battle raged round village whole of gun on side aiding in fight then volume of smoke flame rose austrian be seen retiring sulowitz still kept up heavy fire saw strong body from austrian left move down there while centre advanced to cover retreat of defender of lobositz to check advancing mass of prussian thought for time that general engagement be about to take place then saw prussian advance cease roar of cannon gradually died away battle be at end for hour remained apparently unnoticed then captain wingratz rode up with officer be sorry to have neglected so long lieutenant drummond see be fault of own people who have kept so busy be lieutenant kerr compatriot of yours who will take special charge of be sorry that meeting can not take place under more favourable circumstance kerr said holding out hand might well have be other way now come with to tent have doubt that be hungry can assure that be two walked together for about quarter of mile austrian officer having left a soon a have introduced there be three of here morning kerr said a entered tent other two be missing one know be killed other badly wounded whether be dead prisoner can not say by way be not officer who cut way through squadron of regiment went on joined cavalry who at once fell back be in lobositz squadron be not ordered out a hear that be found by cavalry a followed prussian struck that might be although from lobositz must only see that be staff uniform that officer wore yes be be carrying order for cavalry to retire be what supposed a soon a be seen coming down valley a must have suited much better for prussian cavalry to have stayed where be for little longer general sent out squadron to intercept be splendid thing to do on part of course there be number of watching from earthwork can assure that there be general inclination to cheer a cut way through fellow be sure that if have known that be countryman must have done though action be at expense of own regiment squadron suffered heavily a rode back again for battery from homolka turned attention to a soon a have gone through have officer nearly thirty men killed wounded before got back into shelter how long have be out here only about two month really be lucky in getting onto keith staff be cousin of mother fergus said made lieutenant aide de camp at once be first cornet be promoted at dresden king have given strict order about plundering happened that came upon marauder at work have good fortune to rescue gentleman of importance from hand king who be furious at order being disobeyed promoted have be lucky enough to get wounded in affair a lost good deal of blood looked doubt good deal worse than be expect have good deal to do with getting step well be lucky fellow be eight year cornet before got promoted think bad luck in getting captured balance good fortune in being promoted so soon to extent perhaps doe will get benefit when return doubt fritz be watching a rode must have seen cavalry coming down slope before man in command of squadron must have done so must have felt that be lost unless order be received must have be relieved indeed when saw reach have indeed be case king marshal have be watching through glass prussian cavalry marked how ground behind be dotted thickly with body of horse men will never stop king said impatiently cavalry men be always getting into scrape with impetuosity gorlitz must have known that be only sent forward to ascertain position of austrian not to fight whole army ought to have turned a soon a crossfire of battery opened upon knew that majesty whole army must be watching sire keith said quietly fancy under such circumstance few cavalry men must draw rein till have done something worthy of at moment fog wreath moved away see king exclaimed there be great body of austrian cavalry moving along behind sulowitz rise behind village must hide from men where be messenger keith there go sire be well out of valley now by pace be riding at wo be long before reach wo reach at king said curtly minute later see there be squadron of horse riding out from lobositz to cut off doubt guess what errand be see sire must see too be checking horse for orderly be coming up to then cavalry will be lost king said enemy battery be playing havoc with will have austrian down upon in few minute ah expect gorlitz see now men be halting forming up suppose mean to charge austrian when come up there be three to one against be lost there be hope yet sire keith said a again turned glass on fergus aide de camp be going to charge austrian squadron so be king exclaimed lowering glass for distance be little more than mile from spot where stood must be mad be possible may do sire orderly be riding boot to boot beside know already that be good swordsman will have advantage that enemy wo dream of attacking rate at be riding will help through there go raised glass again to eye bravo be through first troop still together now be at there sire be through second troop bravo fergus king made remark until saw austrian squadron draw rein then said thank god have saved cavalry be glorious deed marshal keith make out commission a captain today be very young sire marshal said hesitatingly by heaven sir must promote if be infant in arm king replied why keith loss of half cavalry must have crippled cavalry men be not made in day there have reached now see be wheeling well quickly done yes wo be overtaken three minute later not man must have come back colonel rogner said to one of group of officer behind will please ride down meet cavalry when come in convey to lieutenant drummond highest satisfaction at gallant manner in have carried out order will also inform general gorlitz that in opinion pushed reconnaissance much too far that be well content with bravery shown by troop at manner in drew off on receipt of order in five twenty minute colonel returned said regret to say majesty that lieutenant drummond be missing have inquired among officer find a be following general gorlitz horse suddenly pitched forward lay without movement evidently horse be killed by cannon shot whether mr drummond be also killed must not say must hope not king said warmly must not lose so gallant young officer for great deal keith if take lobositz today let most careful search be made over ground cavalry passed for body if be found so much worse if not will be proof that be either wounded unhurt that have be carried off by austrian cavalry who passed over same ground a ours who certainly must not trouble to carry off body chapter prisoner next morning horse be brought round for fergus at once started under escort of captain lieutenant kerr fifty trooper with thirteen other officer taken prisoner at lobositz seven hundred rank file have also be captured however be to march under infantry escort on following day fergus afterwards learned that sixteen officer of whom eleven belonged to cavalry have be killed eighty one officer about eighteen hundred men wounded in desperate fighting at lobositz fergus found that among austrian battle of previous day be considered victory although have lost advanced post at lobositz can not say seemed so to said to lieutenant a rode away from camp why have prevented king from penetrating into bohemia king must have done three day ago without fighting battle fergus said just a schwerin did at koeniggraetz there must have be need to have marched night day across mountain in order to give battle to army nearly twice strength of own object be to prevent from drawing off saxon in perfectly succeeded oh there be other way of doing that have only to keep along other side of elbe until faced pirna then must have joined sound easy fergus laughed must not be so easy to execute mountain defile be terrible may be sure that king will not be idle while saxon be marching to meet other however be hard fought battle must think that loss must be quite a great a yours for artillery must have played terrible havoc among infantry a marched to assault of village yes hear morning that have lost about hundred twenty officer killed wounded about two thousand one hundred fifty men nearly seven hundred missing prisoner what loss be of course ca say can not understand taking so many prisoner fergus said great many of belong to cavalry see who be dismounted by fire of gun be captured when horse swept down ah yes did not think of saw good many men running across plain when galloped out two of officer belonged to rd royal dragoon guard half of regiment have taken part in reconnaissance horse like own have be shot under a soon a be brought up from tent where have be lodged exchanged cordial greeting with fergus no longer belonged to regiment a on promotion have be gazetted from on to staff during time have drilled with in berlin have come to be well known to of thought that be lieutenant one of said be not far from when charged through austrian be unhorsed a went forward be running back when saw come out there be good many of thought object be to capture be use running threw down in hope must think have be knocked over passed within thirty yard of gun opened so heavily on after have got through thought prudent to keep quiet little longer before made move result be that austrian cavalry a came along in pursuit of men picked up do know where be bound for prague in first instance beyond can not say suppose will depend good deal on what take place now there be doubt saxon will have to surrender suppose anyhow will send farther away unless indeed there be exchange of prisoner long day ride took to prague news of battle have be sent off night before a have be reported a victory inhabitant be in state of great delight bonfire blazed in street church bell rang in triumphant peal whole population be abroad arrival of party with prisoner afforded welcome confirmation of news there be few yell hoot a rode along in charge of escort a rule people stood silent a if in respect for misfortune for most of captive be wounded be taken to military prison comfortable quarter assigned to wound of who required be redressed by surgeon there be hearty parting between fergus kerr a latter after handing over prisoner turned to ride off with escort to barrack start early tomorrow for camp again said if be kept here be sure to see again before long fergus shared room with captain hindeman officer of rd think at likely will remain here latter said be more probable that will be sent to olmuetz to one of smaller fortress in moravia war be will think likely to be confined to bohemia until spring if indeed king doe not have to stand on defensive can not help thinking that must have done better if have let thing go on quietly till spring be not probable that russia austria must have be more ready then than be now must have have whole summer before might have marched to vienna before campaign be over now will have winter to make preparation will have france austria russia to say nothing of poland on hand be tremendous job even for frederick to tackle remained for three week at prague be then informed by governor that have order for to be removed to olmuetz accordingly next day eight of officer started on horseback under escort when reached bruenn found that be to be separated next morning captain hindeman fergus be taken to fortress of spielberg awkward place to get in out of drummond captain said a approached fortress very much so fergus agreed if see chance will certainly do best to escape before spring think there be much chance of that other said gloomily if have be left at prague even at bruenn there might have be chance in fortress where everything be conducted on very severe system be veritable prison think that anything without wing have chance of getting away a rule officer taken prisoner in war enjoyed considerable amount of liberty be even allowed to reside in house of citizen on giving parole enforced embodiment of saxon in prussian army have however excited storm of indignation throughout europe that greatly damaged frederick cause be indeed unheard of proceeding most mistaken one for greater part of saxon seized opportunity to desert a soon a next campaign began be more ill advised since saxony be protestant country therefore action alienated other protestant prince in germany whose sympathy must have otherwise be wholly with prussia be to small extent due to high handed action during winter swede joined confederacy undertook to supply army of men france paying subsidy towards maintenance member of confederacy agreeing that upon division of prussia pomerania must fall to share of sweden thus may be said that whole of central northern europe with exception only of hanover be leagued against prussia be result of general outburst of indignation that instead of being kept in large town allowed various privilege prisoner taken at battle of lobositz be treated with exceptional severity confined in isolated fortress fergus companion be lodged in small room in one of tower window be strongly barred floor be of stone door massive studded with iron two truckle bed table two chair formed sole furniture not much chance of escape here captain hindeman said a door closed behind guard prospect doe not look very bright admit fergus said cheerfully have proverb there be will there be way have will certainly a have plenty of time before will be hard if find way went to window looked out over hundred foot said must say precipice fully a deep at foot of wall at rate have advantage of extensive view be glad to see that there be fireplace for cold will be bitter here when winter set in wonder whether room above below be tenanted hindeman shrugged shoulder be not at present in mood to take interest in anything be now end of october fergus be very glad when door opened again warder came in with two soldier who carried huge basket of firewood be not long before large fire be blazing on hearth day after day passed fergus turned over in mind possible method of escape prospect looked very dark even if door be open there must be difficulty of sort to encounter in middle of day many people went in out of fortress with provision wood other matter at gate be shut sentry placed on wall on getting out must have to cross inner courtyard then pas through gateway at sentinel be posted night day into outer court be surrounded by strong wall over thirty foot high with tower at angle escape from window must be equally difficult two long very strong rope must be required bar of window be so massive that without tool of kind must be impossible to remove month later captain hindeman fell ill be removed to infirmary fergus be glad of departure have be so depressed that be useless a companion so long a remained there altogether prevented plan of escape being attempted for difficult a might be for one person to get away must be next to impossible for two to do so for hour in day prisoner have leave to walk on wall fellow prisoner have never availed of privilege fergus always took daily exercise partly to keep in health partly in hope that plan of escape might present sentry however be always posted on wall while prisoner be at exercise on side allotted for walk rock sloped away steeply from foot of wall thought of escape therefore in broad daylight be out of question fergus generally watched what be going on in courtyard in time came to know be entrance to apartment of governor family where married officer be quartered where soldier lodged saw that on ground floor of tower occupied be quarter of field officer belonging to garrison one day saw number of men employed in clearing out unused quarter on one side of outer courtyard judged that addition be about to be made to garrison gave substance to plan that have be revolving in mind that evening when warder brought food said carelessly see have more troop coming in man replied there be three hundred more men coming will march in tomorrow afternoon will be getting room on first floor below here cleared out tomorrow morning for officer who command fergus have along considered that there must be difficulty in suddenly attacking overpowering warder when came in out of room for special precaution be taken fact that prisoner be in uniform on showing below must be instantly arrested seemed to forbid chance of making attempt to escape be matter of clothes have more than anything else puzzled fergus for although thought that might possibly obtain uniform from officer quarter be evident that guard must at once perceive that be not one of officer of garrison arrival of fresh detachment relieved of difficulty now seemed that way of escape be open to much depended upon hour at regiment must arrive later did so better a weather have for day be terribly rough road must be deep heavy be likely that must not arrive until time past hour fixed next afternoon listened for roll of drum must greet arrival of newcomer just a door opened sergeant entered with lantern heard sound that have be listening for illustration a man be placing supper on table fergus sprang upon nothing must have happened more fortunately a man be placing supper on table fergus sprang suddenly upon hurled down on to face then fastened hand behind with rope have made from twisted strip of one of rug be not afraid of calling out a window looked outside be blowing gale moreover sound of drum below must aid to prevent noise being heard from courtyard want to hurt sergeant said do want liberty must put bandage round mouth to prevent from calling know a well a do that there must be chance of being heard however loud might shout now in first place be going to see if can get uniform if can not must come back take yours binding sergeant leg a well a arm putting muffler over mouth fergus went out leaving own jacket cap behind key be in door turned put in pocket shot heavy bolt ran downstairs when got to bottom tried door of major quarter be unbolted felt absolutely certain that major must be out a with other officer must have gone down to gate to receive of incoming detachment on opening door saw article of be in search long cloak regimental cap at once put on after further search found pair of military pantaloon patrol jacket throwing off cloak rapidly changed clothes wanted now only regimental sword to complete costume trusted to long cloak to hide absence of throwing thing that have taken off under bed went out closed door behind locked took key have with short sword carried by warder relied upon to silence sentry at passage leading to outer court must attempt to stop however be most unlikely night be dark there be light burning at hour with fresh troop arriving general movement in fortress there must be question of countersign being demanded by sentry in interior of place man indeed only drew up saluted a dimly made out officer coming from major quarter courtyard beyond be half full of soldier newcomer have just fallen out be being greeted by member of garrison who have known before officer be chatting together fergus made way unnoticed in darkness to gate a have hoped baggage waggon be making way in sentry be placed on side of gate now then said sharply hurry on with waggon commandant want gate shut a soon a possible passing sentry went on a if to hurry up rear of train taking for one of officer of newly arrived party sentry stepped back at once passed out there be six waggon still outside unnoticed passed went down road have brought with under cloak sergeant lantern a soon a be mile from fortress took out in order to be able to proceed more rapidly have taken particular notice of country from prison window when came down into broad road running along valley turned at once to south plan have be carefully thought out while in prison knew perfectly well that without money must be altogether impossible for to traverse many hundred mile lay between saxony there must be hot pursuit when in morning be found to have gone must hardly be suspected that have taken road for vienna a must be entirely out of way happily be not altogether penniless have always carried five six gold piece sewn up in lining of jacket with letter with have be furnished by count eulenfurst a resource in case of being taken prisoner wished now that have brought more thought that might prove sufficient for first need walked night candle burnt out in two hour after starting at eleven moon rose light enabled to keep road without difficulty a morning dawned approached good sized village forty mile from starting point waiting for hour until saw people stirring fergus went to posting house shouted for postmaster sight of field officer on foot at hour of morning greatly surprised man when came down horse have fallen broken neck fergus said have have to walk mile on foot have important despatch to carry to vienna bring round horse without moment delay postmaster without smallest hesitation ordered men to saddle bring out horse will be sent back from next stage fergus said a mounted rode on at full speed changed horse twice not slightest suspicion being entertained by of postmaster that be not what seemed before noon arrived at last post house before reaching vienna bottle of best wine landlord want to speak word with in private room bring two glass wine be poured out after have drank glass fergus said landlord be bearer of important despatch be imperative must not attract attention a enter city if be seen recognized there question might be asked curiosity excited a to news of be bearer see that be sensible man will readily understand situation to avoid attracting attention must be best for to enter city in civilian dress be about size beg to furnish with suit of clothes for will pay at once will do willingly sir landlord answered feeling much honoured by being let into what deemed important affair best suit be at service can send out from town must rather pay for landlord may be ordered in direction may not have opportunity of returning if will say how much suit cost will hand money landlord went out returned in minute with clothes glass of wine landlord fergus said a handed over amount at landlord valued glass of wine then while be changing get light trap round to door will not want to take into vienna will alight send back again half mile side of gate mind must inquiry be made be best to say a little a possible in five minute fergus be on way again have procured from landlord small trunk in have packed uniform directed to keep until heard from if in course of week received order be to forward to major steiner at spielberg when within mile of vienna fergus got out gave present to driver told to return then walked forward to gate entered without question thought better not to put up in quarter of town walked long distance through city purchased travelling coat lined with sheepskin small canvas trunk in put went distance farther hired room at quiet inn called for dinner of felt much in need for beyond eating few mouthful of bread while fresh horse be brought out for have tasted nothing since previous evening after dining went to room took boot off feeling completely worn out from long journey after two month of confinement threw on bed slept for three hour then went for hour stroll through town by time be getting dark snowflake be beginning to fall thickly be very glad after sitting for time listening to talk in parlour of inn to turn in for night in morning ground be covered with snow be glad to put on thick coat for cold outside be bitter for hour walked about vienna contrast between city berlin struck greatly whole bearing manner of people be brighter gayer soldier of whom there be great number in street austrian croat hungarian have none of formal stiffness of prussian laughed joked a went seemed a easy light hearted a civilian around be for most part inferior in size physique to prussian there be springiness in walk alertness intelligence be wanting in more solid soldier of north spent day in making acquainted with town position of gate other particular might be important to a must not feel sure of reception that must meet with when presented letter in afternoon city be particularly gay sledge made appearance in street seemed delighted that winter have set in in earnest next morning after breakfast fergus went to mansion of count platurn whose position have ascertained on previous day name have be scored under in list a one on whom might confidently rely be bearer of letter to count platurn said to somewhat gorgeously dressed functionary who opened door have message to deliver to personally doorkeeper closed door behind spoke to footman who went away returned in minute two told fergus to follow to spacious comfortable library where count be sitting alone be bearer of letter to sir said in pleasant tone of voice whence do bring from count eulenfurst of dresden fergus said producing count gave exclamation of pleasure have completely recovered asked of course heard of outrage of be sufferer be going on well when saw last count count opened letter read with air of growing surprise a went on when have finished rose from seat offered hand to fergus be scottish officer who saved life of count wife daughter said warmly how come to be here know be enough for that rendered dear friend wife who be cousin of mine great service be not here hope on mission a austrian noble must feel impossible to further indeed count have be so must assuredly not have presented letter to in giving to countess said that possibly fortune of war might be unfavourable might be taken prisoner in case said might find friend invaluable gave letter to eight gentleman in various great town saying that believed that one of must for sake of count do kindness in power prevision have turned out correct horse be shot under at battle of lobositz be made prisoner sent to fortress of spielberg three day since effected escape deemed more prudent to make way here where one must suspect of coming instead of striving to journey up through bohemia effected escape from spielberg count repeated in surprise be indeed notable feat for be one of strongest prison will tell about presently now about count eulenfurst affair created quite sensation partly from rank well known position of count partly from fact that king of prussia called upon count to express sincere regret at what have occurred vigorous step that took to put stop to act of pillage marauding be said at time have not be for opportune arrival of young scottish officer aide de camp to marshal keith life of count family must assuredly have be sacrificed that king in token of approbation have promoted officer upon spot pray take off warm coat make at home touched bell servant entered immediately if anyone call say that be engaged on business can see one morning place two chair by fire bring in wine glass two chair be moved to fire wine be placed close at hand on small table count fetched box of cigar from cabinet fergus have already adopted universal custom in german army of smoking now count said when cigar be lighted tell about affair at dresden fergus related fact a modestly a must no wonder eulenfurst speaks of in highest term said count truly be nobly done six pomeranian soldier to single sword 't be wonderful chief credit must a have said count be given to maid for whose aid matter might have gone quite otherwise doubtless great credit be due to lieutenant drummond see have already defeated three prefer to think that must have got better of others even if have not come to aid countess have hope quite recovered at time came away since be who writes letter in name think that have quite recovered for few hour doctor be even more anxious a to state than of count news that be doing well might recover did wonder for be able to take part in nursing two day after received wound saw by account little cousin received king did sir bore well be doubt great trial to so soon after terrible scene have passed through in have showed great calmness presence of mind be able to give assistance to mother a soon a be released from bond be not present sir wound be a have said in flesh be of so little consequence did not think to have bandaged until other matter be arranged when have made report to marshal begged that surgeon must be sent instantly to aid count fainted from loss of blood be day before be able to ride out to pay respect to countess now tell about escape from spielberg fergus did be well managed indeed laughed count seem to be a ready with wit a with sword to have provided against emergency be fortunate that have hidden away gold piece with letter for otherwise must hardly have got clothes from postmaster be bold stroke indeed to use majesty uniform imperial post to further escape now must think in what way can best aid will require stout horse disguise well filled purse eulenfurst authorizes to act a banker to advance money that may require therefore need offer thanks what disguise do fancy must think that dress of trader travelling on business must be a good a must choose yes must think must must give out a saxon merchant fergus went on in first place german learned from hanoverian be near enough to saxon to pas muster hair complexion be common enough in saxony will get official paper from city authority stating that be one will say paul muller native of saxony draper by trade now returning to dresden will have difficulty in getting through one of own furnishers say that must not make way through without must be stopped questioned must facilitate matter will see about afternoon have simply to say to one of tradesman employ that be sending agent through bohemia to eulenfurst think that in present disturbed state have better travel a trader ask to fill up official paper take to burgomaster office to get signed stamped will do a matter of course seeing that be sufficiently good customer of horse can of course supply with must not be too showy must be strong serviceable animal with fair turn of speed clothes have perhaps better buy for together with such thing a can carry in valise must gladly ask to stay with here for while having arrived in dress might excite remark among servant be to appear in different character regret that wife family be away at one of country seat will not be back for week suppose will not care to linger so long here thank count must prefer to leave a soon a possible think that there be really fear of being recognized if search at along vienna road be not likely that will do so a far a certainly must obtain news of for first forty mile must not be likely to push inquiry a far for dismounted field officer must not have attracted attention at first village through passed must be best for not to change clothes at place where be stopping can have everything ready for by tomorrow morning if wish to leave at once must certainly prefer doing so very well then do go out by west gate at nine o'clock walk for four mile when find quiet spot change clothes walk on until within sight of village of gulnach there wait will send confidential servant with horse on seeing standing there will ask who be waiting for will give name then will hand over horse paper to got up went to table opened drawer here be hundred rix dollar mr drummond hand a count eulenfurst banker be matter of pure business must do with much le than sir fergus said 't be better to be well supplied besides there be clothes to buy be sure provide with good fur lined travelling cloak will need can assure best course will be to travel through saint poelten ip cross river at once go over mountain by road through freystadt to budweis be by far most level road from here though good deal longer than one through horn there be snow in air think that will have heavy downfall may well find defile by horn road blocked by snow whereas by freystadt be not likely to find difficulty most of road be perfectly flat chapter flight after leaving count platurn with most sincere thanks for kindness fergus went to clothier where bought clothes suitable for trader with warm undergarment ample cloak lined with warm though cheap fur carried to inn rest of day be spent in strolling about in examining public building art gallery next morning paid reckoning taking small trunk in one hand fur cloak in other started wearing coat have first purchased a thought that crossing defile into saxony might very well need that a well a cloak a western gate be one nearest to inn be not long before issued out walking briskly came in three quarter of hour to wood a there be one in sight along road turned in here changed clothes then leaving have taken off behind continued on way in le than hour approached village learned from man met be gulnach waited by roadside for quarter of hour then saw man galloping towards leading riderless horse drew rein a came up what be waiting here for asked platurn fergus replied be right sir be horse here be letter count bade give also sword unbuckled one wore bade wish god speed pray tell that be sincerely obliged to for kindness fergus replied a buckled on sword man at once rode off saddle be furnished with valise contained several article have not thought of buying among warm fur cap with flap for ear pair of fur lined riding glove transferred remaining article from little trunk to valise threw former away rolled up cloak strapped behind saddle then mounted be glad to find in holster brace of double barrelled pistol powder flask bag of bullet also large flask full of spirit a gathered rein in hand have difficulty in restraining shout of joy for with excellent horse good arm warm clothes purse sufficiently well lined felt be prepared for contingency a moved on at walk opened count letter contained only few line wishing safe journey begging to tell count eulenfurst that regretted must not do more for messenger to prove goodwill affection also official document that have promised to procure for tearing up count letter putting official document carefully in pocket pressed heel against horse flank started at canter stopped for night at ip on following day rode to linz snow have fallen almost incessantly be glad indeed that have brought coat a well a cloak with next night halted at freystadt a be strongly fortified place commanding southern exit of defile from mountain be asked for paper official merely glanced at returned be forced to stay here for several day a be assured that must be certain death to endeavour to cross pas in such weather on third day snow ceased falling early next morning force of men comprising almost whole of garrison started to beat down snow cut way through deep drift for four day work continued men being assisted by regiment be marched down from budweis opened defile from northern end pas be important one a in winter be one chiefly used for communication between bohemia vienna be therefore highly important that must be maintained in practicable state fergus be in hurry to proceed knew that there be not smallest possibility of operation being commenced until snow disappeared might not be until end of march therefore took matter very quietly keeping entirely indoors a long a snow continued to fall going out a little a possible afterwards be glad indeed when news came that pas be clear a soon a gate be unlocked pressed on in order to get ahead of large convoy of cart laden with warm clothing for soldier be also waiting for pas to be opened in spite of have be done be rough work passing through defile did not arrive at krumnau until nearly sunset budweis lay few mile farther ahead have made up mind not to stop there a be large garrisoned town small place suited better passing through town next day continued course along road near river moldau made short journey for snow have not yet hardened be very heavy riding therefore took four day in getting to prague thought probable that here watch might be kept for for have travelled straight from spielberg be point for in probability must have made unless have gone through silesia then travelled up through breslau therefore made circuit of picturesque old city entered by western gate then rode straight for bridge have slept at place four mile distant have started at daybreak so that be still early in day when proceeded on way stopped at small town ten mile farther north two three squadron of cavalry be quartered there landlord at inn where put up at once asked for paper took to town office where be stamped a being in due order hour later a fergus be at meal two officer entered paper appear to be right sir one of said courteously in time like be duty to examine closely into matter come from vienna yes sir way did travel by way of linz budweis said snow began on day before left capital be advised to take route a road must be more level le likely to be blocked with snow than through horn will see that paper be stamped at linz also at freystadt be detained at latter place seven day for first three snowed for next four day garrison be occupied with aid of troop from budweis in opening defile officer nodded happen to know that story be correct sir that account fully for movement since leaving vienna way do intend to cross pass into saxony must be guided by what hear of state have hoped to have got back before snow began to fall in earnest must think that road by river will now be best must think so officer said even will be bad enough however will not detain farther moved away to table calling for bottle of wine sat down be mistaken think fellow must have bare faced impudence to come through prague one said other laughed must think that must have impudence for anything major in truth rather hope that wo lay hand upon fellow who devised carried out such scheme a did deserves liberty of course overpowering warder be nothing that must have have impudence to go down into major quarter appropriate clothes leave own uniform behind then taking advantage of arrival of regiment march calmly out through pas sentry who took for one of newly arrived officer in charge of waggon be really splendid how be that did not overtake next morning can not make out have sword with horse spectacle of field officer on foot without even sword must have attracted attention of very first person who met have not be gone two hour when troop started in pursuit for when major whose door have locked have burst open found that uniform be gone suspected something be wrong have sergeant in charge of prisoner mustered one be missing man who have charge of young scotchman a must not be found fellow cell be broken open there be warder bound gagged bird have flown party of horse be sent off by road leading to bohemia silesia sign of man have a far a have heard yet be discovered only thing can imagine be that when heard cavalry in pursuit left road hid up somewhere that afterwards tried to make way by unfrequented path be starved in snow in case body be not likely to be found until spring can not help thinking that fellow who must plan carry out that escape must hardly be likely to lose life in snowdrift see be not sudden idea on other evening must have found gate open after sunset must have be certain to have found major absent from quarter must have be waiting patiently for opportunity a soon a heard that battalion be coming into garrison must have resolved to act more than that must have calculated that instead of arriving at four o'clock a be timed to do must be detained not get in until after dark be clear headed fellow scotchman whether be in army frederick what make affair more wonderful be that be quite young fellow probably understood german think that must have acted more wisely have waited until spring know other said when once troop be in movement north certainly must not have escaped in military uniform without being questioned scarcely seems possible that must have procured other must be in more of hurry to fight again than be there can hardly be much serious fighting other said with russia france with swede who have be bought by france will have men under arm while know be utmost frederick can muster will have to be scattered in direction round frontier be sorry that france have joined in other said be unnatural enough that russia must combine to crush prussia when come to old enemy french helping against german power say frankly like besides though may get silesia back again that will be small advantage in comparison to disadvantage of france getting firm foothold on side of rhine even if share of partition doe extend beyond river will be frontier nearly down to sea will have power of pouring troop into germany whenever chooses fergus have now finished meal without caring to listen longer betook to bed to avoid appearance of haste did not start so early next morning mounted at ten rode to junction of eger with elbe be too late to cross river night therefore put up at village on bank crossed in ferry boat on following morning to leitmeritz town of considerable size be now within day ride of defile through elbe find way from bohemia into saxony paper be inspected a usual by officer in command of troop of cavalry there will have rough time of if push on said there be traffic through pass now so snow will lie a fell at moment may come down again a far a mouth of pas will find easy enough for send troop a far a day beyond must say must be if not quite impassable advise to stay here quietly until hear of someone having crossed at rate if do go on must take three four peasant a guide to help through difficult place must not be possible captain fergus asked to hire boat did not think of yes there be flat boat at ordinary time go down to dresden with raft of timber whether must find anyone willing now to make such journey be more than can say be very anxious to be back to business fergus said a must have to pay handsomely for guide to take over even then might lose life must be better for to pay higher get through at once on going down to water side saw several boat hauled up be not long before boatman seeing stranger examining craft came down to want to go down to dresden said 't be bad time of year one of men replied be bad time of year a far a cold be concerned be good time of year for going down river said for now that frost have set in river be low current gentle whereas in spring when snow be melting must be raging torrent in of narrow defile evidence that stranger whoever be be fool silenced boatman for minute now fergus went on what be lowest price that one of will take horse down to dresden for be disposed to pay fair price not more if attempt to charge exorbitant one will take guide follow road must never get through one of men said well at rate must try if must not succeed by road by river must cross by other pas have doubt must get through by graber zittau stranger acquaintance with country again silenced men talked for while apart then one said will take for twenty rix dollar do suppose that be emperor in disguise fergus said indignantly 't be three day journey at most perhaps six for coming back against stream will need four men master there be food by way after much bargaining price be settled at fifteen rix dollar party being satisfied with bargain men because be more than twice sum for must have be glad to do at ordinary time fergus because have still forty rix dollar in pocket have only bargained a did in order not to appear too anxious on subject price be to include erection at one end of boat of snug cover of rush for use found on going down to shore three hour later that boatman be engaged in covering in whole of craft with exception of few foot at end with roof of rush boat be thirty five foot in length ten wide with straight side general resemblance to canal barge save that beam be greater in comparison to length roof be high sloped sharply tall man must walk along in centre while at side there be three foot of height hay straw be extremely scarce whole supply of country having be stripped by foraging party bundle of reed have be thickly littered down especially near stern shortly after return landlord of inn told that if did not want to take horse with must gladly buy have frequently to send to prague for thing for inn besides have to get provision for people in town sold best horse last autumn to officer whose charger have be killed now that sledging have begun want one can travel fast do journey there in day so if want to take will accept reasonable price will buy offer be welcome one with two splendid horse at command for knew that good care must have be taken of one left in camp third must only have be in way although good useful beast be scarce good looking enough for officer on marshal staff therefore after usual amount of bargaining parted with for fair price next morning early went on board servant of inn following with great hamper of wine provision be glad to see that bright fire burned on earthen hearth in middle of boat smoke finding way out partly through hole cut in thatch above partly by opening at fore end of boat brought with horse cloth a well a other belonging men who be clearly in hurry to be away pushed boat off from shore a soon a have taken place want to be back a soon a can owner of boat said for will not be long before ice begin to form want to be frozen in doe not feel to quite so cold morning fergus remarked sir be going to have more snow wo matter to if snow for next week better be not often that river close altogether until after christmas in mountain river seldom freeze at there be too much current besides in shelter of hill cold be not so great two oar be got out for purpose of steering rather than of hastening progress of boat once well out in current be allowed to drift quietly with stream fergus spread horse cloth on rush by fire found need for sheepskin coat cloak loosely thrown over shoulder collar turned up to keep off draught blew in under bottom of thatch being sufficient to make thoroughly comfortable there be nothing to see outside shore being low flat have brought large supply of meat with handed over portion of to man who acted a cook of crew told to make broth for be welcome gift to crew who seldom touched meat with addition of barley coarse flour herb that have brought for own use excellent stew be provided pot be kept going through journey fresh meat other ingredient being added from time to time in addition to slice of meat be grilled over fire eaten with bread have brought gift of bottle of wine between crew day of small ration of spirit last thing in evening added greatly to satisfaction of men by nightfall arrived at entrance of defile snow be falling heavily tied up against bank fergus chatted with men listened to story of river for hour of have at various time gone on timber raft bewailed war must do much harm must not altogether interrupt trade for timber must be required a usual in saxony hanover a rule neither of contending army interfered with river traffic though communication by land be greatly interrupted owing to peasant cart being impressed for military service anxiety of everyone for safety of home belonging brought trade between country to standstill on river however difficulty consisted not in interference by authority from so large number of able bodied men being called out for service that amount of timber cut brought down be greatly diminished while need of army brought trade in cattle other produce to entire cessation danger of river be not great although in spring when snow melted river be swollen navigation be rendered especially in narrow reach of defile difficult dangerous for force of stream be so great that be well nigh impossible to direct course of raft indeed pole used for purpose be often found too short to reach bottom men be up long before daylight be two hour later before fergus roused shaking off fine snow have drifted in lay thickly on coat went out to have look at thing one of men be already preparing breakfast two of others stood at bow with long pole with punted boat along captain also provided with pole stood in stern snow have ceased air felt sharp cold a came down from hill be thickly covered so there be end of snow for present captain said a pushed aside curtain of reed closed stern of covered portion joined yes be not altogether sorry for can see where be going will keep on now until be through defile there be moon captain can tell pretty well by depth of water where be can manage to keep in middle of current there be obstruction there to affect though in place there be plenty of ugly rock near shore however if have luck will be through before midnight will pas worst point before sunset day passed indeed without adventure of kind journey be highly interesting to fergus for scenery be very picturesque sometimes hill narrowed in stream straitened in course hastened speed at others hill receded be covered far up with forest above bleak mountain top with mantle of snow rose high in air captain pointed out spot where saxon have crossed where pent in surrounded with battery commanding mean of exit be forced to surrender be smooth work now said a be going through one of narrow for river be low current gentle in flood there be wave here must swamp boat did keep out in middle a be doing must be impossible to pole against even close to shore see ice be forming already near bank how do manage coming back in place can pole boat will be light will only draw few inch of water then hire horse for bit at one of little village where road leaf river other three will get out tow from edge while will steer will manage easily enough if ice doe not form too thickly if worst come to worst must stop at one of village get people to help to haul well up wait till snow be quite over then make way back on foot come fetch boat up when spring flood be over then pas be not so dangerous after captain fergus said with smile not when snow have once hardened to men accustomed to a soon a weather get settled there will be little traffic snow will be beaten down besides where hill come steep to water edge man on foot can always make way along when water be low though horseman might not be able to do so in fact suppose fergus said combine at leitmeritz to represent pass a being great deal more dangerous than be in order to force obliged to make journey to take a many men a possible with to pay two three time proper fare by boat pass over hill must be terrible now man said most of must be absolutely impassable until snow hardens a for rest added with smile may be that there be something in what say see time be hard there be little work to be done scarce timber coming down if did not get good job occasionally must go very hard with by nightfall be nearly through defile lantern be placed in bow of boat until long after fergus be asleep men continued to work at pole when woke up in morning boat be floating down quiet river with plain of saxony on side mountain range far astern at noon neared dresden hour later fergus stepped ashore paid men sum arranged handed over to rest of provision must be sufficient to carry far on way back soon learnt that marshal keith be established in old quarter made way thither met two three officer of acquaintance one recognized in present attire have hired boy when landed to carry cloak valise saddle bridle have sold with horse be a usual passing sentry at gate without notice when one of stepped in front of what be business sir business be with marshal keith said be particular sentry called sergeant of guard can pas up fergus said sharply be well known to marshal keith will assuredly see soldier took up to anteroom lieutenant lindsay who be on duty came forward looked at doubtfully for moment then shouted joyfully why drummond be be indeed joyful meeting old fellow have thought of a immured in one of enemy fortress a likely to remain there till war be over now here be marshal will be delighted can not be more pleased than be to be back again lindsay be alone yes come in at once wo announce opened door gentleman to see marshal said fergus walked in marshal recognized at once holding out hand shook of fergus cordially be indeed glad to see said knew that be unhurt for on morning after battle sent in parlementaire to browne with list of prisoner taken received list in return a name be among be not put down a wounded anxiety about be relieved tried month later to get exchange must not hear of in first place there be doubt that king action in incorporating saxon with army have caused strong feeling against in second have plenty of fortress in to stow prisoner while must calculate that more prisoner have to look after fewer men must have to fight now tell by what miracle have got here have nothing particular to do lindsay may a well stop hear story tell sergeant to call out if one in particular come to everyone else be engaged stay broke off have just told that luncheon be ready in next room story be always better told over bottle of wine so tell sergeant lindsay for next hour can see one unless be on very particular business now in first place captain drummond oh of course have not heard broke off in answer to fergus look of surprise king watched charge through austrian squadron when saw reach cavalry in safety turned to come back ordered at once to make out commission a captain ventured to object that be very young said have saved cavalry that must promote if be infant in arm be really absurd marshal will feel downright ashamed to be called captain by men still lieutenant though dozen year older than be fear have gone over lindsay head need not mind drummond lindsay laughed will have chance one of day not soul will grudge promotion there be many of who saw charge can tell that be talk of whole army next day be thoroughly recognized that saved cavalry for commander must certainly have taken against austrian if have be equally certain that none of must have got back again when name appeared in order next day felt that one ever better deserved promotion king inquired especially a soon a list came whether be wounded fergus keith said be very much pleased when heard that be not now let hear how come to be here marshal laughed heartily when fergus told of escape in disguise of austrian field officer be most admirably managed fergus said when tale be finished making for vienna instead of for frontier be masterly stroke of course finding friend there be most fortunate even have not done so have doubt must have got through somehow think best idea of be taking post horse then getting fresh suit of clothes from postmaster be glad ordered major suit of clothes to be sent back to must have liked to have seen face when found that not only uniform prisoner have disappeared will be good story to tell king have sore trouble enough on shoulder for difficulty be thickening round although frederick be born general really love peace quiet book society of few friend far better than turmoil into be plunged french be going to open campaign in spring with army of hundred thousand men russia will invade east frontier with certainly a many more perhaps hundred fifty thousand say rascally swede who have not shadow of quarrel against intend to land fifty thousand men in pomerania austria will put two hundred fifty thousand in field even tempered relying a king be be enough to drive to despair anything will interest for hour make forget difficulty be very welcome marshal asked many question for a said king must like to know in out of matter knew that fergus must much rather that story must be told king by than that must be called upon to do so hope horse came back safely lindsay fergus asked a left marshal apartment oh yes went back with convoy of wounded be now safe in keith stable other be of course at count sent thing back at same time when returned here packed everything up sewed in sack be in storeroom what have become of karl did get safely back yes have nasty sabre wound got in charge be in hospital for six week king gave handsome present on day after came in must have given commission if must have taken declined altogether saying that be very comfortable a be colonel must have made sergeant at once refused that also just at present be still looking after horse helping generally in keith stable wound be on head be scarcely fit for duty with regiment so of course will now fall in to place with again fergus went down to stable where be received with greatest delight by karl whose pride in master be great after exploit at count eulenfurst have be heightened by feeling excited in army at having saved cavalry from destruction thought that must be back by spring captain said donald have talked over many time be of one mind that if one must get away from austrian prison must do chapter prague next morning fergus rode over to see count eulenfurst found quite restored to health be received by countess thirza with great pleasure illustration fergus be received by count countess thirza with great pleasure return in safety be in small degree due to count have not be for letter to count platurn with countess furnished doubt whether must have be able to get through at rate if have done so must only have be with many hardship danger certainly great delay have doubt that help received from count be of considerable assistance to lessened difficulty much captain drummond be sure must have managed without have formed plan a to what must have done have found absent have thought of several thing count have settled on nothing must have remained day in vienna must have exchanged suit have got from innkeeper for other idea be that have best join one of convoy of provision going up to bohemia calculated must have difficulty in obtaining place a driver for of course service be not popular of men must have be glad enough for to take place might thus have got forward a far a prague after must have taken chance think must in same sort of way have got a far a leitmeritz there might have be detained for very long time until there be opportunity of crossing defile must have be difficult indeed for to have earned living there what be left of money have after paying for landlord suit must scarce have lasted with closest pinching till spring must have managed somehow be sure thirza said confidently after getting out of strong fortress must be nothing to get out of bohemia into saxony have not congratulated yet countess said upon last promotion lieutenant lindsay came over to tell about how have gained of course be greatly pleased although grieved to hear that have be made prisoner wondered whether at time be captured have of letter have written with whether must come in useful did not even occur to that must have called upon count platurn cousin thought that might be detained at prague vienna be last place where must have pictured have known that have be sent to spielberg think must have given up hope of seeing again until be exchanged for have heard that be one of strongest of austrian fortress do hope captain drummond will see great deal of winter there will not be many gaiety though doubt there will be state ball there will be many little gathering a usual among ourselves will count upon to attend always unless be detained on service learn that be probable king will pas whole of winter here will send horse down to today count said will find in good condition have be regularly exercised thank very much count wrote to before started have have opportunity of thanking personally for splendid animal sorry a be to lose horse rode at lobositz congratulated be not riding one of yours must have have difficulty in replacing captain drummond count said with smile least can do be to keep in horse flesh while war last hope will not be very long for surely king can never hope to make head against force will assail in spring will be glad to make peace on term doubt must be glad to count a enemy propose to divide dominion among be not very clear what term must make though grant that on paper odds against be enormous think that will see there will be hard fighting yet before prussia be partitioned perhaps so count replied surely end must be same know have be strong opponent of course taken by court here saxony prussia a protestant country must be natural ally consider be infamous that court rather bruhl who be powerful must have joined in coalition against frederick who have given cause of complaint sympathy then be wholly with can see hope whatever of successfully resisting tremendous combination various thing might happen count empress of russia austria pompadour might die ally might quarrel between england may find capable statesman who will once again get army together joined perhaps by netherlands give france so much to do will not be able to give much help to ally yes thing might happen frederick first campaign have be to great extent failure be true that have established saxony a base saxon troop will be of advantage to must have acted much more wisely have on surrender allowed to disband go to home many then might have enlisted voluntarily country must not have have legitimate grievance common religious tie must soon have turned scale in favour of prussia who a see have be driven to invasion by court intrigue with austria have done must have marched straight to prague have overrun bohemia established headquarters there menaced vienna in spring looking at coolly that might have be best way count man who find three four of neighbour have entered into plot to attack house seize good may be pardoned if doe not at first go very wisest way to work count laughed hope that next campaign will turn out differently own can scarce see possibility of prussia alone making head against danger surround winter passed quietly there be fete state ball many private entertainment for while europe be indignant pretended to be so at occupation of saxony people of country be by mean so angry on own account be more heavily taxed by frederick than be by own court now that published treaty between confederate have made evident that country without own consent have be deeply engaged in conspiracy hostile to prussia none must deny that frederick be amply justified in step have taken at party only prussian officer who be personal friend of host be invited fergus who have be introduced by count eulenfurst to acquaintance be always asked be requested to bring with few of personal friend lindsay therefore be generally companion be indeed in short time invited for own sake for scottish officer be regarded in different light to prussian pleasant manner frank gaiety made general favourite duty a aide de camp be now light indeed although be two three time sent with despatch to berlin even to more distant part of prussia where preparation for coming campaign be being made on great scale whole prussian population be united be war not for conquest for existence class responded cheerfully to royal demand be confined to order for draft of men for new tax of kind be laid on people expense of war being met entirely from treasure have since termination of silesian war be steadily accumulating fixed sum being laid by year to meet emergency might arise towards spring party be ready to take field ally have men ready for service frederick have well trained soldier while newly raised troop be posted in fortress at point most open to invasion odds be indeed sufficient to appall even steadfast heart of frederick of prussia one must have judged from calm tranquil manner in king made arrangement to meet storm that have doubt a to issue man for man prussian soldier of time be finest in world be splendidly drilled absolutely obedient to order filled with implicit confidence in king comrade have be taught to march with extraordinary rapidity at same time to manoeuvre with regularity perfection of machine must be trusted in emergency to do everything that man be capable of french army strong be first to move men be preparing to march to join army have be got up by mixed body german federation main force be to move through hanover to oppose be mixed army maintained by british money comprising hanoverian brunswickers hessian strong commanded by duke of cumberland with be prussian who have by frederick order evacuated frontier fortress joined what be called british army of observation frederick prepared for present to deal with austrian intending if successful against to send off men to strengthen cumberland army proposed swedish invasion be altogether disregarded thirty thousand men principally militia be posted to check russian invasion so quiet have be preparation that none of enemy dreamt that prussian must assume offensive considered that must confine effort to defending defile into saxony silesia be not frederick idea a spring approached have be busy redistributing troop from winter cantonment preparing three army for invasion of bohemia april have be busy month for staff aide de camp have passed day even night on horseback at last be in readiness for delivery of stroke on th king started from lockwitch facing old saxon camp at duke of bevern from lousitz marshal schwerin from schlesien without slightest warning three great column poured down into bohemia movement took austrian absolutely by surprise not dreaming of step on frederick part have prepared near frontier vast magazine for supply of advancing army have to be abandoned in greatest haste sufficient amount of food to supply entire army for three month fell into hand of prussian marshal browne general konigseck who commanded austrian army in bohemia fell back to prague with greatest speed that must make light irregular corp that frederick have raised during winter placed under experienced energetic officer pervaded whole country capturing magazine town putting to ransom dispersing small body of enemy spreading terror far wide browne succeeded in reaching prague before king must come up to bevern however overtook konigseck greatly hastened retreat killing thousand men taking five hundred prisoner after konigseck reached prague without further molestation duke of bevern joining schwerin column austrian retired through prague encamped on high ground on south side of city prince karl being now in command of whole have prince be possessed of military talent listened to marshal browne advice instead of taking up defensive position must have marched with whole army against king whose force must very greatly have outnumbered instead of doing so remained inactive on nd of may twelve day after moving from saxony frederick arrived within sight of prague so closely have followed retreating austrian that occupied that evening monastery at prince karl marshal browne have slept night before thirty thousand men who be under command of marshal keith be left to watch prague garrison while frederick on tuesday searched for spot where must cross river effect junction with schwerin knew position have arranged that three cannon shot be to be signal that river have be crossed pontoon bridge be rapidly thrown over signal be given prussian poured across before whole be over schwerin light cavalry came up arrangement be made that two force must meet at six o'clock next morning at spot within two mile of austrian camp on lisca hill map battle of prague time austrian stood inactive permitted prussian column to join hand without slightest attempt to interfere with have browne be in command very different step must have be taken prince karl be indolent self confident opinionated have set army to work to strengthen position in possible manner be naturally extremely strong right flank being covered by swampy ground formed by chain of pond from water be let off in winter ground sown with oat be now brilliant green to eye of frederick general surveying from distance have aspect of ordinary meadow whole ground be commanded by redoubt battery on hill rose precipitately seven eight hundred foot behind position in battery be sixty heavy cannon while there be in addition one hundred fifty field gun well might prince karl think position altogether unassailable believe that if prussian be mad enough to attack must be destroyed frederick schwerin spent much time in surveying position agreed that on two side austrian position be absolutely impregnable on right flank attack be possible schwerin must fain have waited until next morning since troop be fatigued by long march have be on foot since midnight austrian however be expecting reinforcement of thirty thousand men under daun to join hourly king therefore decided on attack terrible obstacle presented by swamp being altogether unnoticed with incredible speed prussian moved away to left by eleven o'clock be in readiness to attack right flank of austrian position browne however be in command here a soon a intention of prussian be perceived swung back right wing of army at right angle to original position so that presented front to prussian attack massing thickly at village at edge of swamp rapidly whole of artillery cavalry be formed up on face quick a have be advance of prussian austrian be perfectly ready to meet led by general winterfeld prussian rushed forward a advanced terrific artillery fire be opened upon be wounded severely troop fell back main body now advanced under schwerin whole again pressed forward in spite of incessant rain of grape case shot prussian advanced until reached pleasant green meadow have seen in distance then real nature of ground be at once disclosed troop sunk to knee in many case to waist in treacherous mud soldier le valiant le disciplined must have shrunk appalled at obstacle prussian struggled on dragging forward with greatest difficulty through mud through slush through rain of grape from upwards of two hundred cannon through storm of musketry fire from infantry regiment after regiment a reached edge of dismal swamp plunged in unhesitatingly crawling struggling onward never in annals of warfare be there more terrible fight for three hour continued without moment interval thousand of assailant have fallen body have be trodden deep into swamp a comrade pressed after sometimes regiment struggled back out of mire thinking beyond mortal power to win victory under such term next moment reformed flung into fight again schwerin seeing regiment named after recoil placed at head shouting follow son led till fell dead struck by five grape shot austrian fought a stoutly marshal browne leading till cannonball took off foot be carried into prague to die there six week later while terrible struggle be going on prussian cavalry have made very wide circuit round pond lakelets charged austrian horse on browne extreme right first line be broken by so many strong be that prussian be brought to standstill then drew back charged second third time austrian gave way prince karl brave if incapable did best to rally in vain at last fled in headlong rout pursued for many mile by ziethen horseman still infantry struggle be maintained at last prussian right wing not engaged though suffering from artillery fire on height have turn general mannstein discovered that at angle where browne threw back right wing of army to face prussian there be gap troop there have gradually pressed more to right to take part in tremendous conflict elbow be therefore defended only by half moon battery through fish tank led way followed by prince henry ferdinand whole division struggled through mud drove back austrian hastily brought up to oppose captured battery poured into gap thereby cutting austrian army in two taking half in flank be deciding point of battle austrian right already holding own with difficulty be crumpled up forced to fall back hastily other half of army isolated by irruption threw back endeavoured to make fresh stand at spot defended by battery stockade be in vain prussian pressed forward exultingly fresh troop leading way in spite of confusion occasioned by loss of commander of surprise caused by sudden breakup of line by inrush of mannstein prince austrian fought stoutly four time made stand prussian be not to be denied austrian gun have be captured be turned against at last giving way fled for prague where of rushed for shelter while fled up valley of moldau have not be that accident upset frederick calculation greater portion of austrian must have be obliged to lay down arm prince maurice of dessau have be ordered to move with right wing of keith army strong to take up position in austrian rear position must have reached hour before in passage down narrow lane of pontoon for bridging river be injured when bridge be put together proved too short to reach opposite bank cavalry in vain endeavoured to swim river stream be too strong frederick masterly combination broke down bulk of austrian instead of being forced to surrender be simply shut up in prague with garrison battle of prague be one of fiercest ever fought austrian army have improved wonderfully since silesian war artillery be specially good infantry have adopted many of prussian improvement have browne be in sole command have escaped unwounded issue of day might have be changed prussian lost men killed wounded austrian including prisoner frederick put loss higher estimating that of austrian at of whom be prisoner of prussian at without counting marshal schwerin who alone be worth about be evident that king estimate of loss of austrian must have be excessive have advantage of standing on defensive prussian gun did comparatively little service while own strong battery played with tremendous effect upon prussian struggling waist deep in mud there can therefore be little doubt that latter must have suffered in killed wounded much heavier loss than austrian impassive a be accustomed to show feeling little frederick be deeply affected at loss of trusted general of splendid soldier who have be so long carefully trained even have prague fallen victory must have be disastrous one for for threatened a be by overwhelming force loss of men to be quite a serious a of men to confederate in keith army there have be considerable disappointment when became known that be to remain impassive spectator of struggle that while comrade be fighting have simply to blockade northern side of city will have plenty of opportunity marshal said quietly to aide de camp on seeing downcast look war be beginning will be turn next time for be great task king have set in attempting to carry strong position that austrian have taken up will not do without very heavy loss tomorrow may have reason to congratulate yourselves that have have share in business nevertheless a day went on tremendous roar of battle rolled down upon terrible continuous never ceasing for three hour even keith walked in state of feverish anxiety backwards forward in front of tent while troop stood in group talking in low tone trying to pierce with eye dun coloured cloud of smoke that hung over combatant on other side of prague when at last din of battle went rolling down towards city feeling of joy be intense in many relief from tension long excitement be so great that burst into tear shook hand with other others threw cap into air then few voice burst into well known verse of church hymn nun danket alle gott mit herzen mund und haenden of english translation run now thank god with hand heart voice in moment be taken up by deep voice in solemn chorus regimental band at once joining in jubilant thanksgiving pious men be honest protestant hard fighting soldier very frequently on long march beguiled way by stirring hymn of church keith around stood bare headed a hymn be sung not word be spoken for time after strain have subsided that be good to listen to keith said breaking silence have often heard psalm singing of cromwell ironside spoken of with something like contempt can understand now how men who sing like with heart must be almost invincible be grandest thing have ever heard marshal fergus said of course have heard when be marching did not sound like fergus be appropriateness of occasion perhaps depth of feeling of men own sense of immense relief that made so striking listen there be fresh outburst of firing austrian have fallen back be fighting stoutly chief effect of great battle be of moral rather than material kind prague be not strong place with garrison of men be too well defended to assault until be taken frederick must not march on a have intended leave so great force in rear moral effect be however enormous ally have deemed that have ridiculously easy task before that frederick must have to retreat before advancing army must at last see that there be nothing surrender before that must have emerged from behind shelter of saxon hill have shattered most formidable army of threatened on ground of own choosing intrenched fortified caused feeling of consternation dismay french army russian united force of french with german confederacy be arrested on march month elapsed before be again set in motion marshal daun who have arrived at erdwise fell back at once when news reached taking post at entrance of defile made greatest effort to increase army reinforcement be sent to from vienna adjacent country duke of bevern be posted with men to watch frederick sat down with force to capture prague siege train be hurried up from dresden on th of may battery on south side of city of keith on north opened fire on city for month missile be poured into town magazine be blown up terrible destruction done garrison held out firmly at time made sortie be always driven in again with much loss men behind fortification however weak be not to be attacked approach to city be closely guarded became at last evident that a long a provision held out prague be not to be taken cannonade became le incessant after month almost died away for daun have by time gathered large army be evident that great battle must have to be fought if be won by prussian prague must be forced to surrender if not city be saved be not until th of june daun cautious careful general in accordance with urgent order from vienna prepared to advance force have now grown to of garrison of prague must be spared to issue out to help frederick have under of great portion must remain to guard siege work thus then advantage lay with relieving army several officer in disguise be despatched by daun to carry into prague news of advance to warn prince karl to sally out with whole of force fall upon prussian a soon a attacked in rear so vigilant however be besieger that none of messenger succeeded in entering prague on th frederick set out with men to be followed by more under prince maurice two day later being must be spared from siege work to join bevern who have fallen back a daun advanced junction effected frederick joined bevern approached daun who be posted in strong position near kolin thirty five mile from prague on th prince maurice arrived after several change of position army faced other on th within short distance of kolin daun new position be also strong one be in fact only to be assailed on right prussian army be moved in direction order being to pay attention to austrian battery musketry fire to march steadily to spot indicated be done ziethen dashed with hussar upon austrian cavalry drawn up to bar way defeated drove far from field while hulsen division of infantry carried village of preezer on austrian flank in spite of austrian battery so far frederick combination have worked admirably hulsen then attacked wood behind strongly held by austrian here struggle commenced lasted whole day wood being several time taken lost be not supported owing to mistake entirely upset frederick plan of battle while three mile away from point where attack be to be delivered mannstein whose quickness of inspiration have largely contributed to victory of prague now ruined frederick plan by impetuosity corn field through division be marching towards assault of austrian left be full of croat who kept up so galling fire that losing patience turned attacked regiment to gave order cleared croat off returned strongly reinforced regiment coming behind supposing that fresh order have arrived also turned off in short time whole division whose support be so sorely needed by hulsen be assaulting almost impregnable austrian position in front mistake time arising from misconception of too brief positive order given by frederick led prince maurice who commanded prussian centre to hurl in like manner against austrian for four hour battle raged in spite of disadvantage prussian fought so desperately that daun believed day to be lost sent order to troop to retreat to suchdol commander of saxon cavalry considered order premature gathering large body of austrian infantry charged with own cavalry so furiously upon hulsen that latter be forced to retreat movement spread attack slackened other division moved down hill have won frederick in vain tried to rally lead afresh to attack have done men must do battle ceased daun scarcely attempted to pursue prussian marched away unmolested even by cavalry of regiment remaining firm in position until nightfall repulsing with great loss one attempt of austrian at pursuit ziethen cavalry did not draw off until ten at night austrian have men in field of whom lost in killed wounded prussian who began day strong lost of whom prisoner including wounded amounted to news of disaster with frederick order to prepare to raise siege of prague at once came like thunderclap upon prussian camp frederick remnant of army arrived there in good order with baggage train day later cannon be removed from battery magazine emptied in good order without attempt on part of austrian garrison to molest prussian army marched away took up post at news that austrian army have at last beaten frederick that prague be saved caused exultation joy among ally equal to dismay have be aroused by defeat at prague although there be nothing remarkable worth much congratulation in fact that army in almost impregnable position have repulsed attack of of little over strength chapter in disguise leitmeritz lying a did short distance beyond mouth of defile leading into saxony be admirably chosen position supply for army must be brought up by elbe retreat be assured

everyone know that great many of be there against will hesse gotha dessau men must prefer fighting on prussian side when be called out have to obey at what time will start must like to get to erfurt a soon a place be astir be by five man said there be trumpeting drumming enough by time one must sleep longer if wanted to then will start at dawn peasant must have given up bed to fergus latter must not hear of said that be quite accustomed to sleeping on ground whereupon peasant went out returned with large armful of rush a told fergus have cut only day before to mend hole in thatch fergus be well content for knew well enough that must sleep very much better on fresh rush than must in peasant bed place where must probably be assailed by army of flea a soon a man wife be astir in morning fergus got up bathed head face in tiny streamlet ran within few yard of house then after cutting hunch of bread to eat on way two started did not come down upon main road until within mile half of town then passed through large village where troop of french cavalry be engaged in grooming horse attracted attention whatever entered erfurt at quarter past five separated when got into town agreeing to meet in front of cathedral at eleven o'clock fergus went to eating house where saw party of french non commissioned officer soldier seated be talking freely confident that landlord man who be serving two three german present must understand be evident that have very little confidence in soubise one must think sergeant said that be going to change nationality to settle down here for life here have fifty thousand men there be nothing to stop going to dresden except ten thousand twelve thousand prussian say that daun have army must eat up frederick be certain that must not spare sergeant guard to help bar way can not understand comrade leisurely way of making war may suit people be not way must admit that be not prussian way said be enemy though why be sure know be not business way that dash out set austrian dancing be really splendid wish that own general have little of fritz energy go there be general murmur of assent here be september beginning next to nothing done now there must be enough to do if fritz must get away from daun dash off in direction yes said there must be plenty to do must not mind wagering that must not wait for after be not sure if must not be best thing to do for german with be little better than rabble be so francois mixed up with a must be must have to fight whether liked not at rate if mean to fight what be here for can not say laughed own be not so eager to fight a seem to be be very comfortable ride about country take pretty well what like be better than being in barrack at home while on other hand be joke fighting prussian fight be not skirmish be battle be not question of few hundred killed be question of ding dong fighting of fifteen twenty thousand killed on side joke that for part be quite content to take easy at erfurt to leave to austrian to settle matter with obstinate fellow so continued talking fergus saw that so far news whatever of frederick march against erfurt have reached learned too that although there be outlying body to north main bulk of force lay in around erfurt contempt with french soldier spoke of german portion of army be very great little state have by order of council of confederacy be compelled to furnish contingent even if representative in council have opposed proposal therefore very many of men have joined unwillingly while in other case french declared that levy have be made up by hiring idler ne'er do well in town so a to avoid having to put conscription into force in rural district officer be declared to be a incapable a men have not be that austrian contingent five thousand strong have be joined with drilling largely undertaken by non commissioned officer of force nothing approaching order discipline must have be maintained frenchman lamented fortune in having to act with such ally instead of being with purely french army be gradually pressing duke of cumberland to seaboard fergus waited until party have left inn when landlord came across to hand reckoning bad time master said bad time shaking head ruefully yes be bad enough landlord must say that must be doing good trade with soldier in town good trade landlord repeated be being ruined do not know that in addition to levying heavy contribution on town issued regulation settling price at troop be to be served at beer shop inn breakfast saw what fellow ate penny tumbler of wine penny dinner penny why item cost more than double a nobody brings in cattle for might be seized on way compensation given so meat get dearer be waiting until there be none to be have on term then will send representative to general to point out to that be absolutely impossible for to obey regulation ah be terrible time must not have suffered more than have coburg joined frederick though say that richelieu french army be plundering even worse in hanover country beyond than soubise be doing here moreover one must rather be plundered by enemy than by fellow who pretend to come hither a friend if frederick must march in here must open house free to comer must not grudge last drop of wine in cellar there be never saying fergus replied king of prussia always appears when least expected more unlikely thing have happened than that must appear here fine morning illustration a fergus be sallying out mounted officer dashed by at gallop having paid reckoning went to door a be sallying out mounted officer dashed by at headlong gallop horse be flecked with foam be evident that have ridden far fast on important errand having nothing to do until must meet peasant fergus followed officer at leisurely pace in five minute came up with horse held by soldier at entrance gate of very large house sentry be pacing up down in front of officer going in be that headquarters of french general asked townsman yes man walked on with muttered malediction few minute later several mounted officer rode out dashed off in haste in various direction there be evidently something up fergus said to perhaps have got news of prussian approach in quarter of hour several general officer arrived entered house be evident that council of war have be summoned hour elapsed then number of aide de camp staff officer rode off in haste few minute later trumpet sounded regimental call then assembly before have died away similar call echoed from part of town soldier ran hastily through street mounted officer dashed in direction citizen came to door in surprise at sudden movement fergus have longer doubt about cause of stir great thing now be to ascertain whether army must advance to take up strong position outside town oppose prussian advance whether must march away being fifty thousand in number former must appear to be natural course for general to adopt a frederick have with twenty three thousand men of fact however soubise must be ignorant might only have heard that prussian army be marching to annihilate before long baggage waggon began to clatter through street be being driven westward be in same direction that regiment made way fergus followed to plain outside town tent have already be struck troop a arrived from town camp be marwilled in order long train of baggage waggon be already making way westward there be longer ground for doubt that soubise be retreating be just eleven o'clock when fergus returned to cathedral peasant be awaiting seem on move latter said have heard much about doe not matter now fergus replied must get back to place a quickly a can not word be spoken until have left town must be going up into hanover to join french army there peasant said be running away frederick will be here tomorrow night at rate next day news seems too good to be true master how have learnt have learnt from one here be one of king officer came on here to find out whether enemy must be likely to come out fight must bolt when heard of advance lord be praised man said piously taking off hat a spoke thought sir that there be something curious in having such horse still more so in wanting to find out about force of enemy here be business of mine felt that must be friend for have be austrian french must have ridden boldly into town a went along road be met by several troop of cavalry riding at full speed be way came morning shortest yes sir by good mile then will return by said fergus a soon a left main road went at run for distance then broke into fast walk in hour from time of leaving erfurt arrived at hut will run along fetch horse sir peasant said will go doe not know might refuse to let come near in few minute fergus returned with horse saddle bridle wallet be quickly put on fergus dropped pistol into saddlebag buckled on sword have brought with be not own one have bought at starting good piece of steel with battered rusty sheath showed that have be lying for week possibly for month on field of battle before being picked up then with word of adieu thanks to peasant wife slipping crown piece into hand of latter mounted rode off chapter rossbach fergus knew that there be several cavalry post ahead thought likely that of might be left to give warning of prussian approach therefore rode across country for mile have begun to think that must have gone beyond limit of outpost when saw hussar pacing across line in front of beat evidently being between two small wood three four hundred yard apart checked horse a saw fergus approaching be good tempered looking fellow nodded to fergus a much a to say that if must speak language must like chat with latter at once checked horse said good day in french ah speak language soldier said be glad to exchange word with someone be hot here especially when one time be up one ought to have be relieved hour ago yes can understand expect have be forgotten well doe not make much difference will get off next guard in consequence will have to wait time before be relieved if stop here what do mean soldier asked mean that when left erfurt army be moving west a rode along met several troop of cavalry galloping to join be strange news nothing be known when came out here no news only arrived at erfurt morning that frederick army be within day march saw troop march out baggage waggon on way before started say that troop may have gone may have stopped to form post of observation well at rate will go into village see ought to have be relieved hour ago if have such news a have remained there must have be sure to have sent to order videttes to use special vigilance have only be posted here a sort of practice for did not think that there be enemy within hundred fifty mile now if news be true may have prussian cavalry coming along at moment well thank for warning turning horse went off at gallop a outpost must not have be set except by party most in advance fergus knew that there be now no more risk of falling in with enemy unless cavalry force have be sent forward to endeavour to get idea of force of prussian a general have so precipitately decided upon retreat be not likely that must have ordered reconnaissance of kind to be made therefore presently regained main road riding fast arrived at place where prussian have pitched camp thirty mile from erfurt having made twenty mile march day dismounted at house where keith have established quarter have bad news for sir said word of coming reached erfurt at eight o'clock morning by eleven whole army be on march westward bag baggage be bad news fergus must hardly have brought worse king have hoped to have struck heavy blow then to be off again to face austrian what strength be about fifty thousand how did get news of coming can not say sir have gone into erfurt soon after five have already picked up good deal of news from talk of party of french non commissioned officer who be taking breakfast at small inn who not imagining must understand talked very freely over affair sat over meal time did not go out until have left just a did so mounted officer galloped past at speed showed be bearer of important despatch followed to soubise headquarters while there noticed several mounted officer rode out in great haste quarter of hour later several general officer arrived there be consultation for hour then officer rode off in direction in few minute trumpet be sounding drum beating over town in very short time movement began towards western gate by ten o'clock tent be struck round town waggon loaded be on way west hour later whole force be in movement in direction a issued from town on side met cavalry have be scattered among village galloping in think that there be at present moment enemy within ten mile of erfurt be in danger none at sir passed night at friendly peasant hut five mile side of town inside advanced post left horse in wood peasant guided by bypath to town did not exchange word with anyone except landlord of hotel where breakfasted be bitterly hostile to enemy also spoke to solitary french vidette who have in hurry of retreat be left behind told that have best be off a whole army be in full march for west well if breakfasted at six morning must be hungry dinner will be ready in hour have better share with must go now tell king news that have brought said nothing to about having sent in twenty minute marshal returned king wish to see fergus of course be vexed always take bad news well unless be result of blunder of one of officer doe not say much even then be very bad for officer when see frederick never forgives blunder well captain drummond so have be playing spy for have be doing best majesty french be gone bag baggage yes sire have gone off west to perch somewhere among mountain suppose perhaps will get bolder presently when hear that be more than double strength did learn anything more than what marshal keith have told heard great deal of talk among party of french non commissioned officer sire expressed great dissatisfaction with general at long delay also spoke with absolute contempt of confederacy army officer men said that if have not be for drilling by austrian non commissioned officer must be nothing better than rabble daresay soubise be of same opinion king said want to have few week more drill before set in line of battle however have doubt will manage to bring to book before return well be obliged to for zeal captain drummond although keith tell that got in without being questioned such business be always dangerous mayhap next time will have better opportunity for distinguishing a managed to pas so freely among after made escape from prison can clearly be trusted on work of kind fergus saluted retired next morning troop started a usual at daybreak be to make short march for have longer occasion for speed have made hundred fifty mile at very rapid pace when halted frederick with cavalry rode straight on into erfurt wait to put on uniform now keith said to fergus on return from royal quarter dinner be waiting be ready if be not lindsay be going to dine with too well lindsay marshal said a latter entered see advantage of young fellow being able to speak german well if have be taken prisoner at lobositz must have be fast in spielberg at present see be now able to undertake perilous mission peril mean promotion quite see that marshal lindsay said with smile though can get on with french fairly enough tongue doe seem to be able to form crack jaw german word see marshal be not only one doe not think sir bad a german be be not much worse than own have be here much longer than have marshal laughed be right can not say half dozen german word see have not have motive for acquiring can not very well get promotion again must not do for to speak better german than king of prussia who beyond few word necessary for animating troop on occasion know very little german for general work here french be amply sufficient because officer speaks a see german be very useful too to young officer who wish to push forward be willing to undertake special work of kind even then marshal must have advantage over prussian officer who speaks french depends good deal upon prussian officer greater portion of be mere machine splendid fighting machine doubt of great use outside own work anyone must detect with eye nineteen out of twenty of dress how must disguise a like step regulation length bring foot down in regulation way be a stiff a if have swallowed ramrod have suppleness adaptability be so accustomed to obey that have almost lost power of originating must be taken shot before be in enemy line ten minute now fergus have advantage of knowing language of being quick witted sharp next two month be passed in march to fro seidlitz with cavalry took possession of gotha to great satisfaction of duke duchess king rode over dined with while seidlitz remained there a governor with couple of regiment of horse strong body of french austrian hussar grenadier artillery marched against gotha seidlitz having so few men to oppose evacuated place enemy marched into in triumphant procession duke duchess made best of matter invited principal officer to banquet just a be sitting down to seidlitz with prussian reappeared men being so artfully scattered about appeared great deal stronger than be enemy be seized with panic soubise general mounted in great haste in few minute whole be retreating at top speed seidlitz pursuing for distance killing thirty taking sixty prisoner with large amount of baggage plunder then returning to gotha to eat dinner prepared for enemy ferdinand of brunswick with division have be sent off to check if possible movement of french army under richelieu near magdeburg in october came startling news that berlin be threatened that force said to be fifteen thousand strong under general haddick be in rapid motion towards prince maurice be ordered to hasten to defence king also moved in direction invading force be four thousand strong number however be so magnified by rumour that governor of berlin who have four thousand troop did not venture to oppose sent royal family archive away under strong escort haddick occupied suburb of city knowing that a soon a real force be known must be hotly opposed receiving news that prince maurice be rapidly approaching demanded ransom of pound finally accepted pound then hurried away prince maurice arrived twenty four hour later consequence of little success magnified by report into berlin captured prussian royal family in flight turned out very advantageous to frederick enthusiasm in paris vienna be enormous order be despatched to army to set to without further delay finish work fifteen thousand men be sent from richelieu army to reinforce soubise who thereupon issued from mountain stronghold marched against leipzig frederick however arrived there first ferdinand maurice joining day two later while waiting there frederick received joyful news that england requested to appoint duke ferdinand of brunswick commander in chief of army until now commanded by duke of cumberland who have just sailed for england pitt have now risen to almost absolute power in england be busied in reforming abuse in army navy dismissing incapable official preparing to render efficient aid to hard pressed ally proposal that prince ferdinand must assume command of army whose effort have hitherto be rendered nugatory by utter incompetence of duke of cumberland who although personally a brave a lion be absolutely ignorant of war afforded immense satisfaction to king better choice must have be made ferdinand be related to royal family of england prussia be capable general prudent at same time enterprising firm under difficulty ready to seize opportunity under command there be doubt that northern army have hitherto be useless have only be saved from absolute destruction by incompetence of french general must now play useful part on october th soubise in spite of order to fight fact that have double strength of prussian fell back before soubise felt confidence in troop upon other hand officer of confederate army be puffed up with vanity remonstrated hotly against retreat next day frederick came in sight of soubise army be camped on height near town of weissenfels frederick have one half of force with other half under keith being still detached five thousand men garrisoned weissenfels frederick made short work of place cannon burst down gate troop rushed forward with speed garrison fled across bridge over saale have already be prepared for burning set on fire in such haste that four hundred be unable to cross be made prisoner fugitive joined army on other side of elbe gun opened upon burning bridge to prevent prussian from trying to extinguish flame prussian returned fire artillery duel be kept up until three o'clock by time bridge be consumed frederick have already fixed upon spot suitable for erection of during night while enemy be falling back to take up fresh position upon higher ground engineer working diligently succeeded in throwing bridge across keith arrived at next morning strong force lay opposite ready to dispute passage when soubise found that king be crossing by new bridge called in detachment marched away to strong position there set in array ready to receive attack keith bridge be finished on rd of november afternoon crossed joined frederick on th army be on move by two o'clock in morning bright moon be shining by light be discovered that enemy have shifted position for one much stronger with approach protected by patch of wood bog prussian army therefore marched back to camp king hoping that being so far from base of supply enemy must be forced ere long to make movement must afford chance of attacking under better circumstance ground from weissenfels rise very gradually to height of hundred twenty foot so in so flat country be regarded a hill on slight swelling be several small village of rossbach be principal standing high up on crest here frederick right wing be posted while left be at bedra king took up quarter at large house in rossbach from roof at eight o'clock on morning of th saw that enemy be getting into motion moving away towards left movement have begun much earlier hour later have passed through village of grost be apparently making way to freiburg where have magazine hoping to have chance of attacking rear frederick ordered cavalry to saddle whole army to be in readiness then sat down to dinner with officer at noon little did dream at time that slow clumsy movement that be watching be intended by enemy to end in flank attack on on previous day soubise with general looking down on prussian camp have reckoned force at ten thousand in reality have seen only portion of camp site being hidden by dip of ground even soubise thought with odds of over five to one in favour must fight battle with certainty of success planned masterly march by must place on frederick left rear drive into bend made by saale annihilate army in enthusiasm at happy idea sent off courier to carry news to versailles that be about to annihilate prussian army take king prisoner frederick dinner be prolonged there be nothing to be done patience be one of king strong point at two o'clock officer who have remained on watch on housetop hurried down with news that enemy have suddenly turned to left king went up to roof with officer at once divined intention of foe be glorious moment for at last after three weary month be to meet in battle instantly order be given in hour prussian army be in movement with exception of irregular corp be left to occupy attention of enemy horse have be posted a if to threaten rossbach by line taken prussian be at once hidden behind crest of hill from enemy so soubise thought that prussian being afraid of attack be marching away with speed for keith bridge at merseburg accordingly hurried on cavalry ordered infantry to go at double for purpose of capturing runaway prussian in meantime seidlitz with four thousand horse trotted briskly along until reached still concealed from enemy sight spot towards be hurrying in two great column headed by seven thousand cavalry allowed to move forward until be on flank then dashed over crest of hill charged like thunderbolt upon taken completely by surprise enemy cavalry have scarce time to form two austrian regiment two french be alone able to do so there be withstanding impetus of prussian charge rode right through disordered cavalry turned formed recharged four time cut way through until broke away in headlong flight be pursued by seidlitz until out of sight from hill when turned waited to see where must find opportunity of striking blow by time frederick with infantry be now pouring over crest of hill advance heralded by fire of twenty four gun rapidly in echelon approached enemy in vain soubise endeavoured to face round column thus taken in flank to meet coming storm be seconded by broglio commander of confederate army two column be jammed together be in confusion at astounding unexpected attack order be unheard disobeyed everything be still in utter disorder when six battalion of prussian infantry hurled upon when forty pace distant poured in first terrible volley then continued fire

killed wounded five thousand prisoner seventy two gun while prussian lost one hundred sixty five killed three hundred seventy six wounded victory be one of most remarkable surprising ever gained for figure by mean represent full loss to defeated german portion of army after being chased for many mile scattered in direction only one regiment reached erfurt in military order in two day whole of men be on way to home in various state composing confederation french be in le disgraceful condition plundering a went mere disorganized rabble continued flight until fifty five mile from field of battle be long before gathered again in fighting order joy caused in prussia in england by astonishing victory be shared largely by inhabitant of country through french army have marched everywhere have plundered pillaged a if have be moving through enemy country instead of one have professed to come to deliver protestant inhabitant have everywhere be most cruelly maltreated church wrecked pastor treated a criminal greater portion of germany therefore regarded defeat of french a matter for gratification rather than reverse in england result be enormous have effect of vastly strengthening pitt position twenty thousand british troop be ere long despatched to join army under duke of brunswick be now called allied army from time french force under richelieu ceased to be dangerous to frederick france england be old antagonist entered upon duel of own duel be to cost france canada much besides to establish england naval preponderance to extinguish french influence in netherlands fergus drummond be not under fire at memorable battle of rossbach keith division be not in fact engaged affair having terminated before arrived keith however have ridden to position on brow of hill where king have stationed staff following have satisfaction of seeing enemy heavy column melt into mass of fugitive spread in direction over country like dust driven before sudden whirlwind what next wonder fergus said to lindsay who have three day before be promoted to rank of captain a much to satisfaction of fergus a to own suppose more marching lindsay replied may be sure that will be off again to try conclusion with prince karl bevern seems to be making sad mess of there of course be tremendously outnumbered thirty thousand men against eighty thousand have fallen back into silesia without making single stand suffered prince karl to plant between breslau schweidnitz prince be besieging latter town with twenty thousand men while with sixty thousand be facing bevern four day after victory indeed frederick set out with thirteen thousand men leaving prince henry to maintain line of saale guard saxony while marshal keith be to go into bohemia raise contribution there threaten a far a might be austrian post in country fergus however went with king army king having said to marshal keith lend that young aide de camp of yours have seen how can be trusted to carry despatch at risk to life be ingenious full of device have luck luck go for great deal like too have observed that be always lively cheery even at end of longest day work notice too that even though relation never becomes too familiar talk will be refreshing when want something to distract thought from weighty matter so fergus went with king who must ill afford to lose keith from side with none be more friendly intimate now that schwerin have gone relied upon more implicitly than upon other of officer keith have be for time unwell be suffering from asthma other ailment rendered rapid travel painful to must obtain more rest ease in bohemia than must find in rapid journey king intended to make on fifth day of march frederick heard to stupefaction that schweidnitz have surrendered place be extremely strong one king have relied confidently upon holding out for two three month fortification be constructed in best manner be abundantly supplied with cannon ammunition provision surrender be inexcusable fault be doubtless to large degree that of commandant who be man of resolution resource be also partly due to fact that portion of garrison be saxon who have at pirna be obliged to enter prussian service great number of deserted hundred eighty of in one day going over from advanced post to enemy with troop like there must be assurance that post must be firmly held fact might well shake confidence of commander in power of resistance blow be none le severe to frederick from being partly result of own mistaken step of enrolling men bitterly hostile in rank of army still disastrous a news be did not alter resolution at even greater speed than before continued march sometimes of evening sent for fergus chatted with pleasantly for hour two asking many question of life in scotland discoursing familiarly on such matter never making allusion to military affair on tenth day of march arrived at gorlitz where piece of bad news reached frederick prince karl after taking schweidnitz have fallen with sixty thousand men on bevern have crossed by five bridge across loe column be met by prussian force strongly intrenched for space of fifteen hour battle have raged over seven eight mile of country five time austrian have attacked five time have be rolled back again at nine o'clock at night be successful more le in four of attack while prussian left wing under command of ziethen have driven assailant across river again during night bevern have drawn off marched through breslau crossed oder leaving eighty cannon eight thousand killed wounded tremendous loss indeed when army at daybreak have be thirty thousand strong bevern rode out to reconnoitre in gray light of morning attended only by groom fell in with austrian outpost be carried to vienna being distant relation of emperor be sent home again without ransom be opinion of frederick that have given up intentionally on return be ordered at once to take up former official post at stettin where conducted so well in struggle against russian army two year later be restored to frederick favour a if misfortune be not great enough two day later came news that breslau have surrendered without firing shot when be known that king be within two day march pressing forward to relief here ninety eight gun immense store magazine be lost to prussia frederick straightway issued order that general who have succeeded bevern must be put under arrest for not having at once thrown army into breslau appointed ziethen in place ordered to bring army round to glogau meet at parchwitz on december nd ziethen punctually did in spite of terrible misfortune have befallen frederick be still undaunted increased a be by arrival of ziethen force be third of strength of austrian latter be flushed with success while ziethen troop be discouraged by defeat own portion of force worn out by long rapid march by failure of object for have come calling general together on rd recounted misfortune have befallen told that one trust in terrible position be in quality valour that intended to engage enemy a soon a found that must beat of perish in battle enthusiastically general declared that must conquer die with among soldier spirit be equally strong for have implicit confidence in king well justified trust in own valour determination that evening frederick eager a be to bring terrible situation to final issue can not have felt that must have be too desperate undertaking to have attacked enemy posted a be with river known a schweidnitz water many other natural difficulty covering front having flank strengthened a be austrian custom with field work battery fortunately austrian settled difficulty by moving out from stronghold daun have counselled remaining there prince karl great majority of military adviser agreed that must be shameful thing ninety thousand men must shut up to avoid attack by force of one third own strength that be in respect preferable to march out give battle in case prussian must be entirely destroyed whereas if merely repulsed in attack on strong position considerable proportion might escape give trouble in future austrian indeed having captured schweidnitz breslau defeated bevern in space of three week made master of considerable portion of silesia be in small degree puffed up have fallen anew to despising frederick blow dealt at prague have be obliterated by success at kolin frederick later success over french federal army be not considered by a matter affecting although several austrian regiment have be among soubise force officer be very scornful over aggressive march of frederick small army derisively called potsdam guard parade many be joke cut at military mess at expense difference then with two army regarded coming battle be great indeed on one side there be easy confidence of victory satisfaction at length troublesome little king have put in power on other deep determination to conquer to die feeling terrible a struggle must be great a be odds against might yet did man do duty come out victor in struggle what think of matter lad frederick said laying hand familiarly on young captain shoulder know nothing about majesty like rest feel confident that somehow will pull through of one thing be sure that be possible for men to do soldier will accomplish well will see be well that know country round here for many review have held of garrison of breslau on very ground where be about to fight position be very strong one be afraid that crafty old fox daun will here a did at prague persuade prince karl to hide behind battery be not for must feel confident whereas now feel hopeful still doubt not that will find way in somehow chapter leuthen at four in morning on sunday december th frederick marched from parchwitz intending to make neumarkt small town fourteen mile off quarter when within two three mile of town learned to deep satisfaction that austrian have just established great bakery there that party of engineer be marking out site for camp also that there be thousand croat in town news be satisfactory indeed for two reason first being that bakery must be of great use for own troop second that be clear that austrian intended to advance across schweidnitz water to give battle be evident that must have have idea that be pressing on so rapidly must never have established bakery so far in advance protected by so small force lost time in taking advantage of carelessness sent regiment of cavalry to seize hill on side of town then marched rapidly forward burst in gate hurled croat in utter confusion from neumarkt while cavalry dashed down cut off retreat one hundred twenty of be killed five hundred seventy taken prisoner in town austrian bakery be found to be in full work eighty thousand bread ration still hot be ready for delivery initial success unexpected treat of hot bread raised spirit of troop greatly be looked upon a happy augury two three hour before neumarkt have be captured austrian army be crossing river presently received unpleasant news of what have happened surprised at news that prussian be so near general at once set to work to choose good position be not difficult task for country be swampy with little wooded rise many village planted right wing at village of nypern be practically unapproachable on account of deep peat bog centre be at larger village named leuthen left at total length of front be about six mile prussian started before daybreak next morning in four column frederick riding on ahead with vanguard when near borne eight mile from neumarkt caught sight in dim light of considerable body of horse stretching across road in front of a far a must make out line prussian cavalry be at once ordered to charge down on left flank enemy proved to be five regiment of cavalry placed there to guard army from surprise however be surprised be at once overthrown driven in headlong flight to take shelter behind right wing at nypern five hundred forty being taken prisoner large number being killed wounded frederick rode on through borne ascended small hill called scheuberg to right of road a light increased must from point make out austrian army drawn up in battle array stretching from nypern to sagschuetz well be for that have reviewed troop over same ground knew bog morass guarded austrian front for long time sat there on horseback studying possibility of situation austrian right regarded a absolutely impregnable leuthen might be attacked with chance of success sagschuetz offered by far most favourable opening for attack formation of ground offered special facility for movement being effected without austrian being aware of what be taking place for there be depression behind swell broken ground in front of austrian centre by prussian must march from borne unseen by enemy until approached sagschuetz be three hour after frederick have taken up place before four column have reached borne a soon a be in readiness there be ordered to march with speed a far a radaxford thence to march in oblique order against austrian left austrian time must observe group of horseman on hill moving sometimes way sometimes that more than must not see conjecture be various a hour passed after hour daun believed that prussian must have marched away south with intention of falling upon magazine in bohemia that cavalry seen moving along hill be placed there to defend prussian from being taken in flank in rear while thus marching general lucchesi who commanded austrian right wing be convinced that cavalry formed prussian right wing that whole army concealed behind slope be marching to fall upon in belfry of church at leuthen on top of windmill on other point of vantage austrian general with staff be endeavouring to obtain glimpse beyond tiresome swell to discover what be going on behind in vain there be cavalry moving occasionally from crest to crest nothing beyond lucchesi got more more uneasy sent message after message to headquarters that be about to be attacked must have large reinforcement of horse prince daun at first scoffed at idea knowing that bog in front of nypern be impassable at last sent message to effect that if cavalry did not come must not be responsible for issue be thought therefore that must have good ground for insistence daun sent off reserve of horse several other regiment drawn from left wing went off at trot at head to see what be matter be just a started that prussian with music playing men singing gieb das ich thu mit fleiss be mir zu thun gebuhret grant that with zeal strength day do have passed radaxford reached lobetintz be about to advance in oblique line to attack king saw with removal of so large body of horse from very point against troop must in hour be hurling nothing must have suited plan better at rapid pace with precision order a perfect a if upon level ground suddenly prussian poured over swell on flank of sagschuetz nadasti who commanded austrian there be struck with astonishment at spectacle of prussian army believed to be far away pouring down on flank head of four column artillery ziethen cavalry appeared simultaneously marching swiftly making pause being good general lost not moment in endeavouring to meet storm left be thrown back little battery of fourteen gun at angle so formed opened fire launched cavalry against of ziethen for moment ziethen men be pushed back fire from infantry battalion close by checked austrian horse fell back out of range ziethen making counter charge drove away in meantime prussian infantry a advanced poured storm of fire upon austrian line aided by battery of ten heavy gun prince maurice who commanded here have planted on rise clump of fir tree held by croat in advance of austrian line be speedily cleared then prussian broke down abattis protected enemy front charged furiously against infantry drove before capturing nadasti battery in ten minute after beginning of fight position of austrian left be already desperate whole prussian army be concentrated against being on flank crumpled line up a advanced prince karl aide de camp galloped at top of speed to bring daun cavalry back again austrian battalion from centre be hurried down to aid nadasti be impeded by retreating troop confusion thickened until be brought to climax by ziethen horse have be unable to act until now fir wood quagmire abattis have be passed by prussian dashed into mass sabring trampling down taking whole battalion prisoner prince karl exerted to utmost to check prussian advance battery be brought up advantageously posted at leuthen heavy body of infantry occupied village church took post so a to present front to advancing tide quarter of hour battle might have be retrieved long before disposition be effected prussian be at hand map battle of leuthen nevertheless by great diligence austrian have to extent succeeded leuthen be centre of new position lucchesi be hastening up while nadasti swung backwards tried a arrived to form left flank of new position be being done under storm of shot from whole of prussian artillery be so terrible that many battalion fell into confusion a fast a arrived leuthen straggling hamlet of over mile in length with two three street of scattered house barn farm building two church be crowded with troop ready to fight unable to do so line being jammed upon line until sometimes hundred deep pressed constantly behind by freshly arriving battalion in front by advancing prussian regiment be almost without officer into confused straggling helpless mass prevented from opening out by house inclosure prussian ever keeping formation poured volley with terrible effect in such fashion a drake perfectly handled ship poured broadside into huge helpless spanish galleon at gravelines with like dogged courage a shown by spanish austrian mass suffered almost passively while occupying house church facing prussian resisted valiantly desperately from window musketry fire flashed out resistance round churchyard being specially stubborn churchyard have high strong wall so terrible be fire from roof of church other spot of advantage that tide of prussian victory be arrested for time at last made rush churchyard gate be burst in austrian driven out leuthen be not yet won frederick now brought up left wing have till time be held in reserve came on with levelled bayonet rushed into fight king be a always in thick of battle giving order a coolly a if at review sending fresh troop where required changing arrangement a opportunity offered keeping whole machine in due order by presence animating with determination to win die almost equal readiness to accept either alternative at last after hour stubborn resistance austrian be hurled out of leuthen still sternly resisting still contesting foot of ground lucchesi now saw opportunity of retrieving with great cavalry force terrible consequence of own blunder led impetuously down upon flank of prussian frederick have prepared for such stroke have placed draisen with left wing of cavalry in hollow sheltered from fire of austrian battery bade hing attempt nothing cover right flank of infantry from austrian horse accordingly let lucchesi charge down with cavalry then rushed out on rear fell suddenly furiously upon astounded at sudden unexpected attack with rank swept by storm of prussian bullet austrian cavalry broke fled in direction lucchesi having paid for fault by dying fighting to last duty thus performed draisen be free to act fell upon flank rear of austrian infantry in few minute battle be over austrian in full retreat made however attempt to stand at saara be hopeless be soon pushed backwards again hotly pressed poured over four bridge across schweidnitz river for most part continued flight to breslau until austrian have crossed river prussian cavalry be on rear sabring taking prisoner while infantry be halted at sun having now set exhausted a be by work have begun at midnight continued until now without pause break not yet be task completely done king riding up line asked if battalion must volunteer to follow to lissa village on river bank three battalion stepped out landlord of little inn carrying lantern walked by king side a approached village ten twelve musket shot flashed out in field to right be aimed at lantern one be hurt there be other shot from lissa be evident that village be still not wholly evacuated infantry rushed forward scattered through field drove out lurking croat king rode quietly on into village entered principal house to astonishment found full of austrian officer who must easily have carried off infantry being still beyond village have small force remaining there believing that prussian have halted for night at saara be a much astonished a frederick at entrance king have presence of mind to hide surprise good evening gentleman said be there still room left for do think austrian officer supposing of course that have large force outside bowed deeply escorted to best room in house then slipped out at back collected what troop must a went hurried across bridge prussian be not long in entering very speedily cleared out rest of austrian then crossed bridge with few gun followed in pursuit army at saara on hearing firing betook again to arm marched to king assistance twenty five thousand men band again joining in triumphant hymn nun danket alle gott a tramped through darkness when arrived at lissa found that be safe bivouacked in field never be there greater more surprising victory never one in military genius of commander be more strikingly shown austrian be in good heart be excellent soldier brave well provided with artillery strongly placed yet be signally defeated by force little over one third number have there be two more hour of daylight austrian must have be not only routed altogether crushed loss be ten thousand left on field of whom three thousand be killed twelve thousand be taken prisoner one hundred sixteen cannon captured to loss must be added that of seventeen thousand prisoner taken when breslau surrendered twelve day later together with vast store of cannon ammunition including everything taken so shortly before from bevern liegnitz surrendered whole of silesia with exception only of schweidnitz be again wrested from austrian thus in killed wounded prisoner loss of austrian amounted to a much a total force of prussian latter lost in killed eleven hundred forty one in wounded about five thousand prince maurice upon whose division brunt of battle have fallen be promoted to rank of field marshal fergus drummond have be with king throughout terrible day until battle began duty have be light being confined to carrying of order to prince maurice after took place among staff dismounting chatted with acquaintance while karl held horse when however fir tree wood be carried king rode forward took place there during attack upon austrian position at sagschuetz matter became more lively ball from austrian battery sung overhead sent branch flying tree crashing down sagschuetz won king followed advancing line air be alive with bullet case shot illustration roar of battle be so tremendous that horse be well nigh unmanageable after fergus knew little more of battle being incessantly employed in carrying order through thick of to general commanding brigade even to battalion roar of battle be so tremendous that horse maddened with din sharp whiz of bullet at time be well nigh unmanageable occupied attention almost to exclusion of other thought especially after have be struck by bullet in hind quarter have come to understand that strange maddening noise meant danger not until after be over be fergus aware of escape have have bullet have cut away ornament from headdress one of rein have be severed at distance of inch two from hand bullet have pierced tail of coatee buried in cantle of saddle iron guard of claymore have be pierced however on return to king after carrying despatch be able to curb own excitement that of horse to make formal military salute a reported in calm quiet voice that have carried out order with have be charged be with great gratification that heard king say evening a staff supped together at inn at lissa have done exceedingly well today captain drummond be very pleased with be always at elbow when wanted observed that be never flurried excited though indeed there must have be good excuse for young soldier being so in such hurly burly be over young for further promotion for year two must find other way of testifying satisfaction at conduct indeed when list of promotion for bravery in field be published few day later fergus name appeared among who received decoration of prussian military order honour fully a much valued a promotion for time lost service of karl who have be seriously although not dangerously wounded just before austrian be driven out of leuthen news of battle filled confederate with stupefaction dismay prince karl be at once recalled be relieved from military employment daun being appointed to supreme command prince withdrew to government of netherlands there passed remainder of day in peace quiet army be hunted by ziethen cavalry to koeniggraetz losing two thousand prisoner large amount of baggage thirty seven thousand men only of eighty thousand stood in battle array at leuthen reached sheltering wall of fortress in so dilapidated worn out condition by end of week after arriving there no le than twenty two thousand be in hospital thus after eight month of constant weary anxiety frederick by two heavy blow have dealt successfully at confederate stood in far better position than have occupied at opening of first campaign when a enemy fondly believed prussia must be captured divided without smallest difficulty frederick wintered at breslau whither came many visitor from prussia there be constant round of gaiety festivity frederick desired nothing so much a peace once twice there have be faint hope that might be brought about by favourite sister wilhelmina who have be ceaseless in effort to effect two empress pompadour be alike bent on avenging on king revers that have suffered increased determination to overwhelm great a frederick success have be did not blind to fact that position be almost hopeless when war began have army of hundred fifty thousand of finest soldier in world two campaign have made frightful gap in rank at prague have fought with eighty thousand men at leuthen have thirty thousand little kingdom must scarcely supply men to fill place of who have fallen while enemy have teeming population from to gather ample material for fresh army seemed even to hopeful spirit that must have one ending that success however great weakened more than adversary winter rest be however most welcome for moment there be nothing to plan nothing to do save to order that drilling of fresh levy must go on incessantly in order that at least of terrible gap in army might be filled up before campaign commenced in spring began badly for early in january russian be on move empress have dismissed ordered to be tried by court martial general who have done so little previous year have appointed field marshal fermor to command in place ordered to advance instantly to annex east prussia in name on th of january crossed frontier six day later entered koenigsberg issued proclamation to effect that august sovereign have now become mistress of east prussia that men of official social position must at once take oath of allegiance to east prussia have be devastated year before by marauder hatred of russia be intense people be powerless to resist fled leaving behind majority be forced to take required oath for time east prussia became russian province nevertheless young men constantly slipped away when opportunity offered to join prussian army money be frequently collected by impoverished people to despatch to frederick to aid in necessity far greater assistance be english subsidy of pound be paid punctually for four year be of supreme service to be spent thriftily of enormous sum expended by country in subsidizing foreign power none be ever laid out to tenth of advantage of pound given to frederick in north campaign also opened early ferdinand of brunswick bestirred defeated french signally at krefeld drove headlong across rhine frederick too took field early on th of march moved from breslau upon siege began on st of april on th place surrendered four thousand nine hundred prisoner of war be taken with fifty one gun pound in money three day later frederick with forty thousand men be off deceived daun a to intention entered moravia besieged olmuetz keith be with again fergus have returned to staff march be conducted with marvellous precision accuracy that characterized frederick movement olmuetz be strong place stoutly defended prussian engineer who did not shine at siege work opened trench eight hundred yard too far away magazine be too far off daun who a usual carefully abstained from giving battle so cut up convoy after five week of vain endeavour king be obliged to raise siege partly owing to loss of convoy must have enabled to take town be now at last extremity partly that knew that russian be marching against brandenburg made masterly retreat struck heavy blow at daun by capturing destroying principal magazine then took up very strong position near koeniggraetz here must have maintained against daun assault for position be one daun have held strongly fortified news from north be of so terrible nature that be forced to hurry thither cossack a russian army advanced be committing most horrible atrocity burning town village tossing men woman into fire plundering murdering everywhere very small prussian force be watching be powerless to check swarming marauder frederick therefore evading daun attempt to arrest march crossed mountain into silesia again at landshut gave army two day rest wrote sent paper to brother prince henry who be commander of army defending saxony from invasion telling that be on point of marching against russian might well be killed giving order a to course to be pursued in such event left keith in command of forty thousand men to hold daun in check must latter advance against silesia again took fergus with finding young officer talk pleasant mean of taking mind off trouble beset in nine day army be fifteen thousand strong marched from landshut to frankfort on oder here king learned that though kuestrin russian be besieging still held out town have be barbarously destroyed by enemy in fierce anger army pressed forward russian army officer men be indignant in extreme at brutality committed by cossack be powerless to restrain for indeed ruffian did not hesitate to attack kill officer who ventured to interfere between victim next morning early frederick reached camp of general dohna who have be watching although unable to interfere with russian proceeding king have profound contempt for russian in spite of warning of keith who have served with that be far better soldier than appeared to be anticipated very easy victory over early on nd of august army from frankfort arrived dohna strength be numerically about same a king with thirty thousand men frederick have doubt that must make short work of eighty thousand russian of whom twenty seven be cossack rabble who be not worth being considered in pitched battle deceiving russian a to intention by opening heavy cannonade on one of redoubt a if intending to ford river there crossed that evening twelve mile lower down after manoeuvring faced russian who have at once broken up siege on hearing of passage fermor sent away baggage train to small village called kleinkalmin planted on moor where front be covered by quagmire zaborn stream hearing late at night on evening of th that frederick be likely to be upon next morning russian general drew out into open ground north of zorndorf stand on bare rise surrounded by wood quagmire formed army into great square two mile long by one broad with baggage in middle formation have be found excellent by russian in turkish war be by mean well adapted to meet frederick method of impetuous attack being ignorant a to side upon frederick be likely to attack having decided to stand on defensive adopted method most familiar to frederick have cut bridge across river warta oder believed that must after defeating russian drive into angle formed by junction of two stream cause to surrender at discretion unfortunately have not heard that great russian train have be sent to kleinkalmin have done so must have seized so have possessed of russian store munition of war have forced to surrender without blow for cossack have wasted country far wide deprived of resource army be so burning with indignation desire to avenge cossack cruelty that made pause marched in haste right round russian position so a to drive back towards junction of two river map battle of zorndorf fermor cossack brought in news of frederick movement be hidden from by forest seeing that be to be attacked on zorndorf side instead of from on have expected to come changed front swung round line containing best troop to meet on arriving at zorndorf frederick found that cossack have already set village on fire be disadvantage to for smoke of burning house rolled down towards russian so prevented from making observation of prussian movement king rode up to edge of zaborn hollow finding too deep boggy to be crossed determined to attack at southwest with left centre placing cavalry in rear throwing back right wing first division marched forward to attack by west end of flaming village next division must have be support marched by east end of zorndorf road be longer one there be consequently wide gap between two division heralded by fire of two strong battery swept southwestern corner of russian quadrilateral crossfire ploughing rank with terrible effect first division under manteufel fell upon enemy fire of prussian battery have sorely shaken russian have produced lively agitation among horse of light baggage train in centre of square heralding advance with tremendous fire of musketry prussian infantry forced way into mass have second division be close at hand a must have be victory must already have be won although also engaged be not near fermor poured out torrent of horse foot upon manteufel flank front without support surrounded prussian must hing be swept back losing twenty four piece of cannon while russian with shout of victory pressed upon at critical moment seidlitz with five thousand horse dashed down upon disordered mass of russian casting into irretrievable confusion at same time infantry rallied pressed forward again in fifteen minute whole russian army be confused mass fermor with russian horse fled to kratsdorf have not bridge there be burnt by frederick must have made off leaving infantry to fate must now according to rule have surrendered proved unconquerable save by death seidlitz cavalry sabred until fatigued by slaughter prussian infantry poured volley into stood immovable passive dying where stood at one o'clock in day battle ceased for moment prussian have marched at three in morning seeing that although russian army have be destroyed other half have gradually arranged into fresh front of battle frederick formed force again brought up right wing for attack on side of russian quadrilateral still stood forward went battery well in advance before infantry came within musket range russian horse foot rushed forward to attack with such force that captured one of battery took whole battalion prisoner broke centre here be regiment of dohna perfectly clean well accoutred being le accustomed to war than frederick veteran gave way at once before russian onslaught in spite of frederick effort to prevent fled from field must not be rallied until mile distant from veteran stood firm however until seidlitz returning from pursuit again hurled horseman upon russian mass broke up drove cavalry in headlong flight before chapter step russian infantry being involved in turmoil confusion caused by charge of seidlitz defeat of cavalry prussian infantry again pressed forward pouring in heavy fire charging with bayonet three battalion have be drawn from very country maddened by tale have heard of cossack cruelty be not to be denied russian however keeping rank filling up gap a be formed returning a best must fire of prussian held together with sullen obstinacy by time ammunition on side be exhausted now struggle became hand to hand bayonet against bayonet butt end of musket to butt end seldom have so terrible struggle ever be witnessed be approaching foot by foot inert russian mass be pushed backwards one of general demikof collected two thousand foot thousand horse took possession of knoll frederick ordered to be dispersed again forcade be ordered to attack with two battalion general rutter to bring up dohna men again take in flank latter have not recovered from state of demoralization at first cannon shot turned ran continuing flight even further than before taking refuge in wood frederick instantly dismissed rutter from service then a night have completely fallen terrible conflict ceased fermor by time finding that there be crossing river have returned no regiment battalion of army remained in order there be confused crowd officer did best to form into sort of order regardless of regiment battalion cossack scoured field under cover of night plundering dead murdering wounded flame marking path four hundred of be caught at work by prussian hussar one killed frederick sent for tent army pitched camp facing russian during night latter having got into sort of order moved away to westward bivouacked on drewitz heath facing battle ground fermor have twenty eight thousand men still with while frederick have eighteen thousand former loss have be twenty one thousand five hundred twenty nine killed wounded missing of whom eight thousand be killed that of prussian be eleven thousand three hundred ninety of whom three thousand six hundred eighty be killed thus side lost third of number in terrible struggle next morning russian got into better order drew up in order of battle cannonade be for time kept up on side army be beyond range of artillery party have real thought of fighting fermor beaten on own ground day before must not dream of attacking prussian latter be worn out by fatigue of previous day moreover on side musketry ammunition be used up hussar pursuing cossack have in night come upon russian waggon train at kleim carried off good deal of portable plunder next morning under cover of fog russian retreated reached baggage then moved slowly away harassed by dohna sullenly continued retreat to russian frontier if frederick must have pressed must probably have won victory have news called to hasten away west to join prince henry a presence there be urgently required for defence of saxony fergus have be with king when dohna regiment gave way before impetuous charge of russian rest of staff having be sent away one after other to bring up seidlitz to order fresh movement among infantry a king rode down to endeavour to restore order followed closely behind confusion be terrible russian horse mixed up with infantry be sabring trampling down suddenly three of dashed at king fergus setting spur to horse interposed between frederick one of russian be ridden over horse man by impetus of rush other two attacked furiously for moment be very hard pressed kept horse prancing curvetting managed to keep assailant on right until at last cut one down minute later ran other through body gallantly done major drummond king said quietly a wheeling horse fergus returned back to take post behind will not forget that have saved life then without further comment frederick continued work trying to rally infantry ordering entreating even laying cane always carried across shoulder minute later there be thunder of hoof seidlitz burst down upon russian mass changing in moment fate of battle excited by late encounter fergus horse took bit between teeth joined seidlitz cavalry a swept past in spite of effort of rider plunged with into midst of fight for next few minute fergus have slight knowledge of what be going on being engaged in series of hand to hand fight with cavalry infantry three time be wounded then pressure ceased be again galloping across moor in pursuit of russian horse be not until seidlitz force drew rein that recovered control of horse flank be bleeding from bayonet gash bullet have gone through neck first wound be of comparatively small consequence feared that other be serious though horse panted from exertion excitement breath came regularly be evident that ball have not hit spine for have done so must have fallen at once turned rode back with cavalry who dismounted short distance from scene of action in readiness to take part again must be required while pursued way to spot where king have stationed surrounded by several of staff king glanced at then said be relieved from duty major drummond let one of surgeon see to at once fergus rode short distance then turning suddenly faint slid from horse to ground one of staff happening to look round at once rode back to have best let bandage up wound roughly said will be difficult to find surgeon now that be up to eye in work somewhere in rear fergus have received two severe wound in face bayonet thrust through leg officer did best to stanch bleeding be still occupied in doing so when karl rode up jumped from horse ran to master side where have be karl fergus asked for soldier have also received severe wound in head followed master a in duty bound be distance behind in melee must not get near being mixed up with one of squadron did not see a came back be in great state about until on

about russian one of trooper said be dirty even look like soldier never saw such obstinate beggar to fight from moment cavalry made first charge be beaten ought to have given in seemed to know nothing about that second line of theirs charged a if be beginning of battle be never so surprised in life a when poured down on horse foot be nothing to way stood afterwards if have be bag of sawdust must not have be more indifferent to fire be bad business of dohna men thought when joined looked too spick span to be good that must run almost a fast far a men of federal army at rossbach be shameful neither in last war in have prussian soldier so disgraced envy suppose man in army will speak to may be sure that will be long time indeed before fritz get over will need hard fighting something desperate in way of bravery before forgives how be master karl will do have got three wound lost lot of blood in fortnight will be in saddle again perhaps le for be a hard a steel saved king life karl be twenty yard away be wedged in so that there be moving except backwards for dohna men be half mad with fright russian be cutting slashing in middle of saw karl said be close to at time put spur to horse rode over three four of own men cut down one who grasped rein got there too late have great fear of result though why know killed six pomeranian who be looting count eulenfurst place close to dresden made short work of three russian be done beautifully too tried to get one on side of kept on right that made safe thing of be quiet good tempered officer there be a much fun about a boy when spirit be up there be not many swordsman in army must match why when first joined nearly three year ago be in rd royal dragoon own regiment heard sergeant who be in fencing room say that there be not officer in regiment who be match for with sword now have finished pipe must be going to look after again king surgeon examined fergus wound next morning said that although must not be able to sit horse until leg have healed must otherwise soon be convalescent soon after have left sir john mitchell came in to see a english ambassador have very often during last two winter met fergus in king apartment at be regular visitor be by time well known to other mitchell indeed regarded fergus a valuable assistant in work of interesting frederick turning mind from many trouble anxiety surgeon have just given good account of to king drummond said majesty expressed much satisfaction at hearing that wound be not serious 'that youth be not like most of compatriot mitchell ' said to with smile ready to fight equally ready to join in drinking bout must opportunity offer be always on horseback a hardy a healthy a can be with one of hard drinking sort fever might set in there be risk of with 'as told saved life yesterday be nearly compelled to take to sword must have be of little avail against three russian save for sake of prussia life be of great value to for 't be one full of care trouble for country sake must fain hold on to a long a there be hope for deliverance from enemy can congratulate on promotion mitchell for made major on spot be brilliant feat a brilliant a performed at lobositz at count eulenfurst house at dresden of got step 't be not often that officer get thrice promoted for distinguished bravery time feat be talk of whole army will not be le so at present time methinks will feel jealous at rapid rise ' king be too kind excellency think so drummond have marked good deal during last two year have borne well a scotchman be proud of have knack of kinsman keith of entering into king humour of being bright companion when be in good temper of holding tongue when be put out of expressing opinion frankly yet never familiarly freshness hopefulness often see cheer king whose prussian can not for life help being stiff formal get to talk with a if be human being like next to keith think that there be one with whom king can distract mind so completely a with to be like getting whiff of fresh air from scottish hill told surgeon to see that be sent down with first batch of wounded officer next day accordingly while two army be watching other cannon be growling fergus be taken down to frankfort zorndorf be fought on th of august on nd of september frederick started with army for saxony where prince maurice have be sorely pressed by daun newly raised army of confederate have have to take post on height short distance from dresden bad job major karl grumbled a brought news to fergus who be quartered in private house king have gone to have slap at daun here be left behind if must have waited fortnight might have be with perhaps will get there in time yet karl may be sure that a soon a daun hears that king be coming will a usual begin to fortify will need small amount of marching counter marching to get to come out give battle be slow cautious before after leuthen be likely to be doubly so however will get tailor here today to measure for new uniform what with blood cutting breech to get at leg must certainly get new outfit before rejoin hope will be with marshal again be good deal more lively with than be with king staff who although doubt excellent soldier be certainly not lively companion do hope there will be no great battle until get there must think might start in week surgeon however must not hear of be end of third week in september before fergus rode from frankfort news from south be so far satisfactory that have fidgeted le than must otherwise have done daun have in fact retired hastily from meissen have taken post in almost impregnable position at stolpen neisse be being besieged must be relieved daun now blocked frederick way at stolpen to town to bautzen cut off indeed from silesia for moment royal army that of prince maurice be lying at dresden fergus therefore be content to follow doctor order to spend four day on journey down to dresden keith be there received joyfully lindsay greeted vociferously so have gone up step above laughed never be fellow with such luck a have saved king life hear tumbled over score of russian won victory with own sword not quite a much a lindsay fergus laughed score of cossack come down to three of whom one horse tumbled over managed other two still although battle be only half finished when be put out of further part in may be said in one way to have won for have king fallen there be saying how matter might have gone be true that must not have lost for russian be past taking offensive might have be drawn battle be terrible business lindsay said seriously a bad in way a prague be to say in proportion to number engaged everyone say must rather fight three austrian than one russian marshal have rather scored off king for warned that though slow russian be formidable foe king scoffed at idea have found out now that greatly undervalued have owned a much to keith be sorry to say marshal be not well suffers good deal fancy that after campaign be over will ask to be relieved from active duty in field will take command of army covering dresden have led hard life see have done a much a three ordinary men still will see how be next spring must almost break heart to have to give up before war be over be difficult to say when will be lindsay here be getting towards third year war be not one whit nearer to end than be when left berlin be true that have no longer to count france a formidable russia have turned out far more so than expected having once taken matter up empress if be half a obstinate a soldier be likely to go on at for long time be using up army very fast can not replace loss a austria russia can do hope be not going to make twenty year war of lindsay said if go on in way that be doing drummond will be field marshal in third of time must remember about proverb of pitcher well yes lindsay must remember that be having share of hard knock have be wounded twice now to say nothing of being stunned taken prisoner so see be having share of bad luck a well a good now at present have never have a much a scratch when bad luck come may come in lump there be something in fergus though own have not thought of well perhaps be better to take in small dos than have come at once so have brought man back safe see though have have ugly slash across cheek by way hope that two sword cut be not going to leave bad scar drummond must be hard to have beauty spoilt for life only nineteen though fortunately everyone think two three year older however will be honourable scar woman mind disfigurement in man if be got in battle be pity though that did not get when defending king life instead of in cavalry charge afterwards brought horse safe out of battle hope have like honourable scar lindsay got ugly gash on flank with bayonet be afraid when heals white hair will grow on have also bullet through neck fortunately missed spine windpipe be quite healed up now be really pity to take horse a under fire lindsay said regretfully well when one risk one own life one ought not to mind risking that of horse however valuable suppose not still be pity to ride so valuable animal be paid so much for risking own life see drummond be part of bargain that must risk that of horse worth amount of money fergus on arrival called at once on count eulenfurst who with wife daughter be delighted to see for have now be absent from dresden since frederick have marched against soubise thirteen month before heard from captain lindsay count said when army arrived here three week since that be wounded not gravely also that for valour shown in defending king when be attacked by three russian have be promoted to rank of major upon congratulate heartily now that have come suppose king will soon be dashing away with again what man be what soldier can assure that sometimes when read bulletin be inclined to regret be not born two day journey farther north yet in spite of fierce blow at enemy there be sign of peace being nearer than when dropped down to rescue twenty seven month ago 't be terrible war be indeed count certainly when crossed sea to take service here little thought how terrible be struggle be approaching if have known be sure that mother must never have let leave home must be terribly uneasy about countess said do hear from often writes once month so do get letter in batch know that must be very anxious say nothing about in letter declares that be proud that be fighting for protestant prince so hemmed in by enemy that thought hope of england be with bell ring a loudly at victory through england scotland a do at berlin if of saxony have understood matter sooner count said must be surely fighting now on side indeed have not frederick compelled saxon prisoner to serve with have sent to home there must have be animosity a protestant people must soon have come to see that cause be own most of do see now for whenever enemy have entered saxony have plundered ill treated people especially protestant be horse still alive yes count well save one be wounded at zorndorf for that can not blame for be own doing when seidlitz charged into midst of russian passed close to turk maddened by excitement seized bit in teeth joined in melee got three wound have two happily have be cured a rapidly a have though with advantage to appearance of of will scar on face always show a do now thirza asked be sure hope not said at present be barely healed in time doubt redness will fade out will not show greatly though daresay scar will be always visible must be proud of major drummond said thirza considering that got in so great battle one in rendered such service to king see will not be always able to explain when how got fergus laughed people who know will say 'there go young student who have got face slashed at university must not say that said indignantly even if be not in uniform anyone can see that be soldier whether not countess thirza be matter will certainly trouble very little however begin to think that will not always be soldier certainly must not leave army a long a war go on have seen such terrible fighting such tremendous carnage think that at end of if come out at end will be glad to take to peaceful life cousin marshal keith have be fighting life be great soldier have honour of being regarded by king a friend have home peace quiet child growing up to take place must not like to look forward to such life must rather go back pas day in scottish glen where be brought up think that be right count said seriously in ordinary time soldier life must be pleasant one must reckon upon occasional excitement of war war a be beyond calculation in three campaign present one be not ended nigh half of army marched through here have be killed wounded be terrible to think of one talk of chance of war be making death almost certainty for if war continues two three year how few will be left of who began even now great battle will probably be fought in few day two great army be within a many march of dresden smallest of outnumbers frederick other be fully twice strength so intrenched a hear that position be well nigh impregnable expect king will find mean to force out of without fighting fergus said with smile daun be altogether over cautious leuthen be not likely to have rendered more confident fergus spent greater part of time at count for marshal keith insisted upon abstaining from duty until march began be off tomorrow morning said when went up on evening of th of september where know not except king marshal keith prince maurice suppose that anyone know wherever be start at daybreak may return ere long safe sound count said be there nothing that can do for know regard a one of family there be nothing must give greater pleasure than to be able in way to make comfortable thank heartily count need nothing if did must purchase for be seldom that one have to put one hand in one pocket a captain have saved greater part of pay for last two year will pile up hoard still faster now that be major have never have opportunity before of thanking for purse handed to karl to be laid out for benefit in case of need hold still have never have occasion to draw upon hope that never may have to do so next morning army furnished with nine day provision leaving force to face army of confederate strode along road at usual pace took road for bautzen drove off loudon who commanded daun northern outpost without difficulty so passed flank advance guard pushed on to bautzen drove away small force there leaving there magazine of army occupied hochkirch few mile away king with main body arrived at bautzen on following day halted there to see what daun be going to do latter be in fact obliged to abandon stronghold for prussian at hochkirch menaced road by drew provision from magazine at zittau marching at night reached occupied line of hill between hochkirch zittau within couple of mile of former place frederick have be forced to wait at bautzen till convoy of provision arrived when joined division at hochkirch saw daun army on opposite hill busy a usual in intrenching ordered army to encamp when be within mile of daun position marwitz staff officer to whom gave order argued remonstrated at length refused to be concerned in marking out of such encampment be at once put under arrest officer did work frederick in fact entertained sovereign contempt for daun with slow march perpetual intrenchings obstinate caution have belief that austrian marshal must attempt to attack be in very bad humour too having discovered that retzow have failed to take possession of stromberg detached hill must have rendered position safe one put under arrest ordered stromberg to be occupied next morning force proceeding to do so found however that post be already occupied by austrian who resisted stoutly being largely reinforced maintained position on hill on several battery be placed be now tuesday frederick determined to march away on saturday obstinacy have placed army in altogether untenable dangerous position officer be extremely uneasy keith declared to king that austrian deserved to be hanged if did not attack to frederick replied must hope that be more afraid of than even of gallows chapter hochkirch village of hochkirch stood on hilltop with extensive view for mile round on side save on south where hill rose one above among hill be one called devil hill where primitive country people believed that devil witch held high festival once year frederick right wing be commanded by keith lay in hochkirch beyond village have four battalion battery of twenty gun on next height to hochkirch from point to devil hill extended thick wood in strong body of croat be lurking frederick with centre extended four mile to left of hochkirch retzow who have be restored to command have ten twelve thousand men lying in behind weissenberg four mile away frederick force with of keith amounted to twenty eight thousand men retzow command be too far away to be considered a available daun force lying within mile of hochkirch amounted to ninety thousand men well might keith say that austrian deserved to be hanged if did not attack frederick be somewhat uneasy must have moved away on friday night have not be waiting for arrival of convoy of provision from bautzen still relied upon daun inactivity time however reliance be falsified daun general be of opinion that must be disgraceful be to stand on defensive against army practically le than third of force expostulation at length roused daun into activity once decided disposition be a usual excellent map battle of hochkirch plan be able one with thirty thousand men be to start a soon a be dark on friday evening sweep round to south follow base of devil mountain then through hollow thick wood till be close to force on right of hochkirch be to fall suddenly on at five o'clock on saturday morning order be that a soon a hochkirch be taken rest of army sixty thousand strong be to march against frederick in front on left so completely smash crumple up frederick have premonition of storm be gathering on thursday friday austrian be engaged a usual in felling tree forming abattis throwing up earthwork in way strengthening position everything seemed to show that daun be still bent upon standing upon defensive only a lurking croat pandoors have night crept up through brushwood hollow skirmished with prussian outpost away on right scattered firing be not heeded much in hochkirch fergus have just got up in little room shared with lindsay in marshal quarter mile north of hochkirch be putting on boot when few minute past five sound of firing be heard there be croat a usual said what restless fellow be drummond have be up at unearthly hour morning since got here wo be light for two hour yet doubt whether will be light then look to a if be thick fog be right about early hour admit have be restless be not pleasant idea mile away there be army big enough to eat up nothing whatever to prevent pouncing upon at moment except two three battery marshal be saying last night must regard a most fortunate escape ever have if drew off safely tonight without being attacked that firing be heavier than usual there go couple of gun two advanced piece be sending round two of case shot into bush suppose lindsay said drowsily fergus completed dressing went downstairs out into night here must hear much better than in room above have one loophole for air light be almost stopped up with wisp of straw must now plainly hear volley firing continued crackle of musketry ran upstairs again have better get thing on at once lindsay be more serious affair than usual will take upon to wake marshal went to keith door knocked opened who be there what be marshal asked be drummond sir there be heavy firing going on to right much heavier than have be other night what o'clock be about ten minute past five sir there be thick mist be pitch dark will go over inquire what be going on yes do expect that rascally croat have be reinforced be trying to find out whether be still in position will be back a soon a can sir fergus ran round to low range of shed in horse be stabled karl be there shouted yes major voice said close at hand be listening to that firing saddle up at once may a well ride with be going to see what be about lantern be burning in shed by light fergus orderly rapidly saddled horse have better light two more lantern karl leave one on wall burning will take others will want for one can not see horse length away if have not sound of firing to guide must soon lose way altogether light enabled to go at fairly fast trot trusted rather to horse than to own eye roar rattle of firing increased in volume minute be more than affair with croat karl good deal more major look a if austrian be beating up quarter in earnest doe indeed when reached hochkirch found troop there astir cavalry trumpet be sounding to horse clamour round village told that troop encamped there be getting under arm do know what be going on to right sir fergus asked field officer who be in act of mounting marshal keith have sent to inquire not in least a far a can tell by sound must be attacking in force seem to be working round in rear of battery there sound be certainly coming way then will go on to battery fergus said have ridden little way farther when be convinced that officer be right crash of musketry volley rose continuously although boom of gun be mingled with there be nothing like continuous fire might have be expected from twenty gun battery suddenly from right crackle of firing broke out then heavy volley bullet sung overhead be attacking in rear sir sure enough karl said be afraid have captured big battery karl fergus said a turned horse be few hundred yard back to village just a reached roar of fire broke out from rear must make way slowly along street so crowded be now with infantry who unable to see until yard two away must not make room for to pas a must otherwise have done for staff officer with feverish impatience fergus pushed on until road be clear even now have to go comparatively slowly for unless kept to track across open ground led to farmhouse must miss altogether light be moving about there a rode up keith be at door orderly be bringing up horse what be major drummond be attack in force sir on right flank rear enemy have crept up between hochkirch battery a came through village be attacking in rear can not say for certain believe that battery be taken though there be heavy infantry fire still going on there ride to ziethen captain lindsay give news tell to fall upon austrian captain cosser captain gaudy ride off to infantry bring up at double will take on kannaker battalion rode down at once to camp of battalion be hundred yard away despatching others of staff to hasten up regiment near kannaker battalion be already under arm marched off with a soon a arrived be going to left of village fergus will make for battery must retake do go first into hochkirch see how matter go there if badly give order to colonel of first battalion come along tell to throw into village assist to hold to last after that must be guided by circumstance be doubtful if will ever find again in black mist fergus handed lantern to keith orderly who took place at side of marshal a regiment went off at double fergus rode up to village be scarce twenty minute since have left be evident that furious fight be raging there that austrian have already penetrated distance into street without hesitation turned rode back again in few minute met dark body of men coming along at rapid run where be colonel asked reining in horse suddenly for have nearly ridden into midst of just ahead of to right sir in minute fergus be beside by light karl carried recognized major lange said have marshal order that must march into hochkirch hold to last austrian be already in partial possession of way be major drummond for in mist have almost lost direction there seems to be firing going on everywhere ahead will direct fergus said have just come from there trotted back to village a approached hochkirch be evident that although defender be still clinging to outskirt greater portion be lost with cheer battalion rushed forward be in moment fiercely engaged major lange horse fell dead under struck by austrian bullet fergus rode into first house came to dismounted left horse there may a well leave yours here too karl can do good with must only be in way when begin to get light will try find marshal may a well get hold of first musket ammunition pouch that can pick up there will be enough for man to do to hold place until more reinforcement come up desperate struggle went on in street prussian who have be driven back joined battalion just arrived bayonet butt end of musket be used rather than shot for in mist friend must not be distinguished from foe five yard away be from shout rather than by uniform that men knew whether have one other in front of karl be not long in finding arm taking place in rank be soon at work with others village be almost circular in shape clustered a be on top of hill struggle be not confined to one street raged in dozen more le parallel with other gradually prussian pressed forward have more than half cleared village when advance be checked by arrival of fresh battalion of austrian then lange threw men into church churchyard there stubbornly maintained soon flame burst out from various direction giving welcome light to defender enabling to keep up so heavy fire upon now swarming enemy that repulsed attack made upon eight battalion of austrian in vain tried to capture position attacking on side stubborn prussian held firmly to meanwhile beyond a far a battery fight raged plothow battalion have be stationed in advance of have be attacked enveloped on side by austrian have defended splendidly though forced back by sheer weight of number have maintained order done heavy execution by fire battery have be lost who have be driven out rallied with plothow men made so furious rush forward that hurled austrian out again be for few minute for such mass of enemy poured up through mist that there be withstanding many of prussian be taken prisoner captivity be of short duration for through mist ziethen horse burst out suddenly into raging tumult scattered austrian released prisoner be then off to fall upon fresh enemy a soon a discovered position everywhere isolated combat took place battalion after battalion squadron after squadron a arrived flung upon first enemy came upon in darkness keith on reaching battery again retook again austrian mass obtained possession in around hochkirch similar desperate struggle be going on none fled falling back until meeting battalion hastening up reformed charged again ziethen horse together with rest of cavalry gendarme mingled with staff officer others who have lost way continued to make furious charge against austrian pressing round rear of position holding in check until cartridge be spent lange battalion held churchyard though number be terribly lessened by austrian fire then major called upon men to form in mass cut way through enemy with bayonet most gallantly did losing many remnant emerged from village gallant leader wounded to death among fergus karl separated from ran to house where have left horse mounted galloped off by time centre be coming up led by king a neared hochkirch cannonball took off head of frank of brunswick king youngest brother in law prince maurice of dessau riding in dark till within twenty yard of austrian be badly hit storm of case musket bullet swept approach to hochkirch be so terrible that frederick battalion have to fall back first thing be to find marshal fergus said a rode out of hochkirch must be somewhere to right illustration before must extricate fergus be surrounded by austrian galloped on until flash of fire burst out few yard in front horse fell dead under before must extricate from be surrounded by austrian officer shouted to to surrender seeing hopelessness of resistance at once did so looked round to satisfaction saw nothing of karl be placed in midst of austrian regiment under charge of sergeant told that must be shot if tried to escape frederick with more battalion have come up pushed on thrusting austrian back until have left hochkirch on left by time be past eight o'clock fog be dispersing saw great body of austrian on height to right from waditz to meschduitz a well a on whole line of height on left only line of retreat therefore be along at foot of dressau height ordered to be seized at once be done before austrian must reach spot being hindered by furious charge by ziethen from open ground between kumschutz canitz frederick rearranged front of battle waited for retzow to come up with left wing austrian tried several attack with little success too have be hindered confused by mist force have be engaged in round hochkirch have suffered terribly pushed forward feebly now that prussian gun on height be able to open fire upon retzow be long in coming for too have be attacked by twenty thousand men who have be told off by daun for purpose attack however be badly managed feeble delayed retzow from making start when frederick urgent message reached during anxious delay austrian captured frederick main battery of thirty gun north of rodewitz be beginning to press forward when retzow came onto ground took up position at belgern covering frederick left flank have be hour sooner might have saved heavy battery lay beyond range of gun on dressau height frederick must not have supported without bringing on general battle then in steady leisurely manner king drew off force took up new position from krewitz to puswietz carrying off whole of baggage retzow troop on dressau height covering movement until have passed daun great army standing on circle of hill watching not interfering with movement frederick rashness have cost dear have lost eight thousand men five thousand three hundred eighty one of hundred nineteen officer killed prisoner rest wounded have also lost hundred one gun most of tent of austrian three hundred twenty five officer five thousand six hundred fourteen rank file be killed wounded thousand prisoner lost twenty thousand of men deserted during passage through dark intricate wood fergus remained with regiment have captured until battle ceased after be taken under guard to spot where prussian prisoner be gathered of there be fifty eight officer greater part of whom be more le severely wounded two of officer belonged to kannaker battalion from fergus asked for news of marshal keith fear be killed one said led into battery be with after be driven out again after neither of saw everything be in confusion must not see twenty yard way know that battalion have suffered terribly just before be captured being with score of men cut off from rest by rush of austrian rumour spread that marshal have be killed more than can not tell two hour later austrian officer rode up with order that prisoner be to be marched distance farther to rear fergus went up to said can tell sir if marshal keith be among killed be one of aide de camp moreover cousin of yes officer said have fallen body be recognized by general lacy who command here be on staff general be greatly affected for marshal be at one time comrade in arm marshal be shot through heart have previously received two other wound be most gallant soldier one highly esteemed by will be buried with military honour at hochkirch where have be carried fergus be deeply moved keith have be so uniformly kind that have come to feel for almost a father must not speak for minute then said must ask general lacy sir to allow to attend funeral a one of marshal staff a relation who loved very dearly name be major drummond will certainly ask sir have doubt that will grant request thereupon gave order that young officer must remain with fergus until answer be received then rode off in few minute rest of prisoner be marched away in hour officer returned general lacy will be glad if will accompany to quarter gladly accedes to request lacy occupied one of house at hochkirch have be spared by flame aide de camp conducted fergus to empty room general be away at present said will see a soon a return when alone fergus burst into tear be indeed heavy loss to even before came out have come to regard keith with deep respect admiration have heard so much of from mother that seemed to that relationship be far closer than really be that keith stood in position of uncle rather than of mother cousin since have be in germany have be constantly with save when be away with king genial kindness absence of formality affectionate interest have shown in have be almost of fatherly nature be poor consolation to know that be death keith must of others have chosen have survived campaign must probably have be obliged to retire from active service to take quiet command where inactivity must speedily have chafed beyond bearing after so active stirring life two hour later officer entered room said that general lacy have returned must see general be alone when be shown into room face evinced momentary surprise when eye fell on fergus promotion be not very rapid in prussian army have expected to see man of between thirty forty sight of young officer with rank insignia of major wearing on breast prussian order surprised be sorry indeed for loss major drummond said in english sorry for own too though may well be that in case keith must never have met again be comrade once like everyone else loved what relation be to be mother first cousin general be always dear friend have for year written regularly to other be settled that must come out to a soon a be old enough 't be upwards of two year since did so have be more like father than cousin to during time have gone up tree fast general lacy said very fast sir owe to good fortune not to influence be in case promoted by king good judge of men not accustomed to give promotion easily will tell how happened there be not much to tell sir on first occasion freed count eulenfurst of rascal who be maltreating family remember circumstance lacy said warmly heard from saxon officer who joined at end of first campaign after saxon army be disbanded officer be allowed to go free be at dresden for time heard story be gallant business think killed six of be next occasion next followed very quickly general be given for carrying order to prussian horse enabled to get back to line before austrian cavalry fell upon be there lacy said so be officer who charged through squadron of cavalry accompanied by single orderly certainly won promotion fairly there where did get last step at zorndorf where in melee when russian broke rank be fortunate enough to intercept three russian dragoon who be making for king who be hemmed in among infantry be trying to rally good reason again for promotion well if go on be likely to rise a high a cousin be poor life a looked down upon keith face today thought how empty be honour that adventurer like ourselves can gain have risen too what doe bring responsibility toil consciousness that solitary mistake may bring into disgrace that in case end may be like death on battlefield fighting in quarrel in have concern of may disapprove grave soon forgotten name scarce known to one countryman be not worth general spoke in tone of deep feeling have made up mind not to continue in service after war be over fergus said after short pause although king have personally be very kind to when marshal remained in bohemia took on own staff be right a be young few year further service will do harm will indeed do good be if pas through unharmed man who have fought under frederick gained small honour in service where brave men be common will be respected when return to home matter how small patrimony may be will be in respect abler man for few year of fierce struggle adventure now major drummond must say goodbye for present a have to ride over to marshal may not return until

of prisoner where message delivered from general lacy to officer in charge caused many small indulgence to be granted to on way south day after day convoy pursued way by short march for several of officer be too severely wounded to travel far several of be left at prague here greater portion of others be taken on by southern road through budweis rest turning southeast towards moravia on evening before separated commander of convoy said to fergus have wish to choose a to of fortress must be sent to can put name down with party will go to iglau in moravia rest to fort round linz think must rather go to linz colonel a be good enough to give choice accordingly next morning fergus with twenty officer continued way south majority proceeded to iglau to be distributed among various fortress of moravia fergus be much pleased that have not be sent with party for have by chance be taken to former place of imprisonment must certainly have be recognized strictest precaution taken against repeating attempt on arrival at prisoner be formally handed over to charge of governor distributed among various outlying fort round city ten others be told off to same prison a fergus fort be one nearest to river on west side of city stood hundred yard from bank gun being intended to prevent passage of danube a well a to guard city against land attack from side be strong place a be situated in flat country presented natural obstacle to escape be surrounded by broad moat fed by cut from river on other side of moat be two small redoubt facing west fort contained ample barrack for garrison of three hundred men who occupied with bomb proof in must take refuge in event of siege beyond moat glacis sloped down to ditch cannon be placed in casemates of have be withdrawn casemates fitted with massive shutter converted into prison for use of officer two captain be lodged in same casemate with fergus light came from without there be low semicircular window over door be very strongly barred admitted sufficient light in daytime not such bad quarter fergus said a looked round when cold weather come will only have to stuff straw through bar leaving one square open for light manage to hang thick curtain across at night suppose will give brazier of charcoal when get little colder though indeed be cold enough now at rate will have rest major will be treat after long march during last campaign must think that can sleep best part of winter away fasten shutter pretty securely fergus went on be three inch of solid oak see bar be riveted at end suppose think that must have plenty of time to cut rivet head off before army must approach in short time officer in command of force came round be very civil courteous said that have already ordered stove to be sent in that must have straw laid over floor will be permitted to take exercise when like upon rampart overhead said reasonable request make will be attended to regret that misfortune of war must have placed in keeping for austrian can appreciate bravery can not admit that braver men be to be found than in king of prussia army a to ration must be plain certain sum be allowed by government for cost of prisoner make go a far a can often wish that sum be larger may say that be permitted to order addition to food from without upon payment need hardly add that order must pas through hand of officer in charge of that everything brought in be rigidly inspected have there be exchange of prisoner of late one of fergus companion asked be compliment to gentleman for government apparently place higher value on than on be very chary of swelling frederick army by release of prisoner somehow king seems to make double use of soldier fight battle here then rush away to meet enemy two three hundred mile off while when get advantage seem so satisfied with ourselves that sit still until have let advantage slip from hand may ask if by last news marshal daun be still near hochkirch be so a far a yesterday courier brought news at first thought that have won tremendous victory have eaten up frederick army later news be that king marched safely away so far from being demolished be now perfectly master of movement ready doubt for tussle if must advance however must imagine that snow will soon put stop to active operation then bowing courteously left to pay visit to prisoner in next casemate chapter breaking prison seems to be pleasant fellow fergus said disposed to do best to make comfortable so if see chance of getting away will be able to get through winter very fairly think there be chance of escape surely major pray drop major captain stauffen let call other by name while be here discipline of prussian army be admirable must a rule be most stringently maintained by sort of form observance here by three self confined in casemate for one can say how long be ridiculous that must be always stiff ceremonious be year older than be have have good fortune to have better opportunity than have have have be promoted accordingly while here let try forget about make thing a pleasant round a possible two officer agreed not without grave doubt for to be quite serious matter to relax even in prison stringent rule guided relation of officer to other in prussian army be strong place fergus went on know that be a difficult to break out of a last place be in have be prisoner before two officer asked together for belonged to regiment be not with frederick at lobositz have indeed only recently come down from berlin yes be taken at lobositz marched to spielberg managed to get away from there be long story will do to pas away evening when have got fire can sit comfortably talk round cell there be so high in castle with wall rock below there be fall of hundred fifty foot at least so that difficulty of escape be good deal greater than be here perhaps must say seemed to be good deal greater for know that be there be tramp of sentry outside suppose walk up down whole length of six casemates counted a came in be at one end of course be advantage why so one of others asked with puzzled expression of face well see sentry only pass once to twice pass casemate in middle have back to twice a long at time must not have thought of stauffen said yes can see that if be escaping through door seems to impossible that must be advantage glanced at companion a if to say that there be more in fortunate young officer than have thought among officer who have served throughout with frederick manner in fergus have gained promotion be well known rescue of count eulenfurst family be general subject of talk at dresden even putting aside gallantry of action be considered that army in general be indebted to for having saved from disgrace must have attached to have murderous outrage be carried out successfully manner in have saved prussian cavalry from destruction by charge through austrian squadron have similarly be talked over in regiment engaged at lobositz who have be at zorndorf be cognizant of fact that have gained majority by saving king life a have be mentioned in general order of day regiment however to two officer belonged have come down from berlin six month before have formed part of command of prince maurice until frederick have returned from zorndorf have with portion of force of prince maurice marched out to compel daun to abandon impregnable position at stolpen have not particularly observed fergus on journey south when during last two three day of march have noticed have regarded a fortunate young fellow who have by royal favour received extraordinary promotion have be pushed up over head of older men simply from favouritism thus manner towards have be even more stiff ceremonious than usual do think then stauffen said that there be chance of making escape oh have not have time to think about yet fergus laughed there be generally way if one can find out have doubt that will take good deal of thinking before hit upon if doe nothing else for will be amusement through long evening to have to puzzle out there be hurry for be not likely that there will be more fighting before army go into winter quarter so that be there when campaign open in spring will be soon enough door opened now two soldier brought in stove be placed nearly in centre of room flue went up to top of arch then turned at right angle passed out of casemate through hole just over window after lighting stove brought in two bundle of rush spread over floor then carried in tray with dinner placed on little table there be three stool standing by side of three barrack bed placed in corner of room carried to table others waited to see upon side fergus placed put down on one side excuse major stauffen said changing putting facing fire placing own on one side while companion be opposite to then stood stiffly waiting until fergus with shrug of shoulder took place dinner consisted of thin soup followed by meat of have be made stewed up served with good gravy two sort of vegetable bread be white good bottle of rough country wine be placed by side of commandant feed better here than be fed at spielberg fergus said cheerfully if got there did not get meat if have meat have broth only gave bottle of wine commandant evidently doe a say make money get for keep go far let drink health better employment to evidently feel being kept here instead of being with army in field in fact be just a much prisoner a be without even satisfaction of being able to talk over plan for escape ah see have sent box of cigar too finished last a rode here today be wondering when must be able to get more in also tobacco for pipe hope smoke stauffen companion whose name be ritzer did so be glad of fergus said think be very cheery sociable when everyone smoke certainly when only two out of three do look somehow a if one who doe not be left out in cold never smoked until came out here two year half ago there be doubt at end of day hard work when have got to do long ride in dark be very comforting effort to keep conversation going be not very successful two officer be evidently determined to maintain distinction of rank saying to that must probably soon get tired of ceased to attempt to break down barrier insisted upon keeping up after dinner be over lighted cigar then went out mounted step from yard to rampart be soon joined by officer from other casemates separating into group strolled up down making remark on country round town behind fergus have at once left fellow prisoner joined two three others with whom have be previously acquainted one being captain of rd royal dragoon be with stauffen ritzer be not major latter said have brother in same regiment so know how do get on with at present be rather stiff distant insist upon treating a senior officer be absurd when be prisoner be fifteen year older than be detest that sort of thing of course in great garrison town like berlin dresden strict rule of discipline must be observed think be carried altogether too far a be custom of service there be nothing to be said about here a be fellow in misfortune seems to simply ridiculous becomes second nature after time officer said two with be lieutenant must feel little surprised if did not pay usual respect yes then be older man must naturally take lead in case to can assure be most disagreeable to have men much older than insisting upon treating a superior officer especially a regiment having only recently joined suppose set down a young favourite other who have got promotion over head of deserving officer because be related to someone in power ought to know that there be not much promotion to be gained in way in army major king be last man who must promote anyone for cause why schwerin son have served for four year be still cornet in regiment doubt king must be glad to promote if specially distinguished a have have opportunity of doing so will probably work way up in regiment a everyone else doe two three more officer came up joined party presently captain ronsfeldt strolled away joined group be not long before engaged stauffen ritzer in conversation have major drummond in with have not yes stauffen said shortly who be young fellow do know yes first joined regiment a junior cornet be le than two year half ago be senior lieutenant at time now be pretty well up on list of captain thanks to work have done vacancy death have made boy have gone over head be now walking about a major with order on breast be enough to make one sick of soldiering who be related to be related to marshal keith ronsfeldt said quietly ah that explains think quite understand case stauffen certainly if think that there have be favouritism think anyone ever heard of frederick promoting man out of turn save for merit suppose there be one in army who have won rank more worthily who be more generally recognized a deserving have never heard single word raised against honour have received when ride through camp men nudge other say 'that young fellow in staff uniform be major drummond there be not soldier try to put little extra respect into salute be joking ronsfeldt ritzer asked in astonishment be never le so ritzer then gave account of manner in fergus have obtained promotion two officer be silent when ronsfeldt concluded have made fool of ourselves stauffen said at last must apologize ritzer certainly must other agreed heartily seemed to that trying to make put aside respect due to rank be sort of affectation really impressed more disagreeably upon took for upstart favourite though might have known have thought of that king never promotes unduly who must possibly have believed that young fellow not yet twenty must say must have so distinguished will be lesson to not to judge by appearance day be cold cheerless after hour spent on rampart most of party be glad to return to casemates fergus be one of last to go back to disgust two officer rose saluted formally a came in wish captain stauffen said to express to deep regret at unworthy way in received request morning to lay aside distinction of rank while be prisoner here be under error regiment having only joined from berlin short time before king marched with to hochkirch be altogether ignorant of manner in have gained rank have thought that be result of favouritism now know highly distinguished service how worthily have gained step sincerely hope that will overlook boorish conduct will endeavour to forget manner in received kindly advance say more about gentleman fergus replied heartily have have luck availed of a assuredly must have done have same opportunity occurred to can quite understand that seemed to monstrous that at age must be senior officer feel be often inclined to regret must thus have be unduly pushed up however let say more about do hope that will be a three good comrade together that within casemate at rate there will be question whatever of rank that will call drummond a will call by name now let shake hand over bargain let draw stool round stove have comfortable talk have be speaking to major leiberkuhn about ordering thing tell that commandant say that one list must be made on order of of casemates must be put down separately sergeant will go out day with money must be given to to cover full extent of order will return change day when hand in article required have ordered tobacco better cigar than three bottle of good hungarian wine sergeant be going in hour so will be able to enjoy chat evening always take precaution of carrying twenty golden frederick sewn up in lining of tunic come in very useful in case of emergency of kind be afraid that of have imitated forethought ritzer said with laugh have only last month pay in pocket stauffen be better off ah well with thirty pound among will do very well fergus said must be careful because if do make escape will want money to get disguise be not really in earnest drummond stauffen said in what say about escaping be quite in earnest about getting away if see chance though admit that at present matter seems little difficult perhaps if will tell about escape from spielberg will be able to get hint from now drew up seat round stove fergus told in detail manner of escape omitting only name of nobleman at vienna who have assisted be excellently done ritzer said warmly making off in austrian uniform at only moment when thing must be done be certainly masterly stroke so be taking of post horse stauffen agreed getting disguise from postmaster must like to have seen austrian look of surprise when got uniform back again be afraid that adventure afford hint for getting away from here even will admit that three austrian uniform must not be secured tale by procured post horse must hardly hold good in case of three if get away at must be done in entirely different manner place be not so difficult to get out of a spielberg be for with patience must certainly manage to cut off rivet head of bar see at present how must cross wide moat with sentry pacing up down thirty foot above climb up brick wall on other side without making noise that done of course must on dark night cross glacis swim outer moat accomplished question of disguise will come in just at present be not very easy to see how be to be managed can swim officer replied in affirmative well be something gained a to rest need not bother about at present be not uncomfortable where be if get back in time for next campaign be really matter others laughed at confident tone in spoke after hearing detail of prior attempt seemed to that companion be capable of accomplishing what almost seemed to be impossibility have knew very slight chance of being exchanged so long a war lasted few general officer others whose family possessed great influence be occasionally exchanged be evidently policy of austria to retain prisoner in first place desired to reduce frederick fighting force in second number of austrian taken have be very much larger than of prussian captured support of fifteen twenty thousand prisoner of war added to drain on frederick resource three campaign have passed without materially altering position of combatant a many more might elapse before war came to end indeed there be saying how long might last prospect be so unpleasant that two officer be inclined to run very considerable risk in attempting to obtain freedom week later snow began to fall heavily moat froze there be getting across without being seen even on darkest night fergus said a walked up down rampart with two companion unless sentry be sound asleep in such weather a be last thing likely to happen unless something altogether unexpected occurs will have to postpone action till spring come now that have bought book can pas time away comfortably be happy thought of major leiberkuhn that of must buy one book so that altogether have got forty between taking reading quietly will last for couple of month may be equally interesting a sergeant bought second hand at about franc volume can lay in stock without hurting whenever choose few day later bought several set of draught chessman domino dozen pack of card have be arranged at general meeting held in major casemate strict rule have be laid down that there must be playing for money several of prisoner have have only few mark in pocket when captured agreed to meet at three o'clock in two of casemates by turn a one must not hold whole number made great break in day must have be better if meeting have be held in evening regulation that during winter month be locked up at five prevented being adopted so cold weather passed not altogether unpleasantly strict rule that case in slightest difference of opinion arose must at once be submitted to adjudication of major leiberkuhn senior officer of casemate in occurred effectually prevented dispute quarrel over card other game good fellowship remained therefore unbroken in march sun gained power snow ice began to melt fergus again began to think how escape must be effected can think of only one plan said to two companion one evening be clear that be altogether hopeless to think of getting out by door a agreed must be possible to chip off head of rivet unbar shutter let down into moat if be to make way along at foot of wall chance of being seen by sentry above must be very slight for of course must choose night when wind be blowing hard water ruffled in case splash might make must not be heard swimming along to corner of face of fort must turn keep along until reached spot where cut run to river crossing moat to must be most dangerous part of business ought if possible to dive across there be low wall there cheval de frise on top of must have to get out by side of then swim along cut crawl along edge of till get to river then must crawl along under shelter of bank towards town till get to boat hauled up swim to one moored little way out in stream then must row up river for distance land that seems possible enough drummond captain ritzer said what about uniform must leave behind swim in underclothes must say must take couple of suit with must make up into bundle carry on head while swim of course if take will not be able to dive must swim across moat to cut trust to darkness for sentry not seeing then once on board boat must take off wet thing put dry one on can hardly wander about country in shirt drawer drummond stauffen suggested certainly not idea be that a soon a be mile two away must either board boat where see light overpower boatman take clothes if will not sell to else land at quiet house rig out there must be great difficulty about once rigged out must make south for a soon a escape be found out next morning cavalry will scour country in direction on side of river give notice of escape at town village after lying up quiet for time must journey at least fifty mile west might make for munich if like strike isar at landshut then work up through ratisbon then through fichtel mountain to bayreuth so into saxony from landshut can cross bohmerwald mountain into bohemia if like from munich can keep west into wuertemberg up through hesse darmstadt cassel into hanover lastly can go on to mannheim down rhine then come round by sea to hamburg others laughed look tremendous business anyhow drummond must never think of attempting by ritzer said if assure that think will be possible be ready to try think that there be chance of success ritzer really see why must fail of course there be risk in once fairly on other side of moat on river bank seems comparatively safe can see that there be always lot of boat moored in stream side of bridge by taking small boat might put off to one of get change of clothes at once bind gag crew there be not likely to be above two three of give piece of gold to pay for clothes then row straight up river land mile two away must make plain sailing of course must push boat off when landed must float down past town before daylight chance be that boatman finding that be loser by affair must make complaint to authority even if did must be far beyond reach by time have got to do be to choose really dark night with wind rain first job to be done be to get head off rivet have examined carefully be roughly done fancy that iron be very hard knife will think make comparatively short job of must not work at night ritzer said sentry in front must hear noise think of sawing head off fergus said with help of little oil fancy steel will cut through iron yesterday tapped edge of knife against edge of stone parapet be good steel very brittle managed to make pretty fair saw of tomorrow will do yours if like carried clasp knife for cutting food with when serving in field have oil have bought for dressing salad with fergus at once attacked one of rivet cut said after three four minute work of course will be long job ought to do in week there be three bar if cut rivet at one end of have doubt will be able to turn bar on rivet at other end relieved other at short interval worked greater part of night at end of time head of one of rivet be cut almost through will leave a be now fergus said quarter of hour work will take off a be one must notice what have be done unless inspected closely greatly encouraged by success others now entered warmly into plan using knife instead of stone be able next day to convert knife into much better saw than own have be other two rivet be cut in much shorter time than first waited week then wind began to rise by evening gale be blowing rain falling heavily there be moon night must be admirably suited for purpose supper be brought in at six o'clock knowing that must not be visited again until morning at once began work a soon a have finished cutting one rivet tried bar united strength be quite sufficient to bend far enough to allow being withdrawn from rivet then throwing weight upon turned upon bolt at other end until hung perpendicularly in half hour other two bar be similarly removed heavy shutter opened be closed again until preparation be complete first ate supper then sat talked until nine then knotted sheet together tied underclothes into bundle austrian government will be loser fergus laughed will get three prussian uniform instead of six suit of prison underclothing now will go first will one of will go according to rank ritzer laughed very well now mind gentleman do take water quietly will wait until be down then will follow other closely so that can help one if necessary can hardly see water from here sentry being twice a far off from a be will see le besides think likely that will be standing in sentry box in such rain a feel confident that will get across without being seen river be high opposite wall of moat be only foot above water so will have difficulty in getting out on other side have money sewn in small bag round neck may a well take knife with will help to tackle boatman think be everything now will be off fastening sheet firmly to one of bar swung out slid down rope quietly noiselessly entered water be so cold that almost took breath away swam stroke two along wall waited until joined by comrade casemate being end one have ten twelve yard to swim to angle of wall fifty took to point facing cut fergus have paced on rampart above calculated that stroke must take yard be too dark to see more than dim line of wall on other side waited until others joined be all right asked in low voice yes cold be frightful will soon be out of said wait till have gone few yard then follow one after other surface of moat be so ruffled by wind fergus have little fear of being seen even if sentry above be out watching felt sure that must be in sentry box so swam boldly across at once climbed onto lower wall helped two companion out be completely numbed by cold come along said be on lower side of cut crawl for short distance then can get up run will be best thing for in three minute be up on river bank now can change clothes said others will soon get wet through wo be a cold a be thing be soon stripped off gave rub with one of dry shirt be soon dressed in double suit stocking be better fergus said cheerfully now for run along towing path quarter of mile run circulation be restored felt comparatively comfortable have at suggestion of fergus wrung out thing have taken off thrown over shoulder so a to afford protection against rain now dropped into slower pace after going for mile neared spot where craft be lying moored in river several small boat be drawn up on shore one of launched put out oar rowed quietly to large barge fifty yard from bank on light be burning taking pain to prevent boat striking side stepped on board fastened head rope proceeded aft light be burning in cabin looking through little round window in door saw three boatman sitting there smoking playing card opened knife slid back door stepped in chapter escaped so astonishing be spectacle of three lightly clad men appearing suddenly on board craft moored out on river that three boatman sat immovable in attitude in have be sitting at entry of strange visitor without uttering word superstitious by nature doubted whether there be not something supernatural in appearance of three stranger if cry out make slightest sound fergus said showing knife be dead men if sit quiet do a order harm will come to want clothes if have spare one can hand to if not must take have on be not robber want to steal if will fix fair price on thing will pay for must in case submit to be bound gagged till morning when on going on deck will find difficulty in attracting attention of of comrade who will at once release keep hand on table while friend take away knife if one of move hand be a good a dead man companion removed knife from belt of two men sitting outside then fergus said to third man now hand over knife will do now of be captain be man sitting farthest from door said very well now have spare clothes on board yes lord replied in tone showed that have not yet recovered from first stupefaction have sunday suit want fergus said want three suit that have on what do value at anything like lord want to know how much cost when new man asked two comrade then mentioned total very well will give that then will have reason for grumbling for will get three new suit for three old one now do touched man nearest to take off coat waistcoat breech neck handkerchief boot then get into bunk man did a be ordered a did other two in succession a did so captain ritzer have gone up on deck returned with coil of thin rope that have cut off with tied men securely there be occasion to gag think fergus said might shout a loud a liked with wind blowing one must hear if anyone did hear must take for shouting of drunken man now look here men here be money to buy new clothes have not ill treated in way have sir be quite satisfied now must advise in morning to manage to untie other will fasten door up a go out will have difficulty in bursting that open when be once untied now ask a be satisfied to say nothing about affair to anyone must only make joke among comrade must do good best thing that can do when get free will be to dress yourselves in sunday clothes take boat ashore buy new thing in place of have taken be what will do sir one must believe if told that three men have come on board taken old clothes given money to buy new one in place three boatman be tall brawny bavarian clothes fitted fergus companion well fisherman hat completed costume little cabin have be almost oppressively warm have completely got over chill when left closing door behind took place in boat crossed to opposite shore be to extent sheltered from wind rowed three mile up then landed pushed boat off into stream kept along bank until came to road branching off to left followed until struck main road few hundred yard away then walked west there have be few word spoken since left barge have be hard work rowing against wind stream oar be clumsy have needed effort to keep boat head straight now that be in main road be somewhat more sheltered well drummond have accomplished what seemed to in spite of confidence well nigh impossible have got out have obtained disguise have eight nine hour before escape can be discovered will believe anything tell in future ritzer said yes companion agreed never believed that must succeed though a have set heart on did not like to hang back really did seem to wild scheme altogether thought possibly might get out of fort believed that plan of getting disguise must break down altogether rest seemed comparatively easy rain have ceased star be coming out be comfort indeed one be often wet through for day together when campaigning after five month coddling eight hour tramp in blinding rain must have be very unpleasant especially a have change of clothes now commanding officer what be to be next tale be simple enough fergus said with laugh have be down with raft of timber from mountain be on way back must be story till have passed ratisbon there be one objection be serious one a raftsman must certainly speak bavarian dialect none of can do for reason think must be safer to leave danube at passau make down through munich must be at passau tomorrow morning can put up at little place by riverside two day walking will take to munich certainly one must suspect of being escaped prisoner can get other clothes tomorrow morning finish rest of journey a countryman principal thing will be to get rid of high boot think in other respect there be nothing very distinctive about dress will be more difficult to concoct story must hope that sha' be asked many question see reason why must be will look like peasant going from country village to town if must hit upon story to account for not speaking dialect must of course be great advantage walked along in silence for time then went on must say might give out that be three saxon who having be forced at pirna to enter prussian army have be taken prisoner at hochkirch have be marched down with others to vienna that there on stating who be how have be forced against will into frederick army be at once released be now on way back to saxony be tramping through bavaria so a to avoid risk of being seized compelled to serve either in austrian army prussian that be working way doing job wherever can get day two employment at present having worked for time at vienna be able to go on for bit without doing so think with story must keep to plan of going up through ratisbon must be immensely shorter story must be more probable than that must make big detour to get home yes must think must do well ritzer said will shorten way by two hundred mile after leaving passau must think that have better not follow direct road until get to ratisbon grant that a far a town ought to be quite safe for there be chance of finding out that have escaped until eight o'clock in morning then colonel will have to report matter to commandant in town doubt will send off small party of cavalry by freyberg road to budweis to order authority there to keep sharp lookout for three men passing north doubt very much whether will think of sending in direction escape of three prussian officer be after very important matter still one can not be too careful for possibly commandant may send to munich ratisbon vienna be more likely however that search will be made principally in round linz will feel quite sure that can not possibly have obtained disguise must have gone off in undergarment will reckon that must naturally have hidden up in outhouse country loft until must find opportunity for obtaining clothes most likely barge went on morning before alarm have be given even if did boatman must not be likely to hear of escape of three prisoner think beyond passau will be quite safe a far a pursuit go will be best to halt there only long enough to take good meal then to go on for bit stop at quiet riverside village think will be able to go very far ritzer said boot be great deal too large for be chafing foot horribly road be good level be thinking just now of taking off carrying must be best way by far fergus said must think at passau be sure to find boat going up to ratisbon will settle difficulty distance be thirty mile making one two halt for rest reached passau just a morning be breaking in short time little inn by river opened door riverside be astir went into one of inn ate hearty meal then went down to waterside found that there be several country boat going up river soon bargained for passage have just time to buy basket of bread sausage cheese with dozen bottle of wine before boat started there be other passenger on board telling story have agreed upon be soon on good term with boatman including winding of river be eighty mile to ratisbon boat be towed by two horse glided pleasantly along taking three day on passage bought food at village where craft lay up for night arrived at ratisbon at nine o'clock in evening there found difficulty in obtaining lodging at small inn where question be asked short day journey took to neumarkt tramp of upwards of twenty mile be longer journey on to bamberg two day later to satisfaction entered coburg be now out of bavaria have escaped all difficulty a to dialect far better than have anticipated never having be asked question since left boat at ratisbon have now only to say that be on way to join confederate army be again being gathered preferred avoiding question by walking by night resting at little wayside inn during day avoiding town for troop be beginning to move crossed saxon frontier three day after leaving coburg then travelled by easy stage to dresden here went straight to headquarters of commandant of town reported to fergus have personal acquaintance on staff have difficulty in obtaining for companion advance of portion of pay due to in order that might obtain new outfit took couple of day two captain then said goodbye to fergus with many warm acknowledgment for manner in have enabled to regain freedom expression more earnest since heard that austrian have decided that in future must make exchange of prisoner started to rejoin regiment fergus felt strangely lonely when have left king be at breslau keith be lying dead in hochkirch what have become of lindsay knew not did know to whom ought to report where karl might be with remaining charger belonging hitherto at dresden have felt at home now save for count eulenfurst family be stranger in place naturally therefore went out to chateau here be received with same warmth a usual of course heard of capture at count said though not for many week afterwards be alarmed when news came of marshal death for a be upon division that brunt of battle have fallen feared greatly for at last came list austrian have sent in of prisoner have taken be delighted to see name in though a austrian have be so chary of late of exchanging prisoner feared that might not see for time however remembering how got out of spielberg did not despair of seeing back in spring thirza be especially confident believe conceives capable of achieving impossibility however have justified faith in supper will be served in few minute a doubt story be a usual long one will not begin until have finished meal tell first how be captured be riding through mist to find marshal whom have not seen for two hour a be with regiment defended church at hochkirch then cut way out through austrian mist be so thick must not see ten yard ahead rode plump into austrian battalion fired volley killed poor turk before must get on foot be surrounded taken prisoner not very heroic way must admit much pleasanter way though than of being badly wounded so found on field by enemy countess said be fortunate indeed in getting through terrible battle unhurt be indeed countess must far rather have lost limb than dear friend relation marshal be allowed to attend funeral next day austrian paid honour though have mourned for most deeply can not feel that be death must have chosen have be ailing for month have twice be obliged to leave command rest must in case probably have be last campaign after such wonderfully adventurous life a have led must have felt being laid upon shelf sorely elder brother earl marischal in scotland be not who have be governor for year at neufchatel be with king at breslau at present say king be greatly affected at loss of marshal who since schwerin death have be most trusted general have never seen marshal brother fergus said though know that be greatly attached to other hope that will be at breslau when get there will go report to king after have have few day rest here at present seem altogether unattached marshal staff be of course broken up a served on king own staff twice during last campaign trust that will put on again that will do of course count said after saving life at zorndorf be sure to do so supper be now announced after have be removed party drew round fire fergus told story of escape be excellently managed count said when have finished know that be quite a dramatic a escape from spielberg must think that of two escape from linz must have seemed most hopeless plan of getting shutter open of swimming moat might have occurred to anyone fact that be in uniform that must have be impossible to smuggle in disguise must have appeared to most men insuperable obstacle to carrying out plan certainly be wonderfully full of resource a rule must think that be much more difficult for two men to make escape from place than be for one alone did not seem to be so in case certainly did not add to difficulty of getting out of fort count indeed in one respect rendered more easy there be three of to work at head of rivet certainly facilitated getting clothes from boatman besides rendering journey much more pleasant than must have be for one of alone on other hand must have be impossible to carry out escape from spielberg in manner did if have have two officer with in cell must not have hoped to obtain three uniform must hardly have expected to slip by sentry unnoticed lastly three of must not have got post horse still be quite possible that might have escaped in other manner then have not most remote idea where will find servant horse not slightest if captain lindsay got safely through battle of hochkirch must say that man must stick by servant tough scotchman karl be great chum have doubt that unless received positive order to contrary karl have kept company with of course can find out from authority here who have taken command of marshal keith division might possibly hear whether took over marshal personal staff whether brought own officer with yes must think might do count think will in case report to king if lindsay be stationed at place must pas through on way to breslau must pick up karl horse will of course send horse tomorrow count said be of use saying anything against be settled that must supply with mount while war lasted intend to carry out fully know have in stable here be quite equal to other pair there be two three approach very nearly if can get mounted orderly well good if not will lend one of men of groom must be delighted to go with for regard a saviour of life be afraid friend will not be able to pay many more visit king be miracle of steadfastness of energy rapidity even can not perform impossibility leave out russian believe that must be more than match for austrian who be hampered by slowness of general russia can not be ignored in first campaign be non existent in second annexed east prussia year have have deadly tussle with next year may be still more formidable believe that frederick with skill with splendid valour troop show can keep russian from advancing still further into country at same time prevent austrian federal army from snatching dresden from grasp must regret deeply prussia although tax population heavily at least permit disorder ill treatment of people plundering of village while austrian croat pandoors will spread like swarm of hornet over land state of saxon under so called rescuer will be infinitely worse than have be under conqueror must be heavy blow to king to lose dresden fergus agreed be by mean sure that must not be better without except of course that must bring enemy so much nearer to berlin otherwise loss of saxony must be benefit to during movement in combination be forced to keep eye on dresden at one moment be soubise with mixed army of french austrian confederate troop who have to be met leaving else frederick be forced to march away two three hundred mile waste two three precious month before can get blow at then have to leave considerable force to prevent gathering again while hurry back to prevent daun from besieging dresden to wrest silesia again out of hand saxony lost must devote whole mind whole power to russian austrian army who will doubt at next campaign endeavour to act together nearer be to other more easily rapidly can strike blow at alternately perhaps be right count said certainly austrian must have to keep considerable force to garrison dresden hold saxony for must be sure at very first opportunity frederick must be among raining blow rapidly heavily a to advance north must not dare attempt for frederick who can move more than twice a fast a austrian army must fall on flank rear annihilate still blow must be undoubtedly heavy one for king inasmuch a must greatly raise spirit of enemy must seem to show that end be approaching think end be good way off still count even if russian austrian marched across prussia must hold little more than ground stood on frederick must be ever hovering round attacking on opportunity preventing from sending off detached column while cavalry of ziethen seidlitz must effectually prevent cossack croat from going out to gather store for army to plunder massacre on own account doubt whether anything short of annihilation of army must break king spirit so far a can see be by mean likely to take place however point at present friend be that if austrian get dresden may be long before see again fancy that when army go into winter quarter again if be able to get leave of absence will do pleasure of paying visit whether city have changed hand not if one can travel twice through austria without being detected be hard indeed if can not make way into saxony must not run too great risk countess said know how glad must be to see that regard a one of ourselves even mother must hardly wish son to run into such danger in order that might see other for short time what do say thirza father asked girl thus suddenly addressed coloured hotly must be glad to see father know that very well must not like to run risk be always running risk child so far a can see without so good reason at rate will not join mother in protesting what say be very true have twice made way many hundred of mile in disguise for purpose of getting here in time for first fighting think that there will be anything like same risk in coming here to pay visit at same time must not say single word to induce to do so there be saying where may be when next winter set in what may take place during coming campaign in time like be folly to make plan of sort three month in advance only say therefore must everything else be favourable think that austrian occupation of saxony must not be very serious obstacle to paying visit next winter once here must be absolutely safe a household know what have done for probably for for there be saying whether at least of might not have be killed by villain absolute discretion silence can be relied upon however may be that will see long before that king may have occasion to be here many time during summer count must not hear of fergus returning to hotel where have put up for week remained at chateau where time passed very pleasantly luxurious appointment hospitable attention of host hostess whole of surroundings formed strong contrast indeed to life when campaigning five month have spent in casemate at linz at end of time felt ought to be on move again have that officer of marshal staff have be dispersed being attached to other division lindsay be now upon staff of prince henry prince be out erfurt way have already have sharp fighting with french confederate army fergus have learned on day after arrival at chateau also to east there be sign of movement on part of daun of king therefore suffered to be persuaded to stay on for week nobody be expecting drummond count said doubt will be glad to see will be just a glad ten day later a ten day earlier be believed to be safe in austrian prison may be sure that one will make inquiry whether spent week month in recovering from fatigue before taking up duty again at rate must stay for at least week visit be indeed extended two day beyond time for count countess so pressed that be glad to give way especially a own inclination strongly seconded entreaty on ninth morning be astonished when bedroom door opened karl came in gave morning salute a impassively a if have seen evening before illustration why karl fergus exclaimed where do spring from when did arrive why karl exclaimed where do spring from how did know be here when did arrive

bullet what with sudden flash of fire bolted have just caught sight of turk going down in heap a horse spun round have galloped full hundred yard before must check then did not know what be best to do seemed to that must certainly be killed if have be sure that have be wounded taken prisoner must have gone back even then might more likely than not have be shot by austrian before must explain matter really thought that be killed a from shouting firing seemed to that enemy have own way there rode back to farmhouse luckily austrian have not got there so took tartar rode with to king quarter left with groom who knew well enough then later on having nothing else to do joined seidlitz have satisfaction of striking many good blow in revenge for late in afternoon when fighting be over found captain lindsay told about loss comforted bit by saying that did not think be born to be shot said that have better stay with donald till there be news about two day later told have got list of prisoner austrian have taken that be with unwounded then major be furious with have not be taken prisoner too must have be more troubled still if captain lindsay have not said that in first place tartar must have be lost if have not come back straight to fetch that in second place be not likely must have be able to keep with have be prisoner might not even have be shut up in same fortress asked what have better do said ' be going west to join prince henry have better come with may be sure that there will be question asked about one way other have doubt major drummond will be back in spring be sure to get out somehow ' seemed to that be best plan too major if have be sent back to regiment know what must have done with horse then if did return might not have heard about must not have known what have become of once twice during last month captain lindsay have said to 'your master ought to have be here before karl quite reckoned on arriving by end of march ' said perhaps have

fergus have dressed dear count exclaimed a entered room where count wife daughter be already assembled how can thank for great kindness in taking such pain to fetch karl horse down for have great pain about matter count replied with smile simply wrote to steward that messenger must be sent to erfurt at once to order major drummond soldier servant to come here at speed with master horse belonging beake what arrangement like ' said 'for relay of horse anyhow must get to erfurt in three day will give four for coming back again with man be to be found at quarter of captain lindsay who be on staff of prince henry if captain lindsay be away must find out servant ' be trouble have in matter have really to thank thirza for be idea directly have left room after telling that lindsay be with prince henry most likely at erfurt said ' must think father that there must be time to fetch major drummond servant horse be not so very far surely might be done in week 'well thought of ' said 'it be hundred seventy mile courier with relay of horse must do in three day without difficulty might be back here again with drummond servant in four day will give order at once can manage to get drummond

found on arrival that king have ten day before gone to landshut round place portion of army be cantoned at landshut commanded main pas into bohemia be in position to move rapidly towards point where

fergus arrived at landshut proceeded to royal quarter on sending name to king be at once ushered in so have returned major drummond frederick said cordially in plenty of time to see play though indeed must not be surprised if be time before curtain draw up have hope that might rejoin for after last escape doubted whether austrian prison must hold long be glad to see back again ah be heavy loss that of good marshal none can say how miss be not only a general one of best most trustworthy a friend be always cheery always hopeful one to whom must tell thought ah if have taken advice at hochkirch must not have have to mourn loss be heavy blow to also major drummond heavy blow indeed majesty be a kind to a if have be father will try to supply place king said gravely died in service through error for own sake be glad that be here have something of temperament can talk freely with too come into head did not know whether did rightly in coming to report direct to sire kindness have always be so great to that thought must be best to come straight to instead of reporting elsewhere having indeed fixed post commander did quite right by way keith brother scottish earl marischal be here touched bell said to officer who came in will give compliment to earl marischal keith beg to come to for few minute two minute later keith entered tall man le strongly built than brother much resembling excuse sending for earl marischal king said wanted to introduce to young cousin major drummond very brave young officer a may well imagine since have already gained that rank wear military order of black eagle tell that have not hitherto met came over here at brother invitation be very great favourite of be deeply attached to brother mentioned frequently in letter to keith said holding out hand to fergus knew little of mother first cousin a be for being ten year older than brother be little child in eye when last saw be not that be past military work must gladly try to fill brother place to if can not aid in profession can at least give share of affection a to profession keith be business king said saved life at zorndorf have in so many way distinguished that success in career be already assured be by many year youngest major in service if war go on there be saying to what height may rise have just returned from austrian prison where a told when joined be carried after hochkirch know yet how escaped must dine with evening afterwards will tell about mitchell dines with also too be friend of young soldier have high opinion of that evening after dinner fergus related to party consisted only of king keith british ambassador how have escaped from prison next time austrian catch major drummond king said when have finished if want to keep will have to chain by leg a used to do in old time for month prussian austrian army lay inactive daun have supposed that a king have begun three previous campaign by launching force into bohemia must be certain to follow same policy have therefore placed army in almost impregnable position waited for king to assume offensive frederick however felt that with diminished force must no longer afford to dash against strong position so carefully chosen intrenched by enemy must now confine to defensive leave to austrian to attempt to cross pass give battle slowness with marched in comparison with speed at prussian troop must be taken from one point to gave good ground for believing that must find many opportunity for falling upon enemy when in movement be long time before austrian general recognized change in frederick strategy still longer before must bring to abandon own tactic of waiting fortifying determine to abandon stronghold assume offensive when july opened have by various slow careful march planted in very strong position at marklissa while frederick a usual be watching daun be well aware that frederick of thing desired to bring on battle knowing that russian one hundred thousand strong under soltikoff be steadily approaching determined to wait where be to allow brunt of fighting for once to fall on fergus by time be far away long week have passed a slowly to a have to king be very glad indeed when on nd of june frederick said to know that be impatient for action major drummond blood be younger than mine feel hard enough to be patient however can find employment for duke have now know twelve thousand english troop with have written to saying that a of aide de camp can speak english begs must send officer who can do so for very few of british be able to speak german serious consequence might arise from misapprehension of order on day of battle therefore have resolved to send to can start tomorrow at daybreak will have despatch prepared for to carry to duke who of course by way know will be sure be glad to have with later on must send of scottish officer to take place with for like having with however at present be wasting time may a well go be off again tomorrow morning karl fergus said in high spirit a reached quarter be best news have heard since count messenger brought word at erfurt that have returned major have be dullest six week have have since first marched from berlin for while in winter one know that nothing can be done so be content to rest quietly in spring one be always expecting something if nothing come of one worry grumble be long ride be going time karl care how how long be major so one be moving be going to join duke of brunswick staff be something like ride major karl said in surprise for be right from one side of prussia to other yes be over four hundred fifty mile well major have got good horse have have easy time of lately how long do think that will take well major horse can do forty mile day if have day to rest halfway horse must do more riding on alternate day must be a much a mine must do to manage that must take by turn karl will give horse partial rest one day out of three like must do must say major in about fortnight rode first to breslau thence to magdeburg passing through many town on long journey none of great importance at magdeburg heard that must make for hanover where must be able to ascertain precise position of duke army be on northern frontier of westphalia while french under duke of broglio be advancing north from frankfort on maine french army under contades be moving against ferdinand from west a be probable that there must at least be great battle until two french army combined fergus who have already given horse two day complete rest remained for three day at magdeburg a be likely that must have to work hard when joined duke five day later rode into duke of brunswick principal camp be near osnabrueck where be situated central magazine be glad to see major drummond duke said cordially when fergus reported thought perhaps king must select for service know how zealous active be be greatly in need of staff officer who can speak english for none of mine can do so think that will have hard fighting here soon see that be very much in position of king menaced from two direction if move to attack contades broglio will have hanover entirely open to while if move against contades will capture muenster osnabrueck get magazine might even push on occupy town of hanover before must get back so see have nothing to do to wait in neighbourhood until see design have twelve thousand of countryman here rely upon greatly know how fought at fontenoy splendid fellow be there be scotch regiment with whose appearance in kilt feather in slight degree astonishes people own soldier cavalry be very fine too have much heavier horse than ours must be terrible in charge how long have be on road have be eighteen day sir must have ridden faster having spare charger orderly must hardly travel more rapidly indeed when got to magdeburg found that be not likely that there must be engagement for time allowed horse three day rest so that must be fit for service a soon a arrived here tent be at once erected in staff line for fergus found upon inquiry that british division be at present at muenster be invited by duke to dinner that evening be introduced to officer of staff who received courteously with surprise one so young must not only bear rank of major coveted insignia of black eagle duke however when introduction be over gave short account of newcomer service after dinner begged fergus to tell how escaped from linz have hearty laugh over manner in companion obtained first disguise have heard something of colonel zolwyn head of staff said captain stauffen ritzer be ordered here on arrival at berlin though have not met have heard from others of escape from linz ascribed entirely to major of marshal keith staff who be fellow prisoner of theirs for next three week fergus be on horseback from morning till night movement of troop be incessant two french general manoeuvred with great skill giving opportunity for duke of brunswick to strike blow at broglio guided by treacherous peasant captured minden by surprise contades with thirty thousand men have taken up unassailable position right wing on weser left on impassable bog quagmire with front covered by bastau deep unfordable brook thirty thousand of troop be occupied in besieging muenster osnabrueck other place succeeded in capturing latter containing duke magazine of hay cavalry forage duke position became very grave french believed that in very short time must be master of hanover broglio force of twenty thousand men be on east side of weser ferdinand be unable to move to strike blow at detached force of contades for have done so broglio must have captured city of hanover lay perfectly open to within day march fergus have be specially employed in carrying despatch to british division have made many acquaintance among officer a army gradually concentrated when french force drew closer together often spent evening in tent when day work be done in scotch regiment be soon quite at home fact that be related to marshal keith of whom scotchman be proud have be one of aide de camp sufficed in to render at once popular officer followed with eager interest account of various battle have witnessed little by little extracted from account of manner in have won step so rapidly in prussian service found that british troop in general have profound dislike for lord sackville who commanded who be especially in command of cavalry described a heavy domineering fellow personally indolent slow on ill term with duke of brunswick whom in quiet obstinate way seemed bent on thwarting be ill conditioned brute one of officer remarked only thing to be said for be that be not deficient in personal courage have fought several duel into brought by overbearing temper although have frequently carried despatch to sackville fergus have not exchanged word with english general have taken paper from hand barely acknowledging salute not indeed glancing at turning on heel walking off to read content of despatch generally appeared to displease judging by manner in spoke to officer then must go into tent one of aide de camp must shortly come out with letter containing reply fergus naturally came to regard english commander with same dislike that own officer felt for one day when handing despatch omitted usual salute sackville noticed at once why do not salute sir said raising head for first time looking at duke aide de camp be twelfth time sir have brought despatch from duke of brunswick upon occasion have made military salute by regulation of army believe that superior officer be a much bound to return salute a inferior officer be to render a have not chosen upon one of twelve occasion to return salute see reason why must continue to give sackville looked at a shouted in english with astonishment rage who devil be be major fergus drummond companion of order of black eagle aide de camp of king of prussia deuce be sackville said insolently did not know that king of prussia promoted lad to be major chose for aide de camp made companion of order then sir know now fergus said quietly for explanation of rank beg to refer to duke of brunswick who will doubt not be not unwilling to explain matter to will report insolence to duke at rate sir be not for position here must myself condescend to give lesson of seem to to be in want must doubt sir whether must receive lesson at hand after affair have terminated will be happy to afford opportunity of endeavouring to do so lord sackville be on point of replying when colonel of staff whom fergus have met at dinner at duke who spoke german fluently came up said pardon general can speak to for moment fergus reined back horse length two while officer spoke rapidly to lord sackville care fig latter burst out passionately officer continued to speak general listened sullenly then turning to fergus said well sir will leave matter a be a soon a battle be over will waive rank meet will be ready at time fergus said then formally saluting rode away suppose have answer major drummond duke said when returned to quarter indeed there be none needed have answer sir indeed did not wait for one lord sackville have somewhat hot altercation related word for word what have passed be pity can not blame duke said when fergus have finished man have given great deal of trouble ever since joined with force be always slow in obeying order sometimes seems wilfully to misunderstand altogether be thorn in side be glad indeed that british infantry division be entirely under control with have difficulty whatever be entirely in wrong in matter certainly must address remonstrance to on subject of manner language to one of staff relation be already unpleasantly strained open breach between might bring about serious disaster certainly must not wish that must make allusion to matter sir possibly may have opportunity of teaching to be more polite after have done with french by two sudden stroke duke in third week of july obtained possession of bremen thereby obtaining port by store reinforcement from england must reach also recaptured osnabrueck found to great satisfaction that french have also established magazine there so that store be even larger than when have taken from great point be to induce contades to move from impregnable position knew that contades broglio be a anxious a be to bring about battle did see advantageous opportunity took bold step to tempt on th of july sent hereditary prince with force of ten thousand men to make circuit fall upon gohfeld ten mile up weser so cut line by contades brought up food for army from cassel seventy mile to south such movement must compel french to fight to fall back be bold move have not succeeded must have be deemed rash one for left with thirty six thousand men to face greatly superior force of french bait proved too tempting for french general seemed to that duke have committed fatal mistake left leaning on weser be by march of force to gohfeld left unsupported at distance of three mile from centre seemed to that must now hurl into gap destroy duke left then crush centre right cut off remnant might escape from hanover on tuesday evening july st french got into motion a soon a be dark during night contades crossed by nineteen bridge that have thrown across bastau while at same time broglio crossed weser by bridge of town took up position facing prussian left wing rested on village of todtenhausen intending to attack early in morning to finish before duke must bring centre to assistance feeling sure that french must fall into trap duke ordered cavalry to mount at one o'clock in morning moved in with troop from village around be encamped closing in towards minden whereby centre gradually came into touch with left whole forming segment of circle of minden be centre french also formed segment of similar circle nearer to minden contades be long time getting troop into position for great confusion be caused by having crossed by so many bridge took hour to range in order of battle broglio be in position facing duke left at five o'clock in morning be strong in artillery infantry a ground on flank be unfavourable for action of cavalry be posted in centre cavalry indeed be strongest portion of force numbered ten thousand be flower of french army duke placed six regiment of british infantry in centre be th th rd th th st regiment of hanoverian be in line behind british cavalry be on duke right morning be misty be not until eight o'clock that side be ready indeed even then contades infantry be not finally settled in position battle began with attack by hessian regiment on village of hahlen by very heavy fire of artillery on side order to english regiment have be march to attack enemy on sound of drum meaning that be to move when drum gave signal for advance english however understood order to be be to advance to sound of drum waited for time while attack on hahlen continued be repulsed three time before succeeded before happened english regiment lost patience said ought to be moving drum therefore struck up to astonishment of hanoverian english battalion strode away towards enemy however regiment of second line followed a british stepped forward tremendous crossfire of artillery opened upon thirty gun on one side a many on other in spite of six regiment pressed on unfalteringly with drum beating lustily behind then there be movement in front mighty mass of french cavalry poured down upon english halted closed up gap made by artillery held fire until leading squadron of french be within forty pace then opened tremendous file fire before man horse went down at so short distance bullet found billet for first time in history line of infantry repulsed attack of vastly superior body of cavalry astonished hampered by fallen men horse of first line french cavalry reined up trotted sullenly back to reform repeat charge british drum beat furiously a french rode forward again only to be repulsed a before six time did cavalry with bravery worthy of reputation renew charge six time did draw back sullenly a leading squadron withered up under storm of shot then must do more rode back in broken confused mass through gap between infantry throwing also into partial confusion ride to lord sackville tell to charge with cavalry at once duke said to fergus then checking said have better send someone else repeated order to of staff sackville only replied that did not see way to doing so second then third officer be sent to with like result at last left cavalry rode to duke inquired how be to go on duke curbed anger at seeing fruit of victory lost replied quietly lord opportunity be now past harassed only by fire of british hanoverian gun by of british infantry contades drew off army by nineteen bridge into stronghold broglio who have done nothing save keep up cannonade covered retreat with division total amount of loss on duke side be two thousand eight hundred twenty two of more than half belonged to british infantry french loss be seven thousand eighty six with heavy gun many flag have sackville done duty army must have be annihilated pent up a be with river on flank convergent to other at perfect rat trap from army must have escaped have be hotly pressed by cavalry feat performed by british infantry astonished europe who be at first almost incredulous that six regiment in line must have repulsed over over again finally driven off field ten thousand of best cavalry of france while battle be raging hereditary prince have done share of work have fallen upon gohfeld crushed french division guarding cutting french from magazine rendering position untenable received news that evening at once commenced retreat broglio towards frankfort contades straight for rhine latter be obliged to abandon baggage many of gun army by time have reached rhine have become mere rabble general be at once recalled in disgrace broglio appointed commander in chief although by failing to carry out order have received to fall upon ally left at five in morning have largely contributed to defeat have befallen contades chapter unexpected news fury of british cavalry at shameful inactivity in have be maintained be unbounded commander if moved from tent be saluted with hiss jeer by trooper be not for long however for a soon a news be known at home be ordered to return on afternoon of same day officer rode over to headquarters asked for major drummond be here sir said courteously on behalf of lord sackville will be leaving for england tomorrow be bearer of hostile message from will be obliged if will put in communication with officer who will act on behalf certainly fergus replied be expecting such message have already heard of order sackville have received have requested major kurstad fellow aide de camp to act for must send hostile message going in spoke to kurstad who at once went out introduced to british officer be painful business latter said can assure that undertake willingly however overheard altercation between lord sackville major drummond same night asked to act for when time for came consented can not draw back from undertaking need hardly say that after what happened at minden english officer unless previously pledged must have consented to act for suppose sir there be use in asking whether matter can not be arranged not in slightest major drummond told that have expressed willingness to meet general be certainly not one to withdraw from word friend chooses sword in fact use of pistol on such occasion be quite unknown in continental army a lord sackville leaf tomorrow morning must be glad if must name early hour a early a like be light at half past four then will say five o'clock certainly place there be small clump of tree on heath two mile west of camp will be there at time sir must object to side being accompanied by second friend ask because did anything happen to principal must certainly wish that witness be present at duel have objection major kurstad said will also bring surgeon with of course can do same if be disposed two officer saluted major returned to fergus do mean to kill asked after have told of arrangement have be made certainly not man be overbearing fool merely wish to give lesson personally must be glad if whole of officer of british force must be present in order that might be a much humiliated a possible even if hated man have shadow of feeling of kind must not kill be going home to england to be tried by court martial sentence be likely to be far heavier blow to bully of kind than death must be have taste of already for hear that be hooted whenever leaf tent at appointed time two party arrived almost at same moment at spot arranged fergus be accompanied by major kurstad officer of duke staff by duke own surgeon formal salutation be exchanged between second duelling sword be examined found to be of same length there be difficulty in choosing ground a there be open space in centre of little wood sun have not risen high enough to overtop tree a therefore glade be in shade there be advantage in point of light to combatant lord sackville have reputation of being good fencer in point of physique there be comparison between combatant sackville be tall powerfully built man dissipation good living have rendered muscle flabby sapped strength although be still in what must have be prime fergus on other hand have not superfluous ounce of flesh constant exercise have hardened muscle be picture of health activity general viewed with expression of vindictive animosity while face on other hand wore expression of perfect indifference uniform coat be removed dropping of handkerchief gave signal for to commence lord sackville at once lunged furiously thrust be parried next moment sword be sent flying through air second did not move to recover why do not bring here sackville exclaimed in tone of deepest passion because lord second said coldly a have be disarmed duel necessarily terminates unless antagonist be willing that sword will be restored to will be obliged if will give major buck fergus said quietly little accident of sort may occur occasionally even to noted swordsman when fighting with boy general be purple with passion when received sword from second mind time said between teeth a after preliminary feint two again lunged again sword be wrenched from hand with force elicited exclamation of pain from pray give general sword again major buck fergus said hold rapier too tightly general sackville need little more freedom of play le impetuosity want to hurt seriously blood be altogether too hot next time will bleed on sword arm steadying with great effort sackville played cautiously for time after parrying several of thrust without slightest difficulty fergus ran through right arm halfway between elbow shoulder sword dropped from hand illustration lord sackville stood without speaking while surgeon bandaged up arm lord george sackville have borne well in several duel be accounted gentleman though arrogant overbearing stood without speaking while surgeon bandaged up arm then said quietly ask pardon major drummond matter be altogether fault said must give lesson have given one assuredly will never forget trust that will accept apology for word uttered certainly general more so that own gave provocation by failing to salute only excuse for be that officer of highest rank in prussia always return salute of junior officer of rank did not reflect that having many important matter in mind might have neglected to return mine from pure absent mindedness not with intentional discourtesy can only say have not spoken of matter to three friend here be sure that matter will not be mentioned by when be earnest request that will go further party then mutually saluted rode off to respective camp story of duel did not leak out from fergus friend sackville have openly spoken of matter evening before to several officer have added to disgust at conduct by declaring that wished have be duke of brunswick instead of upstart aide de camp of with whom have to reckon next morning on part exacted pledge from officer who have accompanied rode back to camp without speaking word hour later left in carriage for bremen news of encounter then circulated rapidly excited intense amusement most lively satisfaction on part of british officer on sackville arrival in england be tried by court martial sentenced to be cashiered declared incapable of again serving majesty in military capacity king proclaimed officially to be sentence worse than death taking pen struck out name from list of privy councillor satisfactory explanation have ever be given of sackville conduct at minden many say be probable that be disgusted sulky at having to rise so early must hardly be sufficient explanation more probable conjecture be that a be on notoriously bad term with duke be willing that latter must suffer severe repulse at minden in hope that must be deprived of command appointed commander in chief of allied army few day after battle exultation caused by victory at minden be dashed by news that prussian army twenty six thousand strong commanded by wedel have be beaten by russian at zuellichau ten day later by still more crushing news that frederick with fifty thousand men have be completely defeated by russian austrian army ninety thousand in number at kunersdorf on th of august at first prussian have beaten back russian with great loss latter have rallied joined by loudon with austrian division have recovered ground beaten off prussian with immense loss defeat being chiefly due to fact that prussian army have marched to attack through wood intersected with many stream instead of arriving on field of battle a whole only came up at long interval so that first success must not be followed up regiment who made be annihilated before help came news came from berlin letter have be received there from king written on night after battle said that have three thousand men collected round that circumstance be desperate that appointed brother prince henry general in chief that army be to swear fidelity to letter be understood to mean that frederick intended to put end to life knew that enmity of foe be largely directed against personally that far easier term might be obtained for country be out of way be therefore determined not to survive irreparable defeat indeed always carried small tube of deadly poison on person universal consternation be felt at news however three day later came more cheering intelligence that twenty three thousand men have now gathered round that have again taken command loss in battle however have be terrible six thousand have be killed thirteen thousand wounded two thousand of latter too seriously wounded to escape be made prisoner loss of enemy have be little inferior for eighteen thousand russian austrian be killed wounded letter sent off by king night have disastrous consequence for wrote to governor of dresden must austrian attempt anything on town beyond mean of maintaining be to capitulate on best term must obtain happily for frederick soltikoff be a slow in movement a daun for two month made attempt to take advantage of victory of kunersdorf thus afforded time to frederick to repair misfortune during two month dresden have be lost governor have received frederick letter be unaware how thing have mended after be written that force be pressing forward to aid against austrian besieging army consequently after little more than nominal resistance surrendered when unknown to relief be close at hand french being defeated in full flight for rhine seemed to fergus that be duty to return to king a there be probability whatever of hard fighting on western frontier while position of affair in east be most serious be still on king staff have be lent to duke of brunswick laid matter before latter who at once agreed with that must rejoin king frederick sorely need active intelligent officer at present said be not by force that can hope to prevent russian austrian from marching to berlin by quickness resource opponent be slow deliberate in movement king quickness puzzle confuses be always difficult for two army to act in perfect concert well nigh impossible when be of different nationality daun will wait for soltikoff soltikoff for daun king will harass of have to keep one eye upon magazine in bohemia for prince henry in silesia still constantly menace not only austrian russian army be fed from prague be not that be specially bound to defend hanover from confederate army must march with greater portion of force to join king order be imperative 't be for hanover that george of england be fighting british subsidy british troop will be lost to king be hanover to be taken by enemy if prince henry must join must bring army again to strength with must fight russian austrian army lie between henry king unless daun make grievous mistake slow a be daun seldom make mistake seems well nigh impossible that prince can get through however major drummond be likely to see little fighting here while with king there will be incessant work for therefore by mean go to must have lost many of staff at kunersdorf will doubt not be glad to have with ride be shorter one than have be when going west for king lay little more than fifty mile to east of berlin although there be absolute occasion for great speed fergus rode fast on tenth day after leaving minden arrived at royal camp king be unaffectedly glad to see have be more fortunate than have said have be taking part in victory have be suffering defeat must like to have seen minden charge of countryman be superb nothing finer be ever done rash perhaps be by rashness that victory be often won have not be done one must have said that be impossible for six battalion in line to hurl back again again charge of ten thousand fine cavalry british division at fontenoy showed not many year ago that british infantry now be a good a be under marlborough must give much if have twenty thousand of here with prussian must be saving of did ferdinand send back did ask to come asked leave to come sire thought staff must have suffered heavily that might be more useful here than with duke much more useful major indeed be glad to have with have youth good spirit good spirit be very scarce here have heard last news have heard news since left berlin sire dresden be lost schmettau surrendered that when relief be within ten mile of place must have held out for month at least be incredible however will have back again before long at rate be one place le to guard must not have cared so much if austrian have taken that wretched confederate army even though have ten austrian battalion with must have snatched from be heart breaking however have capital will take time before can do more fink who have be sent off with six seven men to aid wunsch to relieve dresden on day before news of fall came did much fellow commander failed in first object be not idle for recaptured leipzig other town that confederate army have taken snatched saxony save dresden from clutch schmettau be relieved of command never again employed have certainly failed in firmness frederick own letter to have never be cancelled afforded strongest ground of believing that there be chance of being relieved record up to time have be excellent be esteemed a being one of frederick best general frederick harshness to be at time considered to have be excessive king however always expected from general a much a must have accomplished in same circumstance failure to obtain success be always punished after dismissal of brother heir from command king be not likely to forgive failure in others time be most anxious one for have nothing to do to wait for once be well content to do so for day brought winter nearer week must render victualling of hostile army more difficult delay be therefore in favour messenger after messenger be sent to prince henry urging to make possible effort to make way through round cordon of austrian russian post eighty mile long fifty sixty broad intervened between in evening king be accustomed to put aside resolutely military trouble passed time chiefly in society of british ambassador earl marischal keith young scottish aide de camp with occasionally one two prussian officer one evening when fergus have be sent with order to portion of force lying mile away sir john mitchell said to king have be talking with earl marischal over young drummond affair majesty a know father estate be sequestrated after battle of culloden where fell be writing despatch to pitt saying that drummond son have be serving under majesty through war have greatly distinguished have asked to annul sequestration upon ground that young officer have done very valiant service to majesty so to allied cause giving list of battle at have be present saying that duke of brunswick have in report of battle of minden to spoken highly of service rendered if must add line in own hand endorsing request must greatly add to weight will readily do king said will write short letter can inclose in own despatch sitting down at once wrote king of prussia most warmly endorses request of excellency sir john mitchell not only have major fergus drummond shown exceptional bravery upon several occasion resulted in promotion to rank of major with unprecedented rapidity saved king life at battle of zorndorf meeting overthrowing three russian cavalryman who attacked must therefore give king very great satisfaction if english minister must grant request made on major drummond behalf by excellency english ambassador thank very much latter said a read note frederick handed have doubt that will be effectual culloden be now thing of past there be many scottish regiment in english king service many act of clemency have of late be shown to who took part in rebellion can not doubt that pitt will at once act upon request however will say nothing to drummond on subject until hear that father estate have be restored to a day after day passed king became more anxious a to position of prince henry energetic officer have indeed be busy by threatening attack upon daun magazine have compelled austrian commander to move to bautzen for protection finally to make decided effort to crush active annoying foe gathering great force in neighbourhood of prince henry camp prepared to attack on morning of september nd when morning came prince henry have disappeared at eight o'clock on previous evening have marched twenty mile to rothenburg retreat be superbly conducted be necessary to move by several road whole of baggage artillery troop arrived punctually next morning at rothenburg just at hour when daun army moved down to attack of camp where have be evening before austrian scouting party be sent out in direction certain news must be obtained a to direction of prussian march baggage waggon have be seen moving here there be four day before daun be able to learn for certain what have become of having until then believed that must have made for glogau to join frederick henry have however gone in entirely different direction after ordering three hour rest at rothenburg marched west arrived at early morning at klitten eighteen mile from last halting place starting again after three hour halt marched twenty mile farther still straight to west fell upon general weyler who with thirty three thousand men occupied last austrian position to be passed that officer have not slightest idea of possibility of attack from east whole austrian army stood between frederick on northeast prince henry on southeast be therefore taken altogether by surprise six hundred of men be killed with twenty eight field officer seventeen hundred eighty five other officer men taken prisoner march of fifty hour in army with whole of baggage traversed fifty eight mile through country occupied by enemy be one of most remarkable on record completely changed whole situation of campaign there be nothing for daun to do if must not lose dresden whole of saxony again to follow prince henry movement completed dissatisfaction of russian ally soltikoff who have be already sorely worried harassed by frederick ever since daun have moved away to defend magazine crush prince henry now seeing that own food supply be likely to fail marched away with army into poland king be at time to disgust indignation laid up for six week with gout a soon a be better set off to join prince henry daun be slowly falling back have be let alone dresden might have be recaptured campaign come to triumphant ending unfortunately frederick be not content to leave well alone sent fink with seventeen thousand men to maxim to cut off daun retreat into bohemia intending to attack in front daun for once acted with decision attacked fink with twenty seven thousand men although prussian fought with most obstinate bravery be surrounded battered by austrian artillery while having gun with to make reply be forced to surrender have already made way off in killed wounded prisoner loss be fully twelve thousand men frederick threw blame upon fink most unjustly that officer have followed out order given have done man must do to hold position that be commanded to take up disaster be wholly due to frederick own rashness in placing so small force that without artillery where must be attacked by whole austrian army fink after release at conclusion of peace three year later be tried by court martial sentenced to year imprisonment disaster entirely altered situation daun instead of continuing retreat to bavaria advanced to occupy saxony drove general dierocke across elbe taking fifteen hundred of men prisoner frederick however barred way farther six week later army went into winter quarter daun still holding dresden strip of country between bohemia rest of saxony being a far out of reach a ever last six week of campaign be terrible time for frederick have lived in little cottage in small town of freyburg even after army have settled down in cheerless quarter still made several attempt to drive austrian out having received reinforcement of ten thousand men from duke ferdinand effort be in vain ten thousand however on way to join king have struck heavy blow at one of bitterest enemy duke of wuertemberg who have twelve thousand of own men with one thousand cavalry at duke have ordered grand ball to be held great celebration of joy at news of austrian victory at maxim on very day on thing be to take place ferdinand men fell upon suddenly scattered army in direction took twelve hundred prisoner sent duke with such of troop a have escaped back to wuertemberg again subject who be largely protestant rejoicing hugely over discomfiture on day on maxim be fought admiral hawke with small squadron utterly defeated french fleet be to convey invading army to england france be getting a short of cash a prussia in november became necessary to declare temporary bankruptcy king setting example noble others possessing silver plate sent to mint to be coined into money so eager be king to take advantage of opening austrian might give for attack although so near dresden fergus be unable to carry out promise to count eulenfurst to pay visit for be kept constantly employed must not ask for leave early in april king sent for english ambassador be present earl marischal keith have gone away on mission have two piece of news for major king said pleasantly in first place be now getting on for two year since did that little service at zorndorf since then have ever be zealously at work others have gone up in rank be time that have step therefore from today be colonel man in army have better deserved promotion indeed ought to have have after returned from brunswick army where a duke despatch told have rendered excellent service so many officer of rank have fallen since then promotion have be rapid be high time that obtained step that so well deserve other piece of news be for sir john mitchell to tell for be to good office that be due very partially so majesty said ambassador be like enough that pitt must not have troubled to take action on recommendation only have not be that so strongly backed request that in fact became one from therefore be for to give news a please king said well then drummond excellency cousin marischal put head together excellency sent warm letter to english minister saying that have rendered such service to sovereign ally that prayed that sequestration of father estate must be annulled added memorandum saying that a have saved life at zorndorf rendered other valuable service must view a personal favour if request be granted thing must have be managed in couple of day in country in england seems that matter move more slowly excellency have only today received official intimation that affair have be completed that father estate have be restored to fergus be for moment completely overwhelmed have never thought for moment that estate must ever be restored sudden news following that of promotion completely overwhelmed be of mother rather than of that thought have be too young to feel keenly change in life that followed culloden although mother have borne revers bravely have never heard complaint even regret cross lip knew that thought that must never be chief of brave clansman that have longer natural leader protector be very bitter to majesty be too good excellency stopped know what must say king said kindly there be occasion to say have only paid of debt owe excellency thought gave well nigh a much pleasure a doe now be off to camp see sir john between have done what austrian russian have never managed between mean have shaken colonel drummond presence of mind there go along with have matter to talk over together fergus saluted almost mechanically bowed gratefully to mitchell then left room in whirl of emotion to be head of clan again be to vastly greater matter than to be colonel in even most renowned valiant army in europe of estate thought for moment little except that mother must now be able to give up petty economy straitened life to take up station have be hers until father death there be thought too that of countess thirza eulenfurst hitherto have resolutely put that from be not for soldier of fortune without penny beyond pay to aspire to hand of rich heiress be true that many scottish adventurer in foreign service have so married have seemed thing altogether beyond have rendered service to father have in consequence be most kind to have thought that must be only poor return for kindness for to aspire to daughter hand have put matter even more resolutely aside because once twice count have said thing might be construed a hint that must not regard such act a presumptuous have spoken not unapprovingly of marriage of lady of high rank to men who have rendered great service to country for have fought said that with such ample mean a thirza must posse there must be need for to seek for wealthy match for thirza have evinced lively pleasure whenever went to see deep regret when left while colour rose sometimes when came upon suddenly indication that be not altogether indifferent to have determined more resolutely to abstain from taking advantage of gratitude felt for service have rendered now seemed to that news have heard have somewhat changed position be no longer penniless soldier be true that drummond estate be a nothing by side of broad land owned by father at least now be in position of scottish gentleman of fair mean good standing who must dispense with wealth on part of bride have fair home comfort to offer to one in native land that have too obtained rank of colonel in prussian army by service in many desperate battle distinctly added to position thus in respect news that have received be in highest degree gratifying to chapter engaged on following day sir john mitchell handed to fergus official document respecting restoration of estate after taking copy of same fergus wrote long letter to mother

wonderful celerity do what will can not induce daun lacy to give battle though together be three to one against whenever approach simply shut up in impregnable place erect palisade battery hope that will dash against be not likely to do fergus found that frederick when marched have left behind force sufficient to check attempt that austrian garrison of dresden might make towards north at present

told last time be here will stop until terrible war be over king have be most kind gracious to to leave before struggle be over must feel to be act of desertion once sword be sheathed intend to return to scotland for must not care to remain in service when there be nought life in garrison to look forward to moreover strength of army must of course be largely diminished at once what must do afterwards know not perhaps might obtain commission in own army for there be always opportunity of seeing service in america india elsewhere under british flag more likely will at rate for time remain at home mother have other child be lonely life indeed for do not think of settling here what be there for to do count outside army must not turn merchant for must assuredly be bankrupt at end of first month must well turn cultivator when have land to dig now however future be determined for point have own troubled much have be decided without effort on part conversation be continued for little time count asking many question about fergus ancestral home scenery mode of life fergus noticed that thirza took part in conversation sat still looked thought pale day succeeded other quietly uneventfully fergus gained strength rapidly so that in middle of july began to feel that be again fit for service one evening be sitting alone in garden with count when latter said to remember conversation on first evening of coming here a to impossibility of doing anything did remain out here after leaving army there be one solution to did not allude many scottish irish soldier in country in france austria germany have married well why must not do same fergus be silent for minute then said yes count continued in service rose to rank of general a in case of cousin keith to of marshal might do same if remained in army count said be assuredly by far youngest colonel in be favourite of king might hope for anything be afraid count have too much of scottish feeling of independence must not therefore like to owe everything to wife feeling be creditable if not carried too far count said have position be most honourable one have made name famous in army where brave men be common posse quality of youth splendid physique wish to flatter face might win woman fancy there be none however placed who might not be proud of such son in law judge everyone by count fergus said slowly overrate quality forget fact that be after soldier of fortune then never thought of such thing fergus be silent for minute then said may think of many thing count that know in heart be fancy will never be realized let suppose case count said let take case like mine did inestimable service certainly saved life life of several others including perhaps of wife daughter latter have constantly heard name associated with deed of valour must be improbable that must feel depth of gratitude must a grew increase into warmer feeling while on part might entertain liking for must be such out of way thing for to come to ask hand out of way thing must gladly give to may not seem so to count fergus said quietly have seemed so to understand what be so generously saying even with such encouragement can scarce dare to ask what seems to so presumptuous question for four year now house have be a home to be natural that a daughter grew up must have grown to love have told hundred of time that must be indeed base return for kindness be to try to steal heart never have said single word to must not have said aloud have mother be present during month have be here now have struggled hard with thrown with a have be for hour day have made up mind that word must ever pas lip if have done so now be because have drawn from be glad have done so count said gravely for last two year have hoped that might be so for in other way must repay debt of gratitude to can not tell what thirza thought be there have be three suitor for hand year of whom might well in point of mean character have be considered suitable when spoke to laughed at idea though said nothing gathered that love be already given a only child happiness be first consideration a to question of mean be absurd to mention for did marry wealthiest noble must desire more than will have told first time came to after terrible night that must always regard a one of have done so can assure that mother desire nothing better for for sake be glad that have come into scottish estate for own care nothing for indeed be in one respect sorry for will naturally wish that for part of time year must reside there with now have not be so dreadful have not in way count thank with heart for kindness feeling for daughter have grown up gradually be not until be last here that recognized how much cared for then when went away resolved must be better for not to return at rate not to stay here again until heard that be married be true that talked of paying visit even be dresden captured knew that when time came must be able to find excuse for not doing so during time be laid up with fever be ever in mind necessity for remaining away from here only impressed more more strongly upon then appeared carried off must not refuse to come without giving reason fully determined that in way by look word must allow to see regarded other than a daughter of kind host have have hard fight to keep resolution for day feeling have grown stronger stronger have resolved that before left must own to not presumption for have not presumed weakness ask to press more to come here until daughter be married have acted just a must have expected from drummond great hope of countess have be to see thirza happily married fortune position in suitor have be altogether immaterial point excepting that must assure that be not to obtain that hand be sought from first have regarded not only with gratitude with deep interest seemed to only natural that after so strange romantic beginning to acquaintance thirza must regard with more than ordinary interest to must be sort of hero of romance watched closely then found that in addition to bravery possessed quality that must desire be modest frank natural so far from making much of service have rendered be always unwilling to speak of when must not be avoided made a little of a possible spoke several time of to marshal keith said that regarded almost a son spoke in highest term of saw fancied saw in pleasure thirza betrayed when returned after of absence in anxiety evinced when battle have taken place until must ascertain that name be not among list of killed wounded that what have thought likely be taking place that regarded with interest beyond must be excited by gratitude only a to thought on subject knew nothing never saw anything in manner to showed that heart be affected chatted with a freely naturally a to even since have be here time have observed change in yet seemed to well nigh impossible that young soldier must be thrown so much with girl who though be father who say so be exceptionally pretty of charming manner continue to regard with indifference unless indeed loved elsewhere be sure in case must hardly be have however like determined to speak on matter before left a have not felt towards a hoped countess agreed that must be better for sake that must not press to come to stay with again until be married be truly glad that matter stand a have hoped can only repeat that there be one to whom must intrust happiness so confidently a to will do best to justify confidence count fergus said warmly now will go into house tell wife then can acquaint thirza be custom here at least among people of rank for parent first to acquaint daughter with proposal have be made for hand of wish on subject parental control be not carried to point now that used to be maiden sometimes entertain different opinion to of parent happily in present case there be reason to fear thirza will exhibit contumacy fortunately be alone at dinner today therefore do come down quarter of hour before usual hour will get matter formally settled when fergus went into drawing room count be already there thirza show unwillingness to carry out command in matter said with smile a held out hand to fergus shook very heartily pointed out to that must naturally expect to accompany year to scotland to spend month among people there did not seem to consider that insupportable objection in one respect fergus think that be well for that be comparatively young man being now forty four while countess be six year younger thus may be good many year before will be called upon to assume control of estate position of one of great landowner of saxony one of estate will of course be thirza dowry at once will not tie so much will be freer to come go a plea two three minute later door opened countess entered leading thirza by hand girl advanced with downcast eye until father stepped forward took left hand while held right of fergus daughter said mother have chosen for husband colonel fergus drummond consider match to be in way suitable one esteem highly be convinced that will make happy loving a say tenderly truly in room where first saw need not recall to service rendered to exhort to obey order to be true loving spouse to girl looked up now that will father mother most willingly will always to life end be true loving wife to illustration take drummond have won bride fairly well take colonel count said putting hand into of fergus have won bride fairly well know that will be worthy husband to swear to be fergus said a stooped kissed feel how great be boon that have given will to life end be deeply thankful to for confidence have placed in in thus intrusting to care to thirza do swear to be loving husband to end of life now count said will leave young people till bell ring taking countess hand led into next room ten minute passed before signal for dinner be given sufficed to do much to lessen awkwardness of occasion fergus be heartily grateful to count for having left to for short time dinner passed off a usual count chatting gaily while fergus attempted with indifferent success to follow thirza be very silent cheek be flushed eye radiant with happiness did not escape attention of servant who waited that instead of a usual leading down countess while count brought down daughter time count wife have come down first followed by fergus young countess be slow to notice thirza flushed face count household have be deeply interested in visit of fergus woman have always be unanimous in opinion that must have be murdered by marauder have not be for interposition have also agreed that most proper thing in world after what have happened must be that young countess must someday marry brave young officer time that have come during last four year have watched hoped that must hear that be coming about hitherto have be terribly disappointed have almost agreed that if nothing came of long visit nothing must ever come of news therefore brought down by manservant excited lively interest said along that must be so day one of woman exclaimed countess must never have allowed young lady to be out in garden afternoon if count have not be willing that there must be match be sure see how must help falling in love with young countess with woman added be pleasantest looking young gentleman have ever seen know that be one of bravest though be prussian officer there be not bit of stiffness about well only hope be true must not count on too much one of older woman said never can take menfolks opinion on such matter be sure of must know with

thousand have followed lacy with speed managed to throw into berlin before twenty thousand russian arrived there be now fourteen thousand prussian in city thirty five thousand russian austrian outside odds be too great negotiation be therefore begun with russian general tottleben berlin agreed to pay one million half thalers in debased coin now served a medium of circulation lacy be furious when russian marched in men behaved so badly that russian have two three time to fire upon saxon austrian party sacked potsdam other palace in neighbourhood russian behaved admirably so thing went on until on october th came news that frederick be coming lacy at once marched off with speed towards torgau while tottleben russian made for frankfort on oder cossack committing terrible depredation on march king halted when heard that berlin have be evacuated be deeply grieved mortified that capital must have be in hand of invader even for three day own loss from sacking of potsdam other palace be very heavy however paid ransom from own pocket bitterly determined to get even with enemy before winter came on while hulsen be away confederate army have captured stronghold in saxony daun have a usual advanced with sixty thousand men intended to winter in saxony before must get there frederick have dashed south recaptured wittenberg leipzig crossed elbe driven scattered corp of confederate army before prince eugene have also hurried that way defeated brother reigning duke of wuertemberg daun moved with intention of aiding confederate army before must reach hulsen have driven across mountain range into bohemia fell back towards torgau long before fergus have received reply from mother to letter announcing glad news of restoration of estate will be doubly dear to said a having be won back by own exertion bravery four year have be anxious time indeed for fergus thought that be restored to own a result of what have done make up for quite see that a long a war continues can not with honour leave king can not think that war will go on very much longer can wait patiently for end fergus be not quite sure that end will be that will quietly settle down in glen mother eye be sharp seems to that young countess near dresden be very conspicuous figure in letter during four year that have be out have not mentioned name of lady mother always speak of going back there a if be german home be natural enough after service that have rendered still 't be strange that must apparently have made acquaintance of other lady think that have written single letter since have be away in have not said something about saxon count family however even if must be so fergus must not be discontented be only natural that must sooner later marry although must rather that have be into scotch family be for to choose not be grateful already very grateful for kindness family have shown be quite inclined to love pretty young countess if on part be inclined to love think must have said so quite a heartily before received last letter for have great fear that might marry settle down altogether in germany now that estate be yours be head of clan feel sure that will at rate spend part of time among own people second letter reached fergus at beginning of october in answer to from camp in front of dresden in middle of july have be delayed much on way owing to rapid march of army until have shaken free from pursuer after battle of liegnitz began congratulate dear fergus congratulate with heart if there be just shadow of regret that must not have married settled here entirely be small regret in proportion to pleasure feel be not even reasonable for when consented to going abroad to take service in prussia knew that must probably end in settling down there altogether for be hardly likely that must win fortune must admit of coming back to live here of course have estate at time be restored to must probably not have gone at if have done so must have be to stay for few year see service under cousin keith then return to live among own people a be there be reason why must greatly wish to return to scotland where be landless with avenue open to employment however what tell that count countess be willing that must spend month here year be far better than must have expected even hoped a may imagine quite reconciles to thought of marrying abroad in other respect nothing must be more satisfactory than what tell promised wife must be charming young lady father mother kindest of people of course worldly prospect will be vastly beyond anything that even wildest dream have ever pictured for in respect care for be at end will be delightful indeed to look forward to homecoming year consider in way fortunate woman be sure that will come to love thirza very dearly only question be when be first visit to take place everyone say that doe not seem that war can go on very much longer wonderful a king resistance to so many enemy have be can not continue however from what say of determination spirit of people can not think that end can be so near a people think have be saying nearly same thing for last three year yet though everything seemed a dark a possible always extricated somehow from difficulty besides enemy must at last get tired of war in so far have have more defeat than victory have lavished such enormous sum of money france have already impoverished russia austria must feel strain too in church here prayer be offered for success of champion of protestantism be sure that if have sent scottish officer a gustavus adolphus did to raise troop in scotland must have obtained forty fifty thousand men in very few week so excited be everyone over struggle must be surprised what number of people have called upon to congratulate upon rising to be colonel in frederick army people have never seen before can assure that never felt so important person even before evil day of culloden when come back whole countryside will flock to give welcome letter be great comfort to fergus that mother must rejoice at good fortune knew feared that marriage with german lady rank must be sore disappointment to not so much perhaps for own sake a for of clansman english ambassador be no longer with army at fierce fight of liegnitz have be with frederick have passed night in carriage be jammed up among baggage wagon have be unable to extricate to discover how battle be going on several time austrian cavalry have fallen upon baggage have with great difficulty be beaten off by guard discomfort of time anxiety through have gone so unhinged that be unable to follow frederick rapid movement throughout rest of campaign fergus have confided to earl marischal keith later engagement to count eulenfurst daughter be lucky young dog fergus said brother came abroad too late for young countess to fall in love with there be nothing like taking young to business of soldiering abroad bravery be excellent in way youth bravery combined with good look be irresistible to female mind be heartily glad that one of kin must have won something more than six foot of earth by sword count eulenfurst be one of few men everyone speaks well of there be man in saxony who stand higher in other country must have be leading statesman of time wretched king still more wretched minister held in disfavour who opposed wanton extravagance dangerous plan be honour indeed to be connected with family putting aside question of money indeed in respect nothing must be more satisfactory daughter be sole heiress of wide estate a husband will have splendid position be very glad lad that count have objection to passing portion of time in scotland say know that much a scotchman boast of love of country be always ready to leave to better that be very seldom ever return to such be unhappily case with brother such will probably be case with be glad that will be exception that will still keep up connection with old home hope lad that will have more than one son first of course will make saxony home bring up second a scotchman send home to be educated let succeed in glen if have family instinct for fighting let go into british army can go into better let people have one who will be own laird whose interest will be identified with own fergus smiled at old man earnestness be rather looking ahead sir said however be certainly what must like to do if a say have more than one son will certainly give second training suggest make scotchman of certainly if have fighting instinct will see that will have more opportunity of active service in british army than must have in of saxony have be proved unable to stand alone can only act a small ally to prussia austria even putting aside nationality must rather be fighting under clive in india than in service in world even in of prussia be right lad since day of marlborough people have begun to think that british be no longer fighting people way in have wrested canada from french achieved marvel in india to say nothing of conduct of infantry at minden show that quality of race be unchanged day will astonish world again a have done several time in history king soon heard news from earl one evening said to fergus so a earl marischal tell have found time colonel drummond for love making thought that day went to express regret for outrage have be committed at count eulenfurst that must make pretty romance if young lady who received must take fancy to be not altogether unlikely after gallant manner in have saved from rascal of mine when told at dresden that have be nursing idea again occurred to well be glad have done so well for a king rejoice one who have fought so bravely must obtain meet reward a one who dabbles in poetry romance of thing be very pleasant to be not to lose service hope sire so long a war go on will continue to serve majesty to best of power king nodded be what must have expected from one of marshal keith relation said be not everyone who must care to go on leading dog life when pretty well endowed bride be awaiting however can not last much longer crisis must come ere long if can defeat daun may be put off for time if be beaten see can struggle longer against fate with berlin already in hand with country denuded of men almost exhausted in mean with russian austrian army already planted on prussian soil can do more if lose great battle must hope that will not be so sire spirit of soldier be a high a ever now that will be fighting nearly within sight of home can be trusted to achieve almost impossibility men be good men king said if have keith schwerin by side must feel more hopeful be gone there be none to fill place brother henry be good soldier be over cautious seidlitz have not recovered from wound hulsen have done well of late have shown wonderful energy considering that be old man there be none of who be at once prudent when behoved to be prudent quick to strike when see opening like schwerin keith ziethen be splendid cavalry officer be fit to command cavalry only whole burden fall upon shoulder be getting too old to bear so heavy weight trust sire that will not have to bear burden much longer just at present russia austria be doubtless encouraged by success strain must be heavy on also defeat might well cause to doubt whether be worthwhile to continue to make sacrifice produce such small result heaven grant that may be so king said earnestly god know that never wanted war that from day began have eagerly grasped chance presented of making peace short of dismemberment of kingdom must at moment willingly accede to term however onerous in order to secure peace for country chapter torgau after many march quick blow at confederate army driving beyond border of saxony frederick moved towards torgau where daun have established in position that deemed impregnable have be prince henry camp during previous autumn daun have in vain beleaguered hulsen have made headquarters during summer torgau be old fashioned town surrounded by tract of pine wood with pleasant village much well cultivated land town rose above elbe on shoulder of broad eminence called siptitz height stand nearly mile from river on western southern side of town be series of lake quagmire remains of old course of elbe set on siptitz height be daun camp girt about by intrenchment hill be mostly covered with vineyard height be two hundred foot above general level of country area five six square mile covered a flank be by height wood pond morass position be extremely strong one so much so that daun have not ventured to attack prince henry though in vastly superior force still more difficult be for frederick to do so when held by army greatly superior to own for austrian force numbered sixty five thousand while king after being joined by detachment have forty four thousand nothing indeed most urgent necessity must have driven king to attempt so difficult enterprise map battle of torgau plan be to attack simultaneously in front rear to do decided that force under ziethen must attack siptitz hill on south side while with other half be to make long detour assault at same moment on north frederick march be fifteen mile in length while ziethen have six to traverse a route be through forest difficulty in way of two column arriving at point of attack simultaneously be great indeed be increased by fact that weather be wet ground heavy stream swollen king force marched in three column by road through forest there be village here one to question a to turn branching of road thus adding to chance even frederick force must not arrive together at point of attack frederick own column contained eight thousand grenadier foot guard with force of cavalry line of march be by road nearest to daun position two other column hulsen composed principally of infantry holstein chiefly of cavalry marched on parallel road on wider circle baggage in column by outside daun have news of frederick approach have strong detachment watching in wood scout of one of party brought in news of king march signal cannon be fired immediately daun learned thereby of movement to attack from north daun at once wheeled round portion of force to receive frederick attack lacy with twenty thousand men have be placed a advanced guard now shifted position westward to guard what have become daun rear while two hundred fresh cannon be added to two hundred already placed to defend face threatened by frederick for hour before king arrived at point of attack heavy artillery fire have be heard from ziethen side be supposed that have already delivered attack unfortunately have not done so have calculated pace accurately have come upon small austrian force like frederick have encountered have for time held ground have replied to fire with cannon ziethen not knowing how small force be drew up in order of battle drove back on lacy far to east of proper place of attack here became engaged with lacy cannonade be kept up for hour precious time must have be spent in ascending hill giving aid to king when frederick column emerged from wood there be sign of hulsen holstein division king sent out staff to hurry up reconnoitred ground questioned peasant ground proved so boggy a to be impassable frederick withdrew into wood again in order to attack austrian left have in prince henry time be defended by strong abattis since cold weather set in much of have be used by austrian a firewood must therefore be penetrated frederick waited impatiently must hear heavy cannonade on ziethen feared that general must be crushed before must perform part of plan arranged staff be unable to find holstein cavalry have taken wrong turning at point be completely lost hulsen be still far away nevertheless in desire to give support to ziethen king decided upon attack with own column alone grenadier be placed in front line rest of infantry in centre cavalry strong followed to do service chance might afford took time to bring troop into new position while be being done daun opened fire with four hundred cannon upon forest through be marching with din frederick declared exceeded anything that ever heard before small force of artillery took place outside wood to cover attack a soon a few shot be fired austrian gun opened upon be silenced frederick place be between two line of grenadier issued from wood within eight hundred yard of prince henry abattis with marvellous bravery ran forward mowed down in line by storm of cannon shot suffered terribly one regiment be almost entirely destroyed other pressed forward a far a abattis fighting so desperately that daun be obliged to bring up large reinforcement before must drive survivor back austrian believing that victory be won charged down in pursuit second line met firmly drove back following hotly again reached abattis only retreated slowly before overwhelming force austrian then brought up battle have lasted only hour half frederick column be already killed wounded shortly after have retired hulsen column came up four hundred gun have never ceased pouring iron rain into forest newcomer arrived in splendid order remnant of frederick column joined furious at defeat burning to meet enemy again so stern resolute be attack that for time carried before daun line of defence be broken most of cannon silenced for time prussian advanced carrying before have ziethen be doing part instead of idly cannonading lacy battle must have be won inactivity enabled daun to bring up force against king hurled at prussian foot by foot drove back pushed down hill again frederick have be struck from horse by piece of case shot fortunately almost spent failed to penetrate thick pelisse be badly contused for short time insensible quickly sprung to foot again mounted horse maintained place in fight a if nothing have happened after second repulse again formed up troop at moment be joined by holstein with cavalry sun have already set darkness favoured attack daun have not yet recovered from terrible confusion into troop be thrown by attack prussian again mounted hill holstein attacking daun right wing main body of cavalry found morass obstacle so impracticable that be unable to attack a arranged two regiment succeeded in gaining plateau one of dashed upon austrian infantry met broke into fragment took two whole regiment prisoner brought six gun triumphantly off other regiment charged four austrian battalion broke brought greater portion off prisoner night fell upon scene of general confusion two army be completely mixed up in place austrian be in rear of prussian in others prussian in rear of austrian nothing more must to be done so far frederick have gained success thanks to extraordinary bravery determination of soldier have broken up daun line planted on plateau have suffered terribly in doing so must hardly hope in morning to make head against vastly superior force of austrian daun have be wounded in foot have gone down to town to have dressed have be able to remain on field late a be might have be able to restore order to continue battle a be gradually firing ceased exhausted by long march desperate effort have made prussian wrapped in cloak lay down to sleep where stood if sleep must on so bitterly cold night on hilltop there be wood to be have in forest great fire be lighted round prussian austrian straggler alike gathered in morning must be foe again for tonight be content to lay quarrel aside none knowing who be victor who vanquished in morning must be prisoner to others king now that excitement be over felt pain of wound descended hill took up quarter in church at little village of elsnig where house be full of wounded have left charge of endeavouring to reform scattered troop must do little way in vain did general officer move about with order expostulation threat for once prussian soldier be deaf to word of command have done that must do nature triumphed over long habit of obedience even sound of cannon musketry on other side of hill fell dead upon ear ziethen have be cannonading day nothing have come of nothing must come of still hulsen did good deal by six o'clock have got of cavalry infantry battalion in fair order on extreme right where in morning daun left flank stood ziethen ordinarily brilliant active man have be strange failure day not even terrible din of king battle have roused to take measure to support even to make diversion in favour in vain mollendorf active enterprising general have implored to attempt something if only to draw off portion of austrian strength from king saldern general have fruitlessly added voice to of mollendorf feeling of deep gloom spread through army feeling that king have be deserted must have be crushed just a on other side felt certain that serious misfortune must have happened to ziethen at last a darkness began to set in at four o'clock ziethen be persuaded to move marched towards left to point where must have attacked in morning have passed in hot pursuit of small austrian force first sent saldern against village of siptitz burning with repressed impatience saldern infantry went at enemy with rush captured battery there drove austrian out latter fired bridge so that for present farther advance be barred to prussian fortunately at moment mollendorf more to west came upon road by ziethen must have marched be carried firmly over marsh ground by bridge over stream between two of pond seizing pas over morass mollendorf sent to ziethen who roused at last ordered force to hurry there austrian have now taken alarm hurried to oppose passage mollendorf have already many troop across bridge maintained till be sufficiently reinforced to push forward for hour half desperate fight raged prussian gained little ground while austrian be constantly being reinforced from lacy command on left hulsen however just a have got portion of infantry cavalry into sort of order have marked sudden increase of cannonade on other side of hill presently seeing glow of great fire guessed that must come from village of siptitz then came furious cannonade continuous roar of musketry that spoke of battle in earnest ziethen then be coming at last old general determined to help own riding horse have be killed have be sorely bruised by fall sending for cannon got astride of called up infantry round brigade of general lestwitz begged drummer to strike up prussian march through blackness of night started for point where din of battle be going on unceasingly forgotten now be fatigue of day prussian pressed on with quick stride excitement growing higher higher a neared scene of action breaking out into roar of cheering a sweeping round on side of hill joined ziethen hardly pressed troop rushed upon enemy though news of coming cheered line to fresh exertion not yet be combat finished whole of lacy command be opposed to swelled by reinforcement sent down from above by o'donnel who in daun absence be in command be hour before foe gave way prussian pressed steadily up hill until at nine o'clock be planted on top of siptitz hill on highest point of plateau whence cannon commanded whole ground down to torgau daun conscious of danger have a heard of ziethen advance sent order after order that must at cost be driven back even when prussian gained position have still to struggle fiercely for hour to hold daun knew that with frederick established on one side of position with ziethen well planted upon other commanding whole of with gun there be nothing for to retreat already have sent order that strong force must form in order of battle to repel attack close to suburb of torgau a soon a disposition be effected ordered retreat to commence fortunately have four bridge across river have on previous day taken precaution of sending whole of baggage wagon over on occasion of kind daun disposition be always admirable drew off army across river in excellent order prussian army knowing nothing of what be going on other half being too exhausted to attempt to interfere ignorant a be of position state of frederick division have king known earlier what be taking place comparatively few of austrian army must have got across river be not until long after battle be done that frederick sitting depressed heavy hearted dictating despatch in little church seven eight mile away learned that what have seemed likely to terminate in terrible disaster have ended with decisive victory daun lost in battle twelve thousand killed wounded eight thousand prisoner forty five cannon while prussian lost between thirteen fourteen thousand of whom four thousand be prisoner be not until nearly one o'clock in morning that ziethen learned that austrian be already across river then pushed down into torgau crossed town bridge in time to capture twenty six pontoon daun retreated by right side of river lacy by left two force rejoined at dresden took up position a usual in plauen stronghold while frederick after finishing clearance of saxony save capital took up winter quarter at leipzig on th of december result of battle of torgau be not to be measured by respective loss of two army have effect of entirely undoing advantage that austrian have gained throughout campaign left king in better position than when opened in spring russian army have be attacked beaten while austrian be shut up in natural stronghold near dresden whole of saxony have be recovered silesia with exception of one two fortress be still in frederick hand how light hearted king felt after

much worse will indeed be relief to for since heard of desperate fight at torgau how great be slaughter on side have be anxious indeed must have remained so for must have have little chance of seeing list of prussian killed wounded now do go into kitchen know there make comfortable will give order that will be well served then proceeded to room where thirza mother wore sitting former be pale have evidently be cry news have come said not very best yet by mean worst drummond be wounded severe wound not be confidently believed dangerous one thirza ran to father threw arm round neck burst into passion of tear did not attempt to check for little time now dear said at last must be brave wo be worthy of lover of yours there be one bad point about looked up in face anxiously smile reassured must prepare for being somewhat disfigured oh be nothing father nothing whatever to how be disfigured well dear have lost left arm at elbow thirza gave little cry of grief pity be sad father surely be disfigurement more than sabre scar on face 't be honour to brave soldier to have lost limb in battle still be glad that be left arm though have be right leg must have made difference in love for well be very glad thirza that love have not be tested so severely a confess that for part must much prefer having son in law who be able to walk about who must not have to be carried to altar here be letter to from be to say have be written at dictation for of course surgeon insist on lying perfectly quiet at present thirza tore open ran through content be just a say father make very light of writes a if be mere nothing handed letter to mother then turned to count be there anything can do father nothing whatever with wound a will have to lie perfectly still for time may be sure that a one of frederick personal staff will have attention possible be in town must hing a soon a be fit to be moved will be different will have plenty of time to talk over matter before for few month travelling will be dangerous frederick army be in neighbourhood again a daun lacy be in intrenchment behind plauen there be chance of again besieging dresden flying column will be over country a doubtless will croat road will be altogether unsafe for travelling doubt a soon a be able to be moved will be taken to frederick headquarters wherever may be established king will assuredly have hospital at torgau cleared a soon a can lest when have retired austrian might make dash at town next morning karl set out again bearing letter from count one from thirza be of much le formal character than have dictated to a told afterwards greatly assisted cure month after battle be pronounced fit to travel with large train of wagon filled with convalescent under strong escort be taken to leipzig where king have just established headquarters to wounded be to be sent a soon a must safely be moved here be established in comfortable quarter karl again carried letter to thirza ten day later count eulenfurst entered room here count exclaimed how kind of what journey to make through snow have be dragged hither count said with smile dragged hither count yes thirza insisted on coming to see mother declared that must accompany of course there be nothing for to do to set out also be here then count fergus exclaimed incredulously certainly be established at black eagle hotel must not bring here to house full of officer be well enough to walk to hotel yes indeed walked mile yesterday a karl be helping fergus into uniform asked how long be in coming here count did in day sent on relay of horse two day before a carriage be of course on runner snow in good order made quick work of man went on with horse rode with from last place where changed did most of journey sitting by coachman gave more room inside be more pleasant for also in few minute reached hotel count led fergus to door will find thirza alone there thought that have best see so at first hour later count countess entered room look very pale thin mother thirza said after countess have affectionately embraced fergus must hardly have expected to find fat rosy count laughed man doe not lose arm go about a if matter be not worth thinking of few week afterwards be certainly looking better than expected to find that empty sleeve be sad disfigurement though added slyly how can say so father thirza exclaimed indignantly think contrary feel quite proud of with well there be accounting for taste thirza if be satisfied have reason to be otherwise now drummond want to hear about liegnitz torgau for have only heard austrian account dresden illuminated over daun first despatch from torgau saying that prussian attack have be repulsed with tremendous slaughter complete victory gained next morning there came believe despatch be not published be not until heard that daun lacy be within few mile of town that knew that somehow other there have be mistake about matter mistake have not yet be cleared up at dresden defeat part of business can tell from personal observation victory only from what heard certainly when came to sens after surgeon have seen to wound have thought of anything disastrous defeat never did prussian fight more bravely more hopelessly have to mount steep ascent with four hundred cannon playing upon army more than three time number waiting at top to receive then proceeded to tell whole story of battle ziethen seems to have blundered terribly count said believe that be king opinion too ziethen defends action stoutly maintains that must never have succeeded in direct attack in broad daylight anyhow a matter came out all right in end king be too well satisfied to do more than grumble at other be hard fought battle too news of be relief to indeed count said seemed to everyone frederick be so completely caught in toil that must not hope to extricate a know in war have along held to be neutral considered that plot to overthrow frederick partition kingdom be scandalous one that king disgraced by joining in since time sympathy have become more more strongly with frederick be impossible not to admire manner in have defended moreover brutality with confederate austrian wherever army penetrated saxony treated protestant made one regard a champion of protestantism be wrong in forcing saxon to take service with in army after surrender at pirna tax exaction have for last three year weighed heavily on saxony can not blame for that be needful that must have money to carry on war a saxony have brought on must not blame that bore heavily upon then too thirza have for last two three year become perfect enthusiast for prussian whether be king gracious manner to herself from other cause can not say have certainly become ultra prussian now lunch must be ready look a if wanted drummond be sure thirza doe be too excited to eat supper when got here last night a for breakfast be altogether untouched doubt think drummond count eulenfurst said when called next morning that have done duty fairly to prussia how do mean count fergus replied somewhat puzzled by question mean that have served five campaign have be twice made prisoner be wounded at zorndorf nearly died of fever last winter now have lost arm at torgau so think that have fully done duty to king under whom took service must now retire with thoroughly clear conscience own idea be that war have quite spent strength france be practically bankrupt austria russia must be a tired of war a prussia last defeat of hope can not discourage two empress greatly hear from friend in vienna that in capital large city be becoming absolutely disgusted with war though may go on for while believe that fury be spent at rate think have earned right to think of a well a others certainly have nothing to gain by staying longer in service be thinking same last night count certainly one man more le will make difference to frederick thought that unless spoke of must let matter go on a be except thought of asking for three month leave to go home that must go home for few month be excellent plan drummond think must be better that when be there must be able to stay five six month if so inclined go to king tell frankly that feel that want rest quiet for time that have longer occasion in pecuniary way for remaining in army that want to get married good reason for resigning commission see have now sort of right to have voice in matter have narrow escape at torgau next time might not be so fortunate anxious a be for thirza happiness do think be high time that retired from service decides count have have quite enough of terrible work be prussian must owe first duty to country a long a war continued must feel bound to set aside private consideration to defend to last be not so first duty now be assuredly to thirza to to countess therefore will morning go to king ask to allow to resign commission do so drummond thought of saying a much to last year anxiety of terrible three four day after torgau decided if thought that honour be concerned in remaining longer in army must be last to advise to leave even for sake of daughter happiness a be not so have hesitation in urging to retire 't be good time for to leave now cousin earl marischal keith returned here three day ago will get to go with to king will say nothing to wife thirza about till see again drummond of course king can not refuse must like to take in good part a indeed doubt not that will have doubt that will too count may think absurd perhaps vain of indeed be of king be thinking rather than of myself during past three year have be good enough to treat with singular kindness have have trouble care must have broken down most men think that have be relief to to put aside care trouble for hour two of evening to talk to young fellow like on sort of matter just a doe to sir john mitchell cousin earl marischal have doubt of drummond quite understand feeling in matter still be selfish enough to think of feeling too a soon a count left fergus put on full uniform went to king quarter first saw earl marischal told errand be quite right old man said heartily have done more than enough fighting there be saying how long war may drag on told when first heard of engagement to young countess be glad indeed that be not always to remain soldier of fortune be sure that king will consider that have more than done duty by remaining in service for year after having so splendid prospect before frederick be disengaged at present will go over with to will myself open matter fergus have not seen king since arrival at leipzig be truly glad to see on foot again latter said a fergus followed cousin into room felt by mean sure must ever see again on day after torgau still look very thin pulled down want rest lad want rest be not of can get be what have come to speak to about majesty keith said told year ago that be engaged to be married to daughter of count eulenfurst king nodded remember bright little lady who received when went to father house same sire think that warning have at torgau be sufficient that having done best in majesty cause have now earned right to think of so must beg majesty to allow to resign commission to retire from service have certainly well earned right king said gravely have done right good loyal service even putting aside that business at zorndorf not least of service have be that have often cheered by talk when sorely needed cheering that empty sleeve of scar won at zorndorf be proof how well have done duty request now that fortune have smiled upon in other way be fair reasonable one hope colonel drummond went on in lighter tone a will be settled in saxony war can not go on for ever will someday see bride at berlin none will be more welcome be going home to scotland for few month in first place keith said be only right that must visit mother people there before settle here will like enough be back again before campaign open in spring fergus whose heart be very full said few word of thanks to king for kindness that have always shown for what have now said assured that must not only come to berlin a soon a peace be made that a long a war lasted must pay respect to year when be in winter quarter then withdrew made way to hotel be done said to count a entered have resigned commission king have accepted be most kind be glad have done yet be very hard thing to do thirza uttered exclamation of joy be glad indeed fergus that be not going to terrible war again can understand feeling drummond count said putting hand upon shoulder know that must have be wrench to will pas off in short time have done duty nobly have fairly earned rest now let talk of other thing when do think of starting for scotland to must reply fergus said with smile 'how long be thinking of stopping here ' assuredly will not want to be going a long a be here in case must like mother to have week notice before come home think in fortnight wound will be completely healed be thinking count said that will want to take nurse with do mean count fergus exclaimed eagerly that thirza must go with must be happiness indeed quite see why must not drummond there be church here clergyman what do say thirza oh girl said with greatly heightened colour must never be ready so soon a must mother know dear father be talking to hour ago about be what said answered that although might not be able to get great many clothes made there will be plenty of time to get thing from home that in respect must be much more convenient for to be married here than at dresden marriage with one who have so lately left service of prussia must hardly be popular one with austrian in dresden so that altogether plan must be convenient can set milliner to work at once in fortnight get bridal dress ready such thing a be absolutely necessary of course if must rather remain single for three four month father must not wish to press unduly be not that mother said shyly doe seem so very quick if thing be good sooner be done better count said thirza offered further objection next day order appeared that colonel fergus drummond have be advanced step in order of black eagle following came colonel fergus drummond having lost arm at battle of torgau have resigned commission have be accepted with great regret by king service of colonel drummond having be in highest degree meritorious
