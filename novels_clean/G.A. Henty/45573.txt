induced king of sardinia to offer rank of general in army that being grade that have held in monte video garibaldi refused with two hundred fifty volunteer started for venice be besieged by austrian on hearing however of rising in rome flight of pope who have now abandoned liberal profession have thrown into hand of austria garibaldi changed course rank being swollen a marched along arrived at rome at head of fifteen hundred men here met comrade in struggle at rio monte video during six year residence in rome captain percival have imbibed that hatred of austrian detestation of despotism under italian state groaned that be felt by with whom came in contact father in law professor forli being one of leader of liberal party in rome wife too be enthusiast in cause although felt sympathy with mazzini revolutionary party be even before arrival of garibaldi resolved to take up arm must rome be attacked presence of garibaldi still further confirmed resolution a soon a heard that french

europe at time when disclosure have be made respecting horrible dungeon into neapolitan suspected of entertaining liberal view be thrown be filling europe with horror change of front extinguished hope of who have imagined that pope must become centre of liberal thought in italy rendered people of papal dominion desperate vastly increased party of mazzini extreme republican on february th constituent assembly be held in rome republic be proclaimed garibaldi be appointed to defend frontier volunteer poured in from part of italy a king of sardinia have again taken up arm force be moving forward to support when news came of defeat at novara followed by abdication succession of victor emmanuel to throne austria naples spain be now eager to crush revolution in rome resolution of roman be unshaken still hoped to be able to maintain with a expected aid of france terrible blow have be inflicted on finding that french be coming a enemy instead of a friend did not shake determination although be now with courage of despair rather than of hope that prepared for conflict rome must fall at least must prove worthy of best tradition set example must not be lost upon people of italy anything felt must be better than reign of pope in close alliance with tyrant of naples evening after french landing saw rome tranquil grimly determined doubtless many of who be resolved to fight till last be buoyed up with hope that in case must be able to make escape when action be over rome covered great extent of ground french army be not of sufficient strength to form cordon round captain percival have fortnight before sent finished unfinished canvas most valuable belonging down to civita vecchia have shipped for england knew reckless destruction carried out by army after successful assault that possibly if came to street to street fighting considerable portion of city might be burnt professor have similarly sent away very valuable collection of coin book manuscript at nine o'clock went down to mansion that garibaldi occupied long discussion took place route be decided upon for various contingent to follow when alarm be given news have be brought in from time to time during day a to movement of french point at must probably assault be therefore now known must be at porta cavalleggieri at porta san pancrazio captain percival professor returned to former house where professor have taken up residence since wife have gone to leghorn sat talking until late hour be roused early next morning by ringing of great bell of cathedral be joined almost immediately by of other church in city captain percival have lain down fully dressed springing to foot buckled on sword placed brace of pistol in belt then ran down to porta san pancrazio where a knew garibaldi must take up post general indeed have not slept at fearful that french might attempt assault under cover of darkness kept watch round western wall along have posted men must most depend upon even before englishman joined roar of gun on wall told that french be already advancing be like old time comrade garibaldi said with strong grip of hand only be on larger scale than be accustomed to in south america oudinot be beginning with blunder for be making for porta cavalleggieri be flanked by wall of vatican be over confident imagine that expects anything like serious resistance think will certainly beat back there that then will attack here will go to other gate old comrade know indeed volunteer a have assisted to drill oudinot indeed have believed that force of regular troop have with must easily brush aside resistance of half armed mob captain percival hurried away volunteer be already gathered on wall in street townspeople be hurrying out armed with weapon of kind on roof at window of house woman be clustered thickly waving handkerchief scarf shouting word of encouragement applause to men to roar of cannon be now added rattle of musketry when reached gate found heavy column of volunteer drawn up there while behind be dense crowd of excited citizen from wall saw french advancing leading regiment be few hundred yard away be moving steadily forward apparently heedless of cannon thundered on flank face musketry must afford to despise for be beyond distance at accurate shooting be possible indeed firing be of wildest description a comparatively few of men have ever handled gun until few week previously captain percival went up to officer who be in command with whom be well acquainted although massive wall still stood gate have long since disappeared place being occupied simply by barrier where duty on provision good coming into city be collected men be clamouring to be let out said what do think captain percival must let go soon be full of dash enthusiasm at present must fight far better on offensive than must if be kept stationary must keep in hand till french be within seventy eighty yard of gate by time will be answering fire from wall even in front line whose musket be still loaded will only have time for one shot before men be upon must place three four hundred of steadiest men on wall here so that if sortie be repulsed can cover retreat by fire think be good advice other said will come down with tell that will go that must not move till give order that man be to fire until be within ten yard of enemy line be difficult to make voice heard above crack of musketry shout of excited crowd however word be passed from man to man so back among people behind now that knew that be to have way that critical movement be at hand shouting abated stern look of determination settled on face leonard percival joined group of officer who be at head of volunteer officer in command resumed place on wall a be important that if sortie be repulsed must lead men down oppose entrance of enemy until retiring force have rallied be not long before roll of musketry broke out showing that assailant be now returning fire of garibaldians on wall grew louder louder then when head of french column be eighty yard away officer on wall gave order volunteer followed by citizen poured out with mighty shout french halted for moment in surprise not having dreamt that defender of town must venture upon sallying out to attack then there be scattered fire of musketry most of barrel be already empty few of ball took effect without replying volunteer rushed forward opening out a ran to something like order when within ten yard of french bayonet man delivered fire then hurled upon broken rank struggle be short one weight impetuosity of attack supported a be by surging crowd of excited citizen be irresistible regiment broke fled hastily to shelter of troop following leaving ground strewn with dead wounded then bugle at gate rang out order to exulting crowd to retire officer threw in front of men with great difficulty checked pursuit caused to withdraw to original position behind wall chapter ii desperate defence after short halt french having re formed changed course marched along parallel to fortification captain percival have on returning from sortie joined officer on wall watched alternately movement of french scene in city be one of wild excitement men cheering shouting shaking other by hand placing hat on bayonet waving in answer to wild applause of woman on housetop however be not content at being called back instead of being allowed to complete what considered partial victory forgetting that must have be met in very different manner by troop in support who must have be prepared for attack must have reserved fire until last moment a soon a became evident that french intended to make next move against gate of san pancrazio greater portion of volunteer marched in direction captain percival accompanying have done well so far garibaldi said a joined now will be turn will have tougher work than have for will be prepared suppose loss be not heavy very trifling indeed there be three dead brought in there be ten twelve wounded be just sort of action to raise spirit of men be in humour for fighting will therefore lead out here can not hope to succeed with rush a did will be prepared for time best men must be killed before reached mass behind few of whom have gun must be simply massacred volunteer who have undergone rough sort of drill be assembled before french have concluded preparation for assault garibaldi appointed captain percival to take charge of gate having with two hundred of volunteer behind whom be armed citizen clamoured to go out a before garibaldi raised hand for silence then told that must not lead to useless massacre against army of well armed soldier duty said be to remain here if have to fall back will open to let pas will be ready to do share when necessary defence of gate will be for while entrusted to if enemy force entrance fall upon a must upon wild beast discipline arm must be of great advantage in hand to hand fight man must fight a must be protecting family from band of wolf hatchet pike must meet musket bayonet who have knife must dive among throng use fearlessly be great charge that entrust to go out to fight will guard city hold dear loud cheer showed that have struck right chord mob drew back a led out five thousand volunteer advanced to within musket shot of enemy then scattering took shelter behind house cottage wall ruin french cannon opened fire a movement be going on be answered by gun on wall a french advanced murderous fire be opened by hidden foe battle raged for several hour sometimes french advanced close up to position held by garibaldians a soon a did so be exposed also to fire from men on wall in spite of captain percival effort group of men made way down road joined firing line lying down until moment must come when must spring like wild cat upon french once twice when assailant pressed back garibaldians in spite of effort found presently opposed by crowd seemed to leap from ground who with wild shout rushed upon so furiously that recoiled almost panic struck before so unaccustomed enemy men be pulled down a garibaldi have given strict order french soldier must be killed except when fighting be carried back triumphantly into city at last general oudinot seeing that troop be making progress that even if must force way into city must suffer terribly in street fighting with such assailant gave order for men to retire did sullenly while roar of triumphant shouting rose from volunteer men on wall crowd covered house vantage ground from view of what be passing outside must be obtained italian loss be only about hundred men killed wounded whereas french lost three hundred killed wounded five hundred prisoner so unprepared be french general for resistance that have to undergo humiliation of sending in to garibaldi to ask to supply with surgeon to dress wound of french soldier during fighting french artillery have done far more injury to work of art in rome than have inflicted upon defender a artillery played principally upon dome of st peter vatican of building be much damaged joy caused in rome by victory be prodigious fire blazed that night on hill house be illuminated people thronged street shouting cheering have indeed much to be proud of five thousand almost undrilled volunteer have defeated seven thousand of best troop of france illustration walking up down room like caged lion french retired at once to palo on road to civita vecchia garibaldi gave troop few hour rest then moved out to attack french took up most advantageous position troop be flushed with victory while french be cowed dispirited be on point of attacking when general oudinot sent messenger to treat for armistice a proof of sincerity offered to give up ugo basso priest who have remained by side of wounded man when garibaldians have for moment retired garibaldi must peremptorily have refused request for be confident that must defeat capture whole of french mazzini however with two associate in triumvirate still clung to hope that french must aid determined to accept armistice fearing be whole french army destroyed national feeling must be so embittered that there must no longer be hope whatever of alliance garibaldi protested declaring that armistice must enable french reinforcement to arrive mazzini however persisted in decision actually released five hundred prisoner in exchange for priest folly of violent democrat sealed fate of rome have garibaldi be permitted to carry out plan french army must have be destroyed made prisoner to man enthusiasm that glorious victory must have excited throughout italy must have aroused whole population to burst bond furious at act of folly garibaldi troop re entered rome be greeted with enthusiasm by people disliking such ovation slipped away with captain percival to latter house professor forli have taken part in fighting outside wall stationing with troop manned have kept up vigorous fire whenever enemy be within gunshot after repulse of second attack have returned home stupidity of people be incredible garibaldi who have scarcely spoken word since have turned back towards rome burst out waving aside chair that professor offered walking up down room like caged lion held french in palm of hand have allowed to escape fortnight will have three time number to face know what result will be regard cause a lost thrown away by mazzini man who have never taken part in battle who kept shut up in capital when fighting be going on man of tongue not of action be too disgusting be republican if republic be to be in hand of men like will drive to become monarchist again carlo alberto be weak be at least man staked throne for cause when be lost retired mazzini stake nothing for have safe conduct if loses will set to to intrigue again careless who may fall what may come to italy if own wild idea can not prevail desire republic be republic that will manipulate well if must be must be statesman simply fighting man will fight till last failure must rest upon head of who have brought about be bad business captain percival said quietly thoroughly agree with garibaldi in say a know of old be not much given to word began thing will go through with think a do cause be lost blow strike will find echo in italy harvest will grow from seed day a to mazzini two companion be not surprised when stir up muddy water scum will at first rise to top so be in first throe of french revolution so be here mob orator schemer come to power there remain until overthrown by men of heart action after robespierre marat came napoleon great man whom acknowledge admire heartily enemy though be of england after mazzini italy may find great men know like cavour admire immensely be obliged to be prudent cautious now when time come will be regarded a champion of free italy from what have heard of young king victor emmanuel will be sovereign worthy of hope may prove so garibaldi said shortly at present prospect doe not seem to fair one professor will carry out plan when rome fall a fall doubtless will will if escape join wife at leghorn go establish in england have friend correspondent there have son in law who have promised home here must not stay be marked man day that pope enters in triumph must be consigned to dungeon under st angelo there must be difficulty in escaping garibaldi said with fifteen mile of wall must need fifty thousand men to surround french will want strength at point where attack be evident that time must elapse before there must be change in situation at rome mazzini be sending despatch to ledru rollin french assembly imploring to abstain from interference must lead to destruction of roman republic until must be acted upon on other hand fresh troop arrived from france matter must be at standstill in meantime danger threatened from quarter for king of naples be preparing to move with ten thousand men to reinstate pope force with twenty piece of cannon have advanced a far a albano three day after battle garibaldi told captain percival that be about to start that evening with four thousand men to meet neapolitan army asked to accompany troop will not be warned till hour before set out be important that whisper will reach enemy a to intention strength will be glad to go with englishman said after way men fought against french have doubt that will make short work of neapolitan however great odds against bomba be hated by own subject be hardly likely that will fight with zeal in cause be very different foe from french accordingly at eight o'clock on evening of may th captain percival mounted joined garibaldi staff rode to tivoli halting among ruin of adrian villa next morning scout be sent off towards albano returned in evening with news that neapolitan be still there showed sign of intention to advance news of defeat of french having doubt greatly quenched king ferdinand ardour on th garibaldians moved to palestrina general despatched body of men to drive back scattered party of neapolitan who be raiding country be done with little loss neapolitan in case retiring hastily when approached garibaldi have information that evening that order have be given for main body of enemy to advance attack on following day information proved correct before noon neapolitan force be seen approaching seven thousand strong garibaldi have cannon with having set out in lightest marching order distributed portion of force a skirmisher keeping rest in hand for decisive moment neapolitan artillery opened fire main body advanced in good order a soon a heavy fire be opened by skirmisher much confusion be observed in rank two other party be at once sent out taking advantage of cover soon joined in fray opening galling fire upon flank several time neapolitan attempted to advance urged on by officer skirmishing line in front be strengthened from reserve whenever did so until whole of garibaldians with exception of thousand of steadiest troop be engaged incessant fire be maintained against heavy rank of enemy whose artillery produced little effect against almost unseen foe for three hour conflict continued then a garibaldian reserve advanced confusion among enemy reached point at must no longer be controlled ferdinand army fled like flock of sheep garibaldi staff have exposed recklessly during fight riding about among troop encouraging warning not to be carried away by impetuosity into making attack until enemy be thoroughly shaken order issued for general charge heavy fire be maintained upon staff by neapolitan seemed to that garibaldi have charmed life for although several of staff fell continued to ride up down a if altogether oblivious of rain of bullet did not however escape unscathed being wounded in hand foot fugitive did not halt until have crossed frontier into neapolitan territory garibaldians remained for two three day at palestrina seeing that neapolitan showed sign of intention to advance again returned by rapid march to rome mazzini effort have be to extent successful french assembly declared that for france to aid in suppressing people determined to obtain freedom be altogether in contradiction with condition on republic have be instituted sent m de lesseps a envoy to rome napoleon however be of opinion that reverse to french arm must be wiped out on own authority despatched

advanced occupied palestrina roman army now ten thousand strong marched out on th garibaldi with two thousand men moved in advance although roselli be nominally in command of army be conscious of garibaldi greater ability deferred on point to opinion of man who be regarded by a being still commander in chief when within two mile of velletri garibaldi met strong column of neapolitan however after slight resistance took to flight shut up in town garibaldi sent back for reinforcement none arrived until too late in day for attack to be made in morning be found that enemy have evacuated

having given notice in spite of treaty agreed upon between m de lesseps on part of french assembly mazzini that must attack rome on monday june th oudinot be however guilty of act of gross treachery for relying upon intimation city be lulled into sense of security that attack must be made until day named whereas before daybreak on rd troop stole up took possession of building just outside gate of san pancrazio before roman troop must assemble captured porta molle after desperate resistance by few men who have gathered together on alarm being given firing be first intimation that rome received of treacherous manoeuvre of oudinot again church bell pealed out populace rushed to defend wall garibaldi felt that occupation by enemy of two great villa short distance from wall must enable to place

strongly reinforced from time to time in fighting of kind discipline of french soldier military knowledge of officer gave great advantage over italian who fought with desperate bravery without order community of effort essential in such struggle in vain did garibaldi colonel medici best of officer expose recklessly in endeavour to get men to attack in military order to concentrate effort at given point in vain did soldier show contempt for death beyond praise when night fell french still held possession of outpost have gained italian fell back within wall night garibaldi held council of war at captain percival be present latter colonel medici be strongly of opinion that renewal of fighting of day must be disastrous loss have already be very great have be proved that however valiantly fought volunteer be unable to wrest strong position held by superior force of well disciplined men for french army now numbered forty thousand while of defender be twelve thousand of more than half have joined within last three week series of such failure a have encountered must very quickly break spirit of young troop must precipitate end opinion prevailed be decided that for present must remain on defensive maintaining heavy cannonade from wall making occasional sortie to harass besieger in meantime bridge across tiber must be destroyed if possible mine must be driven to blow up battery must be erected by french under cover of position held tactic be followed out french engaged upon erection of battery be harassed by continuous cannonade sortie be frequently made be ere long abandoned loss suffered on occasion being so heavy that troop no longer fought with courage enthusiasm have so animated during first day fighting attempt to blow up bridge across river by mean of barge loaded with explosive failed none of defender possessed knowledge must have enabled to blow in centre of arch mine be equally unsuccessful a french countermined by letting in water formed streamlet ran into tiber filled italian work compelled defender to desist from labour nevertheless progress of siege be hindered although be certain that city if unaided must fall ere long mazzini still clung to hope that treaty made by lesseps carried by to paris must be recognised last hope be crushed by arrival of french envoy with declaration that french government disavowed participation in convention signed by m de lesseps even garibaldi now admitted that further resistance must only bring disaster upon city cause absolutely useless loss of life mazzini two colleague persisted in resolution to defend town to last even if french laid in ash even reproached garibaldi with cowardice on night of st french gained possession of san pancrazio gate having driven passage up to unnoticed by defender at once seized

villa palace in western part of city roselli proposed that whole defending force must join in attack on french battery to garibaldi must not consent on ground that must not be carried without immense loss that even if captured must not be held against force french must bring up to retake gradually assailant pushed way forward encountering determined resistance at capture of villa savorelli on evening of th fewer than four hundred of defender fell by bayonet wound showing how desperately have contested foot of advance on morning of th three heavy column of french advanced simultaneously carried barricade roman have erected garibaldi with most determined of men flung upon enemy for time desperation with fought arrested advance be last effort garibaldi sent to mazzini to say that further resistance be impossible be summoned before triumvirate there stated that unless be resolved to make rome second saragossa there be possible course to surrender in end triumvirate resigned issuing proclamation that republic gave up defence have become impossible assembly then appointed garibaldi a dictator opened negotiation with french so enthusiastic be citizen that in spite of disaster have befallen many be still in favour of erecting barricade in street defending house majority however acquiesced in garibaldi decision that further resistance must be crime since must only entail immense loss of life destruction of city for three day negotiation be carried on then garibaldi with four thousand men left city marched for tuscany while french occupied rome in tuscany patriot met with poor reception for people though favourable dared not receive french have followed in hot pursuit austrian in tuscany be on look out for at last exhausted starving took refuge in

to garibaldi latter warmly approved have done must be done comrade said must be worse than folly for to remain here throw away life must that countryman have fought a nobly for freedom a have done for cause be not yours have right to consider so having made rome home for year being married to daughter of roman however may again fight side by side for assuredly will not be last time that attempt will be made to drive out despot feel sure that italy will yet be free trust that mean to stay here until be too late to retire must remember that life be of greatest value to cause that be duty above

have be confined there have be denounced a calumny by neapolitan government coming from armed with authority of foreign office must not make profound impression might force authority to ameliorate

familiar to many must hardly have visited place without being recognised captain percival went to see several of signor forli old friend upon whom must almost certainly have called before going to estate from whom indeed must have received far more information a to condition than must have obtained by direct application to man who must not have regarded with hostility none of however have heard

dungeon to attic under roof also to hold conversation with prisoner have idea that must actually find professor great hope be that must learn from prisoner that have be confined there a must enable british government to demand instant release terrible a have be description have heard of treatment of prisoner state of jail fell far short of reality not only sent detailed report to government also to time published in full be copied into paper in kingdom created general feeling of indignation disgust failing to obtain smallest information a to professor at naples captain percival then went down to salerno left there with intention of visiting prison in calabria at reggio afterwards of crossing into sicily trying gaol there four day after left salerno servant have engaged in naples returned

to father have also loved professor who have always be extremely fond of be at home for easter when terrible news arrived mother grandmother expressed doubt that father have be murdered when news of confession of one of band discovery of captain percival belonging in hut of brigand arrived gave up hope of ever seeing again madame forli however while not doubting that captain percival have be killed believed that neapolitan government be at bottom of matter know what method of neapolitan be said sensation caused by leonard letter to paper here may have decided to put end by method to further revelation may very well have employed brigand to carry out purpose one know that in many case men be in alliance with officer of police latter be well paid to wink at doings even to furnish with information of person worth robbing to put on guard when a occasionally happens raid be made by carabinieri in mountain capture be hardly ever effected while there be little chance of political prisoner once shut up in dungeon making escape notorious brigand frequently succeed in doing so nobody dare to speak of suspicion there can be little doubt that prison official be bribed to connive at escape knowing well enough that government will not trouble over matter while on other hand escape of political prisoner brings disgrace punishment upon prison official can not think will not think so mother muriel exclaimed for be so same treatment might be given to have have doubt befallen father thousand time better that leonard must have be killed than that must drag out existence in such utter misery a have described a being lot of prisoner in dungeon of bomba brigand may have be set on by government be possible can believe that iniquitous government to be guilty of anything whether leonard be attacked merely for plunder for ransom by connivance of government can not will not doubt that be dead story of one of band can leave doubt of be confirmed by servant who saw fall never try to shake confidence in mother be almost more than must bear to think of father a confined in one of dungeon if thought for moment leonard must be there too believe must lose reason frank returned to

letter be addressed to dear father garibaldi being in caprera probably have little news of what be passing at naples have heard of father disappearance be apparently in ignorance of what have happened since took out letter read bey dear comrade friend 'when last wrote to be to condole with on disappearance of true patriot good friend professor forli hope that long ere have be restored to if a fear have fallen into clutch of rascally government of naples be afraid that will never hear of again several time when have written to have told that be prepared to join when again raised flag of italian independence though held aloof when france joined against austria did rightly for be betrayed by french a be at rome birthplace nice have be handed over to also said that must help with money a know money be one of chief requisite time have come be convinced that population of neapolitan territory be now reduced to such state of despair by tyranny of government that will be ready to hail a deliverer plan be be sure thousand so of men who fought with in alp will flock to standard with intend to effect landing in sicily if capture palermo messina think can rely upon being joined by small number of men there by volunteer from part of italy five thousand men in will be sufficient think at rate that number collected will cross to mainland march upon naples may think that adventure be desperate one be by mean opinion know how easily defeated neapolitan troop in believe that will do so still more easily now for certainly very many of must share in general hatred of tyrant come dear friend join meeting place be called villa spinola be few mile from genoa anticipate great interference from cavour will run with hare hunt with hound a proverb have dare not stop for be convinced that such be state of public opinion in italy that might cost master crown be to do so on other hand must be obliged to assume attitude of hostility must incur anger of austria of papacy possibly of france therefore think that will remain neutral although professing to do in power to prevent moving be promised assistance in money be sure that will fall short of need must buy arm not only for ourselves to arm who join must charter buy steamer to carry to sicily once there regard rest a certain come to with empty hand will receive heartiest welcome a dear friend comrade if can aid also with money not only italy will be grateful to know that need inducement for heart be wholly with more so from disappearance of madame father doubtless work of tyrant need say that first step in town fortress capture will be to release political prisoner confined there may be that among will find professor forli turr will be with baron stocco of calabria bixio tuckory madame carroli have written to tell that place three son at disposal in place of brave brother will moreover supply with money to utmost of power come then dear friend aid with arm counsel let again fight side by side in cause of liberty ' frank leapt to foot will let go in father place mother will not many of who will follow garibaldi will be older than probably not half so strong none can hate tyranny of naples more than do be cause for father grandfather fought now have greater wrong than have to avenge be what thought must say frank mother said sadly 't be hard indeed to part with son after having lost father husband father be italian patriot husband fought for italy in giving up give up yet will not say nay so fierce be indignation in england at horror of tyrant prison that doubt not many english will when hear of garibaldi landing in sicily go out to join if be ready in cause only of humanity to risk life surely can not grudge in cause not only of humanity of land of birth feel sure that father must have taken have be here frank said earnestly believe must frank know that shared to full father hatred of despot who grind italy under heel besides feeling animated one can not cherish hope that father may still be found alive in one of ghastly prison of course mother have talked matter over lament that study must be interrupted can be for few month only probably will be able to return to harrow when school meet again after long holiday so in fact will only lose three month so that make odds one way mother in case be not likely to be shining light in way of learning suppose not frank with fine estate awaiting there be occasion that must be though of course will go through oxford cambridge however need not think of now will be sending money mother certainly father put by certain sum year in order that might assist garibaldi when latter again raised flag of freedom in italy cause be sacred in eye at time left england fund amounted to l a never knew when summons from garibaldi might arrive transferred to name so that need not come back to england must rising occur before return so will not go empty handed will be splendid gift mother suppose will not go back to school before start frank since be to go on expedition sooner start better will write to headmaster tell be most reluctantly obliged to take away from school for few month that be matter of greatest importance that hope will retain name on book permit to return when come back to england if wo mother will not matter very much of course must like to go back again if wo let will only have to go to coach for year two be of little consequence mother agreed perhaps after going through exciting time will not yourself care about returning to school again must not look upon matter a mere adventure frank be very very perilous enterprise in life will be risked daily be differently situated must not have dreamt of allowing to go out have identified ourselves with cause of freedom in italy grandfather lost everything home country maybe life father living a did in rome married to daughter of italian felt a burning hatred for oppression saw everywhere round a did italian perhaps more so for being accustomed to freedom englishman enjoy thing appeared to good deal more monstrous than did to who have be used to life risked death score of time in defence of rome finally lost life while endeavouring to discover whether father be prisoner in one of tyrant dungeon thus although in other respect english boy italian only through grandfather have be constantly hearing of italy wrong on point feel a keenly strongly a son of italian patriot must do consider that be holy war in be about to take part war that if successful will open door of dungeon in thousand among whom may be father be lingering out life for other cause than that dared to think will free noble people who have for century be under yoke of foreigner therefore a if country be in danger must not baulk desire to enter army so now say to join garibaldi even must be taken from will at least have consolation of feeling that be in noble cause fell that sent knowing that happiness a well a life hung upon issue want to view matter then boy not in light of exciting adventure in spirit in crusader went out to free holy sepulchre in huguenot of france fought died for religion will try to do so mother frank said gravely at rate if cause be good enough for father grandfather to risk life for be good enough for know mother went on in changed voice ca put old head on to young shoulder though will try to regard a say be afraid that sha be able to help enjoying a splendid adventure mother smiled faintly suppose be boy nature at rate be sure that will do duty there be certainly occasion for doing with sad face bear in mind always frank that be going out not so much to fight a to search prison fortress may be captured to question prisoner whether have heard known one answering description of grandfather lip quivered voice broke mother stood surprised a mr percival burst suddenly into tear signora rising from seat went hastily to put arm round neck be minute two before mr percival took hand from face went on be going to say frank of father frank started a if have be suddenly struck father repeated in low tone do think mother do think possible thought there be doubt a to how be killed have never let doubt mr percival went on whenever thought have come into mind during past two year have resolutely put aside must have be agony more than must bear to think possible that must be alive lingering in dungeon beyond human aid never have spoken on subject except to mother when first suggested possibility now that there be chance of prison door being opened may let not hope can hardly be that pray that in god mercy may yet see again a again broke down altogether frank with sudden cry threw on knee beside buried face in arm on lap whole figure shaken by deep sob mr percival be first to recover composure gently stroked hair saying must not permit to hope boy must shut that out from mind a have done thinking of only a vague very vague distant possibility how mother must be asked presently raising head did not hear about being killed how beppo saw shot how one of band testified that be dead buried so seemed to frank when mother first pointed out to that might be false just a government of naples declared be absolutely ignorant a to grandfather disappearance when appeared to certainty that be due to own act so must not hesitate moment to get rid of father whose letter a to state of prison be exciting intense feeling against in free country said must be easy for to bribe threaten servant into telling tale thought fit other agent might have informed bandit that rich englishman must be passing along road at certain time that government must be ready to pay for capture delivery to prisoner taken may have be promised large sum to repeat story of englishman having died be buried be possible though be determined not to think of a prisoner mother who knew more of thing than did how matter like be managed in italy thought that be so still to mind there be still be reason against hope for surely neapolitan government must have preferred that brigand must kill rather than that must have trouble of keeping in prison possibly must have preferred that signora forli said speaking for first time knew that be englishman doubtless learned that carried loaded pistol may have reckoned confidently upon resisting being killed may have be disappointed because brigand hoping for large ransom carried off wounded even then mr percival said must have sent up agent to brigand paid to finish work yes possibly be what did do though have never spoken to on subject since told not to have thought over many many time seems to that must scarcely do so for might thus put into power of bandit one of band might make way to naples go to british legation under promise of large sum of money protection denounce whole plot seems to more likely that must send agent to chief brigand pay sum of money to deliver captive up to men who must meet at certain place be probable that chief must on excuse other get rid of band two three hand over prisoner share money only with with when others returned tell that prisoner have died that have buried then carabinieri must use effort to kill who be in secret being in earnest for once probably did kill chief with probably man who gave evidence be not one of party at prisoner charged with minor offence who be promised liberty a price of telling story that be taught if leonard have be killed buried a stated grave must surely have be found earth must still have be fresh indeed nothing be more unlikely than that brigand must have taken extraordinary trouble to hide body a must not have anticipated that vigorous search must be made for for reason have along believed that leonard did not come to end a be supposed may have be killed afterwards by into whose hand be delivered even doe not seem likely for one of might betray secret for large reward may have died in dungeon a so many thousand have done believe firmly that did not a reported die in brigand hut have never since spoken on subject to mother frank for agreed with what said that must be better to think of a dead than in dungeon from a be shown in case of grandfather there be chance of releasing now however if garibaldi be successful a prison will be searched political prisoner freed there be prospect that if be still alive may be restored to frank with natural hope of youth at once adopted signora view mother although admitted that might possibly be true still insisted that must not permit to hope may be that god in mercy will send back to though will pray night day that will do so will be almost without hope that prayer will be granted be to hope must be like losing again if be not found now let talk of other matter sooner start better frank will not have many preparation to make garibaldian outfit be simple one red shirt trouser of colour generally blue pair of gaiter one of thick serviceable boot wide awake in fact sort of cap with perhaps red feather well made blanket wound up strapped over one shoulder like scarf red sash for waist cloak great coat strapped up worn like knapsack spare shirt pair of trouser be outfit that require have better take good rifle with of course pair of pistol clothes can buy out there also sword for doubt garibaldi will put on staff in case will not want rifle mother if do can buy one there in town like genoa there be sure to be shop where english rifle can be bought might have difficulty in passing one through custom luggage be rigorously examined on frontier at port brace of pistol however must be natural enough a english traveller might take for protection against brigand if intended to go at out of beaten track a to money will go to bank on monday request to give bill on firm in genoa turin garibaldi will find difficulty in getting cashed must say that best course will be to go through paris a far a railway be made then on by diligence over mont cenis to turin after by railway to genoa in way will get there in three four day whereas must take fortnight by sea then seems to mother that there be nothing at for to get before start except brace of pistol of course must have clothes up from harrow will write for at once frank must be better that must not go down must find difficult to answer question put to a to why be leaving of course enterprise of garibaldi must be kept profound secret one can not be too prudent in case like for if whisper got abroad italian government must be compelled to stop will not see beppo here when come back mr percival said to frank on monday evening gave notice afternoon what for mother anyhow be not sorry for have never liked know that have not frank begin to think that be right maid said to morning that though did not like to speak against fellow servant thought right to tell that when be out of house before get up of morning be often in drawing room dining room in of have business that when went up yesterday evening know that be very quiet walker came upon standing outside drawing room door when be chatting together thought though of be not quite sure that have ear at keyhole knocked came in instant saw a if have only that moment arrived there have caught sight of before saw be certain that be listening of course might have be mistaken thinking over seems to that be probably right for once twice since have be here have struck that paper in cabinet be not in precisely same order a have left know that be very methodical about such matter still might time when took out have omitted to return in exactly same order a before though think likely that must have done so however thought nothing of at time now that hear that have be spying about room listening at door can not connect two thing together may be that man have be acting a agent for neapolitan government know when be talking matter over on saturday mother suggested that be possible that courier have be in league with brigand possibly may also be agent of government there be so great stir made at time can not regard a impossible knowing how be heart soul with italian patriot that be sent over to watch think not only possible probable signora forli put in know that in italy police have spy in household where suspect owner of holding liberal opinion knowing that house be frequented by so many exile may have very well placed man here regret now that at time man came over at mother request listened to plausible tale took into service have not at time strong suspicion that attack on father be preconcerted one must hardly have mentioned idea to mother have occurred to however be of use thinking over now great point be to consider how will affect plan in what way signora frank asked in surprise mr percival added see what mean mother mean dear if man be spy may be quite sure that have have false key made by can open cabinet drawer writing desk be quite probable that know garibaldi handwriting for knowing that general be great friend of father must almost certainly be furnished with specimen of if be case may take for granted that wherever put letter from garibaldi must get at read that in can do comparatively little harm for rumour of general proposed expedition be already current will know immediately on receipt of letter sent for frank doubtless there be other neapolitan spy over here movement have made since will in case have be watched will have be seen to go to bank to day be not likely that must know how much have drawn out for conversation be with manager in private room knowing devotion to garibaldi cause might well suppose that amount must be considerable one have made secret of fact that frank will start day after to morrow to travel in italy for time will guess that frank be bearer of money to garibaldi possibly a seems that listened at door may even have heard tell frank how much be going to send yesterday evening be talking over how bill have best be concealed may have heard also if did may be pretty sure that will never reach garibaldi unless plan for concealment be changed frighten mother know that there be anything to be frightened about signora said for moment suppose that contemplates actual attack upon frank though will be convinced try to get money partly doubt for own sake partly because loss must be serious blow to garibaldi after disappearance of grandfather commotion there be over death disappearance of father attack upon frank must appear to be sequel of affair must cause such general indignation that ministry must take matter up in earnest result must be far more disastrous for government of naples than must be caused by amount of money reaching garibaldi whom must regard a adventurer who must give trouble who must not hope for success therefore think that there be danger whatever of personal injury to frank do think there be grave fear that money will be stolen on way if suspicion be well founded a to beppo doubt two three of agent will travel with if stop to sleep at hotel room must be entered coat carried off may be chloroformed when in train searched from head to foot baggage may be stolen on way must only be case if find bill on person where agreed last night to hide dare not let go mr percival said in trembling voice why mother frank said almost indignantly suppose now that be warned will be fool enough to let fellow get best of will carry loaded pistol in pocket will not sleep in hotel from time start till have handed bill to garibaldi will take care always to get into carriage with several other passenger if have have fair warning dare say must have be robbed have fear whatever on subject now that have suspicion of what may occur if think must be safer see why must not send bill by post to hotel at genoa signora forli shook head must not do said know what neapolitan spy be capable of if find that have not money with must follow to hotel at genoa bribe concierge there to hand over letter came addressed to steal from rack where must be placed while attention be turned elsewhere however have old friend at countess of mongolfiere exchange letter two three time year be of course patriot will if mother agrees with enclose bill in envelope addressed to put in with letter saying that will call at house when arrive at genoa request to hand letter to will say that vitally concern cause beg to place under lock key in safe receptacle until arrive be excellent idea mother mr percival said must seem to meet difficulty frank rose from seat quietly stepped noiselessly to door suddenly threw open to surprise mother maid be sitting in chair against knitting be all right hannah said a started to foot did not know be there thought that fellow might be listening again closed door asked to sit there evening frank mr percival said knew that must be talking matter over thought better to take precaution to ensure not being overheard quite right mother be glad did so then think that plan will answer yes think so must be sure take care of just a if have money about will mother can rely upon above signora forli said must beware when go to countess for money that take possible precaution call in daytime go in carriage drive straight from place to villa spinola better still go first to garibaldi tell where money be ask to send three of officer to hotel on following morning then take carriage drive to countess take to general with four of in carriage must not dare to attack in broad daylight be excellent plan mr percival said in tone of great relief certainly if do manage to search on way find that have not got bill upon will watch closely at genoa where doubt will get assistance of of francisco agent there be sure to be plenty of in genoa at present however many of there may be must not venture to attack in daylight four men driving along what be doubt frequented road more especially a must know three of be garibaldi men be a much a to say desperate fellow who must doubt like be armed with pistol have better take one more precaution signora forli said be believed that be going to start on thursday morning packing can be done in five minute think that must be good plan for to have everything ready to night send mary out for hansom to morrow morning so that must when come up to door go straight down get into drive to station say that might not be prepared for sudden change of plan at least must give chance of getting start of that can never recover at rate not until get to paris how must catch there frank said francisco agent here might telegraph to agent in paris might be on look out for when arrived take matter up be going via calais let look at bradshaw yes said after examining page train for tidal boat leaf at same time a dover train if when get into cab say out loud 'victoria so that beppo may hear can then when once on way tell cabman to take to charing cross in way if there be one on look out when calais train come in will be thrown altogether off scent seems ridiculous precaution frank said with laugh dear precaution be ridiculous when have francisco agent to deal with now will write letter to countess at once so that may get before arrival there will of course go out post chapter v on way after posting letter frank made several small purchase be more than hour away on return saw cab standing at door a approached beppo came out with portmanteau handed up to driver jumped in be driven off so beppo have gone mother said a joined in drawing room yes came in directly have left said that feeling have be outraged by servant being placed at door must not say why be there thought seemed a if be doubted must not entertain suspicion that be placed there to prevent one listening at keyhole after such insult a that must not remain longer in house said that be at liberty to leave instantly a wage have be paid only three day ago made reply bowed left mary came up told ten minute later that have brought portmanteau down left in hall gone out supposed to fetch cab heard vehicle drive up just now front door closed minute ago signora forli came into room a be speaking mary tell that beppo have gone be comfort that be out of house when once begin to suspect man sooner be away better at same time frank there can be doubt that going will not increase chance of reaching genoa without being searched must say that have made up mind to leave before did be glad that fact of mary being at door gave pretext for sudden departure in first place must conduct affair better than one else must do a know face figure so well then too must naturally wish to get credit of matter after being so long engaged in of course may a well carry out plan arranged to start in morning may feel absolutely certain that may do will not throw off track must know now that be suspected of being neapolitan agent that will very likely change route time of starting regard a certain that house will be watched night day beginning from to morrow morning hour so before train leave there will be vehicle with fast horse close at hand possibly two so one will follow cab other drive at once to place where beppo be waiting a likely a not will go via calais if go way so much better if not will only have to post at station at paris be likely enough that during last day two have have one two men hanging about here to watch going in out so to get to know well will have one at of railway station may also have written to agent in paris to have look out kept for there how must know must describe closely enough for possibly may have sent over photograph frank got up went to side table on framed photograph have be taken when be at home at christmas usually stood be right said have gone then opened album one here have gone too mother be there more of about there be one in bedroom know where hang be there morning have gone too mother said when returned to room so see muriel be right one from album may have be taken yesterday dozen copy made of so that even if give slip here frank will be recognised a soon a reach paris well mother be of use bothering more about have only to travel in carriage with other people can not molest at worst can search will find nothing can not even feel sure have anything on for now beppo know be suspected of listening at door will consider possible that may have changed plan about where will hide money be not a if wanted to put out of way know signora agreed that be certainly last thing must do because there must be tremendous row about must gain advantage by so must not worry further mother think there be slightest occasion for uneasiness will just go by calais a have intended by train have fixed on in will shake beppo belief have money with for must think that if have must naturally try other way at rate mr percival said will not go by line that have intended must be obliged to travel by diligence from dole to geneva thence to chambery again by same method over alp to susa will go straight from paris to marseille boat go from there two three day to genoa very well mother care be certainly there be far fewer change by line to make mind easy will promise that at marseille if have to stop there night will keep bedroom door locked shove something heavy against in way ca be caught asleep well will certainly feel more comfortable dear boy than must if be going over alp of course diligence stop sometimes people get out there must be many opportunity for being suddenly seized gagged carried off must have to be very sudden about frank laughed do think mother that have be building mountain out of molehill beppo may not be spy after may have heard talking of ten thousand pound temptation of trying to get may be too much for will know now that will be on guard that even if have money on person chance of getting be small indeed believe that signora have talked matter over till have frightened yourselves built up wonderful story based only on fact that mary thought that caught beppo listening at door how about photograph mr percival asked possibly have hidden affection for frank laughed have taken a memento of stay here well say anything more about be not in least nervous with brace of loaded pistol in pocket fair warning have have think need be afraid of two three of miserable neapolitan spy accordingly frank started by morning mail a have arranged carriage be full to dover at calais waited on platform until saw english gentleman with two lady enter compartment in took vacant corner seat on arrival at paris drove across at once to terminus of railway to marseille breakfasted there sat in waiting room reading till door on to platform opened official shouted passenger for melun sen dijon macon lyon marseille there be general movement among in waiting room frank found that there be fear of being in compartment by for only one carriage door be opened at time not until compartment be full be next unlocked waited until saw opportunity be first to enter secure corner seat in short time filled up have slept most of way between calais paris feeling absolutely certain that must not be interfered with in carriage with three english fellow passenger be twelve o'clock now must not arrive at marseille until seven next morning wondered where fellow passenger who be packed a closely a possible be going for although did not wish to be alone be not pleasant prospect to be for eighteen hour wedged in so tightly that must scarcely move then wondered whether of men who might be following be also in train have quite come to conclusion that mother grandmother have frightened most unnecessarily admitted that be natural enough after loss have have at dijon several passenger got out others took place so journey continued throughout day carriage be generally full though once twice there be for time five besides read most of way for although spoke italian a fluently a english must not converse in french when tired of reading have several time dozed off to sleep though have determined that must keep awake night at ten o'clock in evening train arrived at lyon here there be stop of twenty minute got out ate hearty meal drank two three cup of strong coffee be not surprised to find on returning to carriage that passenger with two exception have left have got in at macon be evidently men of good circumstance intimate with other have suspicion of for be certain that men who have intention of attacking must appear a stranger to other at vienne left carriage frank be not sorry to see do so if there be really fellow watching said to sooner show get over better be nuisance to keep on expecting something to take place when a likely a not nothing will happen at examined pistol be loaded not capped now put cap on nipple replaced in pocket just before have left vienne man have come to window a if intending to enter after glancing in for moment have gone to carriage illustration assailant fell back disappeared be rather queer frank thought a be alone here there be plenty of room for perhaps have made mistake in carriage at rate wo catch napping strong coffee that have taken at lyon have sharpened faculty never felt more awake than did after leaving vienne sat with eye apparently closed a if asleep with warm rug wrapped round leg hour later saw face appear at opposite window at first be for instant few second later appeared again watched steadily then man moved along to door joined frank without moving cocked pistol in right hand pocket took firm hold of butt with finger on trigger door opened noiselessly second man thrust in arm holding pistol so remained for minute frank be convinced that there be intention of shooting if must be avoided remained perfectly still then arm be withdrawn man holding knife in one hand roll of something in other entered in moment frank right arm flew up pistol cracked out assailant fell back disappeared through open door frank sprang to foot a fired stood with pistol levelled towards window where head of second man have disappeared a comrade fell backwards know have best of now frank muttered to think that will have try advancing cautiously pulled door to lowered window putting hand out without exposing head turned handle then drew up window again foot struck against something a backed to seat in corner a still kept eye fixed on window paid attention to for minute two then became conscious of faint odour expect be chloroform something of sort said a lowered window next to then still keeping eye on door opposite moved step forward picked up large handkerchief steeped in liquid of sort other be about to open window throw out when idea struck have better keep said there may be beastly row over business handkerchief may be useful in confirming story therefore put up on rack lowered window few inch did same to one opposite to then wrapping handkerchief up in two three newspaper have bought by way to prevent liquid from evaporating sat down in corner again felt confident that attack must not be renewed now be found to be on watch armed be probable that two men be alone one remaining must hardly venture single handed to take step against one who be certain to continue to be vigilant have doubt that have killed man fired at that even if wound have not be instantly fatal must have be killed by fall from train seems horrid muttered to have shot man be just a much life mine a must have be in battle hope one heard shot fired expect that most of passenger be asleep if one did hear might suppose that door have come open have be opened by guard have be slammed to of course man body will be found on line in morning expect there will be fuss over hope will all be out of train scattered through town before inquiry be set on foot if traced to might be kept at marseille for week of course must be right delay must be frightful nuisance there be one thing guard looked at ticket just before train started from last station must know be alone in carriage in few minute speed of train began to slacken knew that next station be valence closed eye listened a train stopped a soon a did so heard voice from next carriage shouting for guard then heard animated conversation of be able to gather import sound of gun guard said nonsense must have be dreaming be sure be not voice said indignantly seemed to a if be in next carriage guard came to frank window ah bah said there be only one passenger there englishman be alone when left vienne be sound asleep now perhaps be dead be possible therefore guard opened door be asleep monsieur frank opened eye ticket asked drowsily why showed at vienne pardon monsieur guard said be sorry that disturbed be mistake closed door said angrily to man who have called be a said have be asleep have woke english gentleman up for nothing minute later train moved on again so far so good frank said must think that be right now will be in at seven will not be daylight till past six a fancy that must have be about midway between vienne vallence when fellow fell out be not likely that body will be found for time be sure to have chosen point good way from station to get out of own carriage come to mine even when find be not likely to make out that have be shot for time afterwards hit in body somewhere near heart fancy did not feel sure of hitting if fired at head for carriage be shaking about good deal will probably be thought at first that have fallen jumped out of carriage suppose when be found will be carried to nearest station put in somewhere till doctor functionary come inquiry be held a probably have be badly cut about head face death will be put down to cause at first indeed fact that be shot may not be found out till prepare for burial suppose will take off clothes then a will want to keep for identification if inquiry must ever be made about at rate may hope to have got fairly away from marseille before matter be taken up by police even then evidence of guard be alone will prevent suspicion falling especially on have inclination for sleep although felt certain that must not again be disturbed maintained vigilant watch upon window until few minute after appointed time train arrived at marseille having only small portmanteau carried with be not detained more than two three minute there took fiacre drove to hotel de marseille bradshaw told be close to steamboat office after going upstairs having wash went down again carefully locking door after putting key in pocket then have coffee roll while taking obtained from waiter time table of departure of various steamer from port found to great satisfaction that one of rubattino vessel must leave for genoa at twelve o'clock a soon a steamboat office be open engaged berth walked about marseille for hour returned at ten to hotel took hearty lunch then drove down to port on questioning steward found that there be not many passenger going with tip of five franc secured cabin to having done went on deck again watched passenger arriving be principally italian among must not recognise face of agent who have levelled pistol at men have indeed worn black handkerchief tied across face below eye covering chin broad brimmed hat wore kept forehead eye in shadow although watched fellow passenger with faint hope of discovering by evil expression on face last night assailant have real belief that must even under most favourable circumstance recognise again two three of men wore beard seemed to belong to sailor class probably men who have landed from french ship after perhaps distant voyage be now returning home saw more of a at once went forward there be only eight other passenger in saloon seven of be italian of whom three be evidently friend two of others have frank gathered from talk just returned from brazil sixth be old man seventh traveller for firm of silk velvet manufacturer in genoa three friend talked gaily on sort of subject nothing frank gathered from conversation on deck at dinner gave clue a to occupation have evidently met at marseille for first time after being separated for considerable period one have be in england one at paris one at age be from twenty three to twenty six name be a learned from talk maffio sarto rubini before steamer have left port hour one of seeing that frank be alone said to a passed in broken english be warmer pleasanter here monsieur than be in london be indeed frank replied in italian be miserable weather there when left day before yesterday per bacco young man said with laugh took to be english allow to congratulate on admirable imitation of be english signor be be born of english parent first saw light in rome grandfather be italian broke ice chatted together pleasantly be going to genoa also be going to genoa perhaps for have by time quite come to conclusion on subject on same errand a yourselves others looked at in little surprise then glanced at one that young englishman must be going upon expedition a upon be bound seemed to be out of question mean on pleasure signor one of said after pause if excitement be pleasure doubt be yes be going to visit old friend of father be living little way out of town at villa spinola others gave simultaneous exclamation of surprise be enough signor one called rubini said holding out hand be comrade though how young english gentleman must come to be of party can not say others shook hand a warmly with frank then replied doubt be surprised father fought side by side with man be now going to see in siege of rome so also did grandfather have since paid by life for love of italy name be percival son of captain percival who be murdered while searching in naples for signor forli one of exclaimed same so gentleman can perhaps understand why be going to villa spinola why young a be be a eager to take part in business a yourselves can be yes indeed father name be honoured among a one of general friend companion in south america a one of comrade at rome still more perhaps for fearless exposure of horror of tyrant dungeon however be best that must say more on subject at present be certain that general presence at genoa be causing uneasiness at rome naples rumour that intends to carry out daring enterprise have appeared in newspaper doubt neapolitan spy be already watching movement may be there be on board ship great fear be that victor emmanuel government may interfere to stop doubt whether will venture to do so public opinion will be too strong for one can overhear just at present frank said certainly neapolitan spy be active mother house be frequented by many leading exile have reason to believe that have be watched by spy for time past know have be followed under idea perhaps that be carrying important paper document from general friend there attempt be made last night to enter carriage in be alone by two men one of whom be armed with pistol other have handkerchief soaked with chloroform fortunately be on guard shot fellow who be entering with handkerchief fell backwards out of carriage heard nothing more of other one for aught know may be on board now did well indeed sarto said warmly be in next carriage to did not hear sound of pistol shot be fast asleep be woke up by fellow passenger who declared heard gunshot when reached valence called guard who said that must have be dreaming for there be only young englishman in next carriage knew that when left last station be alone when train went on abused fellow soundly for waking with ridiculous fancy seems that be right after say there be what became of saw nothing more of may be on board for aught know for have black handkerchief tied over face up to eye a hat be pulled well down must not know if saw well have struck first blow in war

uncomfortable place be sure to do so again before business be over thank very much will not refuse so kind offer for doubt greatly whether must keep awake to night now let say more about for may be quite sure that man be still on track there may be other neapolitan agent on board can not be too careful may be that old man who be sitting facing at table may be little fellow who look like agent of commercial house may be one of two men who say come from south america there be telling at rate let drop subject altogether have said nothing at present even spy must lay hold of beyond fact that be going to villa spinola mean to garibaldi did not go up on deck again after dinner sat chatting in saloon until nine o'clock when frank said that must keep eye open longer after allowing time to get into berth rubini came in took off coat waistcoat pulled mattress bedding from other bunk lay down on with head close to door will take one of pistol rubini for by time called other simply by surname thank if scoundrel try to open door find that can not do so may be sure that will move off at once have be taught that be handy with weapon frank be sleeping soundly when be woke by rubini sharp challenge who go there be pitch dark be about to leap from bunk when rubini said be use getting up by time got bed away opened door fellow must be at other end of boat may a well lie quiet be not likely to try again indeed must not care about going outside door for be pitch dark might at present moment be crouching outside in readiness to stab a came out however be more likely to be gone now for directly heard talking must know that game be up struck match be just two o'clock said may a well have four hour more sleep in few minute frank be sound asleep again when awoke be daylight looking at watch found that be seven o'clock seven o'clock rubini said italian sat up stretched arm yawned have have capital night however be time to get up must turn out at once ca be far from genoa now be due there at eight o'clock so will just have comfortable time for wash cup of coffee before going ashore frank dressed hastily then ran up on deck where stood admiring splendid coast town of genoa climbing up hill with church campanile suburb embedded in foliage be just entering port when maffio came up to coffee be ready said have better come down take while be hot will have custom house officer off before land so there be hurry after making meal on coffee with abundance of milk roll butter frank went up again then at advice of rubini drew charge of pistol placed in portmanteau must go ashore in boat sarto said have just heard captain say that wharf be so full that may not be able to take vessel alongside for couple of hour be going anywhere in particular when land frank asked belong to genoa have friend here why do ask must spare hour of time to day must not ask be rather important certainly be at service rubini said in surprise at what hour will meet where be going to hotel europa time will suit so that be couple of hour before dusk will tell what be when meet be better not to speak of here young men consulted together will go to friend rubini said take thing there spend hour will call upon if convenient at eleven o'clock thank will see when have explained reason for troubling have not done so wantonly landed at step of custom have anything to declare official asked frank after passport have be examined stamped have nothing small portmanteau contains only clothes brace of pistol suppose one can land with on payment of duty certainly monsieur why must englishman want intend to make walking tour through italy speaking a before in english there be part of country where after dark must feel more comfortable for having in pocket be strange people englishman officer said after be not far wrong though seems to that must be wiser to give up what carry about than to make show of resistance must end in getting throat cut glanced at pistol named amount of duty chargeable when be paid frank nodded to companion who be being much more rigorously examined took one of vehicle standing outside custom house drove to hotel europa chapter vi villa spinola after taking room seeing portmanteau carried up there frank went out for hour looked at shop in principal street then returned to hotel stood at entrance until three friend arrived have again loaded pistol placed in pocket have engaged open vehicle be now standing at door let start at once said gentleman if will take place with will explain matter to a drive along took seat drive to strada de livourno said to coachman will tell house when get there now friend went on a carriage started will explain what may seem singular to mother have sent out letter contained may say considerable sum to be used by general for purpose of expedition have be intended must bring when discovered that there be spy in house that cabinet have be ransacked conversation overheard be thought almost certain that attempt must be made to rob of letter on way finally after much discussion be agreed to send letter by post to care of countess of mongolfiere who be old friend of signora forli grandmother be convinced that must be watched from moment landed advised not to go to see countess until must take three of garibaldi follower with that after accompanying to house must drive with to villa spinola

arrival crispi with other of garibaldi officer have gone to fetch found that cavour have placed guard of royal troop over magazine with order nothing be to be taken out heavy though blow have be garibaldian agent be already at work buying arm with hope of collecting more than sufficient for comparatively small force must sail for sicily even addition of fund must not avail to supply deficiency a be very difficult for general agent closely watched a now be to purchase military weapon for time conversation turned entirely upon step to be taken now that war chest have be so unexpectedly replenished then garibaldi put aside paper on have be taking note said enough for time signor percival will of course write to good mother expressing heartfelt thanks telling that if success attends can be happy in knowledge that will be largely due to will naturally write home tell what joy gift occasioned how much added to hope relieved of difficulty tell have appointed a

authority know that be here there be concealment about that a long a see sign of preparation for movement will leave alone a probably prolonged stay at hotel may excite curiosity be well that must visit gallery palace take excursion in neighbourhood may be a well too that must mention casually at table d'hote that know a father be great friend of mine when be together in south america will account for paying visit here frequently know that be being closely looked after by government spy must therefore omit precaution now wish to take lunch with a have many question to ask have heard of course of signor forli being missing of correspondence between government that of naples on subject frank went out told driver that must not be returning for time that two gentleman must go back in carriage in few minute a took carriage from hotel hire will of course be charged in bill here be couple of franc for in two three minute italian officer came out thanking frank for accommodation drove away while lad re entered villa meal be ready garibaldi said when entered room where have left be very pleasant to to turn thought for once from subject of expedition meal be very simple one though general have ordered one two extra dish in honour of guest now said when have sat down servant have retired tell first of about loss of dear friend frank related story of father going out to search for signor forli how have be captured killed by brigand a general listened kindly face grew stern hard did not speak until frank brought tale to end cospetto exclaimed may have be killed by brigand doubt not neapolitan government be at bottom of must wager money that hired men of mountain to disembarrass of one who be exposing horrible secret of prison say that body must not be found be search made for simply by carabinieri be made by sir secretary of legation accompanied wrote that although have searched everywhere in neighbourhood of hut must find trace of newly made grave may say that signora forli still belief that father be not killed be like husband carried off to dungeon be possible general said though must not encourage to hope way of people be so dark that there be fathoming since grave must not be found regard a certain that be not buried there for captor must not have troubled to carry body far must have dug hole close by thrown earth over body in case when band returned one other of men who did work must most likely have carelessly pointed to spot said 'there lie englishman though believe that did not die there might have died elsewhere wound be evidently very severe may have proved fatal after be carried off by who took away from brigand if be not fatal may have be murdered afterwards signora forli thought general that be more probable that have be taken to one of prison just a hunted down brigand in order that none of must have power to betray so might have preferred putting in prison to having murdered because in latter case men employed might go to british legation accept large sum for betraying secret may have be so general said if succeed perhaps will find father grandfather cherish false hope even if be once in neapolitan dungeon may before have succumbed to treatment there have mourned a dead buoy up with hope for if did so chance be in favour of suffering terrible disappointment be just what mother impressed upon general said that from first have never allowed to think of father a in prison be not until received letter thought that at last there be really chance that inmost cell of prison must be opened must admit possibility of father still being alive at least will have consolation that if find dear to will have aided in restoring father husband to hundred of other grieving wife mother child may ask how large force be likely to take over with general if government have remained neutral not interfered with must have found men for twelve thousand musket have seized a be have be obliged to write letter to part of italy stopping volunteer who be preparing to join of letter will doubtless fall into hand of authority have therefore so worded that may be supposed that expedition have be altogether given up thousand men be utmost that can hope to embark secretly will be picked men gallant fellow who fought under in alp men who have like be for year living a exile thousand have chosen one will die fighting will never turn back to enemy must have safely landed in sicily have surmounted difficulty danger be caused by hostility of government will however be glad enough to take advantage of work mother thought that must probably form neapolitan state if conquered into republic be dream when be fighting at rome see now that be impossible be for republic on principle must take what can get can not conceal from that experience of mazzini other enthusiast be that be not practical commit terrible blunder matter end in dictatorship a have twice be case in france mazzini must sacrifice practical to gain ideal care nothing for theory want to see italy free can only be done under victor emmanuel be popular energetic father suffered for devotion to cause of freedom son be stronger man at present be forced by cavour other temporiser who surround to curb own impetuosity like cavour gave up birthplace nice to france at same time respect great ability be sure that a soon a feel opportunity have come will grasp king will not hesitate to accept possession hope to gain for with victor emmanuel king of northern southern italy rest be simple then italy can afford to wait opportunity for driving austrian from venezia becoming for first time since day of roman united kingdom when hoist banner in sicily will be a soldier of victor emmanuel king of italy frank be pleased to hear father though advanced liberal in matter connected with italy be strong conservative at home frank have naturally imbibed idea be that people of constitutional monarchy like under lived be in respect freer better governed than under republic still more so than must be under republic constituted according to theory of mazzini of author of first second french revolution by way must have found terrible responsibility carrying so much money with did not carry general bill be with letter to sent by post to care of countess of mongolfiere who be friend of signora forli be hazardous too general said shaking head to trust ten thousand pound to post be terrible risk be best way that must think of general courier who be with father when be killed came over to see mother at request a wished to hear detail about father last day professed great fear of returning to italy a having given evidence against brigand must be marked man there be doubt be so garibaldi put in life must not have be worth day purchase scoundrel have agent in town men who keep informed a to person travelling whom must be worth while to capture of movement of carabinieri in direction mother therefore took into service frank went on two day before started discovered that have be acting a spy have be opening desk examining letter listening at door signora forli have doubt that have made acquainted with content of letter believed be going to carry money to villain garibaldi exclaimed bringing clenched hand down upon table be just what must do know many of friend enjoyed father hospitality doubt must be marked house secret police of francisco must keep eye over what be being done there must if possible get one of agent into man who have doubt acted a spy over father when be in italy must be naturally chosen for work story pretence of fear served admirably to get installed there if have learned that be about to start to bring ten thousand pound perhaps paper of importance must have be nothing short of miracle have arrived safely with be what signora forli mother thought sir be afraid to send letter directed to at hotel where be to stop a man must doubtless telegraph to agent out at genoa must get possession of so instead of doing so enclosed in letter to countess posted there be therefore chance of letter being lost except by pure accident if spy did not know that have sent letter off by post must render journey le hazardous than if have taken with mother signora be convinced that attempt must be made to search baggage on way did not think that must try to take life for after what have happened to grandfather father there must be question that murder be work of neapolitan agent storm of indignation must thus be caused garibaldi nodded doubt be right if scoundrel must have got possession of what carried without injury to must have done so must have stuck at nothing in order to carry out object have caught while be engaged in searching clothes baggage must not have hesitated to use knife can not now understand how have come through without having meddled with might have be done when be asleep in hotel might have drugged in railway carriage in cabin on board steamer coming here secret police of naples be only well organised department in kingdom have agent in london paris other city from moment left mother house must have be watched be sure that although may not know have not be searched be quite sure sir be so certain must be watched that made attempt to get off secretly started by train have intended to travel by did not stop night at hotel way made point of getting into railway carriage contained other passenger happened however that at last of with alighted be one o'clock in morning when left station felt sure that if attempt be made must be before stopped especially a man looked into carriage just before be starting then went away have loaded pistol in pocket rug over sat in corner pretending to be asleep hour later man came looked in joined door be partly opened arm with extended pistol pointed at felt perfectly sure that have intention of firing unless woke minute later comrade entered carriage have open knife in one hand cloth in other a came in shot fell back through carriage door whether in doing so knocked comrade down not can not say at rate saw more of man whom shot have dropped what held in hand on to floor be a have expected handkerchief soaked with chloroform be seven when arrived at marseille fortunately steamer left at twelve when went on board made acquaintance of three young men who be guessed on same errand a name be rubini sarto maffio soon became very friendly found that conjecture be correct being so told what have happened a there be one besides in cabin rubini most kindly laid mattress across door slept there a have not have wink of sleep night before only dozed little one before must have have great difficulty in keeping awake in course of night one did attempt to open door be unable to do so on account of mattress placed there heard more of asked gentleman to come to hotel europa at eleven for be really afraid to come along road here by drove with to house of countess then here so that be well guarded know well garibaldi said rubini be lieutenant in genoese company of cacciatori others be in company have done well indeed friend needed courage to start on journey knowing that francisco police be on track have right to feel proud that vigilance quickness defeated attempt be well that met rubini friend for a spy must know directly entered palazzo of countess that have gone there for special purpose probably to obtain document sent to doubt whether must have be able to come safely alone even if road have be fairly well thronged must not have gone to countess unless have escort general intention be to come to in first place ask three of officer might accompany to get letter of course after having found friend who must act a escort there be occasion to do so suppose there be fear of being further annoyed must think not garibaldi said now know that mission have be carried out will cease to be of interest to at same time must be well to be cautious if fellow shot be leader of charged to prevent supply letter coming to may consider that there be end of affair death will give step to one will owe ill will if however other man be chief of party must doubtless owe grudge be sure to be blamed for having be thus baffled by lad whereas have succeeded must have received approval of superior think therefore if be must abstain from going out after nightfall unless with companion if do so keep in great thoroughfare avoid quiet street habit of carrying loaded pistol in pocket have proved valuable one must advise to continue so long a be here if see rubini tell thank for aid friend rendered others have be instructed not to come here until receive communication that time for action have arrived follower send address a soon a reach genoa so can summon when be needed must never do for number of men to present here authority know perfectly well that be intending to make expedition to sicily a long a see sign of activity spy tell that only half dozen of friend frequent villa may be content to abstain from interference with indeed think that in case must venture to prevent sailing unless receive urgent remonstrance from austria france be such remonstrance made must now be able to reply so far a can learn be remaining here quietly be only visited by few private friend chapter vii expedition sail frank spent pleasant three week in genoa three young men did in power to make time pas agreeably to introduced to family friend one other of always accompanied to theatre opera a much more frequently happened to gathering at own house at of acquaintance

excitedly be almost new arrival consequently unknown to frank who passed on into house where garibaldi officer of staff other principal officer be engaged in discussing final arrangement most of staff be known to a have be there for day joined three four of younger men who be sitting smoking in room on ground floor while council be being held so at last day have arrived lieutenant one of said think everything augur well for be convinced that government mean to interfere with be adopting policy of shutting eye of course will disavow will not dare to stop must know what be going on there be too many people in secret for not to have leaked out know whether noticed must see when be in city morning that there be general excitement people met talked earnestly stranger there be good many there to day be watched eagerly see there be ship of war in port there certainly must have be have intended to stop will be very glad when be well at sea frank said though agree with that be not likely will be interfered with chatted for upwards of hour council broke up list be handed round appointing boat to various officer be told off frank found that be to go in third left shore together with orsini commander of second company turr first aide de camp of general hour passed slowly regular meal be served food be placed on long table must go in take refreshment a pleased new comer indeed officer with exception of two three of garibaldi most trusted friend be still in ignorance a to how be to obtain vessel to take to messina frank who be behind scene listened with amusement to wild conjecture that hazarded knew that matter have be privately arranged with owner of rubattino line of steamer that lombardo piemonte of be in harbour must be seized by garibaldians be warm adherent of national cause must not of course appear openly in matter have already be paid sum agreed on for damage injury might happen to vessel while openly must be able to protest loudly against seizure of ship like government profess entire ignorance of what be going on only few hand must be left on board be to offer feigned resistance be to make noise among garibaldi follower be several engineer who be to take command of assist in engine room in order to save time lombardo be much larger of two vessel be to take piemonte in tow there be still however anxiety on part of leader lest at last moment government must intervene seize arm take possession of steamer seizure of great magazine of arm at milan showed that cavour be in earnest in endeavour to put stop to expedition of whose success have not slightest hope whether must risk ferment must be excited be garibaldi follower to be seized at moment of starting be doubtful be question have be discussed time after time by garibaldi friend that minister be well informed a to preparation purchase of fresh arm arrival of so many men at genoa be certain must not know exact hour at expedition be to start even be sure that might not march down coast take ship at other port than genoa ignorant a be great bulk of gathered at villa spinola of garibaldi plan knew that movement be to begin night there be general feeling of restlessness excitement a evening approached from time to time messenger brought news from city be well there be unusual stir among troop police went about usual duty unconcernedly apparently without noticing suppressed excitement of population at word be passed round that be to lie down a must a there must be movement until one o'clock order be obeyed there be little sleep be known that bixio other officer have already left villa whisper have run round that be going to seize ship that embarkation must take place before morning at one o'clock be in motion again servant of villa brought round bowl of coffee milk a soon a be drunk bread hastily eaten made ready for start frank have that evening donned uniform for first time have be at work with two other member of staff serving out rifle ammunition from outhouse have be converted into magazine men coming in steady stream through back entrance into garden passing again with arm through door party be at work carrying down box of ammunition barrel of flour other provision to shore at one o'clock whole force be gathered there be impressive sight frank for first time fully realised singularity danger of expedition in be to share here be thousand men of whom have fought again again under garibaldi in cause of italian liberty be about to start against wish of government of country to invade kingdom possessed of strong fortress army of one hundred twenty eight thousand regular troop success seemed altogether impossible frank have deeply imbibed conviction of mother signora forli that people at large must flock to standard have be carried away with enthusiasm of general about even darkness of night mystery of quiet armed figure of boat hauled up in readiness for embarkation did not damp suppressed excitement made nerve tingle rendered difficult to remain outwardly impassive men talked together in low tone here be many who have not met since have parted after event have laid stone to edifice of italian unity by addition of tuscany parma modena to kingdom of sardinia greater part of be lombard genoese there be many from turin other city of piedmont be exile who have received summons similar to sent by garibaldi to captain percival greeting of men who have be comrade in many dashing adventure be warm earnest though expressed in few low word hour after hour passed expectation grew into anxiety knew now that bixio have gone to seize two steamer that must have be in roadstead at two o'clock at four there be still sign of fear that have failed that government have at last moment intervened grew stronger be not until dawn be beginning to break that two steamer be made out approaching anxiety gave place to delight steadily in good order men took place under direction of officer assigned to boat by time steamer arrived a near a must venture to shore boat be alongside with crew embarkation be quickly effected be found that there have be no dangerous hitch in arrangement delay having be caused by difficulty bixio have have in finding two steamer be anchored in extensive roadstead of genoa among many other ship store be hastily transferred from boat to steamer at once started for spot where two boat laden with ammunition percussion cap rifle must have be lying off coast through misunderstanding of order interference of authority two boat be not at rendezvous after cruising about for hour in direction garibaldi decided that further time must be lost for at moment government vessel might start in pursuit accordingly steamer head be turned to south expedition fairly began delighted a on board lombardo piemonte be to have escaped without government interference loss of ammunition be very serious blow have brought with from villa spinola scarcely sufficient for couple of hour fighting for on board have reserve for to hand over with gun to expected to join on landing be therefore absolutely necessary to touch at port to obtain ammunition garibaldi chose talamone at southern extremity of tuscany within few mile of boundary of papal state arrived there early next morning garibaldi at once went ashore desired governor of fort in name of king to hand over to supply of ammunition gun doubt governor may have have a to garibaldi authority governor of much larger neighbouring town of orbetello rendered assistance in power gave considerable amount of ammunition several gun vessel filled up with coal inhabitant welcomed expedition with enthusiasm for conduct governor of talamone afterwards received severe reprimand from government who be obliged to clear of participation whatever in expedition have few hour after garibaldi left genoa despatched fast screw frigate maria under order of admiral persano in pursuit official order be to capture bring back steamer on board there can be little doubt that received secret instruction in contrary sense at rate frigate after prolonged cruise returned to genoa without having come within sight of expedition before leaving talamone garibaldi accepted offer of one of follower to undertake with sixty men to effect diversion by raising population in north of papal state expedition seemed hopeless one with so small force must seem that garibaldi assented to in order to rid from whose impetuosity violent disposition might have led to trouble later a be to be expected little party failed entirely in object be defeated captured very shortly after crossing frontier be glad on board two ship when be again under steam heading for goal a by time be certain that news of departure from genoa must have be telegraphed to naples that ship of war of country must be on look out to intercept be decided at council of war held by garibaldi that instead of landing near messina must make for little island of maregigimo lying off north west corner of sicily a by route must be likely to escape vigilance of neapolitan ship of war must be watching for along coast from strait of messina to palermo arriving at maregigimo late on evening of th learning from islander that coast of sicily be everywhere patrolled decided to take bold step of sailing into harbour of marsala a large mercantile port offered several advantage true character of vessel must not be suspected until arrived there hostile ship cruising near might take for ordinary merchantman there be also advantage that being only seventy mile from cape bona in africa afforded better chance of escape must meet with misfortune after landing be obliged to re embark a neared coast made out several sailing vessel steamer near in roadstead of marsala two ship of war be anchored to joy be able to make out through telescope while still at considerable distance that vessel be flying british ensign so headed straight for port found full of merchantman have indeed be attended by good fortune for three neapolitan ship of war have left port that morning be still in sight being evidently suspicious however of two steamer entering port together turned made for marsala again not moment be lost by garibaldians disembarkation at once began happened that british vessel of war be in line of fire consequently whole of men be landed before neapolitan must bring gun to bear two third of be still on quay getting ammunition store into cart when enemy opened fire upon with shell grape fortunately discharge be ill directed garibaldians marched off into town without loss be welcomed with lively acclamation by working class of town authority while throwing opposition in way received under protest a indeed be natural enough for must hardly suppose that handful of men must succeed against power of naples dreaded anger of government must bestow warm hospitality upon adventurer two day be spent at marsala in gaining information a to state of country making arrangement for march inland for transport of ammunition spare rifle in obtaining store of provision sufficient for two three day be fortunate indeed that neapolitan troop be stationed in town that be therefore able to pursue work without interruption during voyage force have be divided into eight company ninth be now formed from sicilian who joined enthusiasm have be necessarily shown rather in action than in shout by people of marsala who with neapolitan ship in bay feared that demonstration might draw upon terrible retribution now showed openly force be accompanied by great number of men woman even monk joined in procession while from village party of fighting men many of whom have taken part in late insurrection joined party when on day after leaving marsala reached salemi force have be augmented by twelve hundred men here garibaldi at request not only of own men of authority of little town deputy from village round assumed title of dictator in name of victor emmanuel king of italy thus proclaiming to world that have broken altogether with republican faction except when on duty there be thorough comradeship among garibaldians fully of thousand men who have left genoa with belonged to upper professional class be of same rank of life a officer consequently when march be done men dismissed from parade stiffness be thrown aside officer men mingled in utmost harmony be in highest spirit first well nigh insuperable difficulty have be overcome hindrance thrown in way by italian government have failed to prevent embarkation danger of falling into hand of neapolitan navy have be avoided reception met with showed that have not overestimated deep feeling of hostility with sicilian regarded oppressor frank while on capital term with officer who be aware how much expedition owed to family who saw almost affectionate manner in garibaldi treated kept principally with special friend maffio rubini sarto during voyage a occasional change from one absorbing topic asked many question about school day be intensely interested in description of life so wholly different from at italian school academy have such good time a have rubini said seem to have done just what liked master appear to have interfered with at except when in school have nothing to do with went where liked did what liked just a if be grown up men be astonishing maffio said why with be never out of sight of master might not quite go where liked there be certain limit beyond be supposed not to pas really a long a did not get into row must pretty well go anywhere within walking distance see big fellow to certain extent keep order really only do in house where live outside there be occasion to look after though be boy be gentleman be expected to act a such ca see why boy want looking after a if be criminal who must break into house maltreat old woman if have chance be because be a be put on honour allowed to act think for instead of being marched about herded like flock of sheep that public school boy a rule do so well afterwards great general wellington at least think be said that battle of waterloo be fought in playing field of eton of course though said eton meant of public school certainly be much le likely to come to grief when leave school become own master than must be if have be treated a child up to time must be so rubini said thoughtfully wish have such school in italy perhaps will have day have many university school at like yours of course master be not priest well be almost clergyman make difference be generally good fellow take lot of interest in sport be natural enough for many of have be great cricketer great oarsman be have rowed in university boat master who have done that sort of thing be more looked up to by boy be thought more of than fellow who have never done anything in particular sort of fellow who have always be working reading have come out high at university be of course very good teacher understand boy half a well a others do why must respect master who have be a say good at sport more than one who have studied hard well know exactly of course be very creditable to man to have taken high degree somehow other one doe have lot of respect for fellow who know must thrash blackguard who have row with in couple of minute just same a one feel respect for officer who have done sort

sure that a nation have benefited more by one than other if there be not one among who have ever opened latin greek book must still have extended empire a have done colonised continent conquered india held own more against other nation by land sea become tremendous manufacturing commercial country others laughed well crowed percival doubt there be great deal in what say still suppose that even will hardly claim that be braver than other people not braver frank said bravery be good without backbone if two men equally brave meet be one with most be what call stamen most endurance most strength most skill who must in long run win fault of english be mean offensively that believe too much in yourselves at rate frank replied boast about a people do be because believe in ourselves that be successful for example here believe that small a be number be going to defeat neapolitan think that will do because also believe in be that feeling among soldier sailor conviction that a matter of course will in long run win have carried through battle war against biggest odds be way that roman ancestor carried arm over europe be braver than men fought believed thoroughly in never admitted to

soldier liked to learn use of sword rapier though might never have occasion to use for a be only son did not want to go into army be just a well now that did go in for expect will be of much use rubini said if neapolitan show to be braver soldier than take for there will be hand to hand fighting if on other hand do stand ground well expect will ever get to close quarter for ought to annihilate before must do so well long for first trial so do must think that good deal must depend upon if beat a easily a have heard father say be beaten near rome in be hardly likely that will make much stand afterwards be not only effect will have on neapolitan troop on people can not expect that sicilian will join in considerable number until have won battle want to make good show even most cowardly troop can hardly help fighting when be twenty to one if be able to make fair show of force enemy may lose heart even if greater part of men be only poorly armed peasant to most of who started from genoa fully prepared to sacrifice life in cause regarded a sacred success have attended passage enabled to disembark without loss of man seemed presage of further good fortune now marched forward with buoyant confidence that in go long way to ensure success thought that there be fifty thousand neapolitan troop in island that general lanza have at palermo twenty eight thousand in way overawed news that strong body of enemy have advanced through calatafimi to meet be regarded with satisfaction calatafimi stood in heart of mountain where road from palermo marsala trapani met on such ground disproportion of number must be of le importance than must be in plain for cavalry of enemy must not be able to act with effect ground too a learned from peasant be covered with ruin of building erected by saracen spaniard norman be therefore admirably suited for irregular warfare garibaldi with few of staff went forward to reconnoitre position decided that own follower must make direct attack while new levy working among hill must open fire on neapolitan flank charge down upon a opportunity offered at marsala staff have bought horse choosing hardy animal accustomed to work among mountain be not general intention to hurl little force directly on neapolitan centre situated in valley while making feint there to attack one flank other rapidity with men manoeuvred giving great advantage while therefore six little gun have obtained at talamonte be to open fire on enemy centre covered by couple of hundred men rest be to act a mobile force under own direction movement must be screened by ruin broken ground must be able to pas in comparative shelter from one flank to other so surprise enemy by falling upon where least expected a approached scene of action garibaldians left road scattering in skirmishing order on side working way along through ruin so covered advance that be only occasionally that glimpse of red shirt gleam of sun on musket barrel showed enemy that assailant be approaching on ground like horse be of little use garibaldi ordered junior member of staff to dismount fasten horse in place of shelter advance on foot with troop a must not require service during fight chapter viii palermo frank heart beat fast with excitement of moment save there be not one of garibaldi own men be accustomed to sound of artillery must scarcely restrain from starting when on sudden neapolitan battery opened fire missile struck rock wall round burst overhead be not so bad a look rubini whom joined a ran forward said with laugh be fortunate that be not frank replied certainly sound bad enough a think can see at can only be random fire soon shook off feeling of uneasiness must not at first repress presently quitted friend pushed forward on own account keeping close to road abreast of garibaldi so that must run up receive order might be given be not long before enemy opened musketry fire gun have be following garibaldi now superintended a be run into position three on side of road be not placed at regular distance be posted where men must while loading be sheltered behind wall from gun must be run out wheeled round fired then withdrawn frank be not long in joining garibaldian line be lying in shelter at foot of declivity in front of be level space of ground with few little farmhouse dotted here there on opposite side of hill rose much more steeply near summit be main body of neapolitan who be altogether about two thousand strong advanced guard of five six hundred have descended into valley be moving across have gun with be now at work a be others with main body when garibaldi joined troop at once ordered genoese company to attack advancing enemy if possible to capture gun have with followed by party of sicilian by frank several other officer who have special duty to perform dashed forward at same moment number of peasant who have made way round on flank unobserved opened fire upon neapolitan who at order of officer in command began to fall back garibaldians hurled upon hastened movement guard have idea of making frontal attack upon enemy so strongly posted have a frank have heard say before dismounted intended to compel to fall back by flank attack be not surprised therefore to hear trumpet sounding recall summons be however unheard at rate unheeded by genoese who continued to press hotly upon neapolitan latter have now be joined by supporting line garibaldi saw that small party who be now almost surrounded must be destroyed unless advanced to assistance trumpet accordingly sounded charge men sprang to foot dashed forward at full speed fighting have be hand to hand garibaldians have only gained advantage so far from fact that be accustomed to fight for be individually more powerful men be indeed habit in fight to rely on bayonet still pressed forward frank be now a cool collected a must have be in football match have several time to congratulate on training have received in use of sword having two combat with neapolitan officer time coming off victorious presently in front of saw one of neapolitan standard in confusion have be left almost unguarded calling to three four of men around dashed at there be short sharp fight men standing between flag fell before bayonet of garibaldians frank engaged in tough encounter with officer who held flag finally cutting down seized staff carried back into garibaldian rank well done well done percival turned saw garibaldi who at head of main body have that instant arrived neapolitan although also reinforced fell back up hill face of ascent be composed of series of natural terrace a retreated up storm of fire from reserve at top of hill cannon there be poured upon garibaldians general halted men for minute two at foot of lower terrace where be sheltered by slope from missile of enemy be re formed then re commenced ascent be hot work ground be very steep swept by enemy fire a terrace be gained men rushed across level ground threw down panting at foot of next slope where be to extent sheltered two three minute made next rush little return to enemy fire be attempted for wretched musket with have be supplied at genoa be practically useless only genoese who have brought own carbine be excellent shot did much execution several time neapolitan attempted to make stand be a often driven back on occasion however fought well steadily terror of garibaldi name have ceased to have effect during twelve year have elapsed since ferdinand army have fled before desire to wipe out that disgrace doubt inspired garibaldi afterwards gave full credit for obstinacy with have contested advance at last uppermost terrace be reached there be one more halt for breath then garibaldians went forward with cheer resistance be comparatively slight neapolitan troop at first engaged have already exhausted ammunition have become disheartened at failure to arrest impetuous assault of enemy when garibaldians reached summit of hill found that enemy be in full retreat exhausted by effort having suffered heavy loss made short halt horse of general staff be brought up by small party who have be left with gun who have advanced across plain at little distance in rear of fighting line a soon a arrived advance continued until little army halted at calatafimi mile from scene of battle garibaldians have captured only one cannon few rifle score two of prisoner for most part wounded by defeat of enemy have gained enormous advantage for a news spread throughout country dimension growing a flew created great enthusiasm from town village men poured down to join army of liberation neapolitan governor have indeed made fatal mistake in not placing much larger force in field for first engagement troop fought bravely though beaten be by mean disgraced have be supported by powerful artillery by couple of regiment of cavalry must have charged garibaldians in plain battle must have have very different result at calatafimi garibaldians halted neapolitan wounded have be left here own have when fighting ceased be sent back to vita inhabitant vied with other in hospitality to although saddened by loss of many of bravest comrade regarded victory have won a augury of future success already country have risen neapolitan in retreat have be harassed number of killed by peasant hour swelled force next morning set out in highest spirit with conviction that success must attend yet there be grave difficulty to be met for ten thousand neapolitan be massed in two formidable position on road by be believed that garibaldians must advance twelve thousand remained in garrison at palermo that evening reached alcamo large town where be received with excitement be even more lively when next day entered partinico where inhabitant who have be brutally treated by neapolitan in advance have risen when passed through a fugitive massacred number of pursued considerable distance along road to palermo at point garibaldians left road ascended to plateau of renne thence looked down on rich plain in palermo stand on city here two day of tremendous rain prevented farther movement be now seeing rough side of campaigning percival rubini said with laugh a four friend sat together in little arbour have erected over top of be thrown two of blanket be not very pleasant certainly frank agreed might be good deal worse be wet be not cold be not fasting of laid in good stock of provision when at partinico certainly never anticipated that must have to rely upon telegraph pole for supply of fuel be lucky that wire run across here for must certainly have have to eat meat raw go without if have be for none of men appeared to mind discomfort supply of wood be too precious to be used except for cooking purpose indeed must be of use for men to attempt to dry clothes until downpour ceased two day later enemy having sent out strong reconnoitring party garibaldi determined to cross mountain come down upon main southern road from palermo officer have be sent to various town on road to summon true men to join force started in evening performed tremendous march gun be lashed to pole carried on men shoulder box of ammunition be conveyed in same manner rain continued incessantly there be thick fog added greatly to difficulty be not until daylight that head of column began to straggle into parco on southern road at once seized commanding position round place began to throw up entrenchment a parco be commanded by hill must not be defended against determined attack two day later two strong column marched out from palermo first advanced by road crossed valley threatened garibaldian rear by passage through hill known a pas of piana dei greci garibaldi at once sent off artillery baggage by road with company of cacciatori body of new levy who be known a picciotti hurried to pas reached before neapolitan arrived there on opening fire neapolitan thinking that have whole garibaldian force in front of in extremely strong position retired at once finding that freedom of movement must be embarrassed by cannon under most advantageous circumstance must not contend against of enemy sent away along southern road while withdrew force from parco for short time followed gun then turned off into mountain directed march to misilmeri few mile from palermo having completely thrown enemy off track pursuing column believing that whole garibaldian force be retreating with gun pushed on rapidly while garibaldi have already turned strong position of monreale be preparing to attack town force have here be increased by volunteer who have arrived from southern village neapolitan general lanza soon obtained information a to invader position prepared with absolute confidence to meet attack must believed be made by coast road on evening of th garibaldi moved across country by little frequented track next morning appeared on road entering town at terminus gate twelve thousand neapolitan troop who still remained in town have suspicion that foe be near day before commander of column have passed through parco have sent in news that be in hot pursuit of garibaldians who be flying in direction governor have given banquet in honour of rout of brigand military band have played on promenade official portion of population have be wild with joy on other hand message have passed constantly between garibaldi agent leader of patriotic party in town who have promised that population must rise a soon a entered city be upon promise that general based hope of success for three thousand badly armed men must hope to overcome twelve thousand troop well supported by artillery defending town street by street seemed impossible even to so hopeful spirit time be lost garibaldians rushed forward drove in at once outpost stationed beyond barrier at gate carried barricade before troop must muster in sufficient force to offer serious resistance beyond opposition became obstinate fierce cacciatori pressed forward by principal street band of picciotti distracted attention of enemy by advancing by parallel street although cannon of castello mare thundered pouring shot shell broadcast into quarter through garibaldians be advancing though from large convent of san antonio held by battalion of bersaglieri terrible fire be maintained upon flank of cacciatori at distance of couple of hundred yard nevertheless pressed on clearing street of troop who opposed advance until reached square in centre of city time gun of neapolitan ship of war have be pouring fierce fire into town with apparent object of deterring populace from rising for be upon private house that damage be committed be so far a garibaldians be concerned innoxious for short time object be attained so terrible be fire swept principal street leading down to water so alarming din of exploding shell falling wall that for short time populace dared not venture from house fury succeeded to alarm be not long before inhabitant flocked out into street under direction of colonel acerbi one of most distinguished officer of thousand began to erect barricade sprang up with marvellous rapidity cart be wheeled out from courtyard overturned men laboured with pickax crowbar tearing up pavement woman threw out mattress from window worked with enthusiasm garibaldi established at pretorio palace central point of city here member of revolutionary committee joined staff be sent off in direction to order band scattered throughout city to assemble there people of palermo be wholly without firearm a weapon of kind have be confiscated by authority armed with hatchet ax knife fastened to end of stick pole to act a pike long spit other improvised weapon prepared to defend barricade few indeed brought out musket have be hidden away when house have be searched for weapon greatest difficulty be experienced from want of powder garibaldi now stationed force so a to intercept communication between various point where neapolitan troop be concentrated lanza who be at once commander in chief viceroy be with several regiment at royal palace castello mare be held by strong force there be regiment at palace of finance point have only reached after hard fighting once there be isolated from other to join hand must have to pas along street blocked by barricade defended by desperate population exposed to fire of garibaldians from window roof night hundred of men woman be set to work to grind charcoal sulphur saltpetre to mix together to form rough gunpowder then to make up into cartridge such compound must have be useless for ordinary purpose must have sufficient strength for street fighting where be necessary to send bullet twenty thirty yard with sufficient force to kill fire of fleet castello mare palace be maintained day town be on fire in many place whole district thousand yard in length hundred yard wide have be laid in ash convent church have be crushed by shell large number of inhabitant have be killed by grape cannister after four hour fighting there be lull in musketry fire neapolitan be gathered in three strong place be virtually besieged there in spite of continued cannonade populace thronged street be not in direct line of fire bell of church pealed out triumphantly bright curtain cloth flag be hung out from balcony friend embraced other with tear of joy while number continued to labour at barricade monk clergy joining in work class being wild with joy at deliverance from long crushing tyranny to have be subjected frank have entered city with chosen band who have led attack on terminus gate advanced with into heart of city in wild excitement of fight have lost sense of danger saw others fall around cheek have be deeply gashed by bullet have scarce felt pain be almost surprised when man close to offered to bind up wound with sash one of first order garibaldi gave after establishing at pretorio palace be to send for lieutenant percival said commit to honour of leading party to prison liberating political prisoner find there have won that distinction by having in first place captured flag of tyrant at calatafimi also by gallant manner in have fought in first rank to day marked conduct be worthy of brave father can give higher praise taking twenty men with frank went to prison on entering demanded from official list of prisoner confined offence with be charged so that criminal must be released with political prisoner hardly needed list however for criminal be few in number neapolitan authority not having troubled with such trifle a robbery assassination prison be crowded with men of best blood in city surrounding country who have be arrested upon suspicion of holding liberal opinion who be treated with very much greater severity than be worst malefactor thunder of gun have already informed that terrible conflict be going on be not until frank men arrived that prisoner knew who be party engaged joy gratitude be unbounded when learned that be free now for ever from power of persecutor a marched to prison several of men have shouted to crowd be going to free captive news have spread like wildfire a prisoner issued from jail be met by friend relative most affecting scene took place although frank considered unlikely in extreme that person arrested on mainland must be carried across to island insisted on warder accompanying over whole prison unlocking door in spite of protestation that cell be empty having satisfied on head went to other prison where similar scene took place fire of neapolitan ship be kept up until then ceased rather from exhaustion of gunner who have be twelve hour at work than from difficulty in sighting gun for in palermo be almost a light a day whole city being lit up by tremendous conflagration in addition house save facing port be illuminated candle burning at window throughout night work be carried on fresh barricade be erected others greatly strengthened be important that three body of troop isolated from other must not effect junction boat be sent off to merchant ship in harbour in order to purchase powder none must be obtained however by morning so much have be manufactured that with what still remained in garibaldian pouch there be enough for day fighting at garibaldi headquarters there be sleep night revolutionary committee received order from general where armed citizen be to take post at barricade how men be to be divided into section be to impress upon though fighting must be desperate must not last long at royal palace there be provision of kind for troop stationed there be there in palace of finance so that if struggle must be maintained for day two at most troop must be driven to surrender by starvation frank have time after returned from prison to have wound dressed then received congratulation of three friend of whom be more le severely wounded have come out of rather best of percival maffio said have bullet through arm rubini have lost two of finger of left hand sarto will limp for time for have be shot through calf of leg so will have scar that can show while will have one will be a good a medal of honour be sure hope not frank said can assure honourable a may be must be nuisance indeed for must be constantly asked where got when answered must be bothered into telling whole story over over again however think can congratulate other on having come out of comparatively unhurt certainly never expected to do so row be almost bewildering be almost a bad a one of football tussle sarto laughed may laugh be very much same feeling frank replied have felt nearly a much excited in football scrimmage a be to day can tell that when two side be evenly matched fellow be straining nerve thrill of satisfaction when one find that one own side be gaining ground be about a keen a anything one be ever likely to feel next day fighting recommenced neapolitan troop making desperate effort to concentrate fighting in street be for time furious at point did enemy make material progress although gained possession of house round palace finance office barricade be desperately defended by armed citizen picciotti from time to time when neapolitan seemed to be gaining ground men of garibaldi thousand flung upon with bayonet that morning under superintendence of skilled engineer powder mill be established supply of gunpowder be improved in quantity quality men woman filling cartridge a fast a powder be turned out fighting work continued throughout night next day chapter ix hard fighting on following morning frank be riding with message from general when heard sudden outburst of firing at distance ahead of checked horse to listen must be near porto terminus said yet there be none of enemy anywhere near there must be fresh body of troop have arrived from south of island bosco column returned from fool errand in search of if so be in desperate mess six thousand neapolitan troop under one of best general must turn scale against must be stopped if possible till general can collect scattered troop frank second supposition be correct one two column have a believed be in pursuit of garibaldi have returned to town so unanimous be country people in hatred of neapolitan that be only on previous day that have learned that enemy who believed be fugitive have entered palermo with whole force furious at having be so tricked made tremendous march arriving at terminus gate early in morning made determined attack on guard there who defended bravely be driven back contesting step frank hesitated for moment then shouted to soldier near run with speed to palace demand to see general at once say that have come from sent to say that porto terminus be attacked know not with what force that be going on to try to arrest progress until arrives with help a run tell man meet to hasten to oppose enemy man started to run frank galloped on shouting to armed man met to follow roar of battle increased a rode when reached long street leading to gate saw that enemy have already forced way in that barricade be being desperately defended by little force have fallen back before horse must be useless now called to boy who be looking round corner of house look here lad take horse lead to general headquarters here be five franc piece get on back lead can trust will do signor can depend upon frank ran forward tremendous roll of fire beyond barricade showed how strong be force there felt sure that defender must speedily be overpowered number of men be running along street shouted to barricade can not hold out enter house man window must keep back to last garibaldi will be here before long kept on until within two hundred yard of barricade then stopped at door of house at corner of lane at right angle to street ran into waited until score of men came up come in here said will defend house till last men closed door behind running into lower room fetched out furniture piled against be assisted by five six woman who with child be sole occupant of house bring mattress bedding that have frank said to to window of first floor will place on balcony in three four minute balcony be lined with mattress frank sheltered men behind looking out saw that fighting have just ceased that dense mass of enemy be pouring over barricade while at same moment crackling fire broke out from house near into defender have run when saw that barricade must be no longer defended along side of street preparation similar to have ordered have be hastily made men who be still coming up be turning into house directly neapolitan crossed barricade opened fire down street be speedily deserted frank have doubt that a garibaldian support came up must make way in at back strengthen defender hundred yard higher up street be barricade behind townspeople be already gathering frank ordered men to keep back inside room until enemy came along powder be good till be close said be a good a best at close quarter illustration hinge of door be broken off from time to time looked out roar of musketry be continuous from window came puff of smoke while enemy replied by storm of musketry fire at defender while column be still moving forward officer be telling off party of men to burst open door bayonet found in house must mark progress made a woman threw out of window preferring death way to being murdered by infuriated soldier be not long before head of column approached house then frank gave word from window discharge be poured into crowded mass stepping back from balcony to load men ran out fired again a soon a be ready while through upper part of open window shower of bullet flew into room bringing down portion of ceiling smashing looking glass striking thickly against back wall several of party have fallen in first two three minute frank taking one of musket ammunition be working with rest when woman whom have posted below ran up to say that be attacking door that be already yielding two three shot fired through keyhole have indeed broken lock be only furniture piled against kept in place already by instruction woman have brought out on to landing sofa chest of drawer other article to form barricade there

assailant a fell be dragged out number of men rushed in began to pull down furniture behind now frank party opened fire aiming coolly steadily soldier rushed in in such number that soon gave word party ran upstairs covered by fire of comrade climbed up over barricade on to landing here defended desperately enemy thronged staircase who be in front using bayonet while men in passage below fired over head at defender momentarily little band decreased in number until two remained on foot by side of frank woman knowing that mercy must be shown picked up musket of fallen fired into face of men trying to pull down scale barricade end be close at hand when there came tremendous crash blinding smoke dust house shook to foundation for moment dead silence took place of din have before prevailed frank two companion have be thrown down by shock half stunned ignorant of what have happened struggled to foot left hand hung helpless by side took pistol have reserved for last extremity from belt looked over barricade at first must see nothing so dense be smoke dust a cleared away little gave exclamation of surprise thankfulness stair be gone thank god said turning round to woman behind who be standing paralysed by explosion shock be safe stair have gone still must scarce understand what have happened until saw yawning hole in wall near stair then understood what have taken place ship of war be again at work bombarding town one of shell have passed through house exploded under stair carrying away with upon below be chaos of block of stone mingled with body of late assailant while

farther will be safe fire will take time to reach there enemy column may have passed across end of street before be driven out woman heard what said with composure terror of past three day have excited nerve of whole population to point of tension that news of fresh danger be received almost with apathy went down quietly to bring up child valuable with one woman brought pair of step greatly facilitated passage of remaining wall one of wounded men have by time so far recovered that be able with assistance to cross without being lifted over in blanket fresh contingent of fugitive here

hand that kingdom sicily together to king that until must do so must remain dictator of sicily there can be doubt that determination be wise one for a afterwards happened at naples must have be altogether put aside by royalist commissioner general plan must have be thwarted in way hindrance offered to invasion of mainland just a have be to expedition to sicily cavour sent over farina to act in name of king admiral persano who with portion of italian navy be now at palermo persuaded garibaldi to allow farina to assume position of governor while allowing garibaldi gave to understand that be to attend solely to financial civil affair farina first move however be to have enormous number of placard that have brought with stuck over city sent to town of island with word vote for immediate annexation under rule of victor emmanuel sicilian knew cared anything for victor emmanuel whose very name be almost unknown to peasant be garibaldi who have delivered be perfectly ready to accept form of government that recommended garibaldi at once told farina that must not allow such proceeding latter maintained that be there under authority of king must take step chose whereupon general sent at once for party of troop who seized carried on board persano ship with advice that must quit island at once put effectual stop to several intrigue to reap entire fruit of garibaldi effort frank have passed weary time wound have be serious one at first surgeon have thought that must be necessary to amputate limb garibaldi however who in spite of many occupation found time to come in twice day for few minute talk with urged before operating to try mean to save arm two week after frank received wound care have be bestowed upon own excellent constitution enabled to state confidently that need no longer have anxiety upon account a recovery be now question of time general thanked frank for early information sent by of bosco arrival for defence of house a reward for other service promoted to rank of captain fortnight later be so far convalescent that must move about with arm in sling have already regained most of bodily strength by end of second week in july be again on horseback be then delighted when on july th heard that garibaldi be going to start at once to assist medici who with cosenz have advanced to within twenty mile of messina have have skirmish with force of six thousand five hundred picked troop with powerful artillery neapolitan who be commanded by general bosco have now taken up very strong position near town fortress of milazzo colonel corti arrived at palermo on day with nine hundred men in american ship have left genoa at same time a medici vessel be captured by neapolitan men of war towed into naples where be anchored under gun of fort lay there for twenty two day when strong remonstrance of american minister forced government of naples to allow to leave now arrived just in time for on board to take part in operation garibaldi embarked portion of on british merchantman have chartered proceeded on board with staff next day landed at port of patti twenty mile from milazzo on th joined medici force strong brigade have be sent by land have not yet arrived garibaldi determined to attack at once position of neapolitan force be very strong one right extended across front of fortress of milazzo be protected by artillery approach be hidden by cactus hedge screened defender from view must not be penetrated by attacking force except after cutting down with sword ax centre be posted across road leading along shore face be defended by strong wall have be loopholed in front of ground be covered with thick growth of cane through be scarcely possible for men to force way neapolitan left be stationed in line of house lying at right angle to centre therefore capable of maintaining flanking fire on force advancing to attack garibaldians suffered from very great disadvantage of being ignorant of nature of ground of enemy position neapolitan being completely hidden from view by cactus hedge cane brake garibaldi have intended to attack before daylight various corp be so widely scattered that be broad day before fight began a soon a force have assembled advanced across plain be covered with tree vineyard a approached enemy position be received with heavy fire by unseen foe for hour fight went on in vain garibaldians attempted to reach hidden enemy for time gathered rushed forward be met by so heavy fire that be forced to retire left wing indeed gave way altogether fell back distance from battle field centre right where garibaldi with medici many of best officer be fighting still persevered at one o'clock garibaldi sent off several of officer to endeavour to rally bring up of scattered detachment of left wing after lot of hard work returned with considerable force garibaldi at head of sixty picked men made way along shore until unobserved reached point on flank of enemy left wing then pouring in heavy volley dashed forward captured gun drove neapolitan from line of defence suddenly however squadron of enemy cavalry fell upon garibaldians drove back in disorder garibaldi be forced off road into ditch four trooper attacked defended with sword until missori one of aide de camp rode up shot three of dragoon other troop who have be following at distance now came up together advanced driving before defender of enemy entrenchment until losing heart broke into flight towards town panic spread at point garibaldians burst through defence in spite of fire of gun of fortress pursued flying enemy into town here sanguinary contest be maintained for hour at last neapolitan troop be driven into fortress now that town have be evacuated by own men opened fire upon gunner be however much harassed by deadly fire maintained by peard companion of whom be armed with rifle of best pattern while gun of garibaldian frigate played upon sea face of fortress position be in fact untenable general bosco knew that assistance must reach for greater portion of neapolitan troop have already withdrawn from island little fortress be crowded with troop have small supply of provision three day later hoisted white flag sent one of officer into town to negotiate term of surrender be speedily concluded ammunition mule used by artillery transport be left behind troop be to be allowed to march with firearm down to wharf there to be conveyed on board ship in harbour landed on mainland frank have not taken part in battle of milazzo have cost garibaldians over thousand in killed wounded for have be despatched by garibaldi when latter went on board ship at palermo to general bixio who be in centre of island to inform of general advance to state probably must be in messina in week said that little time must elapse before arrangement for passage across to mainland must be effected that bixio be to continue to stamp out communistic movement have burst out in several of town there to scatter band of brigand be fortnight after frank arrival to march with force to messina frank must have much preferred to accompany general latter said doubt percival must have liked to go with one must be sent choice have fallen upon have chosen because in first place be father son have already distinguished greatly have fought a fearlessly a steadily a best of old follower surely must be impossible for to give higher praise than in next place be not yet fit for hard work of campaign mantoni tell that will be week before arm will be strong again though bone have healed better than have expected after serious injury received in gallant defence of house when bosco entered town even have not be for think that have done more than share there be many ardent spirit who have arrived from mainland who have not yet have chance of striking blow for country be fair that must have opportunity moreover mother sent out on special mission first to hand to noble gift secondly to search prison in town might occupy for father possibly husband knew that going with must share in peril honour of campaign have done so gloriously in way have done enough grievous indeed must be to have to write to good mother to say that son have sent have be killed father have be victim for italian liberty husband have if suspicion be well founded sacrificed by fearlessness with exposed iniquity of tyrant prison house must be too cruel that must be deprived of son also regard a certain that will not find seek in prison of island a saw when opened door here there be prisoner from mainland among confined there will be with when cross strait be there that mission will really begin be best that must reserve for that battle go to fight now will be last will be needed to secure at least independence of sicily doubt much whether when have once crossed will have to fight a hard a have done here landed handful will land on mainland over twenty thousand strong enemy despised then will fear now thank general must not have thought of questioning order whatever might have be felt for moment little disappointment be not to take part in next battle will start at once to join general bixio will be necessary for to stay with till march to messina can ride for city when have delivered order in can consult own wish be assured that will not attempt to cross strait until bixio join must say that must find more interesting with than doing routine work at messina moreover must remember that population there be not united in favour a be here be doubtless glad to be free agent of revolutionist have be at work among a know with such success have be obliged to send bixio with division to suppress disorder have arisen have not freed sicily to hand over to mazzini agent that will form part of united italy under victor emmanuel still there be enough excitement existing there to render somewhat hazardous for one of officer to ride alone through country think that must be much better for therefore to remain with bixio chapter x with bixio just a ship carrying garibaldi follower weighed anchor frank rode out from palermo road be best in island arrived late that evening at polizzi distance of forty mile from palermo on following day halted at traina here found detachment of bixio brigade be commanded by rubini who welcomed most cordially who must have thought of seeing percival surely general be not coming way started yesterday to join medici give battle to bosco who have seven thousand picked troop at milazzo have sent here with order for bixio be enough to make one tear one hair rubini said to think that be out of well have done share rubini although be disappointed at first admit that be only fair that men who have done fighting must have turn have lost about third of number most of have be wounded medici corp have never fired shot yet have of cosenz will have share again when cross to calabria now what be doing here be scattered about in small detachment giving sharp lesson whenever get chance to revolutionist who be revolutionist be agent of revolutionary committee be of mazzini fanatic seems that several party of be landed on east coast to get up row on own account just a farina have be trying to induce country to throw over garibaldi declare for victor emmanuel of whom people know nothing for whom care le agent have be trying to get to declare for republic have certainly have more success than farina have there be nothing tangible in idea of king while when poor fool be told that republic mean that land property of rich be to be handed over to poor programme have attraction at rate have attraction for brigand of whom at best of time there be always number in forest on slope of etna have doubt that money be freely distributed among to inflame zeal several house of well to do citizen country proprietor have be looted something like reign of terror have begun before bixio brigade marched to restore order see there be great many more of band in forest than usual after rising in winter be suppressed very many of who took part in dared not return to home so fled to hill better class of men came in a soon a capture of palermo made safe for to do so company of have be formed be now with bixio believe that others have enlisted with medici still there be good many of lower class who joined in rising still among hill in rebellion like insurgent must be divided into two class one true patriot other men who join in hope of plunder discontented riffraff of town life in mountain offer great attraction to in first place have to work for living in next there be always chance of carrying off rich proprietor getting large ransom for therefore go to swell rank of men who have for year set authority of island at defiance have terrorised people dwelling on plain at foot of etna just at present men call republican have not be for bixio arrival must have established perfect reign of terror here have shot good many believe bixio have also given sharp lesson at rate presence here have effectually stopped game of revolutionist in town village on plain will be long time indeed before brigandage can be suppressed of course there be intention of attempting such business now will be work must be undertaken by government when italy have achieved freedom feel in position to turn attention to putting down band have for year past may almost say for century be disgrace to land be here solely to put stop to revolutionary movement just a garibaldi put stop to royal movement by sending farina out of island where be bixio have be sweeping through small town village round foot of mountain will afternoon believe arrive at bronte have be headquarters of revolutionary business expect will put foot heavily on men who have be foremost in stirring people up there bixio be just man for work know that one sharp lesson impress mind of people like sicilian have far more effect than lenient measure verbal reproof have to be taught that be not for to meddle in affair of state matter must be left to representative in parliament government of country petty authority of little town come to regard a important personage indulge in prating on public affair instead of minding own business in case be to do best to give protection to people in district against incursion of band of brigand suppose go on to morrow yes will start at daybreak be not many hour ride have about score of mounted men here percival will send four of with surely there be occasion for frank said well know think there be there be large band so far a know down in plain at present of gang have broken up especially came from mainland have not a yet taken to mountain go about perpetrating crime at detached house on traveller meet need not say that at present animosity to red shirt be bitter that in revenge for comrade who have be shot hanged must certainly kill of on whom must lay hand so must be better for to have four men a escort might a well be doing that a anything else for just at present there be nothing going on about here be a dull a must be in small garrison town in northern italy how long do suppose will be before join garibaldi at messina not for little time think if medici defeat bosco at milazzo a suppose will will at once go on to messina message to bixio be that must take time to make preparation for crossing to mainland that until sends word to general to join be to continue work of stamping out movement in restoring order in reorganising municipal authority in placing administration of town village in hand of well affected men so that there can be chance of mazzini party causing serious disturbance again after have left see still wear arm in sling yes mantoni told that must not be safe to take out of splint for month have hope that when did so must be able to use though must not put too much strain on of course be nuisance have reason to be thankful for be afraid for time be going to lose altogether be grand thing defence of house percival be grand thing that shell struck stair just when did for minute must have seen end of defence of life a be that explosion saved four of for wounded men carried off be convalescent also life of five woman eight child for exasperated a neapolitan be must assuredly have shown more mercy there than did in other house entered have be well rewarded for garibaldi have made captain sarto maffio returned at moment three heartily congratulated frank on promotion have be away with small detachment to village three mile distant in search of man who have be one of most prominent in stirring up peasantry have left before got there spent pleasant evening together in morning frank started with four mounted men rode to bronte just a approached town heard several volley of musketry on inquiry found that thirty men who have be captured on march caught in hiding in town have be shot be stranger revolutionary agent brigand on inquiring for general found that have just gone to town hall where have ordered municipal authority principal citizen to meet putting up horse went there first bixio have just begun to speak if have done duty said a well a men who have be stirring up riot revolution must be lying dead outside town be scandalous that men who have be elected by fellow for maintenance of order good government in town district must allow yourselves to be terrified into obedience by handful of agitator instead of calling out men capable of bearing arm suppressing sedition at once have failed miserably in duty man who came a deliverer be now in hour of battle weakened by being compelled to send part of army to suppress disorder at have connived private citizen be scarcely le to blame when saw that men be allowing brigandage robbery to go on unchecked making speech subversive of order instead of doing duty must have taken matter into own hand expelled from office disgraced appointed worthier men a representative spoke to officer standing by who went out returned with twenty soldier who have be drawn up outside hall bixio remained silent during absence now said captain silvio will arrest syndic municipal councillor march off to prison may think fortunate order to be shot for conniving at sedition permitting brigand to carry on work of crime with impunity soldier surrounded men pointed out marched away with now sir bixio then went on to private citizen will at once placard town with notice that most worthy loyal man in town whoever may be be nominated by a syndic that twelve others of loyal true men be appointed municipal councillor leave to to make choice mind that be good one of course wish men of standing influence to be appointed one absolute qualification be that will be men who have shown opposed to conduct of who will pas next six month in prison who can be trusted to maintain law order with strong hand to punish malefactor to carry out order may receive from general garibaldi dictator of island of sicily let have name of men have chosen in course of hour will have inquiry made a to character reputation of before confirming appointment have nothing more to say men retired looking greatly crestfallen bixio turning round saw for first time frank who have quietly taken up place behind young fellow have be great favourite of ever since saw on occasion of first visit to garibaldi ah percival be glad to see that must be here be proof that arm be getting stronger suppose be here on duty yes sir knowing rumour of various kind might reach general have sent to tell that have started with portion of cosenz men to reinforce medici to attack bosco at milazzo considers that will have sufficient force for purpose if not will in couple of day after arrives there be joined by rest of cosenz command who be proceeding by land after beating bosco will go on to messina will take considerable time to make preparation needful for expedition to mainland wish to continue work here to put down disorder to organise establish strong loyal municipal district council in part of island so that when advance need have cause for anxiety for state of affair here will send ample notice when be in readiness for invasion of calabria must like to be at milazzo bixio said a be now impossible must prefer remaining here until garibaldi be ready to start to hanging about messina for week sort of thing be very bad for young troop here get plenty of marching certain amount of drill day in month six week even latest recruit who arrived before left palermo will be fit to take part in battle by side of veteran be to stay with to go on to messina have explicit order sir from what general said gathered that thought better for to stay at rate for present with doctor said that must keep arm in sling for time to come although did not ride here at great speed feel sharp twinge in think must wait few day before mount again after will be happy to carry out order perform duty with may think fit to intrust quite right percival will of course be attached to staff while be with will set to easy work when consider fit to undertake now have put thing in train here will make headquarters for time will be sending party to hill know that village there be terrorised by brigand although be hopeless to try to stamp fellow out may strike few blow at worst of be that peasantry be in alliance with other half know that be a much a life be worth to give information a to brigand movement so to large extent will have to trust to luck when be able to ride again will send off with one of party for be sure that air of slope of etna will do immense deal towards setting up again while heat in plain be very trying especially to who be not in robust health be unaccustomed to climate like be hot frank said started journey very early in morning stopped for five six hour in middle of day think that even in way heat have taken good deal more out of than fatigue of riding have doubt be so must recommend for next week to rise at daybreak lie down at rate keep within door between ten eleven five in afternoon then take gentle exercise again enjoy until eleven twelve o'clock at night even native of island keep indoors a far a possible during heat of day at time of year if find necessary be still more so for suppose came through traina last night yes sir be very glad to find rubini other two friend there next week passed pleasantly bixio be often away making flying visit to town village where have left detachment a there be several of officer of force at bronte who have crossed in same ship with from genoa by whose side have fought at calatafimi palermo frank have very pleasant society indeed a majority of force be men of good family education there be when off duty little distinction of rank with tie of good comradeship of danger fatigue borne in common there be none of stiffness exclusiveness that necessarily prevail in regular army of original thousand knew frank well have heard how largely expedition be indebted for success to aid mother have sent how have distinguished in fighting welcomed everywhere with utmost cordiality early in morning always went for walk be usually accompanied by one two of acquaintance who happened to be off duty after taking meal generally spent evening sitting in open air in front of principal cafe eating ice drinking coffee chatting with officer who gathered there at end of week no longer felt even passing pain in arm reported to bixio that be ready for work again not hard work general said can give employment will suit be calling in rubini detachment from traina where thing be settling down will send fifty men under command to village of latinano be three thousand foot above sea will find much more cool pleasant there than be here other village on about same line will also be occupied brigand have found that be no longer safe to come down into plain be going to push a far up slope a can possibly may then be able to obtain information from peasant below line a to principal haunt of fellow in mountain at present village be going to occupy be used by brigand whom people regard a good customer though ill treat murder without mercy suspect of being hostile to be of course to interest to keep well with majority to pay for what want terror will do good deal towards keeping men mouth shut anything like general ill treatment of population must soon drive somebody to betray of course hitherto brigand have have little fear of treachery commander of bourbon troop have disposition to enter upon toilsome expedition offered small prospect of success merely to avenge wrong of peasant now matter have changed be not only willing eager to suppress band seeing that be in of peasantry may pluck up heart enough to endeavour to get rid of who at present hold at mercy however own have very great hope that will be so there exists have existed for many year association called mafia extends over whole island comprises men of class from highest to lowest exercise terrible power one save leader know who be member therefore distrust neighbour murder be committed one may be perfectly well aware who be author yet one dare say word if by chance carabinieri knowing assassin have standing feud with victim lay hand upon organisation set to work judge may be member if not speedily receives intimation that own life will be forfeited if murderer be condemned be seldom that be necessary jailor be bribed terrorised when time come for to be brought to trial be found that have mysteriously escaped in few case where man be brought into court witness dare appear against be certain to be acquitted be scandalous state of thing one may hope will be changed when italy be free able to attend to domestic affair at present organisation be powerful so that see be not only vengeance of brigand power of mafia seal men mouth enables criminal to carry on proceeding with little fear of arm of law be much obliged to for sending up with rubini frank said will greatly enjoy mountain air hardly see that can be of much service there not much perhaps will fit to do duty when land in calabria rubini corp be like rest composed partly of men who have seen service before with few of thousand with be large proportion of fresh arrival a brave doubt a others without experience will at time make excursion if can obtain news of party of brigand being in neighbourhood in case will naturally take men can most rely upon will request when be away to intrust command of left in village to who be one of thousand be captain a heard with much pleasure in letter from garibaldi on general staff a showed how stoutly must defend house against overwhelming force must certainly hold village with fifteen twenty men against number of brigand who might try to take advantage of absence of portion of force to attack remained there however be not likely that anything of sort will take place brigand be not fond of fighting unless there be ample booty to be obtained though might endeavour to avenge loss have sustained by sudden attack if thought must take wholly unawares rubini will arrive here with corp to morrow afternoon will start next day with detachment other half will go to malfi village ten mile from latinano be looking better rubini said a frank met when company piled arm in principal square in town said be all right when saw other day be not looking so be feeling ride arm be hurting bit however ten day rest have set right again be quite equal to moderate work do know what be going to do have only order to march in here to day well can tell several detachment of fifty men be going up to village three thousand foot up slope of company be to be divided into two with half of be to go to latinano other half to malfi place ten mile from lieutenant pasco will take other wing to malfi be going with well in case will not mind though will not be lively there unless have brush with brigand will at rate be great deal cooler than traina be oven for six hour day be going a second in command to certain extent yes bixio said that a must be good for fighting at present be to take command of village when be away brigand hunting said that naturally must take best men for work leave of who have have a yet experience in fighting to take care of village well must not be left in better hand than yours rubini said heartily will be very glad to have with at daybreak next morning rubini little column got into motion frank be only mounted officer took place by side of bixio who marched at head of column rise be steady though occasionally came to steeper place there be pause with exception of couple of halt for few minute reached latinano at eleven o'clock having be nearly seven hour on way there be demonstration of welcome when arrived did expect doubtless such of villager a felt glad to see march in must be afraid to show openly a must assuredly suffer be to do so when troop marched away again rubini at once quartered men in two three among house with frank a lieutenant accepted invitation of priest whose house be best in village to stay there be not like palazzo at palermo percival rubini laughed can scarcely expect that on mount etna at rate be vast improvement on camping ground on plain priest set before what provision have in house assured that must provide better for in future rubini however knowing how poor be priest of mountain village told that although thankfully accepted hospitality on occasion must in future cater for have said two waggon following will be up by evening have idea of imposing men upon inhabitant of village who assuredly must hardly fill fifty additional mouth have brought with flour wine other necessary doubt will be able to purchase sheep goat from people who by way did not appear to be very much pleased at arrival must not blame signor in first place be poor once when detachment of bourbon troop came up here devoured everything paid for nothing happily only stayed for week village must have be ruined after tale have be spread of lawlessness of garibaldi troop must have feared that even worse than what before happened be about to befall hing tell lie of rubini said angrily never since landed at marsala have taken mouthful of food without paying for unless have be spontaneously offered to a be when be fighting at palermo have doubt that what say be true signor poor people have be taught to believe otherwise so be hardly to blame if did not evince lively joy at arrival moreover know how long be going to stay here be well aware that who show satisfaction at coming who afford aid hospitality beyond dare not refuse will be reported to brigand who will take terrible revenge after have left village can understand position be not comfortable one rubini said people of district have largely brought upon say that be in position to resist large party of brigand sympathy seems to be everywhere with scoundrel afford information in power screen in way give false information to carabinieri hinder course of justice people who act thus must not be surprised if be regarded a ally of band must put up with inconvenience of having troop quartered upon may think fortunate that consequence be worse at present be not here to act against brigand alone a work must be postponed until other matter be settled government have time to turn attention to rooting out state of thing be disgraceful to country be here now a agent of general garibaldi dictator of sicily to suppress not crime stirring up of insurrection revolt against existing government of island heartily wish that must be rooted out priest said can assure that whose work lie in mountain village feel evil consequence to full a much a who work in town village lying round foot of mountain be not that people suffer so greatly in pocket for most part be too poor to be robbed few be better off pay yearly contribution a long a do so be left in peace while better class down in plain be liable at time to be seized compelled to pay perhaps to save life harm be rather to soul than to body a say sympathy be wholly with brigand come to regard a hero to think lightly of terrible crime commit upon others not infrequently young man more enterprising than rest one who have perhaps stabbed rival in love have be drawn for service in army take to hill join for so doing incurs reprobation whatever be sad state of thing trust that when general have settled other matter in island will employ whole force in campaign against brigand be not work to be taken up by small party evil have grown to such dimension that nothing short of army must root out indeed must only then be accomplished by month of patient work so extensive be forest so great facility for concealment will fall to other hand than garibaldi father mission be to deliver sicily mainland from bourbon rule then to hand over to victor emmanuel who free king over free nation will be able to remove abuse have flourished under bourbon a for be soldier without pay fighting for love of country when have done work freed from oppressor will return to home leave to king parliament regular army to put down such abuse a brigandage suppose father must hardly be fair to ask if there be many of fellow in neighbourhood priest smiled mind telling that there be band of fifty of within five mile of place yesterday morning be known that several detachment of troop must march from bronte at daybreak that destination be mountain have doubt that news be carried to band hour later by time be probably twenty mile away up in forest in direction have idea do know what plan be may be that so long a village be held will move round to other side of etna may be that several of band will unite attack one other of party not for what think must get a lesson that must be better to leave alone must say that except by pure accident be not likely to catch sight of brigand unless indeed one come down here a shepherd from hill to make small purchase to gather news think be likely to be result of journey rubini laughed nevertheless being here will have served purpose so long a other detachment be up here brigand will not care to venture into plain will agent of revolution who be with if do be not likely to get safely back again may tell that signal have be arranged by smoke from hill top near bronte will give information that of band have passed down mountain direction in have gone that in be retiring fancy will hardly regain mountain without being intercepted by one other of party be true that will not remain here very long by time go there will be very different system established throughout island will find in future that can no longer get friend abettor among local authority will have to meet active resistance that plunder can not be obtained without fighting that even when obtained will not be carried off to hill without hot pursuit being maintained will be glad indeed if be so priest said if people of town village will combine be actively supported by small body of troop in town will deal far heavier blow to brigandage than can be effected by sending flying expedition into mountain chapter xi hazardous expedition fancy percival that brigand be far more likely to find than be to find rubini said on following morning when frank strolled out into village can expect information from people a to marching about on off chance of lighting upon must be simply absurd on other hand brigand will know by time where detachment be quartered what be strength must be furious at loss have have down in plain forty fifty of have be killed in fight over hundred shot at bronte other town must be burning for vengeance can not help thinking that of band be likely to unite attack of post even if came couple of hundred strong might feel pretty safe of beating off if ventured by daylight sudden attack at night might be extremely serious very serious indeed frank agreed scattered a men be through village must be shot down a came out of house be awkward position certainly rubini said one see way out of must say rubini best thing must do must be to quarter in church must be very serious step rubini said gravely know that one of great weapon neapolitan have used against be that be heretic atheist be to occupy church report must circulate through island that be desecrators spread that sort of report whether there be foundation for not rubini besides at palermo used several of church a hospital for wounded there must be occasion for to live take meal in church to interfere with service if keep dozen sentry round village need not fear surprise during daytime must go on a usual in house where be quartered taking meal there so on then at night must retire to church sleep there securely with couple of sentry posted at door think be very good idea at rate will tell priest when go in to breakfast hear what say be good fellow think though of course hand be very much tied by position be placed in after have eaten breakfast rubini went with frank to priest room padre said like position here be certain that brigand have reason to love that after number who have be put out of way down below must be thirsting for revenge be certainly to be expected priest said gravely therefore think be by mean unlikely that several of band will unite in attack on one of post hinted a much a to last night did padre more think of more probable seems to that be what will do may be post feel that although must beat off attack in daytime must be most serious be to fall upon at night when be scattered throughout village must certainly be so signor consequence must think be most grave therefore padre intend to retire to church evening between ourselves captain rubini be not sorry that have made that proposal rather have announced to intention of doing so will understand that be suggestion must not come from bow to decision having mean of resisting that being understood can say frankly that think plan wise one hope that intend to occupy during day to eat drink there simply to pas night in shelter of wall at other time service can be held a usual certainly be intention wish to put people to inconvenience to abstain a far a possible from doing aught must hurt feeling by a must consider desecrating church thing will simply go on a do now in daytime at nightfall will march into church place two sentry at door in morning will leave after placing everything in order a far a can at quarter to six so that can hold morning mass at usual hour be well pleased with arrangement must people others complain of thus using church can say that be proposal of mine that did not ask opinion on subject simply informed of intention of course have power to combat may tell have sure intelligence that brigand meditate attempt here at other village where party of troop have gone knowing people a do think very likely that attack may be made well wisher of general of great movement be convinced that people can never be raised from present condition so long a be subject to government of naples believe that with freedom island must advance not only in prosperity in orderly life blessing of civilisation none will hail more heartily than establishment of constitutional government such a be enjoyed by portion of italy under rule of victor emmanuel still so long a thing exist a do in mountain must do more harm than good be to declare feeling speak not of personal danger must lose power influence over flock therefore though heartily wishing well can not openly aid will on sunday speak from pulpit pointing out that conduct of soldier show that report have be circulated regarding be untrue that come here with evil intention towards trust when retire will carry with good wish of hope above thing nothing will occur will cause trouble still le evil to guest for not only have given occasion for animosity if harm befall here may be sure that general at bronte will send up strong body of troop who will probably burn village to ground shoot man catch must say signor that word must be more likely to have effect be of soldier perhaps one of yourselves to attend mass daily must show that be not a have be told despisers of religion go far to remove unfavourable impression with can not deny that be regarded suggestion be good one sir rubini said will see that be carried out will come morning captain percival be englishman what must call heretic so will know undertake to be on duty about hour then quite understand other padre openly protest against using church privately approve of doing so protest will not be strong one priest said with smile indeed will tell people that although have thought duty to protest formally can not see that be best that must be so a will ensure peace tranquillity in village will do away with risk of broil when men sit drinking after dark in wine shop when church bell rang for midday mass villager be surprised to see rubini enter edifice that twenty of men straggled in not a body ordered to take part in service a if be regular custom a individual to attend service before bell ceased ringing frank also went in sat down by rubini when left together at close of short service rubini said did not expect to see percival why not frank replied if there be protestant church of course must go to a there be not come here surely be better to say one prayer in church of religion that on main point differs slightly from own than to abstain from going to church at now what be to do with suppose can hardly start for long walk must think not rubini said grimly at least not without taking twenty men with be a likely a not that be watched from forest if be to go out alone might be pounced upon by fellow lying in ambush for at best get bullet through head at best frank laughed certainly at best rubini replied gravely must be better to die with bullet through one head than to fall into hand of vindictive scoundrel who must certainly select much slower more painful way of putting end to existence there must be walking about beyond edge of village then in fact rubini journey up here be to be mere useless promenade be afraid so there be only one hope may be taken a fact that in band of scoundrel whether be robber conspirator bandit there be sure to be one two discontented spirit men who think that ought to have be chosen a chief that advice have be slighted that share of plunder be insufficient must opportunity occur men like be always ready to turn traitor if think that can do so with safety suppose that band in mountain be exception indeed chance of dissent be larger than usual for may be sure that brigand men who have be sent over from mainland to foment discontent create counter revolution in favour of republic be greatly dissatisfied with result of joint undertaking prompt step garibaldi took in sending bixio division here must have upset plan guerrilla doubt have taken considerable amount of booty must have be done without aid of stranger latter counted on doing great thing with assistance of brigand have failed altogether good many of section have be killed must imagine at present time that there be not much love lost between be therefore quite possible that of men be perfectly ready to betray rest regard a on card may get message to effect that one of will if promised pardon handsome reward conduct to rendezvous where band be gathered in case must not return empty handed in respect be better that must get at way than in other for knowledge that one of band have be destroyed by treachery on part of member must cause feeling of distrust uneasiness in gang in mountain man must begin to suspect other man of being traitor although fear of being followed killed of being denounced a traitor murdered perhaps day perhaps week perhaps even month afterwards certainly day other must keep band together yet must lose heart in business quarrel must break out desperate fight must take place many of party must finally break up while others must for considerable time at least undertake fresh enterprise four day passed without incident hour after sunset men marched to church musket be piled inside be then permitted to sit on step outside smoking talking until nine o'clock when sentry be posted men lay down inside late on following afternoon a rubini with sergeant be at end of village woman standing half hidden in bush short distance away motioned to that wanted to speak to there might be dozen men hidden in bush rubini said let turn off go to shed beckon to to come to if stand close to one will see speaking to woman hesitated for time evidently afraid to leave shelter of bush then making sign to rubini that must join presently went back into wood in short time came out on other side walked couple of hundred yard away then turned made wide circuit keeping a much a possible in shelter at last joined be wild looking creature hair be in disorder face bore sign of tear clothes be torn in several place a if have run recklessly through thick wood might have cried a came at present flushed face fierce eye tightly compressed lip quick breathing spoke of passion rather than grief what do want with rubini asked illustration in excitement fell on knee have come to ask for vengeance woman panted prato have afternoon shot husband for what merely because said that if band be not going to do anything must return home be prato drew pistol shot antonio can not bring to life again can avenge signor band of prato most merciless most famous of chief lie five mile away will lead to place must swear to that will show mercy if take prisoner will escape judge in island dare convict jailor must dare keep door shut must have life blood unless will swear will not take to a for others care not must like to be killed for laughed when prato shot antonio like dog bargain not for do a will with prato must die ask reward must not touch blood money ask only for vengeance in excitement fell on knee waving arm above head poured down string of malediction upon brigand chief can promise that will not be taken prisoner rubini said villain have committed score of murder might escape will fight to last woman said be devil be coward must find difficult to escape fire be lit at foot of crag if approach on side in front must fight how many men have thirty seven counting signor will take by surprise can shoot down many before can fire shot what do think zippo rubini asked drawing comrade two three pace aside man be one of most notorious brigand in mountain there have be big reward offered for dead alive for year past must be grand service if must destroy band must earn gratitude of town village below there yes must be grand exploit sergeant said eagerly for to accomplish what neapolitan troop carabinieri have so long failed to do per baccho 't be glorious stroke of luck be what think rubini said then went to woman be ready to aid to avenge husband said know way through forest in dark know well prato band have be in neighbourhood for month past have be in here score of time to buy provision there be two three path by might go know of if like can carry lantern until be within mile of forest go well nigh up to cliff will not start till nine o'clock rubini said at time men withdraw into church can move out by door of vestry behind one in village will dream that of have left place will be at door five minute after clock strike will be there woman said fiercely turning shaking fist in direction from have come a frank be strolling up street met two friend for zippo be cousin of captain have very important news to give percival rubini said a met wo tell here for people loitering about might notice be talking seriously suspect that something out of way have occurred let walk down quietly to other end of village out of earshot of of house until get there let chat of other matter arm still go on well must not be better five six day of mountain air have done end of good have not felt single twinge in arm believe must use for ordinary purpose now with perfect safety be pretty little child be if face be clean must doubt if have ever be really washed must certainly say that hair have never be combed there little beggar know be speaking of did see how scowled have evidently picked up popular sentiment concerning when fairly beyond village rubini told story will be splendid said why capture of prato must cause almost a much sensation in sicily a taking of palermo yes must be grand thing frank agreed be quite sure rubini that story be true one not feint to draw into ambush be perfectly convinced of woman earnestness percival so must have be have seen do not agree with zippo certainly have not slightest doubt in mind a to fact that be speaking truth well if be perfectly satisfied frank said there can be doubt that must be great service to destroy fellow band how many men do propose to take with must certainly take a strong force a possible brigand be desperate fellow when cornered well there must be occasion to leave many men with frank said a must doubt get away unnoticed must be supposed that whole force be a usual in church if leave five good men will be quite satisfied when have gone will barricade door must hold out stoutly for long time there be very little woodwork about place if be driven into belfry must not burn out however might be wise precaution if be to tell three four of men to buy couple of loaf apiece skin of wine a will be dusk before go a usual to church step must bring with without being noticed will do a suggest percival really think that be carrying precaution beyond what be necessary will not be expensive precaution frank replied with smile then think five men must be sufficient rubini asked so far a be concerned see why must not take be ordered to assume command of men left here did not imply that force be always to be broken up certainly be willing to remain here by must infinitely rather go with night march through dark forest must be more serious for than going into pitched battle for if be to trip fall must certainly smash arm again see why must leave here five men even ten must be of great use for business like yours musket may be of advantage will certainly feel very anxious about while be away can quite believe that a say woman be perfectly in earnest when be missed from camp after murder of husband suspicion that have come here to tell where be encamped might very well occur to might find vigilant prepared for may be so rubini agreed well then a villager here will not know that have left until be back again think will take forty five men leave with five will pick men must like to have sarto maffio if can spare a to other three leave to entirely yes can have two be thoroughly good men a well a good fellow a for others will pick out three of best of who last joined must like a many of old hand with a possible for know that will keep head happens be not until men be gathered round church door a usual that rubini told of expedition on be about to start news excited general satisfaction there have be little doing since palermo be taken old hand be eager for fray while who have more recently joined burned to show that be worthy to be comrade of garibaldi first follower at nine o'clock came into church a usual ten minute later detachment with exception of frank little command moved silently out through vestry door so be to stay behind with sarto said a maffio joined frank who have taken seat be thinking over course must be pursued if rubini enterprise turned out badly rubini said that specially asked for be doubt compliment one if mind saying so must gladly have dispensed with will be nuisance indeed watching here night while others be engaged in business quite after own heart be sure that must feel rather annoyed frank said must not have liked to be here without at least two men on whom know can rely to last what can there be for to do sarto asked in surprise at tone in frank spoke know be just what know sarto acknowledge that by mean like expedition rubini zippo be certain that woman be acting in perfect good faith did not see therefore can only take opinion may have be only acting know how passionate woman be seems to possible that thinking what must have done have husband be shot by prato might have worked up into such state one must doubt reality of story of course say that be so only say that be possible in next place even if story be perfectly true may have be seen to leave camp if passed out unobserved by of absence must be noticed might be followed interview with rubini observed in case band may either have moved away when got news what be more likely be prepared to attack rubini column on way mentioned possibility to rubini that woman absence might have be noticed band be uneasy in consequence on look out although in way shook determination to take advantage of offer must be sure take precaution in power still there be saying how thing will turn out may be that if brigand anticipate attack may by time have sent to party to tell that greater part of detachment will be away invite to come finish with men left here while tackle who have gone out against certainly look possible in way put maffio said though hope may not turn out so however see that will at rate have something to think about while be away so be what that bread wine brought in be for rubini asked two others to bring in couple of loaf other to bring in skin of wine of course thought that be for use of expedition asked to do so maffio rather laughed at idea seemed to possible that might be of use here while be away at rate will guarantee that food will not be wasted six of including must not hold church long not against great effort even if must take advantage of absence of part of force to attack must not know how strong party have be left behind must be cautious for bit suppose that must be able to resist determined onslaught thought that might take to tower must hold that for hour yes must do sarto said confidently well at suppose that be going to be disturbed be satisfaction to feel that be not altogether out of affair a usual dozen candle have be lighted in different part of church a soon a be dark three genoese who have joined company after capture of palermo looked sulky downcast at being left behind frank called to have doubt that be disappointed gentleman said must really take a compliment asked captain rubini to leave in addition to two friend here three best men must pick out from who have not formed part of original force have doubt that have done so may tell that consider possible say probable that may be attacked will first see what step must be taken in case have not be up to tower have of none of have mounted there then let investigate said campanile stood at north west corner of church have exterior door opening into church taking couple of candle entered by latter mounted stone staircase leading to lower story of tower beyond wooden staircase led to rough wooden floor under bell to flat terrace above first thing to do frank said be to block up outside door at rate let have look at be roughly made very strong door be well enough doubt whether lock must not give under heavy blow might pile chair behind sarto suggested must rather not do that if can help frank replied may burn door down le combustible there be better however if can find nothing else must use nothing must be found frank then said think that can manage with one chair others looked puzzled will cut up leg back into six inch piece sharpen into wedge drive in round door think must withstand battering until door splintered fell to work at once in quarter of hour score of wedge be driven in now will do same at bottom of church door put in few a high a can reach on side will detain time before yield when be done sarto said what next percival only other thing to be done in way of defence be to carry chair upstairs to first story of tower to make barricade there maffio remarked yes might make barricade of way up stair main object be to get rid of here if found must not storm stair might pile chair in middle of church set on fire be only thing will burn although flame must scarcely mount to roof spark must fly up a there be sure to be lot of dust soot on beam there might catch fire must be burnt out well at rate there will be no great trouble in doing sarto said though must hardly think that must attempt to burn church down brigand have respect for life be not without superstition might be afraid to burn church though must cut dozen throat without scruple yes portion of band be doubt composed of revolutionist from mainland fellow who have scruple of sort who a men of same kind did in paris seventy year ago must desecrate church in conceivable manner for a rule hate religion a hate authority chair be accordingly carried up stowed on wooden floor beneath bell now frank said must like to see how ladder be fastened if can move however found must be well nigh impossible be over thirty foot from stone floor to next story while in bell hung be twenty foot ladder be very solid heavy a only two must get at from above must not be lifted up way can manage frank said after thinking for minute can pull bell rope up through hole fasten somewhere above middle of ladder then with three of pulling on must certainly raise without much difficulty must not have to pull very high six foot must be ample if want to smoke out must bring wood from outside will not be easy to do under fire now will leave one on watch above will be relieved hour do take first watch pedro if hear stir in village below come down tell at once above listen for distant firing be five mile to spot where bandit be on still night like must certainly be heard here other four men then descended to first floor here who be to take next turn of duty said if want further captain will sit here light pipe if have objection objection at think must like to smoke in church below be matter of opinion certainly one must object to being done in detached tower then with sarto maffio went down into church chapter xii ambuscade others will have laugh at when come back sarto said will in way trouble frank said have given couple of hour work have passed time away if have gone well will hear firing very soon may be sure that wo be able to go fast through wood especially a will have to be careful not to make noise of course be up hill too will be a dark a pitch under tree will have almost to crawl along last mile must not be surprised if be hour before be in position to attack now that be prepared to repel attack upon to hold out if necessary for three day even more on provision have got ought to consider alternative what other alternative can there be maffio asked let suppose be a well to suppose worst that rubini fall into ambush make difference whether woman lead into one whether have be trapped ambush laid without knowledge suppose that be ambushed that none of get back here exclamation broke from others said that will suppose worst frank went on man prato who be old hand at such matter must not improbably if expected that rubini must come to attack have at once sent off to band to men who sometimes act with instead of meeting thirty eight men may meet sixty in case might calculate that third of rubini force must fall at first volley there must be in forest without guide in dark surrounded by twice number of men well acquainted with place accustomed to traversing at night now ask frankly do think that many of indeed of must be likely to get back here might not be killed might hide in wood make way down mountain to morrow chance of of returning here seems to to be small indeed if thing turn out a have be saying think ca think percival sarto said in tone of horror say that think so sarto only say that seems to to be possible situated a be be always a well to see what if even most unlikely thing take place must be done let suppose that detachment have be cut to piece what be look out here can defend place rather can defend for three four day what must be benefit of if news got down to bronte must be necessary to send two three company up here to rescue if a be very probable news got down there must have to surrender know what must mean especially a assuredly must have killed good many of brigand in course of fighting thus then nothing must be gained by resistance be appointed to command portion of troop left here in case of rubini going away in pursuit of brigand with rest suppose that be ever contemplated that only five men must be left behind still doe not alter case idea be that village might be attacked during absence of part of force that here must maintain until rubini returned in event of such disaster a be supposing so far from there being advantage in holding church must be serious disadvantage for must risk life without point whatever in doing so be certainly true in case why must have made preparation for defence simply because hope have reason to hope rubini will return be prepared to hold out until doe so once assured that detachment will not come back whole matter be changed how be to be assured ah be very difficult question to answer a long a there be slightest possibility of part however small of detachment returning be bound to hold on here when can feel certain that will not be case duty must be to consult own safety by retreating if possible to bronte at moment sentry on campanile ran in heard sudden outburst of firing captain percival be continuing followed by others frank ran up to top of tower there be doubt that tough fight be going on report of musket came in quick succession sometimes there must be short pause then dozen shot must ring out close together for three four minute not word be spoken then a report became le frequent sarto exclaimed be nearly over rubini have done work frank be silent sarto added do not think so percival hope so frank replied be very much afraid that be not so have rubini taken brigand completely by surprise there must have be one crashing volley then must have rushed in with bayonet must have be over in two minute of brigand might have escaped there can have be pursuit for in darkness in forest there must have be chance whatever of overtaking men perfectly familiar with think that have failed in taking by surprise if did fail to do so brigand must either have moved off in case there must have be fight at have laid ambush for party must account for heavy firing have heard whether ambush be successful whether rubini have beaten assailant off be uncertain others saw justness of reasoning remained silent occasional shot be still heard what do think that mean maffio asked for sarto be beginning to feel profound respect for opinion of companion mean of course that one party other be pursuing fugitive be afraid that be bad sign for a have just said men must hardly try chase brigand through wood know very well waited five minute still shot be occasionally heard conviction that frank worst anticipation have be too surely verified forced upon others will stay here short time longer frank said to others will go down into church must like to think over quietly what have best do walked up down church be tremendous responsibility for lad not yet seventeen to bear of rubini party have escaped might be making way back in hope of finding shelter safety what must be feeling if arrived found party gone on other hand defend a well a might six men must finally succumb before determined attack by large party of ruffian exulting over victory thirsting for complete vengeance by time companion returned from above have made up mind a to plan have best be adopted will take middle course said will leave church conceal ourselves within short distance of door into vestry one of must hide close to so that if of comrade come up knock at door for admission can bring to can then learn what have happened if even eight ten have escaped will return to church hold if only one two will when brigand arrive there be chance of others coming start for bronte be capital plan sarto exclaimed murmur from others showed that too warmly approved there be hurry frank went on will eat good meal before start then there will be occasion to burden with provision before leaving will light fresh candle there be four five pound in vestry will leave four alight in floor of tower rest in different part of church so that when brigand do arrive will think that be watchful well prepared for be not likely will know exactly what strength rubini have with will think that have at least ten twelve men with will be sure to hesitate little before make attack will take little time to burst in great door even door of vestry be strong enough to bear good deal of battering before break that in so that will get good long start of of course may pursue can keep on road for first half mile then turn off make way through forest ca go very far wrong a be always descent besides for aught will know may have be gone couple of hour before get here think in way will have done duty to comrade at same time secured own safety for have right to throw away life when can still do work for italy must not be better maffio said in way will have consolation of knowing that none of friend who have be wounded have dragged here after have left only to find that be deserted while on other hand doe away with necessity of throwing away life altogether uselessly revert to former idea percival if ever have son will send to one of great school in england be clear that life there rough game make men of first sat down ate hearty meal of bread wine then fresh candle be lighted placed a frank have directed then left church locking vestry door behind sarto lay down behind tombstone ten yard from door others took place behind low wall ran round church yard after waiting hour frank returned to sarto be going said to conceal at end of village close enough to road to hear anything be said by people coming along if a hope may be of men will join bring on here if not will make way here at once will give low whistle directly hear retire join will give few minute extra time for may be sure that when see church lighted up who first arrive will wait for rest before running risk of shot from tower when be gathered doubt there will be good deal of talk a to how have best attack leaving sarto frank made way through garden until arrived at end of village then sat down behind low wall close to road in hour heard footstep judged that six eight men be coming from forest there be doubt be on watch there one of said window in tower be lit up will have work to do before finish with fought bravely will say that for although number fell at first volley killed eight ten of men wounded a many more before when there be only about dozen of left broke through ran be lucky that phillipo band arrived in time for notwithstanding surprise doubt whether must have beaten have be alone be good thought of prato to send young vico to follow woman that saw talking to officer frank must hear no more rising quietly retraced step at run a soon a joined companion gave low whistle in minute brought sarto to side be a feared said laid ambush for rubini shot down men at once rest kept together fought till six seven be killed burst through took to flight be afraid that shot heard told that even of be overtaken killed now let be going there be only about eight men in party who first came along may be sure that nothing will be attempted until rest arrive men have noticed light in tower evidently expected that must sell life dearly at rate can calculate upon at least hour before break into church find that have left be obliged to go cautiously before gained road beyond village then broke into trot hour will mean something like four mile frank said a be not likely that can run much faster than be going may safely calculate that will not overtake for over hour after do start by time will be well within five mile of bronte indeed with slope in favour be not sure that may not calculate upon reaching town certainly ought not to be able to run fifteen mile while be running eleven if do must deserve to be caught maffio said must think that must not follow far a for anything can tell may have left church couple of hour ago there be few word spoken a ran steadily along thought of slaughter of so many of friend oppressed fact that have personally escaped be at present small consolation frank have not be long enough with company to make acquaintance of many of men felt loss of rubini extremely at genoa during voyage on march to palermo have be constantly together older man have treated with a much cordiality kindness a if have be young brother frank regretted now that have not even more strongly urged doubt a to expediency of expedition though felt that even have done so remonstrance must have be unavailing so convinced be rubini zippo of sincerity good faith of woman a seemed in respect have be right have not pressed more strongly upon probability of being followed when left brigand after murder of husband be so natural thing that must be so that wondered have not struck at once have urged point rubini might have listened to fatal expedition might not have taken place seemed to heartbreaking affair a ran wiped away more than one tear ran down cheek after keeping on at same speed for three four mile frank heard by hard breathing of companion that power be failing be running quite easily school training being of good service to after long run at hare hound across country four mile down hill be trifle to have too advantage of not having to carry musket ammunition have better walk for few hundred yard get breath again said order be thankfully obeyed be ready to trot on asked five minute later on general assent being given again broke into run more thought of more persuaded frank be that pursuit must be set on foot doubtless first step of brigand must be to surround church to place strong party at door must therefore know that church must have be deserted for at least hour before obtained entry while possibly might have be two three hour before so on finding place empty impulse must be to go to wine shop celebrate victory rather than to start upon pursuit offered small prospect indeed of success few minute halted for moment to listen for sound of pursuing foot everything be still quiet so confident did become a to safety that last three four mile down into bronte be performed at walk must go report to bixio frank said a entered town have better find shelter somewhere there be occasion for maffio replied sky have be getting lighter for little time must be nearly five o'clock be past two when started will wait for half hour frank said before rouse bixio be always out by six bad news will keep shortly before hour went to general quarter house be already astir general will be down in few minute captain orderly said called quarter of hour ago in two three minute bixio came down have news asked hastily when saw frank whose downcast face struck at once yes general very bad news come in here bixio said opening door of sitting room now what be grieve to have to report sir have arrived here with only sarto maffio three other men of detachment that fear captain rubini whole of rest of men have be killed bixio started killed repeated almost incredulously trust that be mistaken what have happened frank briefly related circumstance be sad indeed terrible general said when have brought story to conclusion rubini loss be grievous one be good officer be greatly liked trusted by there be good men too among company have fifteen men of thousand among say woman did not betray men overheard distinctly said that be traitress a soon a be missed by be followed meeting with officer observed what took out beyond village captain percival have told main fact of most unfortunate expedition please give full detail of what did after have left how came to escape felt uneasy from first frank said directly rubini told about woman suggested that might be merely acting part in order to lead into ambuscade rubini zippo who be with when met be absolutely convinced of good faith also suggested that even if be right woman might possibly have be followed disappearance after murder of husband must be almost certain to excite suspicion that intended to avenge by bringing detachment down upon communicated suspicion to sarto maffio at once set to work to make church defensible then related in detail measure have taken how became convinced by sound of distant conflict rubini party have fallen into ambuscade be destroyed for time must not make up mind what course to adopt sir might have defended tower for two three day be by mean certain in fact be very improbable that anything of what be going on must reach ear on other hand must not withdraw little party a even if worst suspicion be correct of rubini men might have escaped might make way back to church then proceeded to explain plan have adopted how have be carried out know whether have acted rightly concluded be terrible responsibility can only say that consulted with sarto maffio who have have far more experience than that approved of plan hope general think be wrong certainly not certainly not position be most difficult one preparation for defence be excellent alternative that have to choose between when became convinced that rubini have be defeated be equally painful if stayed defended place may almost say must have thrown away life of five men with if went wounded men straggling back from forest must have found friend refuge middle course adopted be admirable must at once have saved poor fellow who might arrive while ensured safety of little party by illuminating church secured for long start by going out so a to overhear conversation of first party of brigand who entered village be able to assure that be useless staying longer in hope of survivor of expedition coming in have received message from garibaldi ordering to move to taormina on sea coast have defeated bosco at milazzo neapolitan general troop have be permitted to take ship for naples said that if have not concluded work here must remain for week a must probably be considerable time before preparation made for invading calabria be completed be intending to send off messenger morning to recall outlying detachment will do still will certainly remain here three four day longer in hope that of rubini party may have escaped if thought there be smallest chance of laying hand on scoundrel prato band must march with couple of hundred men into mountain may be sure that did not stop more than hour two at village after learned that party have escaped by to morrow morning may be fifty mile away on other side of etna however a soon a affair be over will urge upon necessity for sending strong force into mountain to put down brigandage especially to destroy prato band disaster have befallen rubini column cast great gloom over brigade not man must gladly have undergone amount of fatigue to avenge comrade felt impossibility of searching great tract of forest extended over larger part of slope of etna bixio however determined to send off strong party to find bury dead two hour later detachment hundred strong left bronte order be to attack brigand if found in village if have left however be not to pursue be to sleep there in morning to compel two three of villager to guide to scene of conflict where be to find bury dead precaution be to be observed although be regarded a certain that brigand must not have remained so near village must only stop there few hour then place a great distance a possible between frank have offered to accompany party bixio refused to allow to do so have have sleepless night anxiety have suffered be quite sufficient excitement for convalescent must do good by going there have best lie down take few hour sleep before party started frank asked captain in command to see if horse have be carried off be in shed adjoining priest house said may still be there brigand must not be likely to make many inquiry when discovered that have gone probably made off directly have eaten supper for have a might have be case so far a knew started for bronte soon after rubini left must have be possible for reinforcement to reach village within hour of daybreak even if one of villager told that horse be there be not likely for whole place must have be in ferment at news brigand may not have cared to carry off a must be useless to in journey over ground covered with forest broken up by ravine gorge detachment returned two day later bringing with to frank satisfaction horse saddlery have be to scene of conflict have found buried body with exception of few who must either have escaped have be killed at considerable distance from spot where be attacked brigand have a frank have expected left village before daybreak have on arriving opened fire at window of church quarter of hour later finding that reply be made have endeavoured to force entry great door however have defied effort when at last obtained access by breaking in door of vestry more than hour have be wasted discovery that church be untenanted have greatly disappointed disquieted after carousing for short time hastily left early on day after return of frank comrade one of missing party reached town be utterly worn out broken down having apparently wandered for thirty six hour in forest in state of semi delirium have at last quite accidentally stumbled upon small village after being fed cared for have be brought down to bronte in cart be said convinced that be only survivor of fight party have arrived within a believed quarter of mile of brigand lurking place when whistle be heard from tree on side of narrow path volley be fired half at least of party dropped rubini believed be among who fell at least did not hear voice afterwards zippo have rallied men who gathering together endeavoured to fight way through assailant what effect of fire be must not tell comrade dropped fast when there be few left threw down musket rushed headlong into forest scattered in various direction be hotly pursued several shot be fired at missed after running for hour flung down in clump of undergrowth have heard a ran other shot have doubt that companion be killed lay where be until morning then tried to find way down to bronte have distinct recollection of what have happened after left bush until found that wine be being poured down throat that be surrounded by group of pitying woman fury of garibaldians on arrival from various village at have be posted when heard of slaughter of friend be extreme many of officer begged general to allow to make one effort to find punish brigand bixio refused have far greater business on hand said italy have to be freed first blow have be struck must be followed up at once brigandage can wait be old sore disgrace to civilised country italy once freed can be taken in hand might spend week even month before must lay hand on prato band villager woodman must keep informed of movement made while not only must gain information must be interested in putting upon wrong track be not to be thought of moreover have garibaldi order to march to taormina if have lost five hundred men instead of fifty must obey that order much a must regret being obliged to march away leave massacre unavenged day after fugitive have arrived force left bronte mountainous nature of country to north prevented direct march towards taormina therefore took road round foot of etna through bandazza to gairre lay nearly due east of bronte then followed line along coast to taormina here troop be halted while bixio with frank small escort rode on to messina a general wished to confer with garibaldi to ascertain how preparation for invasion of calabria be proceeding chapter xiii across strait garibaldi have on entering messina be received with tremendous enthusiasm at once while waiting for reinforcement now pouring in set to work to improve condition of affair in town have taken up abode in royal palace where retained servant of former viceroy considering that must be unjust to dismiss ordered however that own dinner be to consist only of soup plate of meat vegetable large subscription flowed in from italy other country be entirely devoted to public service a have be money taken in treasury at palermo general allowed only a pay eight franc day be always spent before breakfast for although at messina a at palermo endeavoured to clear street of beggar be never able to resist appeal sooner have sauntered out in morning than eight franc melted away among child infirm person who flocked round received frank on arrival with real pleasure congratulated upon having so completely recovered from effect of wound there be plenty for to do said almost hour ship bring volunteer from part arrangement have to be made for bestowing

messina many be sent off to outlying village thousand bivouacked on sandy shore garibaldi went across to sardinia returned with two thousand five hundred men who have be gathered there for descent upon coast of papal state italian government have however vetoed movement have promised that own troop must when time came perform portion of operation port be crowded with shipping by convention have be agreed upon between garibaldi on entrance to messina neapolitan general who commanded force occupied citadel be arranged that sea must be open to party singular spectacle be presented of neapolitan navy looking quietly on while ship arrived loaded with troop for garibaldi while sardinian ship of war viewed with equal indifference arrival of reinforcement to garrison of citadel garibaldi force have now increased to over twenty five thousand men of five thousand be sicilian rest with exception of few french english volunteer coming from northern italy here enthusiasm caused by conquest of

bestow on honour will be sure be one after own heart be going to send missori with two hundred men across strait go with be to choose men competition for honour of being among first to set foot in calabria will be keen one indeed have spoken to missori will gladly take a staff officer of course be not intended that must fight mission will be to travel about country inciting population of calabrian village to prepare to join when land to confuse commander of neapolitan troop by rapid movement to cause alarm at naples by news that invasion of calabria have begun must enjoy greatly general feel very much obliged to for kindness in choosing a major missori have be on garibaldi staff from time frank joined at genoa be well known to when frank visited placed under order received with great cordiality general must not have made better choice said be great satisfaction to have officer with on whose activity energy can so confidently rely have just got through hardest may say most trying part of work for have have to refuse application of score of old comrade who almost with tear in eye have begged to enroll among party be limited to two hundred when have once selected that number be obliged to say to others think that man of band be well suited for work be young active men capable of long march endurance of great fatigue be men of tried bravery must have brush with neapolitan can be trusted to hold own hope to seize fortress of alta fiumara have opened communication with soldier of garrison have hope that may take by surprise if can do so will greatly facilitate passage of army across strait here be list of store be to take in boat of course men will take eighty round of ammunition can carry reserve for if have to take to mountain must be impossible to transport therefore see practically take with only day provision will be carried down before sunset to boat wish must see so divided that man will carry approximately same weight thus one can take four pound of bread four pound of meat third two bottle of wine so on once in hill can purchase what require at village there will at rate be difficulty in obtaining meat must say bread beyond nothing be necessary three calabrians who know country well crossed yesterday will act a guide will probably have to maintain for week ten day before main body cross cart will go down at four o'clock with store will order six men to accompany to place under order in cart will find two hundred haversack in provision will be placed after have seen to division together with forty round of spare ammunition by way have better sell horse across country a will have to traverse must be impossible to ride will probably be able to buy on mainland for sum that will get for here there be good many men on staff of of late arrival who be on look out for horse frank indeed have several time be asked by officer if must tell where must procure mount in course of day have difficulty in disposing of horse saddlery for same amount a have given for at marsala took with only spare shirt pair of sock rolled up in large blanket that with hole cut in middle served a cloak by day cover at night hitherto have be strapped on saddle now rolled up in fashion followed by most of garibaldians so a to carry slung over one shoulder with sword brace of pistol small haversack be only encumbrance at appointed hour went down with cart escort to point two mile from town where boat be lying took hour to make division of store then there be nothing to do until at half past nine o'clock in evening missori with two hundred men marched down there be fourteen boat a be sufficient to carry men in comfort time be lost in embarking be long row for although water be perfectly calm there be strong current through strait have to row head to while crossing two hour after starting landed at short distance from fort soon have evidence that commandant here be watchful for have gone hundred yard when suddenly came upon small outlying picket who after challenging fired then ran off towards fort where beating of drum showed that garrison be already falling in to repel attack hope of surprise be therefore at end a be by surprise alone that little force have slightest chance of capturing so strong fortress order be given after hasty consultation between missori nullo to turn off at once make for mountain while boat be directed to start back for messina headed by guide mounted slope of aspromonte when have gained height of four five hundred foot came upon wooden shed be hastily pulled down great bonfire lighted to inform friend on other side of strait that have safely landed be on way to hill have a ascended heard sharp fire break out at water edge knew that portion of garrison of fortress have sallied out opened fire on retreating boat march be continued for hour cannon of fort have also opened fire object doubtless being to inform large body of troop gathered at various point along coast to oppose garibaldians must cross that force of enemy have landed in darkness however little party made way unobserved past enemy outpost who remained stationary a officer be ignorant of strength of force have thus evaded vigilance of ship of war thought probable that garibaldi with thousand of men might be at hand portion of calabria be admirably suited for guerilla warfare garibaldians be received with enthusiasm at first village at arrived news of easy conquest of sicily have at first filled heart with hope that day of liberation be at hand concentration of troop in south calabria have damped spirit for accustomed for century to be treated like cattle by soldier of oppressor seemed to well nigh impossible that garibaldi must venture to set foot on mainland in face of so imposing gathering presence then of band of men in red shirt seemed to almost miraculous inhabitant vied with other in hospitality able bodied men of place declared readiness to take up arm moment garibaldi crossed strait many of indeed at once joined party while others started among mountain by road leading to other village in order to bring in early news of approach of body of neapolitan troop garibaldians be therefore able to lie down for few hour sleep for next week continued march visiting village after village gathering recruit a went crossing mountain winding up ravine constantly changing course so a to throw neapolitan troop off track several time from lofty point caught sight of considerable body of enemy moving along road once neapolitan officer rode into village where be halting with despatch from general briganti containing demand for surrender missori simply replied that be ready to give battle whenever supporter of tyranny chose to meet although thus answered summons have idea of encountering overwhelming force of neapolitan failing capture of fortress on first landing mission be to arouse population not to fight continued work among mountain in spite of effort of enemy to surround cavalry be useless in so mountainous country garibaldians free from weight of equipment unencumbered by baggage cart be able to move with rapidity set at defiance effort of soldiery hampered by knapsack belt with movement restricted by tightly fitting uniform although course have be devious garibaldians have be gradually working way south skirting height of montalto before starting missori have be informed by garibaldi that intended to land near reggio eight nine day after crossed that be to place band in neighbourhood in order to join in attack on town when reached point within ten mile of reggio missori said to frank must keep moving about can not leave men will send twenty of under command down to melito there be a have learnt from peasant none of neapolitan troop there at same time on account enter town be to do so of inhabitant might send word to reggio might be suspected that be there for special purpose therefore hide among hill short distance from town after nightfall send one of men in have better take one of peasant cloak hat will be ample disguise for will be duty to watch on shore then if see two three steamer can not say what

patois of country have arrested four five other agent of municipality consisted of creature of neapolitan government have gathered round captive inhabitant although evidently favourably disposed towards prisoner be too much afraid of vengeance of master to interfere after hesitating moment frank ran back to wine shop where have be sitting great fear be that neapolitan agent must at once send news to reggio that spy have be taken that garrison there must be put on guard therefore entered throwing aside cloak addressed eight ten peasant present friend said be one of officer of garibaldi who will soon come to free from tyrant a true italian doubt not that heart be with now have in power to do real service rose to foot be ready signor tell what have to do can rely upon to do want to post

have crossed to mainland officer in command have sent to tell that be everywhere joined by brave calabrians will speedily have force capable of giving battle to army of tyrant may be that before many day will come down here from mountain hope to find man capable of bearing arm ready to join will be bad day for who in spite of wish of people certainty that calabria will shortly be freed from presence of troop at naples strive to check tide for own sake watch men who have acted a agent of government of naples station armed men on road by must send message to reggio for must do so troop

long accustomed to tyranny of government that feared to make demonstration whatever of liberal opinion until saw how matter went be upon that tax pressed most heavily have far more reason than fishing class to hail release from exaction have more to lose felt that be best to hold aloof from manifestation of feeling fisherman however thronged round frank announced ready at once to obey order divide yourselves into four party went on let choose leader take in turn to watch road see that none pass at moment frank follower returned two of police went out along road said have just come back be not surprised at what have just heard went on addressing fisherman police have already endeavoured to send word to reggio that friend from hill be shortly coming here have be stopped on way by brave

be at once hanged followed by forty fifty fisherman went at once to police quarter sergeant who be in command came out with detachment men frank said bear ill will to who serve neapolitan government have be government of country none be to be blamed for taking service with doubt not that when like sicily calabria be free who have done duty without undue oppression violence will be confirmed in appointment woe be to who oppose impulse of country there be thousand of peasant in mountain already in arm neapolitan soldier who be powerless to oppose people of sicily will be equally powerless to oppose people of calabria aided a will be when time come by great army from other side of strait already a know sir said to officer road leading from here be guarded have made effort a be perhaps duty to send word to reggio that heart of people here beat with of brother among hill let there be further attempt of sort will be bad alike for who go for who stay when colonel missori arrives will be

keep watch on beach rest can wrap in cloak lie down until receive order from frank now went to one hotel in town ordered supper to be prepared for landlord who have be among crowd when addressed said humbly have already ordered supper to be got ready signor thinking that when have arranged matter must yourself come here pray think that because many of did not at once come forward offer to join be because be indifferent to news see be not with a with fisherman if thing go badly can embark family good in boat cross strait establish in village there earn living a before with who have something to lose be different property must be confiscated must be driven from home many of must be shot others thrown into dungeon quite see that landlord can hardly blame for hesitating little though must remember that men who have be champion of freedom have be almost wholly men who have have much to lose have risked for principle garibaldi army be very largely composed of such men ah signor have never seen chance of success when garibaldi once land will not hang back at present be revolt of peasant tell that france other power be endeavouring to prevent from invading calabria if must not come what can few thousand peasant do against hundred thousand trained troop well think that garibaldi will be restrained from crossing whatever pressure be put upon tried to prevent from sailing from genoa now be dictator of sicily will land somewhere on coast never fear in case signor will shout a loud a one will send son to carry musket in rank frank smiled well landlord let have supper to morrow may talk over affair again bring bottle of good wine when supper be served can close house for night will not require bed will remain here till morning fasten up front door a will have men call frequently hope there be plenty of provision in town in case three four thousand men must march in here to morrow for day signor might feed doubt if must go beyond chapter xiv discovery at one o'clock one of men on look out brought to frank news that must make out two steamer approaching frank ran down to shore man eyesight have not deceived two steamer be certainly making way towards melito from direction of course have almost certainly come from port in sicily did not belong to neapolitan squadron be constantly parading strait indeed be for most part lying twenty mile away while be anchored off reggio demonstration have be made for day at messina cape of faro in order to attract attention lead to belief that be intended to land near spot where missori have disembarked at point north of entrance to strait store have be ostentatiously placed on board steamer at messina faro men have embarked in considerable number evening smoke pouring from funnel showed that steam be being got up preparation be keenly watched by neapolitan served purpose by concentrating attention upon point garibaldi on arriving from sardinia with troop have be collected there have despatched torino franklin carrying thousand of men round island with instruction to to put in at giardini port of taormina proceeded to messina then after seeing that be going on well there rode down to port having previously sent forward seven hundred men detachment be so small that departure attracted little attention be supposed that have only gone down to reinforce bixio brigade thus messina be a ignorant of fact that expedition be about to start from giardini a be neapolitan commander on arrival at giardini on evening of august th garibaldi found that bixio have already embarked thousand men on board torino be steamer of seven hundred ton that be prepared to send thousand on board franklin be small paddle steamer of two hundred ton be reported to be leaking so badly that troop have be embarked on garibaldi at once went on board with staff found that be making water fast leak must not be discovered garibaldi a old sea captain knew what must be done to check inrush of water at least for time a be important that must be able to carry complement of men across sixteen mile of water between giardini melito several of officer must swim ordered to dive overboard to find if possible position of leak in meantime sent ashore for boat load of mixture of manure chopped straw when arrived lump be thrust down at end of pole to point where leak have be discovered particle of composition be drawn into leak by inrush of water in short time leakage almost entirely ceased work of embarkation recommenced three thousand men be carried by torino twelve hundred on franklin where garibaldi took place while bixio commanded on torino vessel be crowded to dangerous extent men be packed on deck a closely a must stand be even clustered on shroud have there be wind must have be dangerous in extreme to put to sea overloaded a be fortunately there be not breath of air water be perfectly calm at ten o'clock two vessel started on eventful voyage owing to difficulty caused by strong current did not arrive off melito until two in morning a soon a frank have assured that approaching vessel be expected sent off one of two men to fetch down party have for twelve hour be lying outside place while despatched other to hut of leader of three party of fisherman not engaged in watching road to tell to call up men a quietly a possible to get boat in water in short time therefore after franklin anchor have be dropped frank arrived alongside torino with dozen fishing boat have rowed to a being larger craft being nearest to shore thought that garibaldi must be on board on reaching found bixio several lantern have be placed near gangway general at once recognised welcome captain percival said heartily a shook hand with be glad indeed when saw boat putting off knew that detachment of missori men must be there have more boat coming out yes sir there will be dozen more off in few minute set off a soon a have assembled sufficient number of fisherman to man alongside be sorry to say bixio said that have run aground fear badly have just sent boat to franklin where garibaldi be to tell have happened have better go at once report to what force have only fifty men sir colonel sent only small party a be afraid that be to come with force must bring enemy down here at once there be fear of trouble in town sir have arranged that will be entirely unopposed there be neapolitan nearer than reggio have suspicion of being here frank at once returned to boat in have come off rowed to franklin ah be percival garibaldi exclaimed when saw then be well will begin to land at once can tell a go ashore what missori have be doing how many boat have with have brought six sir there will be at least dozen more in few minute garibaldi descended into boat be followed by a many men a must be crowded into now first about state of thing here be there chance of being disturbed before men be ashore must think not sir with exception of fisherman whom have roused to man boat one in place know anything of what be going on great bulk of people be in favour syndic authority be prisoner in house even if be conscious of landing must not send news to reggio a have armed party on road have therefore certainly six eight hour before there be chance of interruption be good news indeed everything have gone well with so far except misfortune of bixio steamer running aground unless can succeed in getting off fear that neapolitan will capture however be minor matter now what can tell about position of enemy there be about thirty thousand men under general viale in around monteleone there be twelve thousand at bagnara town between reggio where there be fifteen hundred men under general galotta eighteen hundred men be in aspromonte in pursuit of missori who have now about eight hundred men with must hardly be disposed better for purpose garibaldi remarked will take reggio before support can arrive to garrison success there will be worth ten thousand men to garibaldi remained on shore watching disembarkation of men boatman in melito be soon employed in work by four o'clock whole of troop be on shore while disembarkation have be going on garibaldi have sent for syndic other authority have informed that must now consider under authority obey promptly order that gave that must require bread meat wine for day consumption for whole of force that be prepared to pay for food that must obtain from inhabitant except among fisherman arrival of force be regarded with appearance of apathy townspeople have be told by authority that there be fear whatever of garibaldi freebooter coming near believing that must speedily be crushed regarded arrival with fear rather than pleasure there be many there who be well wishers of cause feared to exhibit sign of friendship lest must suffer terribly for when follower have be destroyed by troop in sicily there have be previous insurrection rising people have long hoped that day must shake off yoke of naples such hope have be entertained on mainland where reign of oppression have be so long unbroken that thought that must ever be thrown off have entered mind of great majority of ignorant people at daybreak war vessel at reggio must be seen getting up steam greatest effort be made to get torino afloat again unfortunately reduction effected in draught of water by removal of passenger certain amount of store have be counteracted by force of current a fast a be lightened carried up higher on shoal little franklin be american vessel chartered for occasion hoisted star stripe a soon a garibaldians have landed steamed across to island torino italian flag remained flying until three neapolitan steamer came up opened fire upon garibaldians on shore three men be wounded by shell when rest forming up marched out of town taking path must scarcely be called road towards reggio four men have soon after landing have be effected be sent to missori with order that must join at reggio a soon a garibaldians be out of range neapolitan commander turned gun on torino after keeping up heavy fire upon for hour sent party in boat to board set on fire first part of march towards reggio be extremely toilsome one for first eight mile from melito to cape d'armi slope of mountain extend to very edge of water troop be continually mounting steep spur descending into ravine have with four mountain gun a path must only be traversed by men in single file difficulty of taking gun along be immense men be in highest spirit fact that in case of disaster destruction of torino have cut off mean of return to sicily in way troubled similarly have thrown on shore at marsala ship in have come have be captured by enemy confidence in garibaldi be absolute thought of disaster be for moment entertained once past cape halted be already evening although distance in mile have be short fatigue have be very great none have closed eye on previous night be therefore impossible to go farther be received with enthusiasm by people of village scattered here there on mountain side greek colony have very many year before settled there retained many of own custom even own language although conversation with north italian garibaldians be difficult often impossible there must be no mistake a to heartiness of welcome everything in way of provision be given to soldier cottage took in a many men a must hold from moment indeed when garibaldians set foot in calabria met with far deeper heartier welcome than have be case in sicily in latter have be joined by comparatively small body of volunteer people have contented with shouting cheering have given little else even in appeal of garibaldi for aid in hospital lint bandage for wounded have met with little response sicilian have in fact fallen to level of neapolitan in calabria on other hand population be manly hardy hospitable possessing virtue of mountaineer in country a news of garibaldi landing spread whole population took up arm here communication be received from missori who stated that be pushing forward with haste that from ruggedness of mountain along be travelling must not hope to be at reggio until late following evening next day garibaldians advanced along mountain side detachment sent out from reggio retiring along road a advanced force halted for night six mile from town messenger from missori announced that in spite of effort be still far distant garibaldi therefore determined to attack next morning without waiting for communication have be opened with townsfolk message be sent back that national guard must support few town be more beautifully situated than reggio lie on lowest slope of spur of aspromonte behind rise castle with gun commanding town whose scattered suburb garden stretch far away up mountain side while across strait lie bay of catania with numerous town village up slope of etna form background with wreath of smoke ascending from volcano on summit away to right lie messina coast stretching along to cape faro intervening strait be dotted with shipping steamer on way to east returning to italy france sailing ship flying flag of many nation fishing rowing boat be settled that bixio with brigade be to enter town by main road effect junction with national guard in piazza lying below castle that when junction be made battalion be to descend to shore attack small fort near marina a soon a news of garibaldi landing have reached town principal people officer of national guard have called upon gallotta begged if intended to fight garibaldi to go outside town to do so so save place from injury must be effected by desperate struggle in street request be strange one general who doubt considered that must do better in fight in open than in street where possibly inhabitant might take part against agreed to do on garibaldi approach marched out of fortress with eight hundred men in two detachment one of took post at bridge just outside reggio while strangely enough other four hundred men took up position on opposite side of town in order to confuse italian troop who must be marching from town on coast towards reggio garibaldi have sent order to cosenz to cross during night from cape faro with twelve hundred men in boat to land near bagnara expecting hard fighting garibaldians moved on at midnight when approached town scout went forward found to surprise that bridge be unoccupied bixio at once crossed reaching piazza joined national guard there without shot having be fired similarly garibaldi with rest of force entered suburb came upon small outpost be at once driven back gallotta who not dreaming of night attack have withdrawn most of troop into castle now beat hasty retreat with remainder cannonade be at once opened by gun upon town neapolitan force on other side of reggio retreated at once fearing that must not be able to enter castle retired along road hoping to meet general braganti who be advancing with column to reinforce garrison bixio battalion took little fort on marina without difficulty barricade be at once thrown up across street leading to castle in order to prevent garrison from making sortie relieving force reaching be daylight now missori column arrived a arranged upon hill side above castle at once opened so heavy musketry fire upon defender that artillery be unable to serve gun feeling that castle must not hold out long garibaldi despatched battalion to hold relieving column in check braganti have already heard from fugitive that town seaside fort be in hand of garibaldians castle invested upon side therefore fell back to await further reinforcement being ignorant of force under garibaldi command at twelve o'clock loud cheer broke from garibaldians round castle for white flag of surrender be hoisted general granted same term be given to bosco force at milazzo namely that garrison might march down to shore there embark on board neapolitan war ship for conveyance to naples leaving munition of war money prisoner who might be confined there behind thus with loss of only seven men killed wounded castle have be considered capable of resisting long siege be captured first blow struck at bourbon dynasty of naples success in be striking one consequence be far reaching news that reggio have be captured by garibaldians almost without fighting spread like wild fire cosenz landing have also be successful added to news that southern calabria have risen in arm created such consternation among commander of various body of troop in town facing strait that prepared to march at once to join main force at monteleone a soon a castle surrendered garibaldi despatched boat across strait with order to troop at messina cape faro to cross at once in craft must get hold of advance from reggio be made afternoon a troop required rest after exertion a evening came on scene be striking one town village on other side of strait from cape faro to giardini being illuminated light twinkled bonfire blazed far up side of etna a soon a garibaldi have entered castle said to frank who have be near day take ten men search castle thoroughly release political prisoner there be sure to be many here frank obeyed order eagerly at palermo have not expected to find prisoner from mainland have read through list of found released at messina without emotion for there a at palermo be men for most part of good family belonging to city now be on mainland prisoner taken in part of neapolitan dominion might be found here first obtained list of detained from officer in special charge of familiar name met eye a glanced hastily down be sure that be entire list asked officer there be none others latter replied if be searching for friend may find here though bearing name majority of prisoner be registered under real name in case where there be particular reason for secrecy name be given when be brought here be ignorant of what real designation may be have better accompany round sir frank said see that jailor open door give facility officer willingly assented felt that appointment under neapolitan government be at end be anxious to please who be likely to be master in future a rule fifteen twenty men be confined together be first visited familiar face be found among have seen officer said be believe confined here under own name a see number be kept together be allowed at certain hour of day to go out into courtyard to converse with other freely there be four prisoner who be kept apart from rest other be four who bear believe other name than given on list go out for four five hour at time on to wall have separate place for exercise can hold communication with other with rest of prisoner in other respect have same food treatment scene in of room that have hitherto entered have be very painful prisoner have heard sound of firing be in ignorance of what meant news from outside world ever reached have heard nothing of event in sicily only explanation that must imagine for firing be that there have be revolution in province that castle have be attacked by party of insurgent hope have fallen when firing ceased during hour have passed while negotiation be being carried on have altogether faded away have heard cannon from without that body of insurgent must have captured fortress seemed out of question there have be attack assailant have evidently fallen back when therefore frank entered attended by chief followed by eight men in red shirt broad brimmed hat carrying musket be too astonished even to guess at truth until frank said gentleman in name of general garibaldi who have captured castle have pleasure to announce to that from moment be free men for most part announcement be received in silence must scarce believe possibility of what said name of garibaldi be known to be who have commanded at defence of rome be who a who have be longest there have learned from comparatively late comer have done such signal service in alp with volunteer when by aid of france milan part of lombardy be

at in light signor frank said doubt will pick up health strength when rejoin friend find that tyranny oppression struggled against be at end leaving last of men to give poor fellow arm lead out frank returned to professor forli latter rose briskly a came in be again said coming here so strangely news brought be so great surprise everything seemed confused be unable to grasp fact have heard that good swimmer if fall suddenly into deep water behaves for few moment like one who be ignorant of art striking out wildly swallowing much water before fairly grasp situation skill return to so be with equanimity have never be shaken since be first seized perceived at once that what be to come be inevitable reflected be vastly better off than most that mind be stored with knowledge accumulated by great thinker of age so fortified must afford to be indifferent to imprisonment persecution see suddenness of knowledge be free did what captivity even a hopeless a mine have failed to do now frank let go out will take down to sea shore then tell by what marvel come to be here if have be father must not have be so surprised that whom have thought of a boy at harrow must throw open prison door be

district stood at door till general looked round pardon sir for interrupting wish to report to that among other prisoner have found signor forli that be in good health garibaldi rose from seat holding out hand grasped of frank be glad be glad indeed lad said with deep feeling that old friend be rescued glad that sacrifice that mother made in parting with have not be in vain that own bravery good conduct have be thus rewarded pray god that other that be seeking for still nearer more loved may also be found excuse said to bixio syndic must shake signor forli by hand before go farther into a hurried out frank said have not told about father yet sir suggested that must go down together to sea shore where must talk matter over quietly came in partly to ask if must require service for next hour two certainly not percival yes will be careful must be shock to to be told suddenly that father have lost life in search for led by frank hurried to spot where professor be standing quietly regarding garibaldians laughing chatting group of neapolitan troop who now disarmed be standing talking together with disheartened sombre face ah professor exclaimed a came up to glad indeed be that have be found rescued friend be right in not despairing of seems age since parted twelve year ago at rome be little changed feared that if found must be like so many of others whose prison door have opened mere wreck of have changed much signor forli said a stood holding general hand line two on forehead be so have taken up again work seemed postponed for century at rome yes time hope that italy will be freed now old friend must excuse for present be full of business evening must have long talk together much have happened in three year have passed since disappeared can keep youngster with have well earned day holiday so saying garibaldi hurried off chapter xv advance from reggio professor forli be silent until frank have passed out through gate of castle then took long breath air of freedom said be different from have breathed daily on wall there for well nigh three year yet seems different be comfort that prison lay in fair spot not in place where must see little beyond wall often often have thanked god that be so that even a free man with world before must see more lovely scene than there be change too there be passage of ship used to wonder where be sailing about passenger how hopefully many of be going abroad to strange country in search of fortune how few be returning with hope fully satisfied smiled sometimes to think of struggle for wealth advancement going on in world round while have need to think of future need always a know few simple be ministered to though cut off from converse with around have best company in world in cell how thankful be that memory be so good that must discourse with great men of world must talk with plato argue with demosthenes must discus old age with cicero travel with homer virgil visit inferno with dante heaven with milton knew by heart many of masterpiece of shakespeare goethe must laugh over fun of terence plutarch be grand company so professor continued to talk until reached shore frank be not called upon to speak professor be talking to rather than to continuing habit of officer of prison have spoken a yet brain be working in old groove once on strand stood silently gazing for two three minute then passed hand across forehead with evident effort broke chain of thought turned to frank strange talk doubt be thinking frank for man so suddenly unexpectedly released from living grave see lad that body can be emancipated more quickly than mind from bond be a one awaking from deep sleep still wondering whether be how came to be here what have happened to fear that will be time before can quite shake off dream now lad once more tell about wife mother have told that be well have said naught of father save that be not here where be how be can answer question grandfather like have be lost to disappeared few month after did be led to believe that be killed professor be again in instant mood have dominated be shaken off be keen sharp alert again a frank remembered be lost repeated heard that be killed how be tell everything in early day of imprisonment when thought of many thing outside wall of gaol one thing troubled more than others wife have daughter harm must come to save first grief at loss slow process of hope dying out daughter have everything that woman must wish to make happy father knew so well must not rest when day passed news of came must move heaven earth to find man in country who dare to enquire after political prisoner incurs small danger be so that be missing tell spare detail have rest of day before will sit down on seat now begin frank told at length how on news of professor disappearance father have interested english government in matter how to enquiry made government of naples have replied that knew nothing whatever concerning disappearance how at last started with order obtained from naples for to search prison of southern italy be just like be noble chivalrous professor said must have known better englishman unacquainted with italy might have believed that with order might safely search for one who suspected be lying in neapolitan prison father must have known better notice must assuredly be sent before arrived have come here for example must week before have be carried away up into mountain till have gone must have be shown register of prisoner must not have found name among must have be told that such person a described have ever be confined here be hopeless go on with story frank told how father have visited several prison how wrote letter exposing horror that have appeared in english paper have created immense impression throughout country be mad of professor murmured noble mad then frank told how news came of being carried off by brigand of step have be taken of evidence of courier who saw fall of of effect being found in hut on mountain when be captured brigand chief killed of report given by one of prisoner that father have died be buried shortly after be taken there of vain search have be made for body be tale believed signor forli exclaimed leaping to foot italian must for moment have thought true at least none who have misfortune to be born under neapolitan rule surely wife never believed in heart know now that did not frank said kept doubt to herself for sake of mother thought that be far better that must believe that father be dead than must believe buried in one of foul prison have described be right be right professor said be certainly better mother did lose hope told that must not allow to believe that might still be alive believe that signora never said one word on subject to other until just before started then related how courier have be brought over how have be installed in house in cadogan place how suspicion of being spy have be entertained until after receipt of garibaldi letter how be convinced at last that have overheard arrangement made for leaving for italy be alive frank to tell by what miracle did escape from net be thrown around part of story be also told be well arranged bravely carried through frank so took up mission have cost father life liberty be great undertaking for lad wonder indeed that mother after loss have suffered permitted to enter upon well contrary to human anticipation have succeeded in one half of will trust succeed in other what seemed hardly possible that must enter castle of reggio a one of conqueror so have free access to secret of prison have be accomplished if garibaldi succeeds in carrying arm farther other prison door be opened may yet find father what have told have explained what have hitherto be puzzle to why must have be treated a special prisoner kept in solitary confinement now understand england have taken matter up a government of naples have denied knowledge of be necessary that prisoner who perhaps day might be liberated prison official must know be able to report existence to british representative may be sure that have father come here examined prisoner official privately must have obtained intelligence of giuseppe borani must not have be here must have be removed none must dream that be prisoner for whom search be made now tell briefly about expedition of garibaldi be europe at war that have managed to bring army here first of grandfather must tell happened last year then related incident of war of whereby france sardinia united wrested milan lombardy from austrian brilliant achievement of garibaldians disappointment felt by italy at nice part of savoy being handed over to napoleon a price of service that have rendered how bologna florence palma ferrara forli ravenna have expelled ruler united with sardinia how garibaldi having be badly treated volunteer disbanded have retired disappointed hurt to caprera then related briefly secret gathering of expedition obstacle thrown in way successful landing in sicily event have terminated with expulsion of neapolitan force from island garibaldi began with thousand men said in conclusion be now at head of twenty thousand will grow hour for have news of rising throughout southern calabria if thousand sufficed for conquest of sicily twenty thousand will surely be sufficient for of mainland easy capture of place will strike terror into enemy raise enthusiasm of troop calabrians to utmost garibaldi have four thousand men with now by time to morrow ten thousand at least will have crossed think be possible that will reach naples without having to fight battle at rate one pitched battle must be enough to free southern italy papal state will come next then a garibaldi hope venice though will be far more serious affair for austrian be very different foe from neapolitan have advantage of tremendously strong fortification must only be taken by siege operation with heavy artillery certainly must not be accomplished by troop like garibaldi now about father supposing to be alive where do think must most probably be imprisoned there be saying that be alive feel confident unless indeed died in prison from effect of wound given when be captured that did not die when in hand of brigand may take to be certain for grave must in case have be discovered must have be handed over to party of police sent to fetch by previous agreement with brigand must have be confined in place considered especially secure from search must fancy that be probably in naples there be several large prison there then there must be advantage if british government have insisted upon commission of own officer searching prison must be removed secretly from one to so that before one in be confined must be examined must have be taken to have be previously searched case be more serious one than mine although be naturalised british subject have gone of own free will to italy in vain belief must be unmolested after so long absence probably there must have be stir in matter have not father taken up so hotly by influence possessed obtained permission to search dungeon a said case be far more serious one went out backed by influence of british government be assisted by british legation held order of neapolitan government for admission to prison thus have be found that have in spite of own so called safe conduct be seized imprisoned british fleet must have be in bay of naples in very short time especially a letter a tell created so much feeling throughout country therefore must be almost vital question for government to maintain story have framed to conceal fact that time be asserting that have be captured killed by brigand be in one of own prison may say frankly that must unhesitatingly have have killed perhaps starved to death in cell be not that must have put in power of official other to betray discovery must have meant fall of government possibly dethronement of king have be italian must assuredly have be murdered for must not have paid prison official to betray whereas being englishman of distinction in whose fate british government have actively interested man who knew fact must have obtained reward of very large amount indeed for giving information be sole reason frank that lead to believe that may still be alive be doubtless imprisoned under name just a be at least must be known to men attended upon that be englishman must scarcely have avoided suspecting that be man about whom stir have taken place government have already incurred tremendous risk by seizure must have be far greater have foul mean be used to get rid of in prison in former case must by extraordinary chance existence have become known to british legation must have framed deliberate lie to account for ignorance of being captain percival might for instance assert that have be taken prisoner in mountain with party of brigand that assertion that be englishman have be wholly disbelieved for must naturally have spoken in italian italian be so good that assertion made that be englishman must have be wholly discredited be merely rough guess at story might have invented for probably must have be much more plausible however plausible must not have received slightest credit have be found that have be foully done to death be difficult frank when one be discussing probable action of men without heart honour principle in deadly fear of discovery to determine what course must be likely to take in particular circumstance now first thing have to do be to cross to messina to telegraph afterwards to write to wife can telegraph yes not direct regular line be that cross strait to town then go up through italy that of course have not be able to use must not use now message have be sent by line from cape passaro to malta thence through sardinia corsica to spezzia can send message by there will be difficulty in getting boat across strait see war ship have steamed away a soon a castle be taken found that anchorage be within range of gun fired few shot into town when castle be bombarding then retired believe that through men of navy have be very reluctant to act against except of course at palermo then will go at once be strange to to be able to say will go very well grandfather of course have money can supply with a much a like have plenty of fund ca say where will find when come back will only have to enquire where garibaldi be be sure to be with will stay couple of day there after hard pallet prison fare can not resist temptation of comfortable bed well furnished room civilised meal especially a be not likely to find of thing on way to naples by way must think must telegraph from here frank said garibaldi sent off message to messina directly castle be taken then let do so by mean went at once to telegraph office from there professor sent following message dearest wife frank have found released be well in good health will write fully evening will accompany aid in search for leonard love to muriel forli having handed in went down to shore again have difficulty in hiring boat frank took twenty sovereign from belt will want grandfather for indeed must have entirely new fit out suppose must there have not be much wear tear in clothes three year be long time for single suit to last have lately have uneasiness a to what must do when thing no longer hung together certainly felt repugnance to asking for prison suit must decidedly go get clothes fit to be seen in before present at hotel respectable house must take in a be will have more sir can let have fifty if must like boy want to be encumbered with luggage suit besides that will wear change of underclothes will suffice can be carried in small hand bag whether walk ride can take with after seeing signor forli off frank returned to castle where be professor garibaldi asked when reported a ready for duty have just seen off to messina general be sorely in need of clothes want to write long letter home must scarcely find quiet room where must do so in reggio will rejoin a advance be wisest thing must do for although look wonderfully well can hardly be capable of standing much fatigue after taking exercise for three year will have great deal to learn a to what have taken place since have be here for suppose prisoner heard whisper of great change in northern italy told in few word sir have time to give detail at reggio twenty six gun five hundred musket large quantity of coal ammunition provision horse mule be captured on following morning major nullo guide with battalion be thrown out towards san giovanni there be other forward movement general be occupied in receiving deputation from many town village there be arrangement to be made for transport of such store ammunition a be likely to be required garibaldians have crossed in large number cosenz medici with considerable portion of command be already over former have gone up into hill next morning garibaldi with two thousand men six captured field piece moved forward be possible that must meet with opposition at san giovanni have scarcely started when messenger arrived from nullo believing from report of countryman that neapolitan be retiring have ridden on with six of guide till to astonishment at bridge crossing ravine close to town came upon two squadron of neapolitan lancer with great presence of mind men have drawn revolver summoned officer in command to surrender surrender to whom latter asked to garibaldi be ready to attack at once if refuse will take to general officer said to nullo repeated command have objection to confer with garibaldi general said will go with to can not take nullo said instruction be simply to demand surrender will go inform of readiness to meet in meantime demand that withdraw lancer from bridge must be considered a boundary between two force can leave two men on side will leave two on mine to general agreed posting two of men at bridge be sent back to beg garibaldi to hurry up troop messenger went backward forward between general melendis garibaldi who be marching forward with haste a term latter laid down be that troop must give up arm then be allowed to march away agreement be arrived at neapolitan evacuated town took up very strong position on hill side above be two thousand five hundred strong with five gun in evening garibaldi with two thousand men arrived near place sending forward two company to bridge made circuit through hill took up position above somewhat in rear of neapolitan messenger be sent to cosenz who be seventeen mile away ordering to start at once if possible arrive in morning body of calabrian peasantry undertook to watch enemy garibaldians wrapping in blanket lay down for night before daybreak be on foot moved down hill enemy opened fire with shell only two three men fell fire be not returned on arrival at spot where be sheltered from fire garibaldi sent in messenger with flag of truce renewing offer of term neapolitan shot bearer of flag a approached afterwards offered to treat garibaldi however greatly angered at violation of law of war replied at first that must now accept nothing unconditional surrender armistice be however granted to enable general to communicate with general braganti afforded time too for cosenz to arrive from salerno for bixio whose brigade have remained at reggio to bring up gun be posted so a to entirely cut neapolitan line of retreat at five o'clock garibaldi sent order to neapolitan to lay down arm within quarter of hour must advance general seeing that must not now hope to be reinforced that be completely surrounded assented to demand soldier piled arm soon fraternised with garibaldians many of showing unconcealed pleasure that have not be called upon to oppose who have come to free country greater portion of threw away accoutrement even cap then dispersed few starting to join main force under viarli greater portion scattering to home fort by water edge below town have also surrendered be important capture a possessed several heavy gun with of faro on opposite shore commanded strait consequently neapolitan ship must not pas on way up towards naples be forced to retire through other end to make way entirely round island thus leaving passage between messina mainland entirely open at daybreak garibaldi started at head of cosenz column for alta fiumara first party of garibaldians landed have failed to capture after short parley surrendered on same term a granted day before men throwing away shako knapsack started for various home three mile farther castle of scylla surrendered national guard of town having taken up arm declared for garibaldi a soon a heard that be coming bagnara have also be evacuated viarli having withdrawn with force marched to monteleone halt be made here strictest order have be given by garibaldi against plundering in way giving cause for hostility among peasantry sentry be posted one of soldier found stealing grape be shot example prevented repetition of offence that evening frank who be down on shore watching men from messina being landed from several steamer saw signor forli be lucky indeed be down here said for house in town be full of troop might have searched night without finding be quite useless to look for bed now indeed house be so crowded that have made up mind to sleep here must recommend to do same see have got blanket with will be much cooler more pleasant than indoors will do so gladly frank will be fresh luxury for to see star overhead a lie sand be quite a soft a of italian bed be likely to be frank have indeed slept out night since garibaldians first landed saved trouble of endeavouring to find accommodation enabled to have swim morning to refresh for day work day after day garibaldians marched on without encountering resistance be indeed procession rather than military advance country be lovely weather superb at village be saluted by number of country people who have come down to greet be armed number of joined garibaldians be for most part of fine physique with handsome face woman of coast be famous for beauty greek element be still predominant in many of village other language be spoken in town national guard be drawn up to receive deliverer with honour inhabitant of class vied with other in hospitality frank have be unable to buy horse have succeeded in purchasing donkey on professor sat placidly smoking a went along with one marching column cosenz division generally led way followed by of medici ebers while bixio followed in rear division having already have share of glory in sicily at reggio main neapolitan army retiring from monteleone passed through town only few hour ahead of garibaldians people reported that great insubordination existed among general braganti have be shot by own men at bagnara other general be accused by men of treachery great number of have deserted garibaldians felt that if must overtake retreating foe victory be certain order have be sent round by garibaldi to villager that men be to meet at maida leaving army at two o'clock in morning with few of staff rode across mountain to town calabrians eager to fight have obeyed order with disappointment for have be left to must have occupied terrible gorge through retreating neapolitan must have to pas taking post among inaccessible hill must have almost annihilated garibaldi be on occasion most anxious to prevent bloodshed must never fight unless foe forced to do so be for reason that have ordered calabrians to meet at maida thereby preventing from occupying pas frank a one of aide de camp rode with professor preferring to move forward at more comfortable pace of marching column ordering calabrians to follow garibaldi went on from maida to tyrola situated on backbone of apennines commanding view of sea on hand arriving there found that neapolitan be mile ahead therefore halted for hour then rode seven mile farther to samprotro where saw rearguard of enemy not more than mile ahead leaving few armed peasant to watch garibaldi staff went quietly to bed in morning again started in pursuit at head of two thousand calabrians peasant brought in news that enemy have halted at village seven mile ahead be endeavouring to obtain food calabrians when approached place be sent forward a skirmisher head of cosenz column be now short distance in rear colonel peard who have ridden with garibaldi be in advance with three calabrians when at turn of road came upon seven thousand infantry cavalry artillery huddled together without appearance of regularity rode up at once to nearest officer called upon to surrender took to ghio general who saying to peard that be not customary to talk so loud before soldier asked to step aside on being told that be surrounded have choice between surrendering being annihilated agreed at once to send officer to garibaldi while officer be absent disposition of troop manifested many of at once threw down arm accoutrement started on road made way up hill in few minute officer returned with garibaldi condition be surrender disarmament when troop must be allowed to leave on promise not to serve again in hour there be not neapolitan left in place garibaldians who have marched thirty mile day halted to allow rest of troop to come up there be indeed further occasion for haste be morally certain that battle must be fought before reached naples neapolitan troop be hopelessly dispirited greater part must gladly have thrown away arm returned to home minority who be still faithful to oath be bitterly humiliated at manner in large body of men have surrendered without striking blow at way in main force fled a hastily a if have suffered disgraceful defeat at approach of garibaldians already naples be almost in state of insurrection in other town whole populace have risen neapolitan authority be powerless be wonderful signor forli who arrived on following morning said to frank that calabrians must have remained passive for couple of century under rule of people so much inferior to that sicily must do so be not surprised population be not to be compared in physique with grand fellow among mountain of sicily doubt there may be finer type of people than of plain sea coast a have told although a pleased a crowd of child at new game did little to aid garibaldi to free messina once taken number enlisted with be small indeed here population have joined to man what splendid men be have risen together before there must have be need for garibaldi what must army however numerous of frivolous population of naples have done against there be hundred of pass ravine have ourselves marched through score might have be held by handful of determined men against army believe that be fear of cannon rather than of soldier have enabled decaying power like of naples to maintain hold cannon must be useful in mountainous country for who have to defend pass be of little avail to invader be notorious that even on plain vastly more men be killed by bullet than by shell one thing doubt have kept calabrians from rising a body be that blood feud exist among a in corsica number of cross that have seen by roadside mark number of victim of quarrel little village stand apart from rest there have be centre round country must gather there have be in fact community of interest community of feeling consequence be rising have be always partial there have be nothing like one determined effort by calabria to win freedom chapter xvi naples resemblance between colonel peard garibaldi be so great that being similarly dressed englishman pushing on so far in advance be everywhere taken for general utilised likeness to utmost news of rapid approach hastened retreat of neapolitan sent fictitious telegram to general a from private friend magnifying garibaldi force representing that be taking line must cut off from naples so sent hurrying away at full speed adding to alarm confusion of government suppose have better push on with garibaldi grandfather frank said one day a finished unusually long march certainly frank signor forli said somewhat surprised will be in naples in three four day be sure garibaldi will not wait for troop be saying to yesterday that be most anxious to enter city a have notice from friend that cavour party be hard at work trying to organise general rising of city before arrives issue of manifesto declaring victor emmanuel king of italy inviting to come at once garibaldi be determined not to allow have from first always declared that came in name of king that when work be done must hand over southern italy to know loyalty absolute disinterestedness idea that must endeavour to obtain advantage for be absurd if have chosen instead of accepting dictatorship of sicily must have be elected king assuredly be same thing here be people hero saviour very name of king of sardinia be scarcely known in sicily excites interest whatever be same thing in calabria enthusiasm be for garibaldi have consented to accept crown must have be elected unanimously wish hope be to present to victor emmanuel southern italy cleared of enemy complete undivided yet rather than so receive cavour farina rest of be intriguing at naples a intrigued in sicily in order that king must appear to take wide accession of territory a expression of will of people not from hand of garibaldi be pitiful to see such mean jealousy in time doubt even have there not be garibaldi must have come about might have be fifteen twenty year hence have be done by mean of royal army france austria must probably have interfered demanded compensation so left italy still incomplete be speed with change have be effected may say admiration with europe have viewed assurance of government at turin that have have hand in business have taken mean in power to prevent have paralysed opposition trust that intrigue will fail that garibaldi may have sole honour that craves namely that of presenting kingdom of two sicily to victor emmanuel must cavour intrigue succeed garibaldi be slighted will be blackest piece of ingratitude history have ever recorded however why do ask go on to naples thought that be burning to get there be see be passing without time for making investigation many place where father if alive may be in prison at potenza for example know that large number of political prisoner be confined doubtless be same at many other town can not bear to think of possibility that may be in one of that have passed by can quite understand feeling frank know be agreed that be at naples will most probably find if be still alive bad a prison may be in other place be more loosely managed there must be fewer convenience for keeping one prisoner apart from others while there be ample opportunity in of naples for many to be kept in secret confinement certainly be so kept at reggio be royal fortress though used a prison for political offender there be malefactor there in jail in provincial town must not be so know that prisoner be mixed up together save who can afford to pay who can live in comparative comfort while rest be herded together anyhow can scarcely exist upon ration allowed to more think of more be convinced that be at naples that must look for father now that have arrived at salerno that a hear neapolitan troop be falling back from capital taking up position round capua gaeta there can be little doubt that garibaldi will in day two go forward there be indeed nothing to prevent from going by train there to morrow if lay aside that red shirt scarf dress in clothes will attract attention see that anything must be gained by will still have to wait until garibaldi be supreme there order be respected may be sure that a soon a be in power first step will be to throw open prison release who be charged with political offence to order hideous dungeon to be permanently closed to thoroughly reorganise system have told that did at palermo will certainly do same at naples four day later king issued farewell notice to people left naples for gaeta three hour afterwards romano minister who have drawn up farewell addressed following telegram to garibaldi to invincible dictator of two sicily naples expects with anxiety to confide to future destiny entirely yours liborio romano subsequent letter informed that at meeting of minister have be decided that prince of alessandria syndic of naples must go to salerno with commander of national guard to make arrangement for entry into capital garibaldi however did not wait be to arrive at head of troop neapolitan garrison of castle other strong place in city might oppose by force a ever wishing to avoid bloodshed determined to rely solely upon populace of naples at once ordered small special train to be prepared be only taking with said to frank few of staff will be one of number have right to not only a representative of mother to whose aid be largely indebted for being now here for own personal service signor forli will also go stood by on wall of rome twelve year ago have suffered much for principle be mother father therefore too will come there be four carriage on little train that left at nine o'clock in morning on th of september for naples cosenz thirteen member of staff represented national army remaining seat being occupied by various personal friend two three newspaper correspondent be affair not without risk signor forli said to frank a walked towards station that people will receive garibaldi with enthusiasm be certain attitude of troop be very doubtful certainly flower of neapolitan army will have be left in garrison at naples if score of remain faithful to bourbon garibaldi life may be sacrificed however can not believe that providence will permit one who have done so great mighty work to perish just at moment of completion of enterprise station master at salerno a soon a train have started flashed news to various station on road consequence be that at village people assembled when journey be done crowd be so vast that overflowed on to line train be brought to standstill national guard climbed on to roof of carriage decorated with flag evergreen at torre del greco resina portici progress became almost impossible train have to proceed at snail pace to naples here authority have prevented all access to station outside scene be extraordinary one horse carriage men woman of highest of lowest class national guard gendarme member of bertani cavourian committee be crowded in confusion together house be decorated with flag tapestry thronged with eager spectator from basement to roof a missori three others rode out from station on horseback followed by garibaldi in open carriage with cosenz by dozen other carriage containing staff who have arrived with roar of welcome be overpowering be with greatest difficulty that horseman cleared way for along road crowd be a great a at station attitude of troop however at various point where be massed be sullen threatening at castel nuovo gun be pointed on road troop stood ready to fire one shot course of history might have be changed garibaldi ordered coachman to drive slower sat in carriage calmly with eye fixed upon troop one officer gave order to fire be not obeyed calmness daring of lion like face filled soldier with such admiration for moment hostility evaporated while of saluted a if to royal personage others took off hat burst into cheer garibaldi acknowledged by lifting hat by cheery wave of hand drove on a calmly a before in carriage behind have held breath at critical moment what escape what escape signor forli murmured to frank who be sitting next to have one musket be fired must have be dead men in minute two what be of more consequence freeing of italy must have be postponed for twenty year be horribly close frank said must rather go through ten hand to hand fight than time like last three minute have made feel quite queer own what say about putting back italian freedom for twenty year never entered mind one thought have be that be going to be smashed up without having chance of striking single blow went through pretty sharp fighting at palermo be always doing something then did not think of danger mind saying be in blue funk just now garibaldi drove straight a be custom of king on first entering naples to palace of archbishop here te deum be sung then went on to palace of angri where staff took up quarter vast crowd assembled outside palace general have to appear again again on balcony in reply to roar of acclamation from enthusiastic population general cosenz who be neapolitan be appointed to organise government did to general satisfaction moderate men only being chosen garibaldi requested admiral persano in name of victor emmanuel to take command of neapolitan navy decreeing that must form part of sardinian squadron appointed to pro dictatorship marquis of pallavicini staunch friend of king have offered signor forli apartment in palace a soon a first excitement have ceased latter said to frank who have at salerno received portmanteau have left at genoa let go out see state of city before do so have best put on ordinary clothes must simply be mobbed if be to go out a one of garibaldi officer yes have have quite enough of a came along frank said will really be comfort to go about for once in peace quiet started in few minute leaving palace by one of side entrance soon mingled in crowd people seemed half mad with delight a soon a news of garibaldi arrival spread through town house be decorated whole population poured out into street among better class joy that government of bourbon have come to end that constitutional government have done so much for northern italy must succeed despotism have pressed so heavily on with anything to lose be deep sincere among lower class enthusiasm manifested be excitement of few minute have francesco returned month later at head of victorious troop must have shouted a lustily be fete special fete mattered little to fickle excitable population what be cause here a on occasion when italian people give way to burst of enthusiasm foreigner be struck with perfect good temper orderly behaviour entire absence of drunkenness among population in paris first step of people excited by change of government must have be to fall upon whom considered to be agent of oppressor gendarme who have so long be feared must not have dared show in street emblem of royalty must have be torn down in public building member of last government must have be forced to fly for life there be little of in naples a in venice six year later feeling of animosity for past speedily passed away how faint be feeling of real patriotism in mind of neapolitan be shown by fact that only one inhabitant of city joined garibaldi army that not single house be open for reception of officer soldier after battle of volturno hundred of wounded men be left lying day on pavement without aid nourishment without single mattress being found for to lie upon by inhabitant never except by king of italy civil military authority of piedmont to garibaldi follower who have won kingdom for be such national ingratitude displayed a by people of naples be pleasant to see signor forli said a frank wandered about must be far more pleasant if one did not know that mean absolutely nothing have told that be same thing at messina that in spite of garibaldi appeal to lady of place did nothing whatever to aid wounded in hospital never contributed so much a piece of lint material for bandage frivolous a people there be in naples be worse if italy be like neapolitan country must not be worth shedding drop of blood for however one must make allowance for for century have be slave rather than free people have have voice a to own disposal must not express even opinion on public affair without risking imprisonment death there have be nothing left for to amuse have be treated like child at school have become child can only hope that in time under free government will grow worthy of freedom worthy of forming part of italy to lombard piedmontese calabrians belong be already late in afternoon until of troop arrived must be impossible to take step with relation to public building castle of st elmo prison of santa maria with many other place be still in hand of neapolitan soldier whose attitude continued to be hostile until retired nothing must be done be by mean certain that gun at st elmo completely commanded town might not at moment open fire can well understand impatience to get rid of troop from city garibaldi said next morning forget percival main object that have in view too long for time when may clasp hand of old comrade of south america rome promise that moment prison be evacuated will go with party who will search search strictly know what jailor be be creature of worst men of francesco government by year of cruelty oppression have earned for hatred of one within wall of prison of friend relative victory mean dismissal be a soon a prison be cleaned from lowest dungeon to roof that will superintend be who be responsible for will be engaged in work of purification may well be that will try to hide lowest worst dungeon from search partly from fear that natural righteous indignation excited by discovery may end in being promptly punished with death for accumulated crime partly in hope that royal troop may yet overcome restore francesco to throne in case must receive approval for still retaining of worst victim of tyranny of government may be sure that will search thoroughly general on going out found street be still thronged by almost frenzied populace invaded hotel cafe pressed must lay hand on to join in demonstration few murder be perpetrated state of thing prevailing affording excellent opportunity for satisfying private revenge a needed only cry that victim be spy of government to justify in eye of bystander in quarter nearest to st elmo enthusiasm have good deal cooled down a fear that gun of castle might at moment open fire for time dissipated desire for marching about acclaiming garibaldi at four o'clock however be known that two officer of castle have gone down to palace at six welcome news spread that garrison have capitulated must march out on following morning frank have little sleep that night all along hope have be high that must find father here now that question must be so soon decided fear be in ascendant remembered that evidence in favour of father death be extremely strong only hopeful fact being that body have not be discovered so slight did even mother signora forli deem chance of being alive that for two year have breathed word to other a to existence of possibility that might be still living undoubtedly release of grandfather have increased own hope felt now that there be small ground for feeling have father be hidden away in fortress might also have survived probability seemed altogether against be not until midday that st elmo be evacuated several company of national guard marched in colonel of staff have with frank be charged with duty of searching dungeon have brought with fifty lazzaroni who have be engaged for repulsive work dozen of garibaldian troop be to accompany prison official be all ordered to go with party a well a lazzaroni be told to bring pail broom castle of st elmo cover area of le than four acre be cut out of solid rock be surrounded by sunken ditch sixty seventy foot deep fifty wide great mass of stone be honeycombed in direction with network of corridor subterranean apartment there be ample space to hold several thousand prisoner upper tier of chamber be fairly clean be in fact barrack of troop gun looked out from embrasure several battery of field artillery with waggon fitting still remained there chamber be littered with rubbish of kind discarded by troop before leaving be not here that prisoner be to be found national guard have already opened door of cell chamber in stage below have liberated confined there work of searching still lower began at once extent be so vast winding be so intricate that work seemed interminable in order to make sure that passage have be searched pail of whitewash be sent for splash made at turning story be darker air more stifling than above for be now far below level of castle frank have taken advice of signor forli have bought several bundle of strongest cigar officer in command officer of national guard who attended soldier smoked incessantly at worst place lazzaroni turnkey be set to work with bucket broom be not until late in evening that came to conclusion cell chamber have be searched about hundred fifty prisoner have be found released among frank looked in vain for father lowest dungeon of have be found empty solemn assurance of prison official who have be threatened with instant death must further search discover prisoner convinced that at rate father be not there next day neighbouring prison of santa maria be searched have formerly be monastery upper cell be lofty capacious jailor declared indeed that be only cell careful search showed door in rock be burst open series of subterranean passage be discovered jailor declared that have never be used in time believed never before that have be used however be evident from mark where lamp have be hung on wall by many other sign prisoner be found here having be released directly be known that garrison of castle have capitulated search occupied whole day so extensive be underground gallery passage be discovered that evidently at one time formed communication between st elmo prison a came out into daylight frank staggered must have fallen have not one of soldier caught have be ill night before effect of close air noxious smell work have be even more trying than on previous day bitter disappointment have now completely overcome after water have be dashed in face have taken draught of wine one of prison official fetched partially recovered be assisted by two of garibaldians down road to town then obtaining vehicle be driven to palace managed with assistance to get up to apartment minute two later signor forli joined one of attendant having summoned a soon a frank arrived trouble to speak dear boy said frank be lying on bed sobbing convulsively have failed that can well understand must not altogether lose heart have thought most likely place there be still other prison will not give up hope until one of have be ransacked be sorry now that did not accompany be afraid after what have gone through that only few minute in one of place must overpower wonder how young strong a be be able to spend two day in such atmosphere will be better to morrow frank said that last place be awful think that be a much strong tobacco a horrible stink upset be choice of two evil must smoke even worse tobacco if must get if have to go through again will get glass of brandy water frank will do more good than anything next morning frank be still too unwell to be able to get up failure have completely broken down felt indisposed to make slightest exertion at twelve o'clock however signor forli came in have piece of news to give said news affords shadow of hope that have not failed altogether last night be talking with general one two of staff garibaldi be a know intensely interested in search sympathises with most warmly suddenly said 'be not possible that may have be removed before king court retired have percival be found in prison must have rendered bad faith mendacity of government more glaring than ever must have deprived of little sympathy be felt for in england therefore feeling sure that prison must be searched a soon a entered percival have be here may with other special prisoner have be sent to capua be so strongly fortified place that may well believe to be impregnable to anything long siege by troop possessing battering train illustration be not until nullo ordered four men to load that must answer frank sat up be indeed good idea exclaimed how stupid of not to have thought of questioning prison people yes be quite likely that if of prisoner be removed must be one of have doubt must have thought of frank if have not be that be completely upset by strong tobacco mind blame for taking be better to be poisoned with nicotine than by stench of neapolitan prison thought only struck garibaldi after have chatted over matter for time went over there morning with colonel although official at first asserted that prisoner have be taken away soon recovered memory when said that must interrogate one of warder separately if found that prisoner have be sent away must have taken out into courtyard shot for lying to then remembered that four prisoner have be taken away declared with adjuration to saint that did not know who be be delivered over to under number only one have be there seven year two have be there five year one two year again threatening to examine turnkey learned that last prisoner received have be confined in one of lower dungeon where yesterday asserted that one have for year be imprisoned other three be also kept in most rigid seclusion in upper cell insisted on seeing man who have attended on prisoner kept in lower cell be surly ruffian be not until nullo ordered four men to load to put fellow with back to wall that must answer question said then that prisoner be must say between forty fifty be not easy to judge of age after man have be below there for few month have never said more than few word to have never struck that be not italian questioned more closely a to admitted that have sometimes when went down heard prisoner singing have listened must not understand word might have be in foreign language have more interest in prisoner than in other supposed by being sent down below there that be hoped must die off a soon a possible seldom lived many month in dungeon man seemed tougher than usual though strength have failed good deal lately be able to walk up from cell to carriage when be taken away now must feel too sanguine frank although there be proof that prisoner be father evidence so far a go be rather in favour of such supposition than against be indeed frank said eagerly fact that put down into cell where a man say be almost certain must soon die that when be found that have not done so be at last moment taken away show that there be very strong motive for preventing fact that be prisoner becoming public know that have very strongest reason in case of father age must be about right fact that be singing must show at rate that be one who be determined not to give in to keep up spirit till very last be sure father must have done well will get up now must not lie here quietly must be impossible after what have be telling think be right frank will have basin of soup sent in for when have eaten that dressed will take carriage go for long drive by road along shore to pompeii sea breeze will do more good than anything lovely view stroll through pompeii will distract thought there be nothing to be done until capua be taken may not be for long time yet however event be moving hear that victor emmanuel government alarmed at success of garibaldi feeling that if be to have voice in matter must not be content to rest passive while be carrying before have resolved upon taking part in affair under pretext that in order to restore peace order be necessary that must interfere be about to despatch army to ancona by sea landing there will advance into central italy act a say a circumstance may demand of mean that now garibaldi have pulled chestnut out of fire for will proceed to appropriate be too bad frank exclaimed angrily doubt be mean ungracious in extreme garibaldi will not feel a other men must be human therefore must like to present kingdom of naples state of rome free from foreigner to victor emmanuel that feeling natural a be be secondary to loyalty to italy desire to see one under victor emmanuel so long a end be achieved care comparatively little how come about moreover can not see that though have accomplished marvel that remains to be done must tax power of army to utmost neapolitan have still seventy thousand men who be encouraged by king being among have in capua most formidable fortress must defy effort of irregular troop wholly unskilled in siege deficient in heavy gun for many month moreover must no longer be mountain warfare must have to fight in plain where enemy cavalry must give enormous advantage there be thing intrigue of cavour agent here be already giving very serious trouble will doubtless increase therefore can well understand that will be glad rather than otherwise sardinia at last must do part towards freeing of italy from will benefit so vastly chapter xvii battle of volturno before starting for drive frank telegraphed to mother have not found here yet despair have faint clue may lead to something that evening wrote long letter acknowledging that have be bitterly disappointed saying that signor forli have found out that of prisoner have be sent away to capua before garibaldi entered town that still hoped father might be among number gave detail a to prisoner for be anxious not to raise hope might not be fulfilled indeed have in letter said little on subject knew mother have refused to allow to cherish hope have written almost entirely of matter concerning event of march country through have travelled scene in have taken part signor forli have at salerno received long letter from home full of delight news of discovery release of latter have given mother have said be joy indeed boy one have never expected even hoped for let anticipate for moment because unlooked for happiness have be given to other dear lost one will similarly be recovered that father have be thrown into neapolitan prison never doubted for moment believed must have survived garibaldi success must open prison door be not so in case of father evidence be almost overwhelming that died in hand of brigand who carried off nothing short of knowing that be alive will induce to abandon conviction have along felt that be so pray not to indulge in false hope can end in bitter disappointment will of course search until absolutely convinced that be not in of prison of country search will at least have be useful for will remove last dread in spite of myself have occasionally felt ever since have be missing that have be wearing life out in one of horrible dungeon next ten day passed slowly frank other member of staff have bought fresh horse few day after capture of reggio be now constantly in saddle carrying message between garibaldi headquarters army garibaldi have be distracted by intrigue going on around have be obliged to go to sicily depretis who have be appointed head of government there be inclined to annexational policy be opposed by crispi other garibaldians consequence be that alarming state of affair existed there garibaldi be therefore obliged to hurry over there having appointed determined partisan of own pro dictator arranged affair generally returned to naples where presence be urgently required illustration position round capua neapolitan army at capua have be very largely reinforced have taken post along river volturno turr who be in command of garibaldian army have in consequence taken up defensive position at madelone caserta aversa thereby barring advance on part of royal army latter position be extremely formidable one right rested on gaeta near sea forty thousand men be massed on right bank of volturno river be here from fifty to hundred yard in width left be at cajazzo in mountain of abruzzi where inhabitant be favourable to royal cause capua on left bank of river afforded mean of moving forward to attack of garibaldians three side of fortification be surrounded by river here make great loop around town twenty thousand men be massed one half of whom be in position in front of only bridge across river be at capua there be ferry near caserta position be so threatening that turr who have under about seventeen thousand men pushed force up to town of santa maria height of sant'angelo of point be occupied after skirmish on th six hundred men be sent off to march far up river to cross to throw into mountain above cajazzo be occupied by two thousand two hundred men with four gun garibaldi arrived at caserta on night of th did not interfere with turr command in order to attract attention of enemy keep from sending reinforcement to cajazzo be arranged that feint must be made against capua two battalion be to advance from aversa to menace southwest of town six battalion be to advance directly against from santa maria ebor brigade be to march to sant'angelo then to drive neapolitan on left into capua to extend on right along hill a far a road to cajazzo movement be completely successful cajazzo be captured force in front of capua obliged to retire under gun of citadel loss however be sustained owing to division from santa maria instead of returning a soon a work be done being kept for four hour under fire of gun of fortress owing to misconception of order position now taken be occupied in strength next day six hundred fifty men be sent off to cajazzo to strengthen small force of three hundred there a place be attacked by fewer than twelve thousand neapolitan troop although without artillery town be desperately defended for four hour barricade at end of main street be held in spite of repeated attack fire from eight gun not until two hundred of little force have fallen did garibaldians fall back succeeded in crossing river at ferry covered by two company couple of gun have be posted at point to prevent neapolitan from crossing there be interval now garibaldians be far too weak to attack numerous enemy posted in almost impregnable position garibaldi be so much harassed by political intriguer that left caserta morning long before daybreak remained whole day at cottage on height of san antonio have already done in power to satisfy royal party that have intention of favouring republic bertram who have done so much for a chief organiser agent be requested to leave rome mazzini also be sent away other appointment be made showing how bent be on handing over conquest to victor emmanuel there can be doubt now that must have be far better have from first abandoned wish not to present conquest to king until be completed have on arrival at messina at once declared victor emmanuel king of island requested to take possession must have allayed jealousy suspicion with movement be viewed by cavour piedmontese ministry similar course a soon a naples be occupied must have have still greater effect garibaldi brave follower must have be spared bitter humiliation gross display of ingratitude however disgraced who inflicted far more than so undeservedly treated turr remained idle during next six day beyond throwing up two three small intrenchment did nothing to strengthen position in fact be daily becoming more probable that there must be further fighting cialdini division have landed near alcona have defeated army of lamoriciere be advancing westward without opposition fanti with army have crossed northern frontier of neapolitan territory be marching south thus in short time neapolitan must be surrounded by three army must be forced to lay down arm on th became evident that considerable movement be in progress on other side of river fort forty thousand men be being concentrated at capua cajazzo garibaldi force available in case of attack be about twenty four thousand men of whom thirteen thousand be northern italian eleven thousand calabrians sicilian one inhabitant of naples of two thousand five hundred be with conti at aversa over seven thousand at caserta remainder being at santa maria sant'angelo village of santa lucia madalone position occupied be nearly thirty mile long reserve at caserta madalone lying behind centre must be despatched speedily to point required frank have come out with garibaldi to caserta spent whole of time riding between different point occupied with communication from garibaldi to general at three o'clock on morning of october st garibaldi started a usual for front frank with two three of younger staff officer rode three carriage carried general older member of staff have scarcely left town when scattered fire of musketry be heard near santa maria rapidly increased in volume soon afterwards gun at sant'angelo opened vigorously when approaching town mounted soldier riding at furious gallop overtook be bearer of message that telegram have just be received from bixio who be in command at madalone saying that be being assailed in great force be even more serious than attack in front for if successful must have cut communication between garibaldians naples galloping on to santa maria garibaldi sent telegram to sartori who commanded at caserta to tell to hold brigade in readiness to support bixio if latter be pressed that turr with rest of reserve be to hold in readiness to move to front be only to send forward single brigade till quite assured of bixio success at santa maria be greater part of old cacciatori with four thousand other good troop garibaldi felt confident that town be in danger of being taken accordingly started at once for sant'angelo be key of position morning have broken now heavy mist rising from low ground near river rendered impossible to see more than few yard din of conflict be prodigious garibaldian gun at santa maria kept up desultory fire answered by of neapolitan rattle of musketry be incessant ahead a seemed fight be raging round be impossible to tell whether santa lucia other post to right be also attacked suddenly volley be fired from invisible enemy within hundred yard ball whistled overhead be uncomfortable frank said to officer riding next to have evidently broken through line connecting sant'angelo with santa maria if have have few earthwork thrown up must not have happened now will be able to take sant'angelo in rear what be much more important may at moment run right into middle of loss of garibaldi must be more serious than of position put together neapolitan have indeed issued out in three column one of pushing out under cover of deep water course have broken through weak line have captured battery of four gun barricade have then mounted one of spur of tifata taken sant'angelo in rear while second column attacking in front have captured four gun battery barricade two hundred fifty yard below village on capua road have taken two three hundred prisoner rest of medici division taking up position in around abbey stood on hillside above village illustration map of battle of volturno october three of guide who have accompanied garibaldi to carry message three mounted staff officer took place in front of carriage in readiness to charge must come suddenly upon enemy so give time to occupant to escape horse be galloping at full speed though occasionally caught sight of by enemy exposed to fire not only of musketry of round shot remained uninjured until two third of distance to sant'angelo garibaldi believed to be still in possession of troop have be covered presently however saw sixty seventy yard away strong body of neapolitan on road turn off to right garibaldi shouted a carriage left road round shot struck one of horse garibaldi other occupant at once jumped out shouting to carriage behind to follow ran across field fortunately there be deep watercourse close by others leaving carriage ran down into mist be too thick for movement to be observed neapolitan kept up heavy fire in direction in have seen carriage through mist a soon a entered watercourse garibaldi told frank companion to dismount a although bank be high enough to conceal men on foot on horseback must be seen above ran along at top of speed a did so frank told companion guide if came upon force of enemy to throw into saddle again charge so a to give time to general to turn off escape have gone few hundred yard when party of enemy who be standing on left bank of watercourse ran suddenly down into frank others sprang into saddle with shout rode at there be hurried discharge of musketry then be in midst of neapolitan be twenty in number have already emptied musket for minute there be hand to hand contest horseman first used revolver with deadly effect then fell on with sword so fiercely that survivor of opponent scrambled out of watercourse fled just a garibaldi staff ran up to take part in conflict be well for general that have found road to village blocked for have ridden straight on must have be captured by enemy who be already in full possession of with exception of abbey church few house round slope of hill two of mounted party be missing one of guide have fallen when neapolitan fired officer have be killed by thrust of bayonet one of garibaldi party be also missing whether have be killed by chance shot have fallen behind be taken prisoner none knew a ascended slope of hill got above mist must now see what have happened part of column have broken through line of outpost have pressed on distance then moved to left until in rear of

in resided priest servitor of church only road leading up from village to be swept by two twenty four pounder while from window of house from roof of abbey steady musketry fire be maintained garibaldi ordered frank to gallop to pas short distance behind village where two company of genoese carbineer two mountain howitzer be posted to direct to mount hill take up position on height above occupied by enemy with cheer men ran forward a soon a received order ignorant of what be taking place in front certain from roar of battle that be raging round village have be eager to advance to take part in struggle order to hold pas have be imperative a presence here be indispensable to cover retreat of garibaldians in sant'angelo to check pursuit until reinforcement came up from rear movement be unobserved by enemy who be fully occupied in attempt to capture abbey be not until two company be established on ridge well above occupied by neapolitan opened heavy musketry fire aided by two gun that latter be aware that have be taken in rear position be altogether untenable a be unable to reply effectively to fire of opponent descending slope joined comrade in village several desperate attack be made upon abbey be repulsed with heavy loss a carbineer have now moved lower down gun commanded village neapolitan lost heart fell back battalion of garibaldi bersaglieri now came up be commanded by colonel wyndham occupied village a neapolitan fell back quickened retreat then descending to four gun battery have first be taken turned gun enemy have forgotten to spike upon in meantime fighting have be fierce round santa maria at first garibaldians have be hard pressed neapolitan have carried before until came under fire of battery placed on railway in front of gate facing capua be well served although assailant several time advanced with cavalry infantry never succeeded in getting within hundred yard of gun left wing however swept round town captured out building except farmhouse be gallantly defended by company of frenchman on right neapolitan fared still more badly for when attack upon battery failed garibaldian force at san tamaro nearly three thousand five hundred strong advanced took in flank drove back with heavy loss by eight o'clock attack have ceased all along line a enemy while falling back preserved good order attempt be made to follow battle have lasted four hour garibaldians be now strengthened by arrival of brigade with four gun from caserta where news have just arrived that bixio be confident of being able to hold ground at madalone two of newly arrived regiment be ordered to endeavour to reopen communication with sant'angelo fighting went on with force still threatening santa maria after suffering heavy loss garibaldians at ten o'clock drove distance back captured three gun many prisoner at eleven fresh attack be made count trani one of king brother having brought fresh battalion from town attack be also repulsed garibaldians maintaining strong position neapolitan troop be still full of spirit at quarter past one made determined effort field battery advanced within three hundred yard of town cavalry charged almost up to railway battery be received with so heavy infantry fire by troop protecting gun that be forced to fall back infantry however pressed on covered by storm of fire from field artillery while gun of capua aided by firing shell into town garibaldians serving gun at gate at railway suffered very heavily volunteer from infantry regiment took place although at one time fire be arrested by explosion of magazine killed many of men dismounted two three of gun time fighting be going on fiercely round sant'angelo two regiment have be sent out from santa maria to open communication with village have be unable to effect object enemy force being too strong for to move far from town at eleven o'clock neapolitan being largely reinforced made fresh attack on battery barricade in front of sant'angelo obstinate struggle took place here superior force triumphed royal troop again captured battery killing taking prisoner almost whole of force defended infantry cavalry then advanced against village garibaldians having leader among fought with extraordinary bravery for three hour maintained a did in abbey although enemy brought up cannon rocket battery to within short distance of wall of abbey be however so massive that even artillery failed to make much impression upon seeing that assault upon santa maria have be repulsed garibaldi sallied out with entire force retook house have be captured by enemy drove back to battery at last captured also knowing that of reserve must soon be up garibaldi at half past two rode out from rear of sant'angelo making wide detour entered santa maria at once ordered general advance ebor brigade sallied out by capua gate advanced against carthusian convent cemetery on capuan road while brigade moved out to endeavour once more to clear way to sant'angelo former attack be successful small squadron of hungarian hussar charged three squadron of enemy dragoon defeated captured two gun accompanied infantry went on at run required hour hard fighting to gain possession of convent cemetery by time five thousand men with thirteen gun have arrived from caserta advance became general medici issued out from sant'angelo whole force from santa maria advanced neapolitan falling back from point by five o'clock whole have re entered capua abandoning position outside garibaldian sentry be posted along edge of wood half mile from rampart until arrival of five thousand men of reserve garibaldians have throughout day although nine thousand five hundred strong maintained successfully against thirty thousand men supported by powerful artillery at madalone bixio have routed seven thousand men who have advanced against position have captured four gun only reverse sustained be at castel morone be garrisoned by only two hundred twenty seven men of one of garibaldi bersaglieri regiment held out for hour against neapolitan column three thousand strong then having expended ammunition be obliged to surrender battle of volturno cost garibaldians

sardinian artillery with regiment of bersaglieri have be landed few day before at garibaldi request have arrived at santa maria did good service by taking place of gunner who have be almost annihilated by enemy fire bersaglieri did not arrive at caserta till battle be over wearied by day fight garibaldians a soon a long work of searching for bringing in wounded be over lay down to sleep frank two other aide de camp of garibaldi be however aroused within hour of lying down news have arrived that neapolitan column have captured castel morone have suddenly appeared on height above caserta number be estimated at three thousand order be sent to bixio to occupy strong position column be directed to start from sant'angelo santa maria for caserta while brigade be to reinforce garrison of santa lucia at two in morning garibaldi started for caserta moved out with two thousand five hundred calabrians four company of piedmontese bersaglieri latter soon found obliged to take off knapsack hat useless accoutrement finding picked men a be unable to keep up with garibaldians clad only in shirt trouser carrying nothing ninety round of ammunition there be little fighting garibaldians lost seven eight men among whom be three piedmontese who be first men of sardinian army to shed blood for emancipation of naples by evening over two thousand five hundred prisoner be taken number be doubled in course of next few day by capture of large portion of force after being defeated by bixio in attempt to seize madalone have scattered over country pillaging burning thus including fugitive who escaped neapolitan army be weakened by loss of nearly ten thousand men explanation of singular attack upon caserta after defeat of neapolitan army be that after capturing castel morone commander have received despatch stating that complete defeat have be inflicted on garibaldi urging to cut off retreat of fugitive by occupying caserta now that work be over that there be nothing to be done until royal army advanced from ancona brushing aside opposition arrived to undertake siege of capua frank broke down have not fully recovered from effect of two long day spent in pestilential atmosphere of prison have stuck to work until neapolitan surrendered then rode up to garibaldi said general must ask to spare from duty for feel so strangely giddy that can scarce keep seat look ill lad hand horse over to one of guide have sent for carriage will be up in few minute sit down in shade of tree will take down to caserta with one of bixio doctor will see at once on arriving at caserta doctor at once pronounced that be case of malarial fever result of miasma from low ground increased doubt by over fatigue garibaldi immediately ordered carriage to be brought round instructed two of men to take place in with frank despatched telegram to professor forli at naples telling to have four men in readiness to carry up to room a soon a reached palace to have doctor in waiting frank be almost unconscious by time arrived at city everything be ready be soon undressed in bed ice applied to head draught of medicine poured down throat in week fever left be so much weakened that be fortnight before must move about again unassisted have lost nothing thing have be very quiet grandfather said to day voting take place of course be mere farce country will declare for victor emmanuel by thousand vote to one medici have be occupied in putting down insurrection in mountain cialdini have won two battle on way west large piedmontese force have landed here undertaken work of garrison how long will be before cialdini arrives with army before capua must think that must be week must be able to go forward again by time frank said must be at capua when be taken quite understand feeling be eager to be there must have patience neapolitan have withdrawn force from cajazzo country round into town there be now nine thousand men there if commander be obstinate ought to be able to defend place for month still grant that obstinacy have not be strong point of neapolitan general hitherto though must be said that troop fought gallantly other day coming back again again to attack commander of town however brave may be must see that even if can hold out for next ten year must not benefit francesco game be already hopelessly lost garibaldians single handed have proved capable of defeating neapolitan troop with army that cialdini have brought from ancona have marched down from north cause be beyond hope army now in gaeta garrison of capua alone remain in arm must say that ere fortnight have passed francesco be likely to have left country for ever quite so grandfather frank replied be have be thinking for last week be why be so anxious to go forward again a soon a possible that will certainly do at rate have few more day to stay here then will get carriage go to santa lucia lying high in mountain change to splendid air there will benefit while stay at santa maria caserta must at once throw back chapter xviii capua garibaldi have be remaining quietly at caserta when on th received message from cialdini inviting to cross river be in readiness to co
