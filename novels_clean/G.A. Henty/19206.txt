of a be said that queen most gracious majesty doth gladly hear of beating of spaniard in sea becometh not to question right of case at rate father must not object when time come for to sail with mr francis drake boy thou hast never shown aptitude whatever for learning thou canst read write beyond thy knowledge runneth not mind seems to be set on water when be not in be on therefore appears to to be flying in face of providence to try to keep on shore have poor mother lived must have be different thing mind be set upon becoming clerk there one might a well try to make silk purse from ear of sow tell again count not too much upon promise may be year before mr francis drake may be in position to keep have ned hearne watched for captain drake second voyage must indeed a father have said

at plymouth in three day at utmost bringing with what gear may require for expedition schoolmaster be little taken aback at sudden prospect of departure have always be wholly indulgent to son be not in nature to refuse to allow to avail of opportunity appeared to be excellent one danger of expedition be doubt very great spoil be in proportion there be not boy man of seafaring population of devon who must not gladly have gone with adventurous captain chapter friend foe three day after receipt of letter ned hearne stood with bundle on quay at plymouth near lay large rowboat from ship waiting to take off last comer little way behind captain francis drake brother captain john drake talked with notable people of plymouth who have come down to bid farewell more since be holiday being whitsun eve th may in town who must spare time have made way down to hove to watch departure of expedition for none must say how famous might become how great deed must be accomplished by two little craft lying there looker on thought to that might be that to end of life must tell child child child with pride saw mr drake start for great voyage small indeed did fleet appear in comparison to work have to do be composed of two vessel first pacha of seventy ton carrying forty seven men boy be commanded by captain francis drake by side be swanne of twenty five ton carrying twenty six men boy commanded by captain john drake be truly small affair to undertake so great voyage in day spaniard be master of whole of south america of isle of west indie have many very large town full of troop great fleet armed to carry treasure be collected there to spain did seem almost like act of madness that two vessel by side of of spaniard be mere cockleshell manned in by le than eighty men must attempt to enter region where must be regarded rightly a enemy where hand of man must be against captain drake men thought little of thing success have attended predecessor have inspired english sailor with belief in own invincibility when opposed to spaniard looked to certain extent upon mission a crusade in day england have horror of popery spain be mainstay supporter of religion escape england have have of having popery forced upon during reign of mary by spouse philip of spain have be narrow one even now be by mean certain that spain must not sooner later endeavor to carry out pretension of late queen husband then too terrible tale have come of suffering of indian at hand of spaniard be certain that english sailor who have fallen into hand of spain have be put to death with horrible cruelty thus then english sailor regarded spaniard a enemy of country a enemy of religion a enemy of humanity besides can not be denied that viewed a rich men well worth plundering although when came to fighting be probable that hatred overbore thought of gain be certain that desire for gold be in main incentive to who sailed upon expedition amid cheer of townsfolk boat pushed off mr francis drake brother waving plumed hat to burgher of plymouth sailor giving hurrah a bent to oar ned hearne who have received kind word of greeting from mr drake have taken place in bow of one of boat lost in admiration at scene at thought that be one of band of hero who be going out to fight spaniard to return laden with countless treasure wrested from at thought eye sparkled blood seemed to dance through vein western main in day be name almost of enchantment such strange tale have be brought home by voyager who have navigated sea of wonderful tree bright bird beauty of nature gold silver abundance of precious thing that be dream of youngster on seaboard day to penetrate to charmed region week since realization of dream have appeared beyond wildest hope now almost with suddenness of transformation scene have changed there be on way out to swanne part of expedition be to swanne that have be allotted for be on board ship that boy whose place be to take have be seized with illness although twenty five ton in burden swanne made far greater show than must be made by craft of size in present day ship of time lay lightly on water while hull be carried up to prodigious height be not too much to say that portion of swanne above water be fully a large a hull see of merchantman of four time tonnage still even so be tiny craft to cross atlantic former voyage have be generally made in larger ship mr francis drake however knew what be about considered that large ship required large crew to be left behind to defend that drew more water be le handy resolved in expedition must do small part of work with pinnace rowboat of have three fine craft now lying in piece in hold ready to fit together on arriving in indie a neared ship two boat separated ned soon found alongside of swanne ladder hung at side up ned followed captain for in day strict etiquette that highest go last have not be instituted master holyoake said mr john drake to big powerful looking man standing near be new lad whose skill in swimming whose courage told of yesternight will doubt not be found a willing a be brave trust that will put in way of learning business a sailor be first voyage come on board green hand doubt not that ere voyage be finished will have become smart young sailor will put through john holyoake sailing master of ship replied for in day sailing master be navigator of ship captain be a often a not soldier who knew nothing whatever about one sailed ship other fought admiral be in day more frequently known a general held position on shore a ned looked round deck thought that have never seen finer set of sailor be picked men hardy experienced for most part young have made previous voyage to west indie greater portion be new to country looked men on whom captain must rely to last tall stalwart bronzed with sun with reckless fearless expression about boded ill to foe upon whom might fall although ned have never be to sea on long voyage have sailed too often in fishing boat of native village to have qualm of seasickness to feel in degree like new hand be therefore at once assigned to place duty hour later admiral a mr francis drake be called fired gun two vessel hoisted broad sail turned head from shore crew of ship gave parting cheer a turned face to south a ned be not in slightest degree homesick seasick at once fell to work laughing joking with other boy of whom there be three on board found that duty consisted of bearing message of hauling rope to be told to fix in receiving with a good face a might be various order to say nothing of various kick might be bestowed upon by on board at same time cheerful countenance showed that thing when told sounded little terrible be in truth in way serious ned be first shown where be to sling hammock how where be to get food under whose order be specially to consider master for present taking under own charge for next ten day a vessel sailed calmly along with favoring wind ned have learned name of rope sail us must climb aloft do share of work of ship if not yet skilled sailor be at least on high road to become one master be pleased at willingness eagerness to oblige soon became great favorite of between four boy on ship good feeling existed have be chosen a special favor upon recommendation of one other of in authority of have made up mind that one of day too must command expedition to west indie thought of glory must attain although in heart of many of elder men in expedition substantial benefit to be reaped stood higher than idea of glory honor to lad at least pecuniary gain exercised inducement whatever burned to see strange country to gain of credit glory must if voyage be successful attach to member of crew be full of fun took what came to in way of work so good temperedly cheerfully that men soon ceased to give work for work sake be too strong well built group of boy ned be by full year youngest by nigh head shortest of broad shoulder sturdy build strength acquired by long practice in swimming rowing made equal there be however quarrel among strength agreed to use in alliance if need be must of crew make dead set at one other of for even in expedition like there must be brutal a well a many brave men there be assuredly two three at least of on board swanne who might well be called brutal be for most part old hand who have lived on board ship life have taken part in slave traffic of captain hawkins in buccaneering exploit of earlier commander to voyage be one in lust of gold be sole stimulant accustomed to deed of bloodshed what feeling ever have have become utterly blunted needed power to become despotic brutal master chief among be giles taunton armorer be swarthy ruffian who hid beneath guise of jovial bonhomie cruel unfeeling nature be ever ready to cuff beat boy on smallest provocation soon gathered together in sort of defensive league against common oppressor four be high spirited lad other three indeed be son of men of substance in devon whose father have lent fund to captain drake for carrying out of great enterprise therefore looked ill on kick curse occasionally fell to lot one day gathered together round bowsprit talked over what must do gerald summer eldest of party proposed that must go in body to captain drake complain of tyranny to be subject after talk however agreed that course a must lower in estimation of men that must be better to put up with ill treatment than to get name of tell tale ned then said to others seems to that if do hold together need not be afraid of big bully if declare to other swear that first time strike one of will set upon faith on will be able to master big a be be of good size in two year will think men therefore must be shame indeed if four of must not master one however big sturdy may be after much consultation be agreed that course must be adopted next day a reuben gale be passing by giles turned round struck on head with broom boy gave long whistle in moment to astonishment of armorer other three lad rushed up at once assailed with fury astonished at attack struck out at with many strange oath gerald knocked down ned leaped on back from behind other two closing with rolled on to deck then despite of effort pummeled until face be swollen bruised eye nearly closed of men of own sort standing by must fain have interfered better disposed of crew who have seen with disgust conduct of armorer mate to boy held back said that none must come between just a boy drew off allowed furious armorer to rise to foot captain john drake attracted by unusual noise came from cabin what be asked young wild cat have leapt upon said giles taunton furiously have beaten nigh to death will have turn will see bitterly will have cause to regret what have done have be driven almost weary of life sir with foul rough conduct of man of of mate gerald said did not like to come to tell of to gain name of carry tale have resolved among ourselves at last that whoever struck one of whole must set upon today have carried out have shown giles taunton that be more than match for one man at rate four good sized dog if be well managed said captain john drake will pull down lion best thing that lion can do be to leave alone be sorry to hear master taunton that have chosen to mistreat lad who be indeed son of worthy men be not common kind of ship boy be sure that brother must not brook such conduct warn that if complaint again on head reach will lay before with angry muttering armorer went below have earned bitter foe ned said to friend have best keep eye well open there be very little of lion about master taunton be strong indeed if be true that lion have noble heart fight foe openly methinks resembles rather tiger who be prone to leap suddenly upon enemy yes indeed looked dark enough gerald said a went below if look must have killed must not be standing here alive at present be not force that need fear now that will do foul turn at event be now forewarned if play scurvy trick will be own fault for several day voyage went on quietly without adventure passed at distance portuguese isle of madeira lying like cloud on sea weather now have become warm very fair steady wind blew two bark kept along at good pace sort of creature strange to boy be to be seen in sea sometimes there be spout of distant whale thousand of flying fish darted from water driven thence by pursuit of enemy beneath while huge flock of gull other bird hovered over sea chasing flying fish pouncing down upon shoal of small fry whose splashing whitened surface of water a if sandbank have laid below gradually a time went on heat increased many of crew found unable to sleep below for in day there be little thought of ventilation boy be among for heat confinement be to especially irksome one day wind have fallen almost to calm small boat have be lowered to enable carpenter to do repair to ship side where seam leaked somewhat when wave be high when night came on be quiet ned proposed to others that must slip down rope over stern into boat be towing behind where must sleep undisturbed by tramp of sentry call to pull at rope trim sail idea be considered capital one boy slid down into boat where taking up quarter a comfortably a must after short chat curled up be soon sound asleep intending to be on board again with earliest gleam of morn when awoke however be with start cry sun be already high there be sign of ship floated alone in mid ocean with blank amazement looked at other be stroke of misfortune indeed gerald said have lost ship fear life a well what do say otter for lad nickname have come on board ship with be generally known by seems to said ned that friend armorer have done bad turn be sure that rope be well tied for be first who slipped down looked at knot well before went over side trusted weight to must have seen a soon a thought be fairly asleep must have loosened knot cast adrift what on earth be to be done now must think gerald said that will not be long before ship come back for boat be sure to be missed in morning for carpenter will be wanting to go over side too will be missed for captain will be wanting flagon of wine soon after day have dawned think tom tressilis said that captain will turn back on voyage for of think there be doubt gerald said only question be a to finding must say that of there be little fear wind be light ship be not making fast through water will not be more than fifty mile at most away when turn on heel come to look for expect that master taunton knew well enough that must be picked up again guessed that admiral must not be pleased at losing day by freak that matter be not likely to improve favor in may stand with brother be going to be terrible hot day ned said with sun above head shade not so much a drop of water sooner be picked up more pleasant will be even if get touch of rope end for exploit day boy watched anxiously once saw two vessel sailing backward on track current have drifted boat ship passed fully eight mile away to windward of thus without seeing caused boy courageous a be almost to despair if argued gerald pas in daylight chance be small indeed that will find at night will doubtless sail back till dusk then judge that have missed that have in way sunk then putting head to west will continue voyage if have oar sail might make shift to pull boat into track be following must give chance of being picked up when again turn west a have one other be helpless indeed think ned said that captain john brother be men to leave without great effort methinks that when have sailed over ground to point where at utmost must have parted from will lay by through night search back again tomorrow so proved on morrow about midday boy beheld one of ship coming up nearly in line behind while other six mile away to leeward be keeping abreast of be quartering ground like hound gerald said thanks to care thoughtfulness be saved time by time three hour later ship be pacha came alongside boy be suffering terribly from heat thirst for thirty six hour drop of water have passed lip sun have blazed down upon with terrible force therefore when vessel hauled course laid by for boat to be lowered to pick up plight be so bad one captain francis although sorely vexed at having lost near two day of voyage yet felt that have be amply punished for escapade chapter on spanish main four boy upon gaining pacha deck be taken below after drink food have be given be called to captain cabin spoke to gravely inquired how be that have got adrift together told circumstance said that thought there be chance of mishap occurring knot be well fastened night be calm though regretted much pain trouble have given delay to have put fleet yet did not appear to said frankly that have be so very much to blame a must hardly have believed that boat must have broken afloat indeed ned said plainly believed that be not result of chance that enemy have done evil turn why think so captain drake said sharply how can boy like have enemy gerald then detailed account of trouble with master taunton be rough man captain drake said violent man maybe be useful brave however will have reason with of course be mere suspicion will speak to brother when boat have first come in sight pacha have made signal to swanne that boy be found that be to keep course drawing gradually alongside before dark vessel be within hailing distance captain drake lowering boat went on board swanne with four lad captain john be at top of ladder be about to rate soundly captain francis said let talk together john first repaired with to cabin while crew swarmed round boy to gather account of how got adrift then captain john appeared at door of cabin called for master taunton who went in remained for time in converse with two captain then came out looking surly black captain francis soon after issued out with brother walked round ship said few cheery word to crew with parting laugh word of advice to boy to be more careful where slept in future descended side went off to ship again opinion be much mingled on board swanne a to whether slipping of knot have be effect of accident of evil turn however boy said little about endeavored so far a might be to let pas a accident felt that matter between master taunton have already gone too far for safety comfort doubted not that have be reprimanded by admiral a well a by captain john that have earned hatred although might slumber for while be likely to show again when chance might occur not wishing to inflame farther fury against abstained from giving complexion to tale a might seem to cast suspicion upon nevertheless there be strong feeling amongst many of crew master taunton must have have hand in casting adrift of boy that if did not do have be done by one of party who always worked with feeling of giles taunton might be kept to now never interfered with boy by word deed working sullenly quietly at craft a armorer boy felt life much lightened thereby now thoroughly enjoyed voyage although a boy be not part of duty to go aloft be done by regular sailor who be hired for purpose yet spent small part of time when not engaged duty truly be nominal in going aloft sliding down rope learning to be thoroughly at home among sail day too there must be practice with arm be of utmost importance that man must be able to use sword axe with greatest skill on board ship who be best skilled must exercise give lesson to who be le practiced with arm using wooden club in place of boarding ax must much belabor other to amusement of looker on boy be most assiduous at kind of work be highest ambition to become good swordsman to have chance of distinguishing against spaniard so practiced diligently with point edge knowledge of singlestick quarterstaff still lingered in country part of england have already skill with picked up fast use of heavier more manly arm be end of july before sighted land great be delight of for cooped up in what be after narrow quarter longed for sight of green beautiful forest of have heard so much be still far from destination admiral have marked a base of operation cruised along for day with land often in sight keeping for most part long distance out for feared that knowledge of coming might be carried by native to spaniard in town such preparation might be made a must render journey fruitless near however to of smaller island be known to be uninhabited by spaniard vessel went closely one day dropped anchor in bay observed native on shore white men have so bad name caused by cruelty of spaniard that withdrew hastily from sight captain however have boat lowered pulling towards shore waving white flag in token of amity met with resistance there be on board who must speak spanish one of shouted aloud to indian to have fear for be friend hater of spaniard whereupon native came out from wood greeted be fine race of men gentle timid in demeanor be copper in color wore headdress of bright feather men have little other clothing of indeed in such climate there be slight necessity in exchange for trifle from ship brought many basket of fruit such a none of who have fresh come from england have ever before seen great be joy on board ship especially among four boy at profusion of strange fruit be seen seated together eating pineapple banana many other thing of knew not so much a name found delicious indeed after so long voyage upon salted food then sailing on dropped anchor in bay captain drake have christened during last voyage port pheasant for have killed many of kind of bird there here admiral purposed waiting for while to refresh crew to put pinnace together accordingly anchor be put out be made snug boat crew be sent on shore to see that be safe for there be saying where spaniard might be lurking returned with great plate of lead have found fastened to tree close to water edge upon be word captain drake if be fortune to come into part make haste away for spaniard be with here last year have betrayed place taken away that left here departed hence on present th july very loving friend john garrett must have be here few day earlier captain drake said when read notice for john garrett must assuredly have joined aid must have be slight assistance in matter in be about to engage however will not do to despise caution therefore lest be attacked while on shore by spaniard will even make fort will be able to unload store put pinnace together without fear of interruption crew be now landed set to work with hatchet bill to clear plot of ground three quarter of acre be after three day work cleared tree be cast outwards piled together in such form a to make sort of wall foot high round hard work done most of crew be allowed little liberty carpenter experienced artificer being engaged in putting

rich with blossom hung on tree here there a passed along snake slipped away among undergrowth in truth boy be a ready to leave alone a reptile be to avoid for be told that be certain death to be bitten by creature most of boy admired little bird indeed be hard for to believe not to be butterfly so small be so rapid movement so brilliant color on th day from landing pinnace be finished vessel being anchored near shore crew went on board for last time preparatory to making start next day there be one tall bright faced sailor with whom boy have struck up great friendship have sailed before

together at cape de verde there tried to get slave for be part of object of voyage to buy slave on coast of africa sell to spaniard here be traffic for have little mind for though be true that black fellow be pernicious race given to murder to fighting of kind among yet be human being be methinks cruel to send beyond sea into slavery so far from home people be not for simple mariner to argue question with admiral captain have heard many worshipful merchant be engaged in traffic however that be methinks that good captain francis did likewise turn against kind of traffic in human flesh for

to sailor who asked why too did not join in sport confess have dread of horrible shark of have heard so much whose black fin see from time to time must have thought said harsh sneering voice of giles taunton that otter must have be match for shark swimmer of south isle indeed native here attack shark without fear must have thought that anyone who pride a do upon swimming must have be equally willing to encounter know do pride on swimming giles taunton ned said composedly at rate one have ever heard speak of such ability a may have in way a to native have seen other fight with shark know how matter be gone about if be to be present few time when such strife take place may be must not shirk from joining in sport knowing nothing of method pursued of manner of attack must be worse than fool be to propose to venture life in such sport many sailor who be standing round approved of what ned said aye aye lad one said one must think of making first jump across spot where might be dashed to piece let man learn to jump on level ground then when know power may go across deep chasm by time good many of men be out of water when suddenly there arose cry of shark from lookout on poop there be great rush for ship excitement on board be nearly a great a in water ned quietly dropped off jacket shoe seizing short boarding pike waited to see what must come of chanced that friend other boy be farther out than men having with ardor of youth engaged in race regardless of admonition have frequently be given to keep near ship for terror of water beast be very great men gained ship in safety shark have come up from direction in must cut off be clearly likely to arrive before boy must gain side at first seemed indeed that fate be sealed shark who in many respect resembles cat with mouse seems to prefer to trifle with victim to last allowed to get close to ship although by rapid swimming must easily have seized before nearest to a approached ship be tom tressilis who be not so good swimmer a others have swum lustily with good heart though white face showed how great effect of danger be upon have not spoken word since shark first made appearance a struck despairingly to gain ship from sailor be already casting rope eye caught that of ned who cried to cheerily keep up spirit tom will be with a huge fish swept along at distance of four yard from side of ship be already turning on back opening huge mouth to seize victim ned dived head foremost from ship onto so great be force impetus with struck creature that be fairly driven sideways from course missing by nearest shave leg of tom tressilis ned be half stunned by force with head have struck fish for shark be not so soft creature to jump against a have imagined however retained consciousness enough to grasp at fin of shark to held on for minute by time shark be recovering from effect of sudden blow ned be beginning to be able to reflect in moment plunged half pike deep into creature stomach again again repeated stroke until shark rolling over in agony striking furiously with tail shook ned from hold instantly dived beneath water came up at short distance shark be still striking water furiously sailor on board be throwing down upon shot piece of iron sort of missile of best archer be hastily bringing bow to side shark caught sight of opponent instantly rushed at ned again dived just before creature reached rising under inflicted more stab with pike then again swam off for be in slight fear that might be struck by friend on board ship of whose missile indeed be more in dread than of shark when rose at short distance from shark be again prepared for rush on part of enemy great fish have now have enough of be still striking water movement be becoming slower for be weakened by loss of blood from stab have received from below from arrow many of be now buried to goose quill in in minute two gradually turned on one side floated with white belly in air shout broke from crew of swanne also of pacha who have be attracted to side by cry when saw that battle be over that enemy have be vanquished without loss of life hurt to ned speedily seized one of rope climbed up side of ship where be may be sure received with great cheering shout of joy approval be fine lad captain john drake said name of otter have indeed be well bestowed have saved life of comrade know that old friend mr frank tressilis father will feel indebted indeed to when come to learn how gallantly risked life to preserve of son ned said that saw credit in action that be mightily glad to have have opportunity of learning to do negro thought nothing of for that shamed to think that heathen must venture life boldly against shark while english boy although good swimmer not hoped wanting in courage be yet afraid to encounter fierce brute incident acted a might be expected a fresh bond between boy a also secured for ned cordial goodwill of sailor be in future free from persecution at hand of master taunton of fellow chapter unsuccessful attack must have be said in proper place upon day after arrival of pacha swanne in pheasant bay barque named isle of wight commanded by james rause with thirty men on board

here put in to water boat a crew have be cramped from stay therein captain drake decided to give day on shore ned reuben gale be of party other two being to great discontent left behind in ship after barriques have be filled with water fire lit for cooking labor of day over ned reuben started for ramble in island be of goodly extent when have proceeded distance in wood picking fruit a went looking at butterfly bright bird be suddenly seized thrown upon ground by men who sprang out from underwood through have passed be too surprised at sudden attack to utter even cry being safely gagged bound be lifted by captor carried away into interior of island after hour passage be put down in heart of thick grove of tree looking round saw be surrounded by large number of native one of person evidently in authority spoke to in language did not understand shook head after several time attempting to make comprehend ned caught word espanolos to vehemently shook head in denial caused quite excitement among hearer one of latter then said english to ned companion nodded news evidently filled native with great joy band be taken off boy indian endeavored by gesture to express sorrow that felt for having carried off be clear that have taken for spaniard that have be watched a wandered inland captured for purpose of learning object force of expedition now however that captor understood that ship be english with great sign of pleasure started with for seashore have already darkened when arrived there crew of boat jumped hastily to foot at sight of so many person approaching ned however called to just a be about to betake to arm shouted that native be perfectly friendly well disposed captain drake now advanced entered into conversation with leader of native in spanish seemed that have met before that many indeed of native be acquainted with person be party of simeroons a be then called ie of native who have be made slave by spaniard who have now fled afterwards came to be called cameroon be mostly so spoken of in book of english buccaneer men be greatly pleased at arrival of captain drake boat for own have be destroyed feared taking to sea in such a must build after much talk captain drake arranged to put on shore so that must go on to isthmus of darien where there be more of in forest promised to prepare to assist captain drake when must come there native thirty in number be soon packed in boat be ready to cross to mainland party then going forward entered port of nombre de dios at three in morning a sailed in being yet good way from city came upon barque of ton be unprepared for attack boat got alongside crew climbed on to deck before presence be discovered dreamt of resistance be offered by spaniard against english be indeed asleep below search be made be found that ship be laden with canary wine circumstance gave great pleasure to english who looked forward to long bout of good drinking while be searching ship have paid little attention to spanish crew presently however heard sound of oar at little distance from ship what be said captain drake ned ran to stern of vessel think sir said that one two of spaniard have got off with boat saw towing to stern when boarded captain drake leant over side at once gave order to one of boat whose crew have not boarded vessel be lying alongside to pursue to strain nerve to catch boat before came near town sailor leapt to oar pulled with will for knew a well a captain how serious matter must be be town alarmed indeed that toil pain must be thrown away a be only by surprise so small handful of men must possibly expect to take large important town like nombre de dios fortunately boat overtook fugitive before be within hailing distance of town rapidly towed back to ship then took place in pinnace pushed off without further delay be not yet light steered by one who knew town well rowed up alongside battery defended without alarm being given a climbed up over wall sentry fired piece artilleryman who there having be rumor of arrival of drake fleet in water be sleeping by side of gun sprang to foot fled a english leapt down into battery there be six large gun in place many small bombard now lad captain drake said must lose time in five minute yonder artilleryman will have alarmed whole town must be there before spaniard have managed to get sleepy eye open advance in three party meet in marketplace be good that must make a much show a possible there can be more concealment therefore must endeavor to make spaniard believe that be far stronger force than in truth be be not until three party met in marketplace that real resistance on part of spaniard began although window have be opened shot fired here there alarm bell be now ringing shout scream be heard through town whole population be becoming fairly aroused a entered marketplace however heavy fire be opened with arquebus gun english have taken with firearm man carried bow arrow with shot fast hard at spaniard silenced fire at moment however happened sadly for success of enterprise that ball struck captain drake inflicted serious wound ned be standing near observed stagger be hit sir asked anxiously tush boy replied be scratch say nothing of now forward to treasury town be in hand lad only remains to to sack a much treasure a can carry remember lose discipline keep together if straggle be lost now light at once torch have brought with shout aloud to inhabitant can speak spanish that if more resistance be offered will burn whole town to ground threat mightily alarmed inhabitant firing ceased altogether for a be not regular soldier knew that object of english attack be to plunder public treasury rather than private property townsman readily deemed to interest to hold aloof rather than to bring upon city so grievous calamity a threatened by english in advance two three spaniard have fallen into hand of men being threatened with instant death if hesitated at once led way to governor house where silver brought down on mule from panama be stored party be placed at door of building captain drake with rest entered governor have fled with attendant house be richly furnished full of silk hanging of vessel of gold silver of kind of beautiful thing however attracted little attention from english although ned young comrade marveled much never have seen in england anything approaching to wealth beauty of furnishing seemed to indeed a if have entered one of house of magician enchanter of whom have read in book during childhood captain drake however passed through gorgeous room with scarce glance led by spaniard descended step into vast cellar cry of astonishment admiration burst from whole party a entered treasury here piled up twelve foot high lay mighty mass of bar of silver carefully packed heap be le than foot long foot wide bar weighed from to pound lad captain drake said here be money enough to make rich for life must leave for present make for treasury house be a full of gold of precious stone a be of silver men followed captain drake brother feeling quite astonished almost stupefied at sight of pile of silver felt moreover impossibility of carrying off so vast weight unless town be completely in hand indeed be very far from being case for whole town be now rising troop who have at first panic fled be now being brought forward a day lightened spaniard sorely ashamed that so small body of men must have made master of so great rich city be plucking up heart preparing to attack ill be then for success of adventure captain francis have suffered so heavy wound in marketplace up to time have kept bravely on none except ned being full of prospect of vast plunder have noticed pale face seen blood streamed down from marked footstep a went nature must now do more with body well nigh drained of blood suddenly fell down fainting great be cry rose from men a saw admiral thus fall hastily gathering round lifted body from ground shuddered at seeing how great pool of blood be gathered where have be standing seemed almost a if with fall of captain courage have animated men must animate again in fighting against ever so great odds have for moment deserted in spite of order of captain john that four five must carry brother to boat that rest must seize without delay treasure of gold diamond in treasury carry off a great weight a might bear none paid attention gathered round body of captain francis lifting on shoulder hurried to boat careless of promised treasure thinking only to escape bear with beloved commander from force of spaniard who a saw party fall back with great shouting fell upon shooting hotly swoon of admiral have lasted few moment a cordial be poured down throat opened eye seeing what men be minded to do protested with force against retreat word however have weight with in spite of resistance carried down to battery there placing in pinnace whole took to boat rowed on board ship wonderful to relate although many be wounded one man giles taunton armorer be killed in attack upon great city in only missed making master of one of greatest treasure upon earth by accident of commander fainting at critical moment to men being seized by unaccountable panic of crew have indeed carried off certain plunder have snatched in passing through governor house in such short search a have be able to make in private dwelling men in general have be so struck with amazement sorrow at sight of general wound that although wealth be virtually at mercy put off with without casting thought upon what be leaving behind boat now rowed without pausing to isle called isle of victual there stayed two day nursing wound supporting with poultry of there be great abundance found in island with vegetable fruit from garden there be great joy among when be found that captain drake wound although severe enough be yet not likely to imperil life that be loss of blood alone have caused to faint at news men took heart rejoiced so exceedingly that stranger must have supposed that have attained great victory rather than have come out unsuccessful from adventure promised to make man wealthy upon second day after arrival at isle of victual saw boat rowing out from direction of nombre de dios a knew that there be fleet in harbor must venture to attack english have fear of approaching boat although indeed wondered much what message must have be sent on board boat be hidalgo spanish noble who be rowed by four negro said that have come from mainland to make inquiry a to gallant men who have performed so great feat that cherished malice against wished to know whether captain drake who commanded be same who have be there before especially did inquire whether arrow used by english be poisoned for said great fear alarm reigned in town many believing that who have be struck by english shaft must certainly die upon head be soon reassured english be indeed mightily indignant at being supposed that must use such cowardly weapon a poisoned arrow then hidalgo inquired why english have so suddenly retreated from town when be in hand why have abstained from carrying off three hundred sixty ton of silver lay at governor house still greater value of gold in treasure house gold indeed being far more valuable than silver insomuch a be more portable answer to question be freely given for in day there be curious mixture of peace war of desperate violence of great courtesy between combatant whereas now enemy arriving with view merely to obtain information must be roughly treated in day be courteously entertained question a freely answered a if have be friend ally when heard of wound of captain drake expressed great sorrow after many compliment be exchanged returned to nombre de dios while next day captain drake english rowed away to isle of pine where captain rause be remaining in charge of ship be mightily glad to see return a be comrade who have remained for long absence have caused great fear anxiety a be thought that captain drake must have fallen into ambuscade that ill have come to party although there be regret at thought that chance of gaining such vast booty have be missed yet joy at safe return overpowered feeling for day two crew feasted merrily held festival captain rause then determined to continue adventure further to separate with ship men from captain drake be of opinion firmly now spaniard have discovered presence in island such measure of defense must be taken at port a to place beyond hazard of attack by so small body a carried by three ship therefore receiving full satisfaction for use of men for guarding ship sailed away on th august leaving swanne pacha to proceed upon adventure alone captain drake sent brother elli hickson to examine river chagres on return captain drake with two ship three pinnace sailed for carthagena where arrived on th day of august while on voyage thither captured two spanish ship of ton with rich cargo of striking so much a blow in resistance at evening anchored between island of cara saint bernardo three pinnace entered harbor of carthagena lying at entrance found frigate in day meant very small craft not much larger than rowing boat have one old man on board who said that rest of company have gone ashore to fight duel about quarrel have have overnight said too what be much more important to english that hour before pinnace have passed that man who be steering have shouted out that english be at hand that have better up anchor go into port said moreover that when pinnace reached carthagena gun be fired must see that shipping hauled in under shelter of castle be bad news indeed there be much hard language among sailor when heard be clear that castle of carthagena if prepared be not to be carried by thirty forty men however gallant determined might be there be too little hope that old man have spoken falsely for have heard gun shortly before arrival there with much bitterness be determined to abandon plan of attack thus carthagena a well a nombre de dios escaped from hand of english did not however go out empty handed for succeeded in capturing by boarding four pinnace laden with cargo a turned head to go out to sea great ship of seville came sailing in laid alongside captured easily having just arrived from spain having thought of meeting foe just a reached port of destination lightened heart of crew with prize in tow sailed out in good spirit ship contained large store of good from spain with sherry merchandise of kind went back to isle of pine usual rendezvous on adding up good that have taken from various prize found that even now have made no bad thing of voyage be now much reduced in fighting strength by illness captain drake determined in mind that crew be no longer strong enough for manning of two ship that must be better to take to one alone knew however that even authority must not suffice to persuade sailor to abandon one of vessel for sailor have great love for ship therefore determined to do by sudden stroke known only to therefore called to thomas moore carpenter of swanne taking aside told to make auger hole in bottom of ship moore who be good sailor made great resistance to order upon admiral assuring that be necessary for success of enterprise that one of ship must be destroyed very reluctantly undertook task previous to captain drake have ordered booty considerable portion of store of ship to be hauled on shore so that might lose nothing of value to next morning ned friend be sitting on bulwark of vessel watching fish playing about in depth of clear blue water seem to be lower in water than usual ned said doe not seem to that be not so high above sea a be wont to be others agreed that vessel have that appearance a seemed clearly impossible that must be so especially when be lighter than usual thought that must be mistaken subject be put aside hour later captain drake rowing alongside called to brother who came to side be going to fish said be disposed to come also captain john expressed willingness to do so will wait for brother said captain john be turning to go into cabin to get cap cloak when captain francis cried out be not ship very low in water morning same a usual suppose captain john said laughing looking over side said methinks doe lie deep in water calling carpenter bade sound well latter after doing so cried out loudly that there be four foot of water in ship great astonishment seized upon officer crew at unexpected news hand be at once set to work pump be rigged with bucket sort of gear strove manfully hard to get rid of water soon however became plain that entered faster than must pump forth that vessel must have sprung bad leak when be clear that swanne must not be saved boat of pacha be brought alongside good remained in be removed together with arm ammunition then crew taking to boat lay by until in few minute swanne sank among tear of many of crew who have made three voyage in loved well be not for long time afterwards known that loss of ship be effect of order of admiral who indeed acted with usual wisdom in keeping matter secret for assuredly although men must have obeyed order must have lost much favor popularity among have truth be at time known next day news be spread among men that be determined to fill pacha with store be on shore leaving party there with to embark crew in pinnace for service in river chagres along coast until at rate must capture ship to replace swanne next day rowed on into gulf of darien there ship be laid up in good place remained quiet for fifteen day amusing refreshing by mean hoped to throw spaniard off guard to cause report to be spread that have left island simeroons living near have be warned by who have be landed from isle of pine of coming received with good cheer promised aid must be required then pinnace be sent out to catch passing ship might be cruising along coast happened one day two of have set off in pursuit of great ship saw passing in distance wind be light have little doubt that must overhaul ned who be one of who remained behind be much angered at missing so good enterprise four hour afterwards ship be seen to pas along remaining pinnace be at once manned captain john drake taking command with fourteen men set out to take spanish galleon gallant a be exploit have be performed in modern time by british tar in attack upon slaver yet in none of case doe disparity of force at approach that often existed between english boat spanish galleon indeed only possible reason can be given for success of english be fear that enemy entertained for spanish captain crew have come to look upon a utterly invincible seemed when attacked by english buccaneer altogether paralyzed a boat rowed up towards great ship size became gradually more apparent deck must be seen crowded with men even ned who be not greatly given to reflection must not feel passing doubt a to possibility of one small boat with fourteen men attacking floating castle like presently boom of cannon from forecastle of vessel be heard ball whizzed over head then shot after shot be fired soon rattle of small arm broke out water round be cut up by bullet ball rough seaman cared little for demonstration with cheer bent back to oar although be wounded rowed up to side of ship without hesitation doubt then from above shower of missile be hurled upon dart stone hot water even boiling tar must have gone hard with english have not spanish carelessly left porthole open near water level through english clambered eager to get at foe many of raging with pain caused by boiling material a rushed on to deck spaniard be ranged in two rank on side of hatchway fell upon at once so great be fury of english that facing way with roar like beast springing on prey fell with axe sword upon spaniard be wild rage with english buccaneer fought be secret of success spaniard be people given to ceremony even in matter of battle be somewhat formal pedantic combat then between english be one presented familiar condition to mind rough sailor hardened by exposure skilled in use of arm be doubt formidable enough individually alone must not have intimidated spaniard have gone great distance towards equalizing tremendous odds between be fury with fought be secret of success be a when cat furious with passion fly at dog many time larger heavier than latter may be a brave in many matter a cat ready to face creature much larger even than under ordinary circumstance be fury of cat appalls turn into very coward thus when band of english fell upon spaniard in galleon who be six time a numerous a naked to waist with hair streaming back with face wild with pain brandishing heavy ax with shout rushed upon foe drawn up in regular order latter after moment two of resistance began rapidly to fall back officer in vain shouted to to stand firm in vain taunted with falling back before handful of men in vain even turned sword against own soldier be useless in front unable indeed to retreat be cut down by heavy ax behind recoiled after few minute fighting began to leap down hatchway although fight continued for short time isolated group here there making resistance battle be virtually won in five minute after english appeared on deck captain two principal officer be killed fighting bravely have effort be in way backed by of men must have made short work of assailant captain drake voice be heard high above din a soon a resistance ceased ordered prisoner to be brought upon deck disarmed at once forced into own boat obliged to row away from vessel for knew that be men once to begin to plunder to fall upon liquor spaniard even if unarmed must be able to rise overpower sooner be last spaniard out of ship than men scattered to look for plunder ned be standing on poop watching boat rowing away thinking to that so crowded be if breeze be to spring up there must not be much chance of reaching nombre de dios suddenly heard below scream followed by splash looking over saw head of woman appear above water without hesitation dived at once from side for moment girl for be little more struggled with a if must have sunk ned grasping firmly in few stroke swam with alongside ship to boat two three sailor running down assisted to pull into then dripping wet be taken to deck where captain in kind tone assured that must receive most courteous treatment that need be under fear whatever be daughter of wealthy spaniard at nombre de dios be now coming out from spain to join frightened by noise of fighting by terrible reputation of english buccaneer have when sailor rushed into cabin with loud shout be so alarmed that have jumped from stern window into sea captain drake assured courteously rough a men might be must none of lay finger upon woman then hoisted flag fired gun a signal to spanish boat be yet within quarter of mile to return for moment rowed on ball sent skimming across bow be hint must not disregard for full a be of men must not have hoped to avoid english pinnace must have put off after when boat came alongside of on board be ordered to ascend side of ship plenty of accommodation having be made young spanish lady maid who have remained in cabin descended into largest boat handed down by captain drake with courtesy equal to spanish hidalgo must have shown before went young lady turned to ned who be standing near expressed to deep thanks for manner in have leapt over for ned must understand only few word for although many of sailor spoke spanish sometimes used among have not yet made great progress with although have tried to pick up a many word phrase a must captain however translated word to said to in reply that there be nothing for to feel under obligation to for for dog must have jumped out done business just a well young lady however undid bracelet of gold on arm insisted upon fastening round ned wrist action caused blush of confusion to crimson face in few minute spanish boat be again off captain added to in young lady be placed food bottle of liqueur other matter might render voyage easy pleasant promised that spaniard who have be transferred again to ship must be landed at earliest opportunity vessel be now searched regularly be found to contain much treasure in good a be on way from europe have of course none of gold silver be main object of search however consoled with thought that ship have be chased by comrade earlier in day be homewards bound hoped therefore that rich cargo must there be secured be not mistaken for when ship sailed up to rendezvous found alongside cheer of comrade told that prize have be handsome one found that have secured nearly million in gold silver transferring cargo of one ship into other set first on fire sailed back to spot where camp be formed on isthmus several other ship fell into hand in way after hindered more vessel on way from europe have ample store indeed far more than enough to supply with luxury for on board pacha richest wine most delicate conserve richest garment of kind be already in such abundance a to become common to down to common sailor feasted on best drank wine that emperor might have approved captain drake in way gave men when on shore much license insisting however that must abstain from drunkenness for a said not only must be at mercy of small body of enemy might find drunkenness breed quarrel dispute a between comrade must be fatal indeed thus although enough of good liquor be given to man to make merry none be allowed to drink beyond point reason why ship coming from europe be allowed to pas unmolested be that drake wished not that day fresh tale of capture must be brought to panama by crew set free in boat for be certain that tale so told must at last stir up such fear indignation at ravage committed by so small body that governor of spanish town must combine force must march against with veritable army while only ship starting from darien be overhauled lightened of content tale be not brought back to darien for crew be allowed to sail on with ship to europe a drake have already more vessel than knew what to do with a for prisoner be to quite useless captain john did indeed at one time propose to that must take out of ship principal men so a to hold a hostage in case of misfortune happening to english admiral said to that so great be enmity fear of did fall into hand of spaniard must not exchange let go even if a many king be set free in return in five vessel be seized plundered while lying at darien be not however going well for while lay there terrible sickness broke out among whether be from change of life from noxious thing ate merely from heat none must say very shortly illness made great ravage among first died charles clift one of quartermaster then one day when pinnace in ned always sailed returned be met with sad news captain john drake be also dead have fallen however not by fever by ball of spaniard have gone out with one of pinnace have engaged great spanish ship latter have shot more straight faster than usual captain richard one of men have be slain in unsuccessful attempt to capture ship sad end be not result of rashness on part for indeed have told men that vessel carried many gun that be too rash enterprise sailor however have by time become so accustomed to victory a to despise don altogether insisted upon going forward be with bitter lamentation regret that returned bringing body of admiral brother be now at end of year in week no le than six of company died among whom be joseph drake of admiral brother loss saddened crew greatly even treasure have amassed now seemed to small of little account even who did not take fever be much cast down captain

leadership of boy be prepared to face even terrible dog threw into fray with ferocity of savage nature springing at throat of two of negro brought to ground one of dog be instantly disposed of by gerald who placing pistol to ear blew out brain ned fell upon other with sword negro joining speedily beat down slew diversion however have enabled spaniard to get upon horse now galloped off at full speed among tree chapter attack in force negro be delighted at success of conflict a be indian who soon joined ten of spaniard have escaped rest having fallen in gorge killed by rock in subsequent fight ned gerald who be now looked upon a leader of party told negro to collect arm of fallen men to give hasty burial to body boy knew too well savage nature of war raged between black white to ask whether of spaniard be only wounded knew that instant death have awaited who fell into hand of late slave now ned said friend must not suppose that fighting be over spaniard will take news back to town be likely enough that will have large force upon in course of few day suspect that will come before time indeed may be far longer for know that will require very large force to search wood now blood be up will be trifle to overcome in stronghold if be to succeed at last labor discipline courage will be required negro now besought boy formally to take command promised to obey order implicitly well ned said if promise will lead friend be older than will be captain will be first lieutenant gerald said must not be ned be oldest be true by few month be far more active quick than have be leader ever since left ship certainly will not take command from well will be joint general ned said laughing think that order will clash then explained to negro native course thought that ought to pursue first point at enemy must be harassed must be provided with missile in second place sign of footstep path leading to accustomed dwelling place must be obliterated thirdly must fight a little a possible being object to fight when pursued interfered with by small party of spaniard to avoid conflict with large body object said be to live free unmolested here if spanish find when come in large number can not overtake that when come in small one be defeated with loss will take to leaving alone agreed to policy be arranged that woman child most feeble of native must retire to almost inaccessible hiding place far in mountain that more active spirit with negro divided into five six band acting to extent independently of other yet in accordance with general plan must remain to oppose passage of enemy first success over spaniard caused wild exultation among negro native ned gerald be viewed a hero lad took advantage of popularity to impress upon negro necessity of organizing undergoing certain drill discipline without a told although occasionally might succeed in driving back spaniard yet in long run must be defeated be only by fighting with regularity like trained soldier that must make respected by spaniard latter instead of viewing a wild beast to be hunted must regard with respect negro fresh from success gained by irregular mean be at first loath to undertake trouble pain boy desired latter pointed out that be not always that enemy be to be caught napping that after check a have be put upon spaniard must be sure to come in greater number to be far more cautious how trusted into place where might be caught in trap weapon thrown away left upon ground by spaniard be divided among negro native be now formed into company native negro being mixed in company so that latter might animate former by example four company of forty men be formed for next fortnight incessant drill went on by time forest fugitive began to have fair notion of rudimentary element of drill when boy be not engaged upon in company with one of native chief examined mountain at last fixed upon place must serve a last stronghold must be driven to bay by enemy be three week before there be sign of spaniard at end of time great smoke rising from signal hill proclaimed that large body of enemy be approaching forest be expected for two day before three negro runaway have taken shelter with negro have be armed with long pike of tough wood sharpened in fire capable of inflicting fully a deadly wound a carried by spaniard carried club leader being armed with sword taken from spaniard while there be also eight arquebus have be gained from same source native bore bow arrow with be able to shoot with great accuracy negro be not skilled with weapon be more useful from greater strength for hurling down rock missile upon spaniard when below consultation have be previously held a to course to be taken in case of approach of enemy be determined a far a possible to avoid fighting to allow spaniard to tramp from place to place then to harass by falling upon in night disturbing sleep cutting down sentry harassing until be forced by pure exhaustion to leave forest tactic be admirably adapted to nature of contest only thing threatened to render nugatory be presence of fierce dog of spaniard preparation have already be made for checking bloodhound in pursuit of fugitive slave in narrow place in one of valley at entrance of forest somewhat heavy gallery have be erected be made of wood heaped with great stone be so arranged that animal running through must push aside stick acted a trigger must release lever heavy log above must fall crushing to death anything beneath lookout be always placed to intercept fugitive slave who might enter forest to guide through trap be of course not set until after have passed have be done in case of two negro who have arrived previous day boy felt that pursuit of by bloodhound must at once be cut short spaniard left to own device anticipation proved correct scout reported that must hear in distance baying of dog undoubtedly enemy be proceeding on track of slave four company be told off to position considerably apart from other while ned gerald with cacique chief of indian one negro four five fleet footed young men remained to watch success of trap be that have hoped spaniard be seen coming up glade troop two hundred strong leader be on horseback fifteen in number after marched pikemen in steady array having men moving at distance on flank to prevent surprise said ned be regular military enterprise last be mere pursuing party gathered at random will not be so easy to deal with cautious men like three hound ran ahead of leader with nose on ground giving now then deep bay peculiar to kind reached trap rushed into gallery be twelve foot in length of sufficient height to enable man on foot to march through leader on seeing trap drew in horse in doubt what structure must mean shouted to hound to stop latter having scent strong in nostril ran on without pausing a last hound disappeared in gallery crash be heard whole erection collapsed crushing hound beneath cry of consternation surprise burst from spaniard artifice be new one showed that fugitive be assisted by men with intellect far in advance of own pursuit be summarily checked for guide of spaniard be now gone enemy paused consultation took place among leader be apparently determined to pursue way alone taking precaution in hope that native must attack a have done previous expedition when hoped to inflict decisive blow upon that must be able to find run away negro in forest have small hope thought possible that must again take initiative first under guidance of one who have evidently be in last expedition took way to valley where fight have taken place here be still there be sign of foe found in gorge great cairn of stone with wooden cross placed over word in spanish cut upon here lie body of ten spaniard who sought to attack harmless men in wood let fate be lesson to who may follow example inscription caused great surprise among spaniard who gathered round mound conversed earnestly upon looking round at deep silent wood might for ought knew contain foe who have proved formidable be evident that soldier brave a be yet felt misgiving a to task upon have entered knew that two englishman portion of body under drake have rendered so feared be leader of men so great be respect in english be at time held that alone vastly added to difficulty danger spaniard saw awaiting however after few minute consultation party moved forward be now formed in two body about equally strong one going quarter of mile ahead other following have men divided force for negro asked ned seems to answered that hope will fall upon first body thinking that there be more behind that others coming up in midst of fight will take by surprise however will let march send word to company lie somewhat in line have taken of approach let at once retire tell to make circuit in hill to leave behind sufficient trace for spaniard to follow will encourage to keep on by will be thoroughly tired out whenever get in valley other place where advantage may be taken of two of company will accompany at good distance on flank pour in volley of arrow roll stone down upon will take command of one of company gerald of other do said to negro follow with last keep out of reach occasionally after have passed fire arrow among rear guard do cacique make way to leading column see that choose most difficult gorge give a far a possible appearance of hurry to flight so a to encourage spaniard to follow tactic be faithfully carried out day spaniard followed a believed close upon footstep of flying foe from time to time from strong advantage spot arrow be rained upon great rock thundered down wild yell rang through forest before however must ascend slope get hand to hand with enemy have retreated be silent a grave in wood perplexed harassed somewhat awe struck by new inexplicable tactic having lost many men by arrow stone of enemy two troop gathered at nightfall in open glade here bivouac be formed branch of tree cut down provision have brought with produced rivulet ran through glade weary troop be soon lying on grass strong line of sentry having be placed round already appearance of troop be greatly changed from of body have entered wood then be eager for fray confident in extreme of power to crush with ease unarmed negro native who have hitherto except on last occasion fled like hunted deer at approach now however feeling be checked have learned that enemy be well commanded prepared so far while have lost several men not native have be so much a seen by at air became alive with mysterious noise cry a of animal occasionally indian whoop shout from one voice to be heard around spaniard stood to arm gazed anxiously into darkness soon shout of sentry told that flight of arrow be being discharged at by invisible foe volley after volley be fired from musketoons arquebus into wood be answered by burst of taunting laughter mocking yell while rain of arrow continued spanish troop whose position figure must be seen by blaze of lighted fire while dense darkness reigned within forest began to suffer severely from arrow of unseen foe body fifty strong advanced into dark forest to search out enemy searched in vain indian better accustomed to darkness knowing forest well easily retreated a advanced spaniard dared not venture far from fire for feared being lost in forest officer commanding old experienced soldier soon ceased useless sortie calling men into center of glade ordered to stand in readiness to repel assault extinguished fire allowed troop at once to lie down to endeavor to snatch sleep however be impossible for although indian did not venture upon attack chorus of shout yell be so terrible continuous flight of arrow at time fell so fast that not one of troop ventured to close eye from time to time volley be fired into darkness once twice loud cry told that at least of ball have taken effect opponent sheltered behind trunk of tree suffered comparatively slightly while many of spaniard be struck by missile morning dawned upon worn out dispirited band with daylight hope revived vigorous sortie be made into wood though discovered in few place mark of blood where of enemy have fallen sign of party being carried away wood be now a deserted a have appeared to be on previous evening when first halted there be consultation among leader be determined to abandon pursuit of invisible foe a be agreed that nothing short of great effort by whole available force of island must be sufficient to cope with foe whose tactic be so bewildering formidable upon march out from wood troop be pursued with same persistence with have be dogged on preceding day when at length emerged captain counted number of men be found that there be le than thirty wounded that twenty have be left behind dead dweller of wood be overjoyed with success felt that new existence have opened before hitherto have be fugitive only thought of resistance to spaniard have ever entered mind felt now that so long a remained in wood maintained drill discipline persisted in tactic have adopted must defy spaniard unless indeed latter came in overwhelming strength time elapsed before fresh effort be made by spaniard affair caused intense excitement in city be difficult to say whether alarm rage most predominated be felt that great effort must be made to crush men of forest for unless be done vast number of negro slave must escape join movement must become more formidable day upon part of in forest great consultation took place of negro be for sending message to slave to rise join ned gerald strongly opposed course there be a pointed out mean in forest for supporting larger body of men than gathered there tree clad hill constituted stronghold be thirty mile in diameter supply of fruit of root of bird be sufficient for want must be very different be number largely increased then must be forced to make raid upon cultivated ground beyond here however strong must be match for spaniard whose superior arm discipline must be certain to give indian strongly supported reasoning of boy negro when fully understood difficulty must arise finally acquiesced in argument scheme be broached for making sally from forest at night falling upon plantation of spaniard offered greater chance of success boy foresaw that sort of atrocity must be sure to take place that quarter must be given to spaniard of age sex therefore combated vigorously proposal also pointed out that so long a remained quiet in forest be not joined by large number of fugitive negro spaniard might be content to let remain unmolested upon contrary be to adopt offensive tactic not only must spaniard in island take up arm against if necessary must send for help to neighboring island must assemble force sufficient thoroughly to search wood to annihilate only case in boy considered that attack upon spaniard must be lawful must be in event of fresh expedition being organized in case be of opinion that must be useful to destroy one two large mansion plantation a near a possible to town sending at same time message to spaniard that if persisted in disturbing in forest similar fate must befall spanish plantation situated beyond town be not long before tactic be called into play one of negro have a be custom gone down to town to purchase such article a be indispensable upon occasion a usual went down to hut of old woman who acted a intermediary remained concealed there during day while went into town to buy cotton for dress other thing must only do in small quantity at time using various shop for purpose returning time with parcel to hut suspicion of spaniard have however be aroused order have be given to watch closely consequence be that after purchasing few article be followed band of soldier surrounded hut after have entered fugitive be there found concealed old woman be at once fastened in hut be then set alight be burned to death upon spot when news reached mountain ned at once determined upon reprisal negro native be alike ready to follow next night whole party hundred fifty strong marched down from forest object of attack be handsome palace belonging to military governor of island situated at short distance from town passing through cultivated country noiselessly without detection reached mansion surrounded there be here guard of thirty soldier sentry be placed at entrance at signal given by blowing of conch shell attack commenced on side sentry be at once shot down negro ally speedily penetrated into building spanish guard fought with great bravery be overpowered by infuriated negro yell shriek shout of kind resounded through palace before starting on adventure ned gerald have exacted solemn oath from of men who be to take part in that on account must lift hand against defenseless person also that spare everybody who surrendered negro be greatly loath to take promise have ned urged to do so purely for sake of humanity oath must unquestionably have be refused for in day of savage warfare there be little mercy shown on side be only on ground of expediency extreme necessity of not irritating spaniard beyond certain point that succeeded in obtaining promise in principal room of palace found governor sword be in hand be prepared to defend life to last boy however rushed forward cried to to throw sword down a only plan by life must be saved brave officer refused answering by vigorous thrust in moment two lad have sprung upon one from side wrested sword from hand negro with yell of triumph be rushing upon with drawn sword boy sternly motioned back keeping well in front of prisoner have sworn said first man who break oath will shoot through head then turning to governor said sir see what men whom have so long hunted a wild beast can do take warning from let in town know determination to have arrived if be let alone will let others alone promise that serious depredation of kind will be performed by of party in forest if be molested if of band who may fall into hand be ill treated swear that for drop of blood slain will ravage plantation destroy house on occasion a see negro have abstained from shedding blood influence over may not avail in future now that see that too can attack may think fit to leave alone in case of serious interference with will lay waste land up to house of city destroy plantation hacienda then hurried governor to back entrance gave sword again having seen in safety fairly beyond reach of of party who might be wandering about dismissed returning to palace have to exert to utmost to prevail on negro to spare who be there indeed one man who refused to obey ned order to lower club shot down at once vigorous act excited for moment yell of indignation among rest firm bearing of two young englishman knowledge that be acting a have given leave to act must of party break oath subdued into silence palace be now stripped of portable useful article ned must not permit anything to be carried away of merely ornamental valuable character only such a kitchen utensil crockery stove arm hanging article of description must be useful to in wild life in forest quantity of arm taken be considerable a in addition to belonging to guard there be considerable number piled in armory in readiness for occasion when might be required when must be useful to be removed light be applied to hanging wooden lattice work before retired saw flame take sufficient possession of building to ensure destruction many of negro have at first laden with wine ned peremptorily refused to allow to carry away knew that be of most supreme necessity good fellowship amity must run between member of band be wine to be introduced quarrel might arise must in end prove fatal to allowed however sufficient to be taken away to furnish reasonable share for man at feast be only natural must wish to hold in commemoration of victory chapter forest fastness be with feeling of triumph indeed that negro after gaining own fastness looked back at sky lighted by distant conflagration have now for first time inflicted lesson upon oppressor a must make deep mark felt to be really free knew that in turn have struck terror into heart of spaniard retiring to depth of forest great fire be made sheep fowl other article of provision have be brought back be killed prepared huge bonfire be lit party secure that for twenty four hour at least spaniard must attempt retributive measure sat down to enjoy banquet have driven with few small bullock also score of sheep however be not destined for spit be to be placed in heart of country so that unless disturbed by spaniard might prove source of future sustenance to there be wild feasting night with dance song of triumph in negro native dialect ned gerald be lauded praised a author of change have taken place in condition of fugitive even stern severity of ned act be thoroughly approved be agreed again that anyone refusing to obey order of white chief must forfeit life blow negro have struck caused intense consternation throughout younger more warlike spirit be in favor of organizing instant crusade for sending to other island for more troop for surrounding forest country for putting last of negro to sword more peaceful counsel however prevailed for be felt that whole open country be a ned have told governor at mercy that damage must be inflicted must be enormous satisfaction of putting fugitive to death even if be finally conquered must be poor recompense for blow might be given to prosperity wealth of island sort of scheme be mooted by runaway must be beguiled into laying down arm practicable plan must be hit upon in meantime in mountain band improved in drill discipline have now gained confidence in gave up heartily to work portion of land too be turned up yam other fruit on larger scale than have hitherto be attempted be planted good supply of goat be obtained hut be erected lad determined that at least a long a spaniard allowed life must be made a comfortable a possible fugitive slave from time to time joined party ned strongly discouraged increase at present from cause be sure be spaniard to find runaway be sheltered there that general desertion of slave might take place must be obliged in self defense to root out formidable organization in midst therefore emissary be sent out among negro stating that none must be received in mountain save who have previously asked permission being only accorded in case where such extreme brutality cruelty have be exercised by master a must wholly justify flight of slave for month sort of truce be maintained between spaniard little army in wood black observed promise ned have made with great fidelity planter found that depredation took place that desertion among slave be more numerous than before have depended solely upon further measure must have be taken case however be different among military party in island to failure of expedition into forest burning of governor house be matter seriously affected pride defeat by english buccaneer be accustomed to regarding english at sea a specie of demon against whom human bravery availed little be slightly touched by that must be defied by set of runaway slave of native whom have formerly regarded with contempt be blow to pride quietly without ostentation troop be drafted into island from neighboring post until formidable force have be gathered there forester have now plenty of mean of communication with negro who regarded a savior to whom must look for rescue shelter in case of master cruelty be always ready to send messenger up into forest with news of occurrence took place under observation grown up slave of course must not leave plantation there be number of fleet footed lad who after must be dispatched from hut into mountain return before daylight while even must remain until next night must attract attention by absence thus then ned gerald learned that formidable body of spaniard be being collected quietly in town effort be made to meet coming storm various gorge be blocked with high barricade difficult part of mountain be with great labor scarped so a to render advance of armed force difficult in extreme great pile of stone be collected to roll down into ravine provision of yam sweet potato other food be stored up last stronghold have after great debate be fixed upon at point in heart of one of hill be singularly well adapted for defense hill be extremely precipitous on side on one side fell sheer down goat track ran along face of precipice to point where hill fell back forming sort of semicircular arena on very face of precipice plateau be two acre in extent here quantity of forage be heaped up in readiness for food of such animal a might be driven in there track be with great labor widened platform of wood being placed at narrow point step be cut in hill behind plateau to enable must stronghold be stormed to escape at last moment up to hilltop above in most place cliff behind plateau rose so steeply a to almost overhang foot in be many gap crevice in considerable number of people must take shelter so a to avoid stone other missile hurled down from above at one point in particular precipice overhung under strong erection of trunk of tree be made be for animal to be placed in heavy roof be amply sufficient to keep out bullet shot while from position mass of rock must be dropped upon be not thought probable that spaniard must harass much from above for ascent to summit be everywhere extremely difficult hillside be perfectly bare sloped so sharply upward from edge of precipitous cliff that must be difficult dangerous task to descend so a to fire down into arena although precaution have be taken be felt that there be little fear of attack from above at last be in readiness a far a effort of in forest must avail message be then sent in to governor to effect that men of forest desired to know for what purpose so many soldier be being assembled in island that on given day unless of be embarked sent off must consider that war be being prepared against that agreement that outlying settlement must be left intact be therefore invalid a boy have anticipated spaniard answered missive by instant movement forward four hundred men be reported a moving out towards hill boy be prepared for simultaneously with movement whole band divided into party of six of have fixed destination instruction being alike solemnly pledged to take life in cold blood to abstain from unnecessary cruelty started quickly from forest night spanish force halted near edge of forest at midnight general consternation seized camp when from fifty different point flame be seen suddenly to rise on plain furious at misfortune general in command put cavalry in motion scoured country only to find however that whole of hacienda of spanish proprietor be in flame fire have be applied to standing crop everywhere heard same tale that who have resisted have be killed that harm have be inflicted upon defenseless person be so new feature in trouble with negro that spaniard must not be surprised filled with admiration at conduct so different to to be accustomed sight of tremendous destruction of property however roused to fury be still further heightened when towards morning great burst of flame in city proclaimed that negro have fallen upon town while greater portion of defender be withdrawn be indeed masterly stroke on part of boy knew that even deducting who have set forth there must still be amply sufficient force in city to defeat crush band thought that by quick stroke might succeed in inflicting heavy blow upon of band therefore have instruction after doing allotted share of incendiarism to make for town to meet at certain point outside then quietly noiselessly have entered one party fell upon armory attacked with fury governor house guard there be a have happened with residence in country cut down fire be applied in dozen place before astonished troop inhabitant must rally from different part of town negro be again in country having fulfilled object carried off with large additional stock of arm before cavalry from front must arrive be again far in country making long detour gained fastness having struck terrible blow with cost to of only eight ten life be singular sight a looked out in morning from hilltop great mass of smoke extended over whole country for although most of dwelling be by time leveled to ground for built of lightest construction offered little resistance to flame from field of maize cane cloud of smoke be still rising a conflagration spread at one stroke whole agricultural wealth of island be destroyed boy regretted that must necessarily be case felt that be now war to knife between spaniard that defeat must be beneficial indeed be case for commander drew back troop to town in order to make fresh arrangement before venturing upon attack on foe who showed possessed of such desperate determination six week elapsed indeed before forward movement be again commenced in time considerable acquisition of force be obtained strong a band felt must not be alarmed at thought of tremendous storm gathering to burst over head woman have long since be sent away to small native village existing on other side of island living at peace with neighbor thither ned also dispatched several of party whom believed to be either wanting in courage whose constancy somewhat doubted traitor now must be destruction of party be certain that negro deserting to enemy offering to act a guide to various stronghold of defender must receive immense reward thus be imperative that man of whose fidelity constancy least doubt be entertained must be carefully sent out of way of temptation band be indeed pledged by most solemn oath death by torture be penalty awarded for act of treachery greater portion of force be now provided with european arm negro have musketoons arquebus native still retained bow while have pike spear be undefended by protective amour in respect spaniard have great advantage in fight a boy pointed out advantage be more than counterbalanced by extra facility of movement on part of native who must scale rock climb hill absolutely inaccessible to heavily armed weighty opponent scout who have be stationed on lookout at edge of forest brought word that spaniard nigh strong have divided in six body be marching so a to enter forest from six different nearly equidistant point band be accompanied by bloodhound large number of other fierce dog of wolfhound breed spaniard have imported for purpose of attacking negro in hiding place of animal negro have greatest dread even bravest who be ready to match against armed spaniard yet trembled at thought of encounter with ferocious animal be clear that repetition of tactic formerly pursued must be possible for if attempt at night attack be made dog must rush out attack not only prove formidable enemy guide spaniard to place where be stationed ned gerald must fain have persuaded native dog after however formidable might appear be easily mastered by well armed men that dog rushing to attack must be pierced with spear arrow to say nothing of being shot by arquebus before must seize of negro however have known so many case in fugitive have be horribly torn indeed frequently killed by ferocious animal that dread of be too great for to listen to boy explanation latter seeing that must be useless to attempt to overcome fear on ground abstained from attempt have be agreed that in event of spaniard advancing from different quarter one column only must be selected for main attack while others must be harassed by small party who must cast down rock upon while passing through gorge so inflict a much damage a possible attempt must be made to strike serious blow upon column selected for attack be naturally that whose path led through point have be most strongly prepared fortified band mustered about three hundred be clearly too strong to be attacked in open fight by forest band gerald ned have already talked matter over in light decided that purely defensive fight must be maintained place where preparation have be made being held to last rapid retreat beaten to next barricade spaniard advanced in heavy column at distance of hundred yard on side marched body of fifty in compact mass thereby sheltering main body from sudden attack first point at lad have determined to make stand be mouth of gorge here steep rock rose perpendicularly from ground running almost like wall along portion of forest in midst of be cleft through little stream ran be here that boy have made preparation point must not be turned without long difficult march along face of cliff on summit of sixty men divided into two party one on side of fissure be stationed spaniard advanced until nearly reached mouth of ravine must be remembered that although forest be very thick vegetation luxuriant yet there be path here there made by constant passing to fro of occupant of wood main direction acted a guide to spaniard hound by sniffing eagerness acted a guide to advancing force paused when saw opening before entrance to rocky gorge while halted increased eagerness of dog told that be now approaching point where foe be concealed prospect of attack on so strong position be formidable even to such body small party of thirty men be told off to advance reconnoiter position be allowed to enter gorge to follow for distance of hundred yard to point where side be approached to nearest point then from parapet of rock piled across ravine came volley of musketry simultaneously from height of side great stone came crashing down such of party a did not fall at first discharge fired volley at invisible assailant then hurried back to main body be now clear that fighting that of serious character be to be undertaken spanish commander rapidly reconnoitered position saw that here at least flanking movement be possible therefore ordered men to advance for direct attack being more afraid of stone from above than of defender in ravine spaniard prepared to advance in skirmishing order in way must be able to creep up to barricade of rock with least loss to from fire of defender while stone from above must prove far le dangerous than must be case upon solid column with great determination spanish troop advanced to attack a neared mouth of gorge flight of arrow from above be poured down upon be answered by own musketeer bowman although figure occasionally exposed above offered poor mark in comparison to afforded by column below men on ridge be entirely native boy having selected negro on whose courage at close quarter must more thoroughly rely for defense of ravine firearm in day must scarcely be termed arm of precision bell mouth arquebus must carry large heavy charge there be nothing like accuracy in fire although steady fire be kept up from barricade many spaniard fell yet larger number succeeded in making way through zone of fire by taking advantage of rock bush gathered near foot of barricade stone came crashing from above did serious damage among real effect of be more moral than physical sound of great mass of stone plunging down hillside setting in motion number of small rock a came tearing down bush small tree be exceedingly terrifying at first a block after block dashed down doing comparatively little harm spaniard became accustomed to keeping under shelter of mass of rock to last moment prepared energy for attack spanish commander found that greater portion of troop be within striking distance gave command to gathered near barricade to spring forward to attack gorge at point be fifteen yard wide barricade across be thirty foot in height be formed of block of stone of various size intermingled with be sharp stake with point projecting line of bush arm of tree piled outwards whole be covered loosely with sharp prickly creeper cut from tree heaped there more difficult place to climb even without being defended from above must be difficult to find covering of thorny creeper hid rock below at step soldier put foot into deep hole between mass of rock fell forward lacerating horribly with thorn coming face downwards on one of sharp pointed stake if without resistance from above feat of climbing carefully prepared barricade be difficult be terrible when from ridge above storm of bullet swept down be only for moment that negro exposed in act of firing behind barricade be a level smooth a be difficult upon outer side great step three foot wide have be prepared of wood so that defender must easily mount standing in line relieve other a fired stone of top series have be carefully chosen of form so a to leave between crevice through defender must fire while scarcely exposing to enemy spaniard behind endeavored to cover advance of comrade by keeping up heavy fire at summit of barricade several of negro be shot through head in act of firing loss however be small in comparison to of assailant who strove in vain to climb up thorny ascent position being more terrible inasmuch a fire from party on rock above never ceased stone kept up sort of bombardment on in ravine even fierce dog must with difficulty climb thorn covered barrier who reached top be instantly shot stabbed at last after suffering very considerable loss spanish commander drew off soldier wild yell of triumph rose from negro combat however have a boy be aware scarcely begun now waited to see what next effort of spaniard must be be hour before latter again advanced to attack time troop be carrying large bundle of dried grass rush although again suffering heavily in attack piled at foot of barricade in minute flash of fire ran up side smoke flame for time separated defender from foe fire ceased on side although above never relaxed effort to harass assailant a spaniard have calculated flame of great heap of straw communicated with creeper burnt up in fiery tongue when flame abated rock lay open uncovered spaniard now with renewed hope advanced again to attack time be able although with heavy loss to make way up barricade when arrived within three four foot of top ned gave word line of thirty powerful negro armed with long pike suddenly arose with yell threw over edge dashed down upon spaniard latter struggling to ascend with unsteady footing on loose uneven rock be unable for instant to defend against assault negro barefooted have difficulty on surface proved so fatal to spaniard like crest of wave swept opponent headlong down face of barricade heavily armed spaniard fell over other in front hurling behind backwards in wild confusion first line of negro being succeeded by armed with ax who completed work first line have begun slaughter for minute be terrible for thirty pace negro pursued advantage then at loud shout from ned turned with celerity equal to of advance whole be back over barricade before spaniard in rear must awaken from surprise scarcely shot be fired a dark figure bounded back into shelter time spanish officer drew back men sullenly felt that have done must be expected of upwards of sixty men have fallen must be vain to ask to make assault again knew too that by waiting other column must be gradually approaching on morrow method of getting in enemy rear must probably be discovered in meantime sent off fifty men on flank to discover how far rocky wall extended while trumpeter under strong guard be sent up to hilltop in rear sounded call lustily musketoons heavily charged so a to make a loud report a possible be also fired to attract attention of other column boy be perfectly aware that must not hope finally to defend position have however given spaniard very heavy lesson success of defense have immensely raised spirit courage of men signal be therefore given for retreat in hour indian on summit of hill negro behind barricade have fallen back leaving only half dozen to keep up appearance of defense to bring back tidings of doings of enemy while rest hurried off to aid detached party to inflict heavy blow upon other column be found that be steadily approaching have lost good many men reinforcement enabled native to make more determined resistance in one two place column be effectually checked report when night fell be that spaniard have altogether lost over two hundred men that column have advanced considerable distance towards center of forest have halted a stood bivouacked keeping up huge fire careful watch formed part however of boy plan to attack thus when morning dawned whole of defender taking different path a far a possible even making great circuit so a to deceive enemy be directed to make for central fortress intermediate position several of be a strong a barricade have so well defended be abandoned for advance from other quarter rendered impossible to hold chapter baffled by midday defender of forest be assembled in semi circular plateau on face of hill scout having be placed near entrance awaited coming of enemy so far a possible mean have be taken to prevent access to place of retreat being discovered stream have be turned so a to run down small ravine leading to approach tree have be blown down by wind have be previously brought from considerable distance be piled in careless confusion across gorge so a to look a if have fallen there give idea that one must have passed way for next two day be quiet scout upon hilltop others who be told off to watch spaniard reported that wood below be being thoroughly searched that enemy be acting in most methodical way column being now in close connection with other intermediate forest being searched foot by foot that be converging towards central mountain of position dog have proved valuable assistant be tracking path used by steadily leading towards stronghold that must finally escape detection none of defender have much hope spaniard must be sure that must be somewhere within line after loss suffered immense preparation made be certain that must not retire until have solved mystery if possible annihilated forest band on fourth day after entering wood spaniard came to point where barricade of tree have be erected so skilfully have be constructed that must have retired believing that there be path beyond little gorge however restlessness anger of dog convinced that there must be something behind slowly passage be cut with ax through virgin forest on side for lesson have received have checked impetuosity came down at side of barricade thus having passed pressed forward in steady array until came to foot of great cliff here dog be not long before pointed out to assailant narrow path scarce visible running along face shout of satisfaction from spaniard testified that now felt certain that have caught enemy in trap party be sent off to position whence must obtain good view of place soon reported that ledge continued to great opening in face of precipice that in place log have be fixed to widen path that there be plenty of room on plateau formed by retirement of hill face for large body to have taken refuge also reported that cliff rose behind amphitheater almost if not quite perpendicularly for great height still higher bare rock fell away at so steep angle that must be difficult in extreme to take up position from above a must enable to keep up musquetry fire to hurl rock upon defender of amphitheater when report be considered by spanish leader saw at once that be not enterprise to be undertaken rashly men be sent down to plain below to reconnoiter while others be dispatched round mountain to see whether path extended across whole face of precipice also to discover if possible whether recess be commanded from above report be unfavorable from valley great natural strength of position be manifest for dozen men must defend path a against thousand by placing behind angle shooting down who turned corner while men from above reported that peak shelved so rapidly towards top of sheer precipice that must be impossible to get near enough to edge to see down into amphitheater reported however that stone rock set going must dash down below that point must be gained from missile must be dispatched on errand council of war be held be determined in first place to endeavor to force position by direct attack men of approved courage be chosen to lead forlorn hope number of marksman with arrow firearm be placed in valley to keep up fire upon who might show on path while above several hundred of men be sent up with crowbar to loosen hurl down rock defender on part be not idle two spot have be chosen in pathway for defense at of face of cliff extended sharply out in angle be on side of angle next to amphitheater that preparation be made here barricade of stone be heaped up on path at point be three yard wide six of steadiest most courageous negro be placed here with musket pike two of be to lie with gun pointed at protecting angle so that instant anyone showed round corner must open fire upon others be lying in readiness to assist to relieve on guard gerald ned remained with always few stone be thrown up on outside edge of path to protect defender from shot of in valley below not indeed that danger from source be very great for face of precipice be eight hundred foot high path ran along four hundred from bottom with clumsy arm in use in day fear of one being struck from below be by mean great similar barricade be erected behind negro be in case of extreme necessity to fall back from first position at second point equal number of men be placed lastly where path ended at amphitheater strong barricade have be erected in sort of semicircle so that anyone after having forced first defense must a showed at entrance to amphitheater be exposed to fire of whole of defender position be so strong that ned gerald have fear whatever of being forced a time approached when ned expected attack defender of farthest barricade be strengthened by considerable number lying down upon path for be certain that for first two three assault spaniard must push matter to utmost that must not be repulsed without severe fighting so indeed proved advancing with great caution along narrow path be sometimes seven eight foot wide sometimes narrowing to few inch leader of party of attack made way along until turned projecting point then gun of two men on guard spoke out two leader fell shot through body over precipice now that knew position of enemy spaniard prepared for rush gathering a closely a must together pressed round corner shot after shot rang out from defender a turned although many fell others pressed forward so numerously bravely that must be said fairly to have established round corner barricade now however faced behind be gathered bravest of negro led by boy barricade too have be covered with thorny branch a have that have defended before spaniard of whom only ten twelve must find fighting room round corner be shot down before must make impression bravely a fought be impossible for men to maintain so unequal difficult fight a after trying for hour to storm barricade spaniard fell back having lost over fifty of best of men in meantime with thundering sound rock be rolling down from summit of mountain greater portion of did not fall in amphitheater at from impetus of descent down sloping rock above shot far out beyond edge others however crashed down on to little plateau who be there be lying so close to face of rock that missile from above went far beyond from below in valley constant fire be kept up be a innocuous a bombardment from above when spaniard fell back only three of defender have be in way injured be hit by pistol ball fired by assailant of barricade when spaniard retired except men told off for post at barricade fell back to amphitheater negro native be alike delighted with success of defense be now perfectly confident of ability to hold out a long a provision lasted there be fear of want of water for from face of hill little stream trickled out pile of yam banana sweet potato other tropical fruit have be collected score of sheep with care boy calculated that for five week must hold out spaniard be furious at non success of enterprise after reconnoitering position in way commander came to conclusion that be absolutely impregnable that only plan be to starve out besieged did not appear that there must be other way of retreat small force must watch path a must be a difficult for besieged to force way back by a for besieger to find entry greater portion of force be therefore marched home guard of two hundred men being set to watch point where path along precipice started incident of five week elapsed after siege began be not important be soon found that spaniard have abandoned notion of attack vigilance of defender be never relaxed for be possible that at moment enemy believing that have be lulled into carelessness might renew attack twice indeed at spaniard advanced crept round point of defense be time received so quickly by fire of defender of barricade that be finally convinced that there be hope whatever of catching napping at end of five week be determined that time have arrived when must leave fortress spaniard have placed guard of fifty men near foot of precipice to prevent attempt of besieged to descend face by mean of rope above precaution have be taken a appeared impossible to anyone looking at face of cliff from distance that human being must scale thanks however to pain have be taken previously way be open in most place rough step have be cut in others where be impossible short stake have be driven into crevice of rock to form step although ascent be difficult be quite possible to lightly clad active men time chosen for attempt be just after dusk have fallen when be still light enough to see close at hand dark enough to prevent in valley observing what be passing young moon be already up giving sufficient light to aid enterprise of most active of native first ascended be provided with rope at bend turn of ascent lowered so a to give assistance to mounting behind strictest silence be enforced arm be wrapped up so a to avoid noise must strike rock one by one men mounted in steady stream be barefooted for ned gerald have imitated example of native upon such task a bare foot have infinitely safer hold than one shod with although cliff looked quite precipitous from distance in reality sloped gently backwards task be far le difficult than appeared to be most dangerous part indeed be that followed arrival at top mountain sloped so steeply back that be like climbing roof of very steep house hand foot be alike called into requisition to enable to get forward indeed to many must have be impossible have not leader lowered rope down from above affording immense assistance to following at last whole body reached top descending upon other side plunged into forest directed course to valley ten mile distant where considerable supply of provision have be stored up where of crop have be planted few week before arrival of spaniard here for two day feasted secure that considerable time might elapse before spaniard discovered that have vanished from fortress then prepared to put into execution plan upon have resolved knew that in town there must be watch of sort kept for believed cooped up without chance of escape four troop then commanded a before issued from forest a sun went down marched towards town be soon after midnight when entered street proceeding noiselessly through advanced to spot assigned to one be to attack

spaniard taken by surprise offered feeble resistance large number of be cut down before must rally open fire upon enemy a soon a resistance became serious negro indian vanished a quickly a have come in meantime whole of town be lit up by sheet of fire rising from government magazine alarm bell of church tolled out shout of frightened inhabitant mingled with yell of native report of firearm from

governor whose instruction to be that be to at once fall back to avoid being attacked by negro officer commanding besieger be glad enough to call men together to retire unharmed from forest now began to inspire almost superstitious fear in spaniard so unexpected mysterious have be defeat inflicted upon there governor son accompanied troop back to city be bearer of missive from ned to officer commanding troop to inhabitant ned offered upon part of forest men if spaniard must consent to leave unmolested in forest upon part must in first place release governor in second promise that act of violence raid of kind must be made beyond boundary question of fugitive slave who might seek refuge among be to be discussed at meeting between head of party must proposal be accepted governor sent line on part to say that be well treated that authorized to enter into negotiation might think fit adding that in case must decide to refuse offer made thought of safety must be allowed for instant to sway notion be two day before messenger returned several stormy meeting have taken place in town officer be for most part anxious to renew fighting be intensely mortified at idea of force of spain being compelled to treat upon something like even term with handful of escaped slave must have again marched troop into forest renewed war townspeople however be strongly opposed to have suffered immensely already by destruction of outlying plantation hacienda event of attack upon town showed that there be little danger of whole place being burnt to ground be therefore eager in extreme to make term with active ubiquitous enemy troop too be by mean eager to attempt entry into forest have fared so ill heretofore that shrank from encounter there be glory booty to be obtained warfare such a be altogether unsuited to habit discipline be useless be so bewildered by tactic of active foe that there be very strong feeling among in favor of making term council sat whole day finally pacific party

four representative of forest men on other thus ended first successful resistance to spanish power among island of western sea governor son then left for city forest men retired to what be now country ned gerald impressed upon ally importance of observing strictly condition of peace at same time of continuing exercise in arm maintaining discipline pointed out to that treaty of kind extorted a be from one that strongest of contracting power be certain not to have long duration spaniard must smart at humiliation have in opinion befallen although fugitive clause might for time act favorably be sure sooner later to be bone of contention impressed upon also that although might a have be shown achieve success for time yet in long run power of spaniard must prevail that nothing short of extermination awaited therefore urged strictest adherence to treaty at same time preparedness for recommencement of hostility month passed without incident relation between little community in mountain spaniard became more pacific latter found that native if left alone did damage bad master learned that course of ill treatment of slave be certain to be followed by flight upon bad treatment

tressilis together with gentleman adventurer named arbuckle when left captain francis armorer who have brought bow on shore with be showing native how much farther english bow must carry than native weapon wondering what country be like beyond hill little party ascended slope just a reached top heard shout looking back saw that be confusion string of armorer bow have snapped native knowing nothing of gun believed that party be now unarmed a armorer be restringing bow one of native shot arrow at fell mortally wounded one standing near now raised arquebus before must fire too be pierced by two arrow fell dead admiral caught up arquebus shot man who have first fired little party on hill have be struck with amazement consternation at sudden outburst be recalled to sense of danger by whiz of arrow struck master arbuckle in heart at same moment dozen of savage made appearance from among tree below seeing deadliness of aim that tom must be shot down at once before must get to close quarter ned turned to fly quick tom for life fortunately stood on very top of ascent so that single bound backwards took out of sight range of enemy there be wood few hundred yard inland apparently of great extent towards lad ran at top of speed savage have to climb hill when reached crest fugitive be out of bow shot range yell broke from a saw lad have made best use of time reached wood two hundred yard ahead of pursuer ned dashed into undergrowth tore way through tom close at heel sometimes came to open space here time ned changed direction of flight choosing spot where must take to underwood without showing sign such a broken bough of entrance after hour running yell shout have at first seemed close behind gradually lessened be now faintly heard then utterly exhausted lad threw on ground in few minute however ned rose again come tom said must keep on fellow will trace with sagacity of dog clever a may be take time to follow track must keep on now when get dark will be in hour so will be able to follow no longer then can take easily do a think best ned be accustomed to kind of thing without word started off at run again keeping a nearly a must straight course for ned experience in forest life enabled to do when one unused to woodcraft must have lost idea of direction fact however that moss grew on side of tree looking east be guide enough for for knew that warm breeze from sea must attract while colder inland wind must have opposite effect just a be getting dark emerged from wood must see stretching far before undulating almost treeless country fortunately there have be rain for time ground be a hard a iron ned said on damp soil under tree will track step will leave mark here in morning when trace to spot will be at fault so saying struck off across country for hour walked moon being high enabling to make way without difficulty at last came upon clump of bush here ned proposed halt tom be perfectly ready for have now walked run for many hour be thoroughly fatigued for after so long voyage in small ship be out of condition for long journey on foot first thing to do be to light fire ned said for be bitterly cold how do mean to light have flint steel in pouch ned said flask of powder for priming pistol in sash here be pity indeed did not put pistol into belt when came ashore even if have not have flint steel must have made fire by rubbing two dead stick together forget have lived among savage for year think that be dangerous to light fire not in least be dark when left wood must have halted on track far back among tree to follow up by daylight besides have walked five hour since then must be twenty mile away have crossed five six hill find few dead stick will pull handful two of dried grass will soon have fire ned made little pile of dried grass scooped out slight depression at top placed dead leaf in on poured few grain of powder added few blade of dried grass then set to work with flint steel after blow two spark fell into powder blazed up igniting blade of grass leaf in minute little pile be in blaze dried twig then larger stick be added soon bright fire burned up throw on of green bush ned said want blaze for although have thrown out fellow in pursuit of there may be others about now ned tom said after sitting for time gazing into red fire what on earth be to do next be question more easily asked than answered ned said cheerfully have saved skin for present now have got to think out what be best course to pursue see way to get back to ship tom said after long pause do ned replied tom savage know that have cut off will be on watch may be sure shoot so straight with little bow arrow of theirs that must be killed without least chance of ever getting to close quarter besides admiral will doubtless believe that have be slain will sail away may be sure that beat off fellow who be attacking will take to wood must never be able to get distance among tree besides must give up hope of finding there a to getting back through wood swarming with savage seems to hopeless then be to become of tom asked hopelessly well lookout be not bright ned said thoughtfully there be chance for may keep ourselves by killing wild animal by pushing inland may come upon people treacherous bloody than savage by seashore if so might hunt live with tom groaned be not sure must not rather be killed at once than go on living like savage life be not such bad one ned said tried once although negro indian of porto rico be certainly very different people to savage still life led on great plain hill abounding with game be more lively than being cooped up in wood a be then besides mean that must be here always propose that try cross continent be not so very wide here be nearly in line with admiral mean to go on there expects rich booty may be month before get round horn if must manage to be there when arrives must be rescued if not own have not much hope of must at least go down to lima time other can talk spanish now very fairly will have such lot of adventure to tell that even if take for spanish sailor a can try to feign will not be likely to put to death must do so if be taken in arm a buccaneer coming in peaceably might be kindly treated at rate if get on well with indian will have choice of making day other for spanish settlement on west coast be in distance first thing will be to get living somehow

threatened be in few minute fast asleep sun be rising above hill when with start awoke at once sprang to foot instinctively looked round in search of approaching danger be however quiet herd of deer grazed in distance other living creature be visible then turned eye upon other burst into simultaneous shout of laughter clothes be torn literally into rag by bush through have forced way while face be scratched stained with blood from same cause first thing to be done ned said when laugh be over be to look for couple of long springy sapling to make bow arrow of course will not carry far might knock down small game come across lad be good shot with bow for in day although firearm be coming in englishman be still trained in use of bow what about string tom asked will cut four thin strip from belt ned said pair tied together will make string for five foot bow will be fully strong enough for weapon will be able to make after hour walk came to small grove of tree growing in hollow be of several specie trying branch found one kind be at once strong flexible with hanger short sword cut down small sapling of four inch in diameter split up pared half down manufactured two bow be rough indeed sufficiently strong to send arrow considerable distance then made dozen shaft pointed notched without feather metal point must not fly straight to distance have thought of long range shooting now ned said will go back to bare space of rock passed hundred yard back there be dozen of little lizard running about there will be hard if can not knock be good to eat tom asked have doubt be ned said a rule everything be more le good to eat thing may be nicer than others hardly anything be poisonous have eaten snake over over again very good be have be keeping lookout for ever since started morning when reached rock lizard darted off to crack crevice ned tom lay down with bow bent arrow in place waited quietly ere long lizard popped up head again began to move about lad now let fly arrow sometimes hit sometimes missed shot be followed by disappearance of lizard with patience found by end of hour that have shot dozen be sufficient for ample meal for how will cook ned skin a if be eel then roast on stick be more thirsty than hungry tom said yes from look of country water must be scarce however a long a can shoot lizard bird can drink blood fire be soon lighted lizard cooked tasted like little bird flesh being tender sweet now have better be proceeding ned said when have finished meal have unknown country to explore if ever get across will have material for yarn for rest of life well ned must say be capital fellow to get into scrape with got gerald out of one if anyone must get through be sure must do so gerald told that always relied upon found always right may be sure will do same so appoint captain general of expedition promise to obey order unquestioningly well first order be ned said laughing that make good pike wood made bow from will do capitally can harden point in fire may meet wild beast good strong six foot pike must be better than sword two hour work completed new weapon with bow slung at back using pike a walking stave again set out on journey across

run faster than horse can gallop during day walk saw vast number of deer of various kind a be sure that must not allow to approach did not alter course be a nearly a must calculate by sun due west sun be warm during day higher hilltop be covered with snow if worst come to worst ned said must go up get snow can make big ball of bring down with in one of sash must think there must be stream somewhere about snow must melt besides great herd of deer must drink somewhere late in afternoon came on crest of ridge there ned said pointing to valley in be number of tree will find water there be mistaken

hurrah tom here be meat drink too be hard if kill something other here look at clump of bush where bank rise if hide there deer will almost touch a pas to water be sure to be able to shoot even with bow arrow first of for drink then will cross stream make camping ground under tree opposite stream be waist deep very cold for be composed of snow water will light fire ned might frighten deer think will attract ned said be most inquisitive creature be always attracted by anything strange fire be soon lighted after got quite dark piled up dry wood upon recrossed river took place in bush hour passed then heard deep sound in minute two leading rank of great herd of deer appeared on rise stood looking wonderingly at fire for little time halted then pushed forward by behind urged by own curiosity advanced step by step with eye fixed on strange sight so crowded be that a advanced seemed compact mass outside coming along close to bush in boy lay silently raised bow bent to full strain launched arrow deer be not five foot from two stag fell pierced through through leaped to foot again boy have dashed out with sword in hand in instant have cut down there be wild rush on part of herd

have owned englishman a belonging to dreaded buccaneer must have be to ensure imprisonment if not execution imperfection of ned spanish fact that tom be quite ignorant of language rendered difficult for to pas a spaniard thought that by giving out that have be carried away in childhood tom at earlier age than ned ignorance of language must be accounted for have be struggle with of to decide upon telling untruth be point upon difference of opinion must always arise will assert under circumstance can falsehood be justified others will say that to deceive enemy in war to save life deceit be justifiable especially when deceit injures one be only after very great hesitation that boy have overcome natural instinct teaching agreed to conceal nationality under false color ned indeed held out for long time tom have cited many example from ancient modern history showing that people of nation have to deceive enemy adopted course that to throw away life rather than tell falsehood must hurt one must be act of folly however determined that must become necessary to keep up character a spaniard by pretending to be true catholic must disclose truth first sight of young men struck captain of spanish escort with astonishment bronzed to darkest brown by sun of plain by hardship have undergone dressed in skin of animal carrying weapon altogether uncouth savage to spanish eye found difficult to believe that figure be of countryman first question however concerned savage who have a supposed attacked escort few word from ned however explained circumstance that yell have heard have be uttered by indian pursuing have reference to convoy consisted of two hundred mule laden with provision implement on way to mine guarded by hundred soldier be large number of native who fastened together a slave be on way up to work for cruel taskmaster when curiosity of captain concerning native be allayed asked ned where comrade have sprung from ned assured that story be very long one at convenient opportunity must enter into detail in first place asked that civilized clothes might be given to for a said looked felt at present rather a wild men of wood than a subject of king of spain speak very strange spanish captain said only wonder ned replied that speak in spanish at be child when be carried away since time have scarcely spoken word of native tongue when reached village to captor conveyed found companion here who be a must see spaniard who must have be carried off a infant a even then must speak spanish whatever have learned now from few word beyond be wholly ignorant be strange story indeed captain said where be that parent lived not place ned said be far to rising sun across on other ocean a seemed perfectly possible that boy might have be carried away a child from settlement near vera cruz captain accepted story without slightest doubt at once gave warm welcome to lad who have a supposed escaped after so many weary year of captivity be going up now said to mine there must remain on duty for fortnight when will return in charge of treasure will be dangerous indeed for to attempt to find way to coast without escort therefore have better come on with return under protection to coast must be glad of stay with in mountain ned said feel so ignorant of everything european that must be glad to learn from little of way of countryman before venture down among be nearest town on coast arica captain said be port from have come be distant hundred thirty mile from here have have ten day hard journeying through forest for next fortnight lad remained at mine be worked by spaniard entirely by slave labor nominal wage be indeed given to unfortunate who labored there be a much slave a if have be sold spaniard indeed treated whole of native in province occupied by a creature to be used mercilessly for labor a having more feeling than lower animal number of unfortunate who perished in mine from hard work cruel treatment be beyond calculation may be said that of enormous treasure drawn by spain from south american possession during early day of occupation doubloon be watered with blood boy who have for nearly six month lived among indian have seen many fine quality be horrified at sight witnessed several time have greatest difficulty to restrain feeling of indignation horror agreed however that must be worse than useless to give vent to such opinion must only draw upon suspicion of spaniard must set authority at mine captain of escort against might prejudice first report must be sent down to arica concerning during first few day of stay boy acted part with much internal amusement pretended to be absolutely ignorant of civilized feeding seized meat raw tore with finger sat upon ground in preference to chair in way behaved a person altogether ignorant of civilization gradually however permitted to be taught delighted entertainer by docility willingness spaniard be indeed somewhat surprised by whiteness of skin where sheltered from sun by lightness of hair eye boy must hear many comment upon wondering remark why must be so much fairer than countryman in general a however be clearly useless to ask none of spaniard thought of doing so end of fortnight arrived under charge of escort lad set out together with twenty mule laden with silver for coast have longer fear of attack of native trouble connected with food supply ample stock of provision being carried upon spare mule be mounted greatly enjoyed journey through magnificent forest be indeed little uneasy a to examination be sure to have to undergo at arica be likely to be very much more severe searching than to good natured captain have subjected longed to ask whether news have be heard of arrival of english squadron upon western coast be impossible to do without giving rise to suspicion have consolation at least of having heard single word concerning countryman uttered in conversation at mine have captain francis drake companion arrived upon coast be almost certain that presence there must be absorbing topic among spanish colonist upon arrival at boy be conducted at once to governor stern haughty looking spaniard who received account given by captain with air of incredulity be strange tale indeed said pass probability why must child have be kidnapped on eastern coast brought across continent be more likely that belong to side however must not be malefactor who have escaped into forest for age forbids idea of kind must have be stolen recall such event a carrying off of son of spaniard here for many year back however can be inquired into when learn to speak language well in meantime have better be assigned quarter in barrack let be instructed in military exercise in language said ecclesiastic who be sitting at table in holy religion for methinks stolen away a be in youth can be no better than pagan tom have difficulty in repressing desire to glance at ned a word be spoken eye of governor be fixed so intently upon that feared to exhibit emotion whatever resolved mentally however that progress in spanish must be exceedingly small that many month must elapse before must possibly receive even rudimentary instruction in religious matter life in barrack at arica resembled pretty closely that have led so long on board ship soldier received with good feeling camaraderie be soon completely at home with practiced drill use of pike rapier taking very great care in exercise to betray exceeding clumsiness with bow alone be able to show how expert be indeed spaniard be in slight degree astonished by extraordinary power accuracy of shooting ned accounted for to by long practice that have have among indian declaring that among tribe beyond mountain be by mean exceptionally good shot indeed be true enough at short distance for at indian must shoot with marvellous dexterity by san josef exclaimed one of spanish officer after watching boy shooting at target two hundred yard distant with powerful bow reminds of way that accursed english archer draw bow send arrow singing through air in faith too men with blue eye light hair remind one of heretic dog who be english ned asked carelessly have heard of such tribe do live near seacoast among mountain be tribe white people like captain said of course will not have heard of fortunately be not likely ever to see on coast if have remained where be born on other side must have heard little else talked of than doings of pirate scoundrel who scour sea defy authority of sacred majesty carry off treasure under nose burn town keep whole coast in uproar said ned in assumed astonishment how be that so great monarch a king of spain emperor of indie doe not annihilate ferocious sea robber surely so mighty king must have difficulty in overcoming live in island officer said be half fish half men what monster ned exclaimed half fish half men how then do walk not really in habit be born sailor be so ferocious bloodthirsty that at sea overcome even soldier of spain who be known said drawing up to be bravest in world on land however must teach very different lesson on sea must be owned that somehow be le valiant than on shore day priest came down to barrack for hour endeavored to instill element of religion into mind of now civilized wild men ned although progressing rapidly in other branch of spanish education appeared abnormally dull to explanation of good father while tom small stock of spanish be quite insufficient to enable to comprehend more than word here there so matter might have remained for month have not event occurred disclosed true nationality of lad one day ordinarily placid blue sky be over clouded wind rose rapidly in few hour tremendous storm be blowing on coast most of vessel in harbor succeeded in running into shelter later in day cry arose that ship have just rounded point of bay that must not be able to make port whole population speedily gathered upon mole vessel small one employed in coasting trade be seen struggling with wave be rapidly bearing towards reef lying quarter of mile from shore sea be at time running with tremendous force wind be howling in fierce gale when vessel struck upon rock mast at once went by board hope of safety for crew appeared at end can not boat be launched said ned to soldier standing round to effect rescue of poor fellow in wreck impossible said boat must live in sea after chatting for time tom ned drew little apart from rest of crowd watched ill fated vessel be rough sea certainly ned said be nonsense to say that boat must not live come along tom let push willop down there be sheltered spot behind rock where may launch methinks that arm can row out to yonder ship throwing off doublet young men put shoulder to boat soon forced into water then taking seat putting out oar rowed round corner of sheltering rock breasted sea be rolling in cry of astonishment broke from crowd on mole a boat made appearance astonishment be heightened when be declared by soldier that two men on board be wild men of wood a be familiarly called among be long struggle before boy reached wreck needed strength seamanship to avoid being swamped by tremendous sea at last however neared catching line thrown to by sailor brought boat up under lee of ship a captain four men who composed crew passenger leaped one by one from ship into sea dragged on board boat then turned head to shore chapter prison of inquisition among spectator on mole be governor other principal officer of arica seems almost like miracle from heaven priest who be standing next governor exclaimed governor be scowling angrily at boat if there be miracle said good father be that eye have be blinded so long think for moment two lad who have be brought up among indian from childhood must manage boat in such sea a why if story be true must of ever have handled oar be sailor skillful daring beyond common have ventured feat that none of people here on shore be willing to undertake how got here know not assuredly be english sailor will account for blue eye light hair have so puzzled for ignorance of spanish so craftily accounted for although assembled mass of people on beach have not arrived at conclusion to governor have jumped be filled with astonishment admiration at daring deed have be accomplished when boat be safely brought round behind shelter of rock occupant landed on shore loud cheer broke from crowd lad received perfect ovation comrade of barrack being especially enthusiastic presently crowd be severed by two soldier who made way through approaching ned tom said have order of governor to bring to lad supposed that governor desired to thank for saving life of shipwrecked men for in excitement of rescue thought that have exposed by knowledge of seamanship have never crossed mind crowd followed tumultuously expecting to hear flattering tribute paid to young men who have behaved so well aspect of governor a surrounded by officer stood in one of battery on mole excited vague feeling of astonishment surprise be two english seaman said when lad approached be useless lying longer knowledge of seamanship appearance alike convict for instant boy be too surprised to reply then tom said boldly be sir have done wrong to man be not ashamed now to say be englishman under same circumstance doubt not that spaniard must have similarly tried to escape recognition a chance have betrayed further concealment be unnecessary take to guard house governor said keep close watch over later will interrogate in palace feeling of crowd on hearing unexpected colloquy be very mixed in many admiration boy conduct have excited swallowed up other feeling among le enthusiastic mind vague distrust terror be at once excited by news that english sailor be among englishman have ever be seen on coast have inflicted such terrible loss on west indian island on neighboring coast that be matter for surprise first appearance on western shore of south america be deemed omen of terrible import news rapidly spread from mouth to mouth large crowd followed in rear of little party assembled around governor house sailor who have be rescued have many friend in port took up cause of boy shouted that men who have done so gallant deed must be pardoned offense perhaps on whole party be in majority sinister whisper circulated among crowd that be spy who have be landed from english ship on coast gradually cooled even most enthusiastic of partisan what at one time appeared likely to become formidable popular movement gradually calmed down crowd dispersed when brought before governor boy affected more concealment only point upon refused to give information be respecting ship on have sailed time at have be left upon eastern coast of america without absolutely affirming fact led to belief that have passed year since left vessel governor presently gazed sharply upon demanded be two white who headed negro revolt in porto rico did so much damage to possession in island ned must have hesitated a to answer tom at once said firmly be not two white men sir know well be two gallant loyal englishman who a know did much to restrain atrocity of indian saw when regained ship be lucky indeed that governor did not put question separately instead of saying be two leader for in case ned must have be forced to acknowledge that be one of outspokenness of tom answer allayed governor suspicion great portion of questioning be directed to discovering whether really have crossed continent for a well a populace outside have at first conceived idea that might have be landed on coast a spy fact however that be captured far up among cordilleras dress appearance knowledge of native tongue tested by bringing in native who entered into conversation with convinced that portion of story be true a have fear of escaping said that at present must not treat a prisoner gallant conduct in rowing out to save life of spaniard in danger entitled to good treatment that must report case to authority at lima who must of course decide upon priest however urged upon governor that must continue instruction to in catholic religion governor then pointed out to ned who alone be able to converse fluently in spanish that have now be so long separated from countryman that might with advantage to become naturalized a spaniard in case must push fortune to utmost with report in favor might rise to position of credit honor whereas if insisted upon maintaining nationality a englishman be too probable that authority at lima must consider necessary to send a prisoner to spain said however that must not press for answer at once greatly rejoiced at finding that be not at present to be thrown into prison be to be allowed to continue independent life in barrack lad took departure from governor house be most cordially received by comrade for short time everything went smoothly suspicion that be spy have now passed away remembrance of courageous action made popular among class in town cloud however began to gather slowly round now that have declared nationality felt that must no longer even pretend that be likely that might be induced to forsake religion accordingly refused positively to submit longer to teaching of priest argument be spent upon in vain after resorting to threat be not obscurely uttered be told with truth that only two three month before six person have be burned alive at lima for defying authority of church that if persisted in heretical opinion similar fate might fall upon english boy be accustomed to think with feeling of unmitigated horror indignation of day of inquisition in time like when general toleration of religious opinion prevails appears to almost incredible that men must have put others to death in name of religion be only by placing in position of persecutor of middle age that can see that what appears to cruelty barbarity of worst kind be really result of zeal in way a earnest if not a praiseworthy a now impels missionary to go with life in hand to region where little martyr grave can be expected nowadays believe at least right minded men believe that there be good in creed that must be rash indeed to condemn men who act up to best of light even though light may not be own in middle age there be idea of tolerance such a men believed fiercely earnestly that deviation from creed to belonged eternity of unhappiness such being case more earnestly religious man be more desired to save around from fate inquisitor who supported can not be charged with wanton cruelty killed partly to save who defied power of church partly to prevent spread of doctrine belief be that be better that one man must die even by death of fire than hundred must stray from pale of church so incur loss of eternal happiness in indie where priest in many case showed devotion heroic quality equal to anything have ever be displayed by missionary in part of world persecution be yet hotter than ever be in civilized europe men believed firmly that be bounden duty at cost to force native to become christian however may think that be mistaken wrong however may abhor act of cruelty committed must be mistake indeed to suppose that be perpetrated from mere lightness of heart wanton bloodthirstiness law of day be in country brutally severe in england in reign of henry eighth loss of ear be punishment inflicted upon man who begged second time offended other ear be cut off third repetition of offense be sold into slavery if ran away from master be liable to be put to death by first person who met theft of article above value of three shilling be punishable by death similar code of punishment prevailed for kind of offense human life be then held in such slight regard that must remember terrible a doings of inquisition be be not so utterly foreign to age in be perpetrated a must appear to living in day of moderate punishment general humanity by boy however brought up in england at time be bitterly even fiercely anti catholic state of thing naturally followed doings in reign of queen mary threatening aspect maintained by spain towards country popery be held in utter abhorrence inquisition be bugbear with mother frightened child when disobedient thought therefore of falling into hand of dreaded tribunal be very terrible to boy debated between whether must not be better for to leave arica secretly to make for mountain to take up lot for life among native of plain who have so hospitably received have indeed almost arrived at conclusion that must be best plan of procedure lingered however in hope daily becoming fainter of arrival of drake fleet seemed that by time must have failed in object of doubling horn nearly six month have elapsed since have be left on eastern coast according to calculation of distance two month must have amply sufficed to enable to make circuit of southern america must not tell that fleet have be delayed by extraordinary accident when off cape have met with storm continued from th of september to th of october without intermission old chronicler of expedition describes a being more violent of longer continuance than anything since noah flood have to waste much time owing to fact that captain winter with one of ship have missing consort in storm sailed back to england two other ship be lost that captain drake with flagship alone remained have spent much time in searching for consort in inlet island among saved in boat from spanish ship be young gentleman of rank fortune owner of large estate near lima who have come down upon business took great affection for young englishman came day to visit there being let hindrance on part of governor gentleman assured that possessed great influence at lima that although doubted not that military authority must treat with courtesy after manner in have risked life to save subject of majesty yet must be otherwise must move heaven earth in favor there be one thing dread said cloud came over handsome face need hardly say what be ned said gravely mean of course inquisition spaniard signified assent by silent movement of head dare not speak above breath of dreaded tribunal said very wall appear to have ear be better to face tiger in den than to say ought against inquisition there be many spaniard who like loathe abhor be powerless agent be everywhere one know not in whom dare confide even in family there be spy tyranny be carried on in name of religion be past supporting even must 'holy office ' lay hand upon keep up heart be assured will risk be worth life to boot to save from must advise to fly ned said can without doubt escape from here for be lightly guarded governor be sure be friendly towards whither must fly asked young spaniard must cross mountain to plain join indian there must be wretched life spaniard said must cut off from kindred friend can give advice to confess death must be preferable even in worst form to fond of exercise able to cause to be respected feared by wild indian of pampas might be different however need not decide yet trust that even must worst befall may be able at last moment to give opportunity of choosing life in preference to death in dungeon of inquisition be about ten day from date of governor writing that ship came in from lima same evening governor came in to with grave face be attended by two official dressed in deepest black senor said be duty in first place to inform that governor of lima acting upon report sent of bravery manifested in matter of wreck here have agreed to withdraw question against touching past connection with english freebooter to allow freedom without let hindrance to further passage to such place a opportunity may afford where may be able to meet with ship from own country be have to say to then men in black stepped forward said arrest in name of holy inquisition on charge of heresy young men glanced at governor believing that be sufficiently friend to give sign if resistance must be of avail replied to unspoken question by almost imperceptible shake of head be well that boy abandoned idea for door opened guard of six men armed to teeth although in plain dark clothes entered be alguazils of holy office bird of night whose appearance be dreaded even by most bigoted spaniard at whose approach mother clasped child closer to breast men crossed at thought that passage boded death to unhappy victim for must be remembered that inquisition framed at first only for discovery punishment of heresy later became instrument of private vengeance men denounced wife of whom wished to be rid wife husband relation of kin be sufficient to ensure safety evidence sometimes true be more often manufactured by malice hate until at last even most earnest sincere catholic trembled when thought that at moment might be denounced flung into dungeon of inquisition brave a lad be must not avoid thrill of horror at presence of familiar of dreaded body be however cheered by thought of promise of young spaniard in whose honesty honor have great faith with few word of adieu to governor thanks to for what have done in behalf followed officer of inquisition along street of arica suffered to be placed on board boat lay alongside mole although be late in evening passage be not unobserved many of soldier recognized in two men marching surrounded by black guard of inquisition late comrade confident in number did not hesitate to lift voice in loud protest against seizure of men who have behaved so gallantly in darkness too feared not that face must be recognized curse threat rose loud in air people looking out from door to hear cause of uproar be variously affected joined in movement of soldier more shrank back with dread into house rather than be compromised with so dreaded body threat however did not proceed to open violence a young men gave sign of attempting effort for freedom comrade contented with many shout of good wish mingled with curse upon captor lad be embarked without alguazils having to use sword have drawn in readiness for expected fray be witness senor officer ned said that came without resistance have chosen must with assistance of soldier have easily broken from hold of men be willing however to proceed with to lima where doubt not that justice of judge will result in acquittal one can blame that be of religion of father have be born catholic then relapsed into heresy must have be reasonable for to have considered case a hold religion have be taught know indeed of other see not how in man eye blame can rest upon take note officer said of docility with have remained in hand will so far testify in favor touching other matter be beyond jurisdiction vessel in boy be embarked be slow one two day after leaving arica saw small sailing craft

separated from guard man in rough peasant dress be forced in contact with ned said hastily in low voice to keep up heart when preparation be made will act ned recognized voice of young spanish gentleman whom have left at arica guessed immediately that have taken passage in swift sailing caravel in order to be able to reach lima before vessel containing prisoner ned have in confidence in talk with informed that still hoped although hope have now fallen almost to zero from long tarrying of fleet that english admiral must arrive that must be able to go on board so rejoin countryman expectation indeed be have prevented ned tom making escape when must have done so taking to mountain for be certain that time at least must elapse before stringent measure must be taken against effort must without doubt be made to persuade to abandon religion day might bring with arrival of english vessel young men be conducted to dark sombre building bore appearance of vast monastery interior be

burned to death lately at lima what frightful cruelty have perpetrated in ghastly prison will burn place to ground hang up judge in case may be sure that further inquiry will ever be thought of concerning attack on prison what do advise to do senor for be clear that best course be to return to arica direct can not think of doing that generous young spaniard replied few day longer absence

allow to leave country placing proof of innocence in hand of providence being bargain that if must bring back to emperor strange wonderful tidings of thing new to such a have never heard of must be restored to place honor held to be acquitted of crime if such news must not be gained by be to remain in exile to be accounted guilty of of be accused coming on board very earnestly entreated admiral to give account of adventure from time of leaving country captain drake willingly did chinaman in great delight exclaimed that be fully sufficient for to bear back to emperor gave very warm pressing invitation to sir francis to bring ship to china where assured of welcome at hand of emperor have captain drake be able to accede to proposition be probable that dealing with east on large scale might have begun century earlier than did golden hind be much battered by voyage have gone through being indeed not new ship when started crew too be longing to get home treasure have be gathered from spaniard be ample for desire admiral therefore although truly longed to see country to open relation between queen be yet forced to decline invitation so to depart on westward voyage golden hind now made slow progress through water bottom being foul with weed other thing have attached to during long voyage captain therefore determined to enter first harbor in uninhabited island that came to for at none of place at have hitherto touched have ventured to take step however friendly inhabitant might have appeared cause of quarrel might have arisen with ship hauled up bent over might have fallen into hand of native so be destroyed return to england cut off from five day after leaving ternate found place fetching up in small harbor whole party landed pitched tent entrenched then took cask water vessel ashore thoroughly repaired trimmed ship scraped bottom so put in state to perform rest of voyage greatly here be crew astonished by first sight of firefly creature be new to island

crayfish when found cut off from natural retreat climbed up tree there concealed in branch on december th again set sail being now among celebes where found water shoal coasting very dangerous wind too be high contrary difficulty greater than anything have found on january th wind however came aft appeared to have found passage out of danger sailing then at full speed be at first watch at night filled with consternation at crash followed by silence vessel be found to have run high upon reef of surface have presented indication not since golden hind have left england have strait be a sore a force with have run upon reef seemed to have carried beyond hope of extrication considered that death be at hand for hardly hoped that ship must hold long together admiral at once to still confusion reigned ordered to prayer whole kneeling on deck prayed for mercy preparing for imminent death presently having finished praying admiral addressed in consoling speech then courage being much raised bestirred to regard position pump be first tried ship freed of water to great joy found that leakage be greater than before that rock have not penetrated through plank appeared to on board to be absolute miracle wrought in favor for seemed impossible to that running at so high rate of speed vessel must have failed to break against rock be probable that in fact ship have struck upon newly formed coral reef that coral when first made be not very hard have crashed to piece under shock so lay in safety upon bed of pounded fragment chapter south sea idol when order tranquility be perfectly restored admiral ordered boat to be lowered sounding to be taken intending to put out anchor ahead to get off by working upon with windlass be found however under forefoot of vessel water deepened so rapidly that at distance of few fathom sounding must be obtained plan therefore be abandoned prospect seemed dark indeed ship boat must at most only carry men on board if ship have to be abandoned whole of treasure must be lost a well a many life there be island far away to south admiral said if worst come must seek refuge on that will be well to send boat to examine see what capability offer for purpose then if weather hold fair can make several trip land men portion at least of valuable will let go sir with three friend ned asked canoe took from last halting place will carry four of a paddle swiftly may be back before many hour idea be good one captain drake said make for island be must say fifteen mile off when have reached see if there be water fuel other necessary whether

ship took bead calico other article then seating in boat paddled rapidly away at first felt little awkward in using paddle in have have practice whatever being powerful men accustomed to use of oar soon fell into regular stroke light boat danced rapidly over water distance be further than captain drake have imagined clearness of air making land appear nearer than really be be only after three hour of hard work that neared turned out to be island of about mile in length so far a must judge reef of coral ran round center of island be somewhat elevated be covered with coconut tree be alone have enabled to be seen from so great distance from deck of golden hind paddling round reef came to opening entering found in perfectly smooth water be soon on shore best way to look for water ned said will be to follow beach round island if there be stream must then come upon have better take arm haul up canoe ned although youngest of party being officer of ship be naturally in command will be hard reuben said if meet with adventure be first time have be out with ned others have have share will be hard upon if when get home have not tale to tell friend hope that will not be so ned said for more than story telling depends upon success fear golden hind be fixed fast that fruit of expedition be lost even if life be saved everything depends upon report may make when return anything must occur to delay to prevent bearing back tidings of place to admiral must be bad fortune indeed mean reuben said anything must prevent returning might do something yet return safely walk round island showed sign of water although searched for hour walking backwards forward across must find sign of pool be clear that there be fresh water spring on island that vegetation depended entirely upon rain fell in regular season discovered from top of island much larger one lying still again fifteen mile to south after much deliberation determined to make for a be of importance that must have news of place to good must be transported to carry back to ship island be much higher there appeared probability that water required must be found there accordingly taking place in canoe again paddled out through entrance to reef steered course for new discovery be large island measuring at least a judged from view of one side twenty mile round shore be steep rowed for time before succeeded in finding place where landing must be effected then deep bay suddenly opened out into rowed scarcely have fairly entered when from bush near shore two large war canoe crowded with native shot out made towards lad at first grasped musket ned said let arm be be here to make peace with native must take chance stood up in canoe holding up arm in token of amity canoe came alongside at racing pace native uttering yell of joy canoe have evidently be seen approaching island preparation have be made to seize immediately on arrival ned held up in hand bead piece of cloth native be too excited for pause negotiation in instant boy be seized placed on board canoe two in be tenderly handled be clearly object of veneration rather than of hostility moment that be on board content of canoe be transferred to large boat be then cast adrift two war boat at full speed made out through passage ned endeavored in vain to attract attention of leader of savage to gesture to explain to that there be vessel from have come at short distance off that if must accompany thither must obtain large quantity of bead cloth showed native however be too much excited to pay attention to effort with sigh of despair sat down by side of reuben who be in same boat with a canoe on emerging from bay turned head to southwest paddled steadily rapidly away from island whither can be going to take reuben said must belong to other island ned answered be war party have come on plundering purpose here what misfortune what terribly bad luck have clearly never seen white men before regard a superior being so far a be concerned be probable that life be safe what will admiral think when night come on return what will become of comrade at thought of messmate left without help in so perilous position ned fairly broke down cried for hour native continued course without intermission gradually island have at first seemed like low cloud on horizon loomed up nearer nearer at last just a night fell landed upon shore here in bay village of hut constructed of bough of tree have be raised arrival of war canoe be greeted with wild prolonged cry by woman child prostrated in wonder astonishment when white men in strange attire be brought on shore ned saw that suspicion be correct that be regarded by captor a god further proof be given of when be escorted to large shed composed of roof of thatch supported on four upright post stood in center of village under be placed of hideous effigy south sea islander worship be affixed to prow of boat may be seen in british museum in other place where collection of indian curiosity be exhibited effigy be carved in shape of human being with enormous goggle eye splash of bright paint strange immense headdress of brilliant color here lad be motioned to sit down native brought offering of cocoa other fruit boy must hardly help laughing at strange position surrounded by hideous idol wanted adventure reuben have got one indeed ned said be translated into heathen god if ever get home will have story to tell will astonish quiet fireside in devonshire ought not to refuse to accept horrid worship gerald said think not ned replied can do harm be at least better than wooden idol so long at least a be taken for god life be safe must not say a much if once became convinced by action that be men like can not sit here life among idol reuben said agree with there reuben patience doe wonder be not troubled in least about sooner later way of escape will present when doe be assured that will use patience be that require now be of poor shipmate that be thinking a night fell great bonfire be lighted native indulged in wild dance round feasting festivity be kept up through night four watch be stationed one at post of temple boy saw that for present at

believe said tom bursting into shout of laughter that be going to put in bow of canoe in place of old god others joined in laughter for to act a figurehead of canoe be indeed comical if unpleasant situation when reached boat boy saw that suspicion be correct that native be preparing to lash to lofty prow rose twelve foot above water in sweep inwards will never do tom said if be fastened like weight will cut horribly let show how to do whereupon with great gravity took large piece of flat wood motioned to savage to lash in front of bow of one of boat at height of three foot above water so a to afford little platform upon must stand native at once perceived drift of what be doing be delighted that new deity must evince such readiness to fall in with plan addition be made at once to four canoe while be being done of leading chief with mark of deference approached boy with colored paint motioned to that must permit to deck in way again boy indulged in hearty laugh stripping off upper garment to immense admiration of native applied paint in ring zigzag other form to white shirt painted large saucer like circle round eye with vermilion so a to give something appearance of great idol

keeping regularly abreast rowed off from island amidst perfect chaos of sound of yell beating of rough drum made of skin stretched across hollow trunk of tree of blowing of conch shell position will be unpleasant one must trust to circumstance to do best at rate must wish that friend conquer for next party if fall into hand might take into head that be devil instead of god might fare worse with be manifest a soon a started that object of expedition be not island upon have be captured one lying away to south be row of several hour before approached a did so saw column of smoke rise from several point of shore knew that coming there be observed by islander presently six canoe equally large with own crowded with men be observed pulling out yell of defiance came across water be clear tom said that island be stronger than own that be only on strength of miraculous presence that islander expect to conquer foe for must never with four canoe venture to attack place of superior force unless deemed that victory be certain with wild yell be answered boldly from own canoe enemy approached combat began with general discharge of arrow then canoe rowed into other general desperate hand to hand combat commenced enthusiasm with inmate of boy canoe be animated at first gave superiority not only beat back attack of foe leaping into enemy boat succeeded in clearing two of of occupant number however told enemy be with very heavy club spear pointed with sharp shell gradually forcing adventurer back when ned saw that little supernatural interference be desirable to bring matter straight again giving word to friend stood up on perch swinging round alighted in boat giving a did so loud british cheer be answered by of comrade then with arm erect began to move along bench of canoe towards conflict be raging on side sudden interference of four deity at head of boat be received with yell of terror by native who be attacking be increased when boy seizing club from hand of native jumped into enemy canoe began to lay about with strength be however required for moment sight of so terrible unexampled apparition appalled islander who springing overboard with yell of despair swam rapidly towards land leaving boat in hand of victor indulged in wild yell of triumph knelt before good genius then taking place paddled towards shore before have reached however defeated savage have landed running up to village have borne news of terrible apparition have taken part against conqueror on reaching village found deserted plundered of few valuable carried down enemy god in triumph into canoe then having fired hut started again with ten canoe towards own island triumphant arrival at village be received with frantic excitement enthusiasm sight of six canoe towed in by four belonging to place be greeted with something of same feeling in nelson time portsmouth more than once experienced upon english vessel arriving with two captured french frigate of size superior to

wreath of flower neck arm be loaded with necklace shell other ornament laugh fellow said ned do believe that have brought four wife in token of gratitude lad have greatest difficulty in restraining from marring effect of solemnity by ill timed laughter put great restraint upon listened gravely while chief made long harangue pointed to four damsel who elated at honor of being selected somewhat shy at being center of public gaze evidently understood that village have chosen to be wife of god although boy must not understand word of speaker there be question a to meaning consulted together a to best step to be taken under circumstance must temporize said tom must never do for to consider slighted after short consultation again took place in solemn row in front of shed reuben who be tallest most imposing of set who be evidently considered by villager to be leading deity then addressed long harangue to chief villager beckoned to four girl who timidly advanced one knelt at foot of of white then reuben motioned that hut must be built close to shrine pointing to sun traced way across sky made mark upon ground repeated fourteen time signifying that girl must be shut up in hut guarded safely for time after nuptials must take place be quite sure ned said pausing turning round to friend that will be able to make attempt to escape before end of fourteen day because must be fearful indeed if be to fail to find compelled to marry four heathen woman will certainly try before fourteen day be up reuben with what success of course can not say if lay plan well ought to manage to get off villager readily understood harangue of reuben without delay whole scattered into wood returning with bundle of palm leaf strong post at once began to erect hut fire be lighted a evening

not above five knot hour must be able to paddle back in course of ten day must take provision sufficient for time first point of course will be to find whether old ship be still on reef if be not there may have succeeded in getting off may have gone to piece trust however that admiral who be full of resource have managed to get off in safety will no doubt have spent day two in looking for finding sign of in island to be sent in other lying in sight to southward will have shaped way for cape first difficulty then be to procure sufficient provision next be to make escape unseen four native who night day watch at corner of shed mean a great honor doubt like many other honor be unpleasant one only plan will be to seize gag suddenly pouncing upon one then there be fear that native who be must say most restless sleeper ever saw may in wandering up to look at find that have gone before be fairly beyond reach of pursuit for one of great canoe will travel at least two foot to one hitherto have only taken such provision from pile have offered a be sufficient for day want left rest for to take away again next morning in future have best day abstract considerable quantity place

unlikely therefore must have gone entirely to piece afforded great ground for hope that have beaten off reef proceeded on voyage hitherto have be buoyed up with expectation of again meeting friend now felt truly unselfish pleasure at thought that comrade admiral have escaped peril threatened downfall of hope termination of enterprise fairly successfully carried out so far there be nothing now for to make for ternate found difficulty whatever in doing without water thirst being amply quenched by milk of cocoa juice of guava other fruit paddled for two day longer working steadily day far into night passed one two island in course of next day passage went within short distance of be horrified at seeing from narrow bay large war canoe put out make rapidly towards have already talked over what must be best course in such contingency proceeded at once to put plan into execution have at starting taken with supply of paint used in decoration with proceeded to touch up coloring on face white shirt on strange ornament have be affixed to head two of now took place one at stern other at bow of canoe other two stood up paddled very quietly slowly along a canoe approached rapidly four broke into song one of old devonshire catch have often sung together on board ship war canoe a approached gradually ceased paddling aspect of small boat paddling quietly along taking heed of presence filled occupant with surprise when way on canoe drifted close to be enabled to see strange character of freight panic of astonishment alarm seized that boat navigated by four god must be seen proceeding calmly along ocean alone be sight for indian legend gave precedent whatever after gazing for while in superstitious dread at strange spectacle turned boat head paddled rapidly back to shore for hour two boy continued course in same leisurely manner when once convinced that be out of sight of late visitor again sat down four stretched to work on evening of day there be heavy mist upon water star be with difficulty seen through lad be convinced that change of weather be at hand before nightfall have set in island have be seen at short distance to north decided at once to make for a if caught in mid ocean by storm have little hope of weathering in craft like in be placed although native habituated to be able to keep sea in very rough weather in little craft to english eye appeared safer than cockleshell boy rowed with strength in direction in island lay before reached sharp puff of wind struck water steerage of canoe became extremely difficult presently however heard sound of dull roar knew that be caused by slow heaving swell of be already sensible breaking upon beach ten minute later be close to shore have be daylight must have coasted round island to search for convenient spot for landing wind be already rising so fast that deemed better to risk breaking up canoe than to run hazard of being longer upon sea waiting therefore for wave sped forward with strength there be crash then leaped out together seizing canoe ran up on beach before next wave arrived fear have knocked great hole in bottom reuben said never mind ned replied will be able to make shift to mend great point now be to drag up so high among bush that will not be noticed in morning by native who may happen to be about until storm be over at rate have got to shelter here canoe laden a still be with provision be too heavy to drag up boy emptying out lifted on shoulder carried inland until at distance of sixty seventy yard entered grove of coconut tree here laid down made two journey back to beach to fetch up provision then took refuge in grove thankful that have escaped on shore in time for scarcely have landed when hurricane have be brewing burst with terrific force sea of immense height came rolling in upon shore tree of grove waved to fro before shook heavy nut down with such force that boy be glad to leave to lie down on open beach rather than to run risk of having skull fractured by missile from above sound of wind deadened voice even by shouting must not make heard now then above din of storm be heard crash of falling tree even a lay be sometimes almost lifted from ground by force of wind for twenty four hour hurricane continued then cleared a suddenly a have commenced lad crept back to grove refreshed with content of two three cocoa apiece then lying down under canoe have taken precaution of turning bottom upwards enjoyed peaceful sleep till morning chapter portuguese settlement day broke bright sunny first care of boy be to examine canoe found a have feared that huge hole have be made in bottom by crash against rock on landing looked for time with rueful countenance at then a usual turned to ned to ask what thought have best be done there can be doubt said that native make sort of glue out of tree shrub growing in island will have to endeavor to discover tree from obtain can of course easily pull off bark from tree will do to cover hole great point be to find substance will make water tight grove be very large one appeared to extend along whole coast seaward be formed entirely of cocoa tree inland large number of other tree be mingled with palm day boy attempted to find semblance of gum oozing from tree with sharp piece of shell made incision in bark of variety that met with to see if fluid exuded might be useful for purpose in vain if can kill animal other ned said might boil down sinew skin make glue a tom did to mend bow with among indian on pampas even then question whether glue must stand action of water a to subsistence have uneasiness besides cocoa fruit of sort abounded in wood parrot other bird flew screaming among branch at approach although at present have mean of shooting snaring creature agreed that must be easy to construct bow arrow must stay be prolonged however shrank from doing a long a possible method of escape presented be absolutely necessary agreed that must burn down tree construct fresh canoe be by mean sanguine a to boat building capability be reluctant to give up idea of continuing voyage in present craft a long a possibility of so doing remained so passed four day succeeded in finding gum other substance appeared likely to suit purpose must think reuben said one day that must be possible to make canoe so buoyant that must not sink even if filled with water how must do tom asked there be many light wood doubt among tree that see must have to remain long time to dry to be light enough to be of use be thinking reuben said that might use coconut there be immense quantity upon tree ground be covered with from effect of late gale if strip off whole of outside husk then make hole in little eye at top let out milk using young one in flesh have not yet formed cutting stick to fit tightly into hole must support considerable weight in water must think that if treated several hundred nut in way put in bottom of canoe keep in place by sort of net might easily make from fiber of cocoa boat must be buoyant enough to carry idea struck a being feasible reuben be much congratulated upon inventive power without delay set to work to carry out plan piece of thin bark be first taken by mean of long thorn used a needle be sewn over hole in canoe with fiber of cocoa then large pile of nut be collected boy set to work at task of emptying of content took hour work to make fit peg two day be spent in manufacturing net to stretch across boat above nut be then placed in boat net put into shape choosing calm night for trial for feared during daytime to show beyond margin of forest placed in water paddled short distance out found that anticipation be justified that flotation of cocoa be amply sufficient to keep boat afloat be of course far lower in water than have before be pace be greatly deteriorated however have expected returning to shore watched for next night then taking in load of provision started at once upon way be weary work now for water logged canoe be very different boat to light bark have yielded so easily to stroke fortunately however met with misadventure weather continued calm be unseen at least not followed from of island that passed on way be ten day after final start before large island recognized a ternate be seen rising above water easy ned said may be thankful indeed that have arrived safely in sight of island now that be close there be fear of tempest have not better talk over whether after will land at ternate not land at ternate others exclaimed in consternation for indeed work during last few day have be very heavy be rejoicing at thought of end to labor why thought be arranged all along must stop at ternate yes arranged that because at ternate alone there seemed certainty of welcome a know tidore only lie twelve mile away from ternate from position be now in will not be more than five six mile farther see when be there king be preparing for war with portuguese in tidore must certainly expect to assist probably to lead fighting men must have objection to reuben said not in least ned replied see if be ever to get back to england must be through portuguese ship alone be to be found in sea be to join king of ternate in attack upon whether successful not must never hope to be received in portuguese ship must probably indeed be taken to goa perhaps burned there a heretic if be to seek asylum on board what do think viewed in light certainly appeared more prudent to go to tidore after little discussion boat head be turned more to west lad continued weary work in paddling water logged canoe so slowly did move that be late at night before approached island determined not to land till morning a might be mistaken for native attacked therefore lay down in canoe went to sleep when within about mile of island next morning paddled along shore until saw canoe hauled up together with english boat supposed that be at principal landing place of island on side of landing place cliff rose steeply up at short distance from beach at point sort of natural gap existed up road ascended into interior of island there be several native moving about on beach a boy approached one of be seen at once to start at run up road lad have carefully removed vestige of paint from face hand having put on doublet concealed strange appearance presented before by white shirt resistance be opposed to landing native motioned to that must not advance inland until messenger returned from governor boy be only too glad to throw down full length on soft sand of beach to dry clothes in sun a for ten day have be constantly wet be stiff tired presently native came down at run announced that governor be at hand rising to foot making best show must in faded garment lad soon saw portuguese gentleman attended by four soldier coming down road between cliff who be asked in portuguese a reached whence come be englishman ned said in spanish belong to ship of captain drake passed by here in voyage of circumnavigation by accident in canoe be separated from ship left behind have come to seek hospitality protection heard of english vessel at ternate governor said sternly week since heard also that captain be making alliance with king there against be not so ned said admiral stopped there for few day to obtain supply such a needed be not here either to make alliance to trade captain drake on starting intended to voyage round coast of america to return if possible by north after coasting up western shore of continent found that must be impossible to pas round north a coast extended so rapidly toward north of asia therefore started to return by cape on way passed through island have be part of plan to make alliance with king of ternate other potentate must have stopped done so must have given armed assistance to king object be simply to return a quickly a possible have there be alliance made must naturally have made for ternate instead of island a have relation with king seek only mean of returning to europe preferred of course to come here where knew that must find christian hoped friend there be palpable truth in what ned said governor unbending expressed readiness to receive help then asked few more question about manner in have become separated from friend seeing advantage in concealing truth thinking perhaps that must be well if opportunity must offer that governor must send vessel to search among island near where wreck took place see if of crew have sought refuge there told frankly circumstance under have left golden hind must be sad indeed said portuguese if so grand expedition under so noble commander must have be wrecked after accomplishing work in part be not friendly to european meddling holiness pope granted discovery on side of cape must fain trade in peace quiet without interference can admire great deed enterprise of countryman indeed said smiling for portuguese be a rule very small race looking at bulk of four young men be indeed almost gigantic by side of soldier be scarcely surprised now see at almost legendary deed hear that countryman have performed on spanish main now follow to castle will there provide with proper appliance what position did hold in ship be gentleman of devonshire ned said bore share in enterprise sailing a gentleman adventurer under captain drake held rank of third officer in ship then senor portuguese said bowing be happy to place house at disposal may be that will be able to render service will far more than repay slight inconvenience trouble to may be put for hear that king of ternate be preparing formidable expedition against a garrison be very small one native be not to be relied upon to fight against of other island addition of four such experienced soldier a yourself will in slight degree strengthen boy replied that sword be at service of host well content with turn thing have taken proceeded with up road into interior of island upon gaining higher land be surprised at aspect of island in place of almost unbroken forest have beheld in other spot at have landed here be fair cultivated land large grove of spice tree grew here there native be working in field with regularity of european portuguese method of cultivating island took differed widely from of english first step be to compel native to embrace christianity second to make of docile obedient laborer raising spice other product for received in payment calico bead european good castle stood in center of small plain be built of stone roughly hewn be of strength must have resisted european attack be well calculated for purpose for be designed consisted of pleasant house standing in enclosure round be wall fifteen foot in height with platform running behind to enable garrison to shoot over top ditch of ten foot in depth fifteen foot wide surrounded so that without scaling ladder to ascend wall cannon to batter hole in place must be well held against attack that native might make upon garrison be not formidable one consisting only of thirty portuguese soldier whose appearance did not speak much for discipline maintained uniform be worn rusty in extreme be slovenly in appearance wore look of discontent hopelessness large portion of indeed have be criminal have be offered choice of death of serving for ten year generally meant for life in eastern sea ned judged that great reliance must be placed upon army of scarecrow in event of attack of serious character men must scarcely show to advantage at home governor said noting glance of surprise with boy have viewed in country like with such great heat real occasion for more than appearance be hopeless to expect to keep up smartness must at home be necessary native be very docile quiet give trouble whatever be not for interference from ternate where people be of much more warlike nature guard have must be ample for purpose be expecting vessel call here about once in six month very shortly anticipate will bring twenty more soldier for whom wrote to viceroy at goa when last called here what be latest news from ternate ned asked have direct news said what know gather from native who by mean of canoe fishing boat be often in communication with of opposite island tell that great preparation be being made that several of largest sized canoe have be built that believe when be full moon be generally era at commence adventure there will be descent upon island then have seven day in to prepare ned said have be doing anything to enable to receive hotly have not governor said now that gentleman have come doubt not that experience in warfare will enable to advise a to what step have better take stand at present alone here officer who under commanded garrison died two month since who be brought up in civil rather than military capacity be own to strange altogether to matter ned expressed willingness of friend to do in power to advise assist governor with many mutual compliment now entered house where goodly room be assigned to native told off a servant governor at once set two native seamster to work to manufacture garment of proper cut for from material have in storehouse for trading with neighboring chief who like savage be greatly given to finery thus by end of week boy be able once more to make show must have passed muster in european capital at governor request have at once proceeded to drill soldier ned gerald taking command of company of fifteen men a understood spanish must readily make understood in portuguese whereas tom reuben knew little of spanish tongue think tom said first morning to governor after friend have discussed prospect together must be well to throw up protection at top of road leading from shore must order large tree to be cut down dragged by strong force of native to spot there so arranged that branch will point downward form chevaux de frise in hollow way leaving until last moment passage between having at hand number of young sapling to fill up gap there be suppose other place at enemy must land oh yes governor said on other side of island land slope gradually down to shore indeed be only for few mile at point that cliff rise so abruptly that must not be ascended yet even here there be many point native must easily scale although in accoutrement must find impossible while ned gerald drilled men with great assiduity astonishing portuguese soldier with energy authoritative manner tom reuben occupied in superintending felling of tree carriage by mean of large number of native to top of road preparation be also made for blocking up lower window of house so that in case of enemy succeeding in carrying outer wall stout resistance must be made within large pile of provision be stored in building great jar of water placed there be sure ned asked governor one evening of native here for own that there appears to to be sullen defiance in manner must not be surprised to see turn upon immediately from other island arrive if did so of course position at top of road must be untenable a must take in rear however if do so doubt not that will be able to cut way back to castle without difficulty think that must be in case advisable to leave at least ten men to hold castle while rest of oppose landing there be in store four small culverin several light wall piece two of culverin be placed on cliff one at side of path so a to command landing two others be placed on roof of castle be flat terraced wall piece be also cleaned placed in position at corner of wall boy having seen that musketoons arquebus of garrison be in excellent order ready for service felt that have be done be possible to prepare for attack day before full moon sentinel be placed at cliff with order to bring word instantly to castle in case craft be seen coming from ternate distance from cliff to house being about mile short time after daybreak next morning sentry arrived at full speed saying that great fleet of canoe be visible hurrying to spot with governor lad made out that approaching flotilla consisted of eighteen great war canoe of crowded a be might contain hundred men in addition to be large number of smaller craft invading force therefore must considerably exceed two thousand men reuben have command of gun at one side tom at other now loaded sighted piece so a to pour volley of case shot into canoe when arrived within quarter of mile from shore canoe came along in dense body a close together a must paddle rower filling air with defiant yell when reached spot upon gun have be trained tom fired piece roar be answered by wild scream yell from crowded fleet reuben followed suit destruction wrought by gnu be at once manifest three of great canoe be broken to piece occupant swimming in water climbed into others among also great many men have be wounded effect of reception upon valor of native be very speedy without moment delay backed off be soon seen making out of range of gun like troop of wild fowl scattered by shot of fowler have horror of cannon governor said exultingly a witnessed departure if have few more piece must have fear of result dispersal of canoe continued only until thought that be out of range for although lad now sent several round shot at did not produce effect canoe being small object to hit at distance when on move culverin being old piece little adapted for accurate shooting fleet be soon seen to gather again after little pause started in body a before along coast be going to make landing elsewhere ned said will have to meet in open be pity that have beast of burden to to harness piece for a be only ship gun be impossible for to drag at speed must enable to oppose landing where be native at first alarm large body of islander have assembled upon cliff in excitement of watching approaching enemy movement have not be noticed be now seen that whole of have left spot not single native be in sight think ned said have better fall back take up position near house repel attack with assistance of gun mounted there with musket only must not have much chance of preventing landing indeed will row much faster along coast than must run to keep up with governor agreed in justice of ned view whole force be now ordered to fall back towards castle a proceeded saw large body of native however kept at distance exultant shout showed that must be considered to have gone over to enemy will make pay for governor said stamping foot shaking fist angrily in direction man will have to furnish double amount of spice for amount of calico for next five year ungrateful dog when have done so much for ned must scarcely help smiling to at thought of many benefit portuguese have bestowed upon unfortunate islander whom have reduced from state of happy freedom to one might be called be little short of slavery be late in evening before great number of enemy be seen approaching swelled a be by population of island appeared formidable body indeed by side of handful of white men who be drawn up to defend place enemy numerous a be appeared indisposed to commence fight at once began to fierce indignation of governor to cut down grove of spice tree to build great fire with think that will attack until tomorrow ned said must be well therefore to withdraw within wall to plant sentry to allow men to rest will want strength when battle begin do think governor asked when be seated in room have finished repast have be prepared that will be well to sally out to meet in open thirty white men ought to be able to defeat almost number of naked savage if have horse must say yes ned said because then by speed must make up for lack of number wheeling about must charge through through be so light active in comparison to ourselves that must find difficult if not impossible to bring to hand to hand conflict have indeed advantage of musketoons observed at ternate that many of men have musket sound of firearm must therefore in way alarm with bow arrow can shoot more steadily at short distance than can must be overwhelmed with cloud of missile while unable to bring to bear strength of arm keenness of sword against club rough spear think that must hold house for year against if lost many men in fight outside might go hard with afterwards when morning dawned garrison beheld to dismay that indian have in night erected battery at quarter of mile in front of gate in have placed culverin left on cliff score of small piece carried in war canoe be work of two white men saw at ternate gerald exclaimed indian must have built battery according to fashion a soon a be fairly light enemy fire opened be answered by culverin on roof of house latter be much more quickly better directed than of indian many of ball of latter crashed through great gate will make sortie governor asked ned think that have better wait for nightfall replied in passing across open ground must lose many men from cannon shot with so small force remaining might not be able to resist onrush of so great number let prepare however to prop up gate must fall tonight will silence gun at gate although sorely bruised battered pierced in many place still stood being shored up with beam from behind at ten o'clock twenty of garrison be let down by rope at back of castle for ned thought scout might be lurking near gate to give notice of sortie with great precaution in perfect silence made way round be within hundred yard of battery before approach be discovered then headed by governor who be valiant man by nature four english ran at great speed forward be inside battery before enemy must gather to resist battle be indeed hard one for indian with club fought valorously reuben tom having be furnished with hammer long nail proceeded to spike gun did with great quickness doings being covered alike by friend by darkness when have finished task gave signal portuguese being sorely pressed fell back fighting strongly to castle where gate be opened to receive in sortie lost eight men next morning at dawn native being gathered in large number came on to assault uttering loud fierce cry cannon on roof be under charge of tom reuben at once opened fire upon while soldier upon wall shot briskly with musketoons native however appeared determined to succeed firing cloud of arrow pushed forward towards gate among be borne by thirty native long tree party surrounded by main body proceeded rapidly towards gate damaged a be hoped easily to overthrow fire of two culverin be however so deadly concentrated discharge of musketoons upon a advanced so fatal that after trying several time to approach close to gate native dropped great log fled chapter wholesale conversion that day three followed passed without adventure native be seen ravaging field destroying plantation doing terrible damage to intense exasperation of portuguese governor did not show sign of intention to attack castle believe ned said on fourth day that have determined to starve out must know that however large stock of provision will not last forever indeed will have learned from men who bore in something of amount of stock have will last say for two month must be little enough be not that be expecting ship spoke of if come shortly will with additional force be bringing crew who will doubt aid be able to attack in open be not for position must be bad one fear tom said that even when ship arrives evil may come of how be that tom ned asked captain will know nothing of what be passing on shore if land men incautiously upon beach advance in direction native will fall upon taking by surprise cut to piece last hope will then be gone might sally out effect diversion reuben said yes tom replied unfortunately must not know of arrival of ship until be over be clear to tom view be correct one that position be much more serious than have anticipated for time governor four young men looked at other blankly destruction of reinforcement must be followed doubt by capture of ship by war canoe massacre of on board must indeed be fatal to hope after what have seen of determination with enemy have come up to attack gate be sure that must fight valiantly outside question of sallying forth be again discussed be of opinion unequal a fight must be be better to attempt to defeat enemy than to remain quiet allow to triumph over coming reinforcement upon what day do think ship will arrive ned said after considerable thought can not say to day governor replied must be here week there be exact time because have to touch at several other island leaf goa always on certain day take many week on voyage even if wind be favorable might have be here week since may not be here for fortnight unless something unforeseen have occurred must be here by time for wind be steady in region rate of sailing regular one chance appears to ned said after thinking for time be to give warning of what be happening here how be to be done asked governor only possible plan ned said must be for one of must be ready to accept duty knowing more perhaps of way of native than others to steal forth from castle to make for shore to lie concealed among wood until vessel be in sight if then must find canoe to seize paddle off to ship if not to swim other lad eagerly volunteered to undertake work ned insisted that be better suited to not only from knowledge of native from superior power in swimming may have said to keep up in water for long time perhaps to swim for life if native see be even desirable above thing undertakes work must be good swimmer although have long ago given up calling otter suppose that power in water have diminished after long consultation be agreed that plan offered more chance of success than other must be most desirable gerald said that must have notice here of ship being in sight in order that might sally out lend hand to friend on arrival will therefore if will allow go with ned when ship be in sight will make way back here while go off to vessel will be impossible ned said to make way back here in daytime can steal out at night to return unnoticed must be difficult indeed when see ship ned get on board might warn to delay landing until next morning in night might enter here with news might sally out at daybreak plan appeared to offer more advantage than other be agreed at last that two lad must having darkened skin put on indian dress steal out night from castle make for shore tom reuben regretted much that must not take part in enterprise governor assured that even be desirable that four must undertake mission must not be spared since presence must be greatly needed in castle must native before arrival of ship make attack upon night ned gerald according to arrangement stole out from castle skin have be darkened from head to foot round waist wore short petticoat reaching to knee of native stuff have sandal on foot for a ned said if be seen close by native be sure to be detected in case sandal must not show at short distance while must enable to run at full speed certainly must not do barefooted took with bag of provision carried sword reuben have pressed upon to take pistol also ned said that if cut off detected pistol must be of use a nothing running must carry through while must pistol be fired inadvertently must call such number of assailant upon that escape must be impossible thrust with sword did work silently just a well a pistol bullet native apparently have fear of attempt at sally from castle for there be nothing like watch set round although near entrance few men be stationed to give warning must garrison sally out to make sudden attack upon invader native be for most part scattered about in small party once twice lad nearly fell in with by dint of keeping ear eye open steered through danger arrived safely upon coast at point two mile to west of landing place here cliff have nearly sloped away height being only twenty thirty foot above water being practicable in many case for descent while behind lay large wood in concealment be easy except in case of organized search of have fear whatever next morning made along shore a far a point where native war canoe have be pulled up in hope of finding canoe small enough for ned to use for rowing off to ship none of rowed le than twelve fourteen paddle so cumbrous boat a must be overtaken in very short time must be seen making out from shore ned therefore determined to swim out especially a observed that watch be kept day night near canoe five day passed in concealment coconut afforded food drink occasionally heard boom of culverin at castle knew that native be showing within range a shot be only heard at time be assured that persistent attack be being made be late in afternoon of fifth day that lad observed sail in distance be indeed so far away that a light be fading must not say with absolute certainty that be longed for ship felt convinced however that have seen sail watched intently a night darkened for sign of passage be four hour later when saw passing along at distance of about mile light on ocean must be no other than on board ship now be time ned said will keep along shore under cliff until get nearly to landing will then strike out do make for castle tell that ship have arrived that will attack tomorrow not at daybreak a proposed at noon a ned proceeded on way along shore saw suddenly blaze up far ahead at landing place small bonfire ah muttered to native have seen ship too be following usual custom here of making fire to show where to land trust that will not fall into snare when however have reached within quarter of mile of landing saw small boat come suddenly within range of light two white men step out of be received apparently with much respect by native assembled there at once advanced up road while boat putting off disappeared in darkness will be murdered ned said to before have gone hundred yard native be crafty enough to allow to land without hindrance in order that suspicion might arise among on board ship in stillness of night thought that heard distant cry be not sure that ear have not deceived far out must see faint light knowing that marked place where ship be moored prepared to strike out for be long swim further than have expected for in darkness captain unable to see land have prudently anchored at considerable distance from even however have be several time a far ned must have swum distance without difficulty whole way must not forget that sea swarmed with shark that moment might have to encounter one of hideous monster have left sword behind carried dagger a swam kept eye in direction in order that must not be attacked unprepared ocean be however fortunately at time deserted by beast if be in neighborhood quiet steady noiseless stroke of swimmer did not reach ear a neared ship heart rose sang out blithely ship ahoy hullo be reply where be can not see boat be swimming ned answered throw rope to climb up side have message from governor for captain of ship minute later ned stood upon deck of portuguese vessel soldier sailor looking on wonderingly at body being white face still colored by preparation captain soon appeared be bearer of message to senor from governor ned said be here in hollow reed give few particular believe tell that may place confidence in have detailed instruction from captain split open little reed ned handed to taking out paper coiled within opened by light of lantern read be in very critical position will need at once courage prudence to come out of have sent friend don eduardo english gentleman of repute to warn against danger threatens to advise on further proceeding will give particular captain invited ned to follow to cabin calling in officer asked for explanation of singular visit ned briefly entered into account of landing of native of ternate of present situation captain rejoiced at escape have have from falling into ambuscade must assuredly have done have landed troop in morning a have intended marched inland fearing danger unprepared for attack ned explained that plan be that troop on board ship must land fight way into interior simultaneously garrison must sally out attack native in rear fight way towards other until effected junction must then retire into castle where future plan must be arranged have however ned said ventured to modify plan have sent word to governor that will not attack until noon instead of landing at daybreak a before arranged have be examining position where canoe be lying be hauled up on beach in compact body be in quiet creek whose mouth must sail past without suspecting existence can not say of course depth of water creek be generally deep must think that there must be enough water for ship to float at rate must not like to venture pinnace might row in carrying gun in bow might play havoc among canoe better still if must send two boat load of men there tonight must manage to land destroy portion of canoe launch tow out others think that must have fair chance of getting peace native must be terrified at loss of canoe must be likely to make term must ensure return to island captain at once agreed to proposition three boat of ship be lowered sailor soldier took place only two three being left on board ship a there be fear whatever of attack from shore during night ned took place in leading boat of captain acted a guide coasted along at short distance from land until ned told to cease rowing must said be close to spot now be needful that one boat must go forward find exact entrance to creek rowing very quietly boat in be advanced until within few yard of shore then proceeded quietly along for distance of few hundred yard when black line of shore disappeared streak of water be seen stretching inland quietly rowed back to other two boat three advancing entered creek together before starting officer have be assigned work crew of one of boat consisting principally of soldier be to land to advance short distance inland to repulse attack that native might make upon party be to stave in small canoe done be to assist third boat crew in launching war canoe into water a approached spot be hailed in indian tongue by someone on shore reply be given hail be repeated louder then a boat rowed rapidly up to place where canoe be hauled up shrill yell of alarm be given be re echoed in several direction near must be heard growing fainter fainter a be caught up by men inland moment boat touched shore men leaped out soldier advanced took up position assigned to to defend working party while rest set to vigorously to carry out portion of work war canoe be heavy required effort of whole of crew to launch into water be therefore work of considerable time to get fifteen of afloat long ere have be done native called together by alarm be flocking down in great number be however in entire ignorance a to number of assailant fire soldier opened with arquebus checked in advance feeling sure that canoe be being destroyed filled air with yell of lamentation rage discharging such volley of arrow at random in direction of portuguese that great number of be wounded indeed native pressed on with such audacity that considerable portion of worker have to go forward to assist soldier in holding at bay at last however whole of canoe be in water other boat disabled canoe be tied together five abreast one of boat towed out of harbor while crew of others remained keeping native at bay for be felt that if whole be to embark at once while still encumbered with canoe must be able to get out of creek slowly must for most part be destroyed by arrow of native when boat have towed canoe well out to sea cast adrift returned up creek then covered by musket of soldier others took place in good order regularity until at last be in boat soldier be ordered to stand up to keep up steady fire upon shore while sailor laid to with hearty goodwill native rushed down to shore in great number although many of must have fallen under fire of soldier yet waded into water in anxiety to seize boat poured large number of arrow into when three boat gained open sea there be few indeed of portuguese who have not received wound more le severe by arrow several have be killed in addition to others who have fallen on shore soldier have suffered much le severely than sailor for although have be more hotly engaged breast piece steel cap have protected be principally wounded in limb canoe be now picked up with in tow party returned to ship here wound be dressed by priest who accompanied vessel in voyage landing at different station ministering to garrison of island have knowledge of healing art poured soothing oil into wound inflicted by arrow men be much alarmed lest arrow must be poisoned ned assured that none of who have be wounded during attack on shore have died from effect that although be custom in many of island to use poisoned weapon people of ternate at least did not practice barbarous usage morning be just breaking a party gained ship captain be glad that ned have postponed landing until midday a gave tired men time to rest prepare for fresh labor a soon a shore must be seen be evident that destruction carrying off of canoe have created immense impression cliff be lined with native whose gesticulation a saw canoe fastened to stern of ship be wild vehement little before noon boat be hauled up alongside soldier took place in with loaded arquebus a many sailor a must be spared also entered to assist in advance ship carried several piece of artillery be loaded so a to open fire before landing be effected in order to clear shore of enemy be soon accomplished native who have assembled on beach be seen streaming up road through cliff be most dangerous part that advancing party must have to traverse a must be exposed to heavy fire from standing above on flank must have suffered indeed very severely have not captain turned gun upon mass gathered on high ground by one two lucky shot plumped into middle of created effect that fire of arrow kept up upon troop a advanced be wild confused several of sailor be severely wounded soldier well sheltered by mail pressed on gained level ground blood being fired a went by spectacle of dead body of first officer supercargo who have landed night before here native be assembled in great force a be now out of sight of on board ship gun must no longer render assistance to little party showed good front a mass of enemy approached charged boldly at native however maddened by loss of canoe feeling that only hope be in
