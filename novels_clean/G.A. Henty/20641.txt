have recovered of cheerfulness before start be hard time for lisle for next week two for everything reminded of father risaldar major other native officer with of whom be familiar grasped by hand when met in token of sympathy sepoys stood at attention with mournful face when passed spent heat of day with book only stirred out in early morning evening meal being considerately sent down to from mess at end of fortnight made great effort joined mess kindness with officer spoke to gradually cheered then there came excitement cheered further there be rumour of disaffection among hill tribe chance of campaign be discussed with animation among officer soldier regiment be very fine one composed of sturdy punjabi agreed that if there be expedition must probably form part of lisle entered fully into general feeling eye glistened a listened to sepoys talking of expedition in have taken part must be splendid to go said to see how colonel must take will certainly ask when time come feel sure that will refuse of course ought to be starting before long for calcutta expedition will probably not last many week if be to go with excitement must keep from thinking do lot of good besides few week must make difference in working up for examination more thought of more felt determined to go with column felt sure that must disguise so that one must suspect who be have be so long associated with regiment that talked punjabi a well a english father have now be dead two month a rumour from across frontier grew more more serious be filled with fear lest opportunity must occur to send down country before regiment marched in case plan must be upset day after day passed however without hearing anything about till one day colonel sent for time have come lad when must part will be very sorry to lose can not be helped have received order morning to go up to chitral be sending down sick at once must start with when reach railway will be able to get through ticket to calcutta a long a be likely that must be going down ourselves be glad to keep here now that have got order to go off have talk with tribe in north be clearly impossible for to keep longer be very sorry boy for know like for own sake for good father be awfully obliged to colonel have be very good to since father be killed feel have have right to stop here so long quite understand that now be moving up into hill can not keep suppose must not go a volunteer colonel asked wistfully quite impossible colonel said decidedly even if have be older must not have taken mouth will have to be fed difficulty of transport will be great there be possibility whatever of smuggling lad of age up with besides know that ought to go to england without further delay want to gain commission to do that must pas very stiff examination indeed so for own sake be advisable that must get to work without unnecessary delay party of invalid will be going down tomorrow can go with a far a peshawar there of course will take train to calcutta bombay know that have plenty of fund for journey to england think said that be uncle to whom be going mind impress upon fact that be absolutely necessary that must go to first rate school better still to private crammer if be to have chance of getting into service by competitive examination very well colonel be sure that be very grateful to officer of regiment for kindness have shown especially since father death will always remember be right lisle have be pleasure to have with be sure will be sorry to lose hope that day will meet again when be officer in one of regiment lisle returned to bungalow called butler only servant have retained look here robah colonel say that must go down with sick party tomorrow a have told be determined to go up country with troop of course must be in disguise how do think that have better go man shook head young sahib have better join friend in england be useless to talk about lisle said have told mean to go up go up will there ought to be difficulty about speak three four of frontier language a well a speak english have at least learnt have picked up by talking to native partly from moonshee have have for four year dear father always impressed upon utility of to officer said that if must take up native language in examination must go long way towards making up for other deficiency so be right so far a language be concerned seems to that best plan will be to go up a mule driver be a sahib will old man said servant will do can to help well robah want in first place to get disguise may a well get two suit be sure to get wet sometimes will require change will take couple of own vest drawer to wear under for will probably experience very cold weather in mountain be serving out clothes to carrier sahib yes forgot that well want to go into camp arrange with one of headman to let take place of one of driver of men will be willing enough to get off job tip of forty rupee must completely settle matter with of course will start with sick escort a there will be several waggon going down with will not travel far at first halting place can slip away come back here will be waiting for on road outside camp early in morning take to headman by way will want to make up bottle of stain for hand foot for of course will go in native sandal will do thing sahib how about luggage before leave camp tonight will put fresh label on directing to be taken to store of monsieur parfit who be father agent to be left there until send for will give sergeant who go down with sick money to pay for carriage to calcutta about robah will stay here at bungalow till regiment come up to take place perhaps will give chit saying have be in father service fourteen year that have found faithful useful if can not find employment will go home have saved enough money hour later robah again entered room have be thinking sahib of better plan wish to see fighting do not certainly do well sahib if go in baggage train might be mile away see nothing of now seems to that must be almost a easy for to go a soldier in regiment a in transport train do think so robah lisle exclaimed excitedly think so sahib see know native officer father be great favourite among if be dressed in uniform took place in rank be very unlikely that of english officer must notice matter be left in hand of native officer yesterday young private died who have just passed recruit stage have be only once twice on parade might take name be most unlikely that of white officer will notice that face be fresh one if did ask question native officer must give that name english officer must not be at likely to notice that be name of man who have died death be not uncommon a regiment be just moving matter must receive attention book of man must be handed to must seem regular be splendid idea robah officer do think have better speak to must speak to risaldar gholam singh be chief native officer in father wing of regiment if consent must order native officer under to hold tongue a be favourite with secret must be kept be grand idea certainly see why must not work out properly have doubt that risaldar major will do can for do think so robah be sure will be very much attached to father felt loss a much a anyone indeed think that one of native officer will do can for must make very easy for lisle said till suggested idea of going a soldier never occurred to with assistance will not be difficult will go fetch risaldar here sahib do so will be on thorn until see in few minute officer tall stately punjabi entered risaldar lisle said know be very much attached to father be sahib well want to do something for must be pleasure for to do so have only to ask for to grant if be in power think be in power lisle said will tell what want have made up mind to go with expedition thought of disguising going a baggage coolie in case must be always in rear see none of fighting have made up mind to go a private in rank a private sahib officer exclaimed in astonishment surely must be impossible must be detected at first halt besides how must son of dear captain go a private object to go a private risaldar of course must stain in uniform be not likely that of white officer must notice strange face must have to eat with others to mix with a one of to suffer sort of hardship be nothing lisle said have be with regiment so long that know way of men think must be likely to make mistake must attract attention a to language know perfectly hardly dare do thing sahib if be discovered on march colonel officer must be very angry with even if be discovered need not be known that have assisted risaldar may be sure must never tell if be questioned must declare that have taken for ordinary recruit if deceived everyone else might very well deceive risaldar stood thoughtful for time might possibly be managed said at last must do much for captain bullen son even risk anger of colonel understand that sepoy died yesterday be quite young recruit white officer have not come to know face might say that be relation of be very anxious to take place must take place in rank under name must certainly be good plan if must be carried out must only be asked few question by sepoys of company must seem to natural must take cousin place that a regiment be moving there be time to teach drill must be expected to pick up what must on way indeed have watched regiment so often that think know command movement must go through without hesitation besides there wo be much drilling on march there will probably be good deal of skirmishing perhaps rough fighting if be to be killed sahib what then mean to be killed if can help lisle said if be will be buried a one of sepoys officer will believe have gone home though may wonder little never write to will think be because be too busy will be long time indeed before of friend write to ask about then will be supposed have be accidentally killed drowned at rate must have satisfaction of being killed in queen service men be delighted at going will run same risk a do well sahib risaldar said will do must very much prefer that have never asked can not say 'no ' to will think over tell tomorrow morning what seems to best plan see at present how be to disappear join regiment be easy enough lisle said be going to start tomorrow with sick convoy will slip away from after have gone short distance robah will meet with uniform rifle will come into camp again in uniform after be dark appear to have thought out officer said if scheme can be carried out there must be difficulty after first day two be more likely to pas unnoticed on march than must be if be staying here men will have other thing to think about will only have three men marching with in column to ask question indeed there be very little talking on line of march well will think over see in morning be a good a consent lisle be highly delighted in morning risaldar called again have spoken risaldar said to three officer of company to soldier mutteh ghar belonged agreed willingly to help to carry out scheme think that there be very little probability of fact that be new recruit being noticed general discipline of regiment be in hand british officer direct carry out order a man be only on parade twice on of occasion came under general inspection of white officer be probable that know face be certainly best that must take mutteh ghar name a soldier will see nothing strange in placing young recruit in rank after cousin have died in regiment be of opinion therefore that can take place without difficulty that chance of change being detected by british officer be extremely slight think however that will be next to impossible for always to keep up character believe that will find so hard to live under same condition a others that yourself will tire of can assure that there be fear of lisle said earnestly want to take part in expedition be quite prepared to share in habit hardship of men may be know if be discovered must be sent off at once even if fight be imminent think can say that when undertake thing will carry through can not tell how grateful feel to for aiding to carry out wish will kindly convey thanks to officer of company particularly urge upon that must show favour pay more attention to than to other men anything of sort must certainly give rise to comment suspicion have already told that officer said think thoroughly understand how must act sick party be to start tomorrow morning how do wish uniform of supposed cousin to be sent to if hand over to robah will bring out to rifle of course must be handed quietly to when return to camp can not march in with will not come in till after dark then havildar must take to one of sepoy tent mention to men there that be mutteh ghar cousin that a great favour be to be allowed to accompany regiment of course will take with usual underclothes to put on when lay aside uniform especially loincloth light linen jacket men use in undress will see to that risaldar can assure so far from finding trouble to act a native will really enjoy will make very light of hardship may have to undergo when come to fighting be a know very good shot must certainly be able to do part with credit will tell havildar to be on lookout for when come into camp to bring straight to will then see that uniform belt be properly put on before send off under charge hope matter may turn out well if doe not must remember have done part because urged upon prayed to assist for father sake will never forget that gholam singh will always feel deeply indebted to when risaldar have left lisle called robah in be arranged robah now remains only to carry out detail in first place must get stain in second must go into bazaar buy loincloth light jacket such a soldier wear when lay aside uniform a to uniform be already arranged for will of course have one of sheepskin greatcoat have just be served out expect will find indispensable put in kit bag one pair of thickest woollen vest drawer can not carry more for mean to take one suit of own clothes to put on in case by accident must be discovered sent back can get carried on baggage waggon tomorrow will start at five o'clock in morning at first halt will leave party quietly have doubt that gholam singh will give order to native officer in charge be to be permitted to do so without remark a soon a leave convoy must join with uniform above with stain can bring out bag with provision for day for will not return to camp until after dark when robah went away to make necessary purchase lisle packed up baggage labelled father effect have be sold few day after death a must not have paid to send home have fetched good price have be gladly bought up by other officer a memento of late comrade because be useful several of officer came in chatted with while be packing expressing regret that be leaving at mess that evening drank health pleasant journey gravely returned thanks when mess broke up returned to bungalow packed small canvas bag with suit be going to take with then examined tried on uniform of dead sepoy robah have that evening received from risaldar fitted fairly well in addition to regular uniform there be posteen sheepskin coat loose boot made of soft skin so that foot must be wrapped up in cloth before be put on putty legging consisting of very long strip of cloth terminating with shorter strip of leather thing have be served out day to troop be to be put on over usual leg wrapping when came to snow covered country be to be carried with men kit till required for ordinary wear there be regular boot be strapped on like sandal well think ought to be able to stand anything in way of cold with sheepskin coat legging together with own warm underclothing be sure robah said that understand proper folding of turban think so robah have seen done up hundred of time nevertheless will give lesson when join tomorrow will have plenty of time for now can think of anything else must be useful if so can buy tomorrow before come out to meet sahib there be warm mitten have be served out for mountain work might take pair of own glove to wear under for from hear will want when be standing out night on picket work among hill wo take glove robah with two pair on finger must be so muffled must not be able to do good shooting well will be cold work for be very late in season know goggles have be served out to men to save from snow blindness from must otherwise suffer severely have be on expedition in third of men be quite blind when returned to camp must look very rum to see whole regiment marching in goggles lisle laughed still anything be better than being blinded will see sometimes sahib for major engaged morning to go with a personal servant a own man be in feeble health though be now getting on in year be still strong enough to travel with regiment be delighted indeed to hear that robah will be very glad to steal away sometimes have chat with will be great pleasure to have someone can talk to who know of course native officer in command of company will not be able to show favour must wish to do so seems like keeping one friend while be cut off from others though dare say will make new one among sepoys have doubt will be very comfortable with major yes sahib be sure that be kind master will be able hope sometimes to give small quantity of whisky to mix with water in bottle robah when baggage be cut down there will be very little of taken however much there might be must not accept that have taken from major store must fare just same a others well sahib hope that at rate will carry small flask of under uniform may not want if be wounded lying in snow must be very valuable to for mixed with water in bottle taken from time to time must sustain until must be carried down to camp be very good idea robah will certainly adopt will carry pint about with for emergency such a describe if want may turn out useful to keep up wounded comrade will not add much to load that will have to carry expect will feel when first march a be now think must keep up with best marcher in regiment with weight of clothes pouch hundred twenty round of ammunition rifle will be very different thing will be desperately tired by time get to end of day march now be twelve o'clock time to turn in for march at five next morning when sick convoy started white officer came up to say goodbye to lisle expressed regret that must not accompany regiment butler have gone on ahead a soon a lisle slipped away came up to assisted to make toilet stained from head to foot dyed hair fastened in long bunch of black horse hair must wear in punjabi fashion on top of head with same dye darkened eyelash when have put on uniform said a far a look go sahib be certain that one must suspect that be not native there be large bottle of stain will only have to do over afresh about once in ten day little of mixed with three time amount of water will be sufficient for if be to put on by must make great deal too dark spent day in grove when evening approached returned to camp now goodbye sahib regiment will march tomorrow morning at daybreak may not have opportunity of seeing again before start hope have done right in aiding in desire to accompany expedition have done for best must not blame if harm come of that may be sure will not be greatly obliged to now for present goodbye chapter start havildar be on lookout for lisle when entered camp did not know in changed attire stained face until lad spoke to be well disguised indeed sahib said have idea that be now instruction be to take to gholam singh tent here lisle found risaldar other two native officer saluted a entered risaldar examined carefully before speaking good said did not think that white sahib must ever disguise to pas a native though know that have be done before now certainly have fear of of white officer finding that be not what seem to be be more afraid however of men still even if guessed who be must not be sure betray here be rifle bayonet complete outfit see that have brought kit with be rather more bulky than usual will pas with rest subadar will take down to men line have arranged that will be on baggage guard at first so that will gradually begin to know few men of company will report to rest story tell will soon be received a one of will see that sack of yours go with rest of kit in baggage waggon officer of company understand that be to be treated like rest of men not to be shown favour at same time when in camp if there be anything that desire complaint have to make can talk quietly to one of will report to in case may be sure that will set matter right if possible think there be fear of risaldar be pretty well able to take care of father gave many lesson in boxing fancy that although most of men be great deal bigger stronger than be will be able to hold own hope so bullen havildar said gravely trust that there will be occasion to show skill punjabi be quiet race of men though of course quarrel occasionally occur among generally end in abuse very seldom come to blow greater portion of regiment have be with for year know other well be not given to quarrelling will scarcely even permit junior to go to extreme need not say that officer of company must interfere at once if saw sign of disturbance have have meal cooked hope will eat with be last be likely to be able to enjoy for time will feel honoured if will sit down with excellent repast be served did full justice then officer shook by hand started with subadar for men line with hearty thanks to others when arrived at hut subadar led way in here be new comrade said a of men roused from ground on entrance be cousin of mutteh ghar bear same name seems that have served in regiment for short time be discharged owing to sickness have now perfectly recovered health have come to join cousin who on arrival find to be dead be very anxious to accompany regiment a understands work risaldar have consented to let go instead of remaining behind at depot be of course much affected by loss of cousin hope that will not be worried by question will be on baggage guard tomorrow so will be left alone until recovers somewhat from disappointment grief will see to subadar one of sergeant said mutteh ghar be nice young fellow will welcome cousin among if be at like thank sergeant be sure will like when come to know for be well spoken young fellow hope that will make a good soldier good night so saying turned left tent hour later lisle be on parade

that will take cousin place slept in same hut a will soon find at home with introduced lisle to other occupant of hut eighteen in number lisle then proceeded to follow example of others by taking off

fire be burning lisle followed example of comrade took lota formed part of equipment filled with water put in ash adding a soon a boiled handful of rice ghee tiny portion of meat in hour meal be cooked taking from fire sat down in place apart a be usual among native troop who generally have objection to eat before others who have money comrade said can buy herb condiment of little trader greatly improve mess lisle knew well have few pice said must be careful till get pay a soon a night fell turned in a be to start at daylight here be room for at side comrade sergeant said have better

be aroused by sound of bugle men told off to baggage guard will at once proceed to pack waggon sergeant said lisle at once got up put on uniform a did three other men in tent kit baggage have already be packed night before men of guard consisting of half company proceeded to waggon hour afterwards bugle roused remainder of regiment soon fell in be broad daylight when started baggage followed little later havildar who be in charge of be fortunately one of of lisle company there be little talk at hurried start two men accompanied of twelve company waggon remainder marched in front others behind lisle have be told off to first waggon be long march two ordinary stage being done in one a animal be fresh transport arrived at camping ground within hour of main column accustomed though be to exercise lisle found weight of rifle pouch ammunition tell terribly upon be not used to boot before journey be completed began to limp havildar noticing ordered to take place on top of baggage on waggon be natural that must feel at first mutteh ghar said will find easy enough to keep up with after few day rest lisle be thankful indeed for have begun to feel that must never be able to hold on to end of march remained on baggage for couple of hour then again took place by side of waggon receiving approving nod from havildar a did so when halt be called men at once crowded round waggon kit be distributed in few minute regiment have appearance of concourse of peaceable peasant tent have be taken with waterproof sheet have be provided with little shelter have be erected accommodating three men sergeant told lisle off to share one of shelter with two other men party meanwhile have gone to collect firewood in hour men be cooking rice well how did like march one of said to lisle found very hard work lisle said havildar let ride on top of one of waggon for couple of hour after be able to march in with rest be rough march for recruit other said will soon get used to grease foot well before put on bandage will find that will ease very much that will not get sore foot a must if marched without preparation lisle took advice devoted portion of ration for purpose last thing at night found that abated heat in foot be able to get about in comfort soldier carried little cooking pot although regiment be composed principally of punjabi many of men be of different nationality although punjabi be much le particular about caste than people of southern india man prepared meal separately ration consisted of rice ghee little curry powder portion of mutton from lisle managed to concoct savoury mess a have often watched men cooking meal sergeant have evidently chosen two good men to share tent with lisle be old soldier not given to much talking be kind to young comrade giving hint about cooking making comfortable abstaining from asking many question be easily satisfied with answer after meal be eaten sat down with talked of coming campaign of have ever be to chitral knew by hearsay nature of road discussed probability of point at serious opposition must begin agreeing that difficulty of crossing pass now that must be covered with snow must be far greater than stand tribesman might make be tough fighter doubt one of said will have more difficulty with than have ever have before for say that great many of be armed with good rifle will therefore be able to annoy at distance when old matchlock must have be useless be good shot too there be doubt about quite a good a be must say there will be tremendous lot of flanking work to keep at distance when come to anything like regular fighting will sweep before from what hear however will only have three four gun with be pity for though tribesman can stand against heavy rifle fire have profound respect for gun expect therefore that will have stiff fighting how do like prospect mutteh ghar suppose will mind when get accustomed to lisle said be because heard that regiment be about to advance hurried up to join think must have enlisted have be going to stay in cantonment be right spirit other said approvingly be same with of there be difficulty in getting recruit when there be fighting to be done be dull life in camp that prevents men from joining have enlisted twice a many men in past three month a in three year before so talked till night fell then turned in putting lisle between that being warmest position in morning march be resumed in same order lisle again taking place with baggage guard march time be only single one be long nevertheless lisle be able to keep place till end feeling great benefit from ghee have rubbed on foot havildar at starting said few cheering word to told that when felt tired must put rifle pouch in waggon a there be possibility of being wanted two comrade when heard that have accomplished march without falling out praised highly have showed good courage in holding on one of said march be nothing to seasoned men must have be trying to especially a foot can not have recovered from yesterday see that will make good soldier one who will not shirk work week will march a well a best of hope so lisle said have always be considered good walker a soon a get accustomed to weight of rifle pouch have doubt that will get on well enough be sure will other said cordially think be a good marcher a in india certainly have reputation doubt be for reason be chosen for expedition although there be several other regiment nearer to spot from what hear colonel kelly will be commanding officer of column must not wish for better hear that there be column much stronger one going from peshawar will put on mettle will warrant that will be first to arrive there not only because be good marcher because larger column more trouble have with baggage baggage be curse of expedition have to be considered be not how far troop can go how far baggage animal can keep up with of animal be doubt good many of be altogether unfitted for work when break down block whole line often even if march be short one be very late at night before last of baggage come in mean that get kit blanket food think lucky if get next morning government be think much to blame in matter instead of procuring strong animal paying fair price for buy animal be not fit to do one good day march of course in end stinginess cost more in money life than if have provided suitable animal at outset lisle have have great deal of practice with rifle have carried away several prize shot for by officer be unaccustomed to carry one for so many hour felt grateful indeed when halt be sounded fire be lighted food cooked then lay down sat in group in shade of grove sense of strangeness of condition have begun to wear off laughed talked with others without restraint up to time when joined

at home with company by time reached gupis have become general favourite at end of day when meal have be cooked eaten must join in song round fire a have picked up several have heard sing have fair voice be often called upon for contribution vivacity good spirit surprised sepoys who a whole be grave men though bore hardship uncomplainingly have soon got over feeling of discomfort of going about with naked leg be a glad a soldier to lay aside uniform get into native attire sepoys have now regular ration of meat be always mutton a beef be unobtainable be much relished by men who cut up into slice broiled over fire not for one moment did lisle regret step have taken young active thoroughly enjoyed life looked forward eagerly to time when must meet enemy for doubt be now felt that must meet with desperate resistance on march to chitral fear be entertained however that when got there must find that garrison have be overpowered for be certain that against force chief attack of enemy must be directed overthrow of ross party showed that enemy be sturdy fighter be known to be armed with breech loading rifle of a good quality a carried by troop in open field felt that however numerous tribesman might be must stand chance pass afforded immense advantage rendered drill discipline of little avail chapter first fight yet though kept up cheerful appearance lisle heart be often very heavy sight of british officer continually recalled father to memory short time back have be with now be gone for ever at time seemed almost impossible that must be so have be constant companion when off duty have devoted much time to helping forward in study have never so far a must remember spoken harsh word to seemed like dream last hour have passed by father bedside many time lay awake in night face wet with tear with reveille must be up laughing joking with soldier raising smile even on face of gravest have taken very short time to make at home in regiment men sometimes looked at with surprise be so different from bore hardship well be with stern face grim determination while young soldier made joke of sometimes be questioned closely always turned question off with laugh have learned place where supposed cousin came from while sticking to said that good fairy must have presided over birth information be much more gravely received than given for native have superstition believe a firmly a inhabitant of british island did two three hundred year ago in existence of supernatural being good bad if have be blessed by fairy one of elder men suggested doubtless will go through campaign without harm be very powerful of good people can bestow long life a well a other gift know whether will do that certainly gave high spirit used to believe that what mother said happened to night after be born be not true only dream solemnly declared that be not have always be famous for good spirit may have be right after there be nothing lisle liked better than being on night picket duty other men shirked to there be something delightful to stand there almost alone rifle in hand watching expanse of snow for moving figure there be charm in dead silence liked to think quietly of past somehow must do so far better while engaged on duty than when lying awake in little tent expanse stillness calmed agreed far more with mood than camp sight be keen even when thought be farthest away three time sent bullet through lurking pathan who be crawling up towards astonishing comrade by accuracy of aim suppose said when congratulated upon third occasion on have laid one of enemy low that good fairy must have given quick eye a well a good spirit be indeed extraordinary that young recruit must not only make out man whom none of saw that must time fetch down at distance of three four hundred yard used to practice with father rifle said be very fond of shikari often went out with need keener sight to put bullet between eye of tiger than to hit lurking pathan so noted did become for accuracy of aim that one of native officer asked privately if must like to be always put on night duty must like other night said by resting alternate night by snatching couple of hour sleep before going on duty when arrive at end of day march in good time can manage very well will arrange that for officer said certainly one must grudge duty one night when there have be little opposition during day lisle be posted on hill where picket consisted of ten men five of whom be on crest while other five lay down in snow day have be hard one lisle be le watchful than usual seemed to that have not closed eye for minute a leant on rifle must have be much longer for suddenly started with feeling that something be wrong saw number of dark figure advancing along crest towards at once fired shot fell back upon next sentry dropping behind rock answered fire enemy have already opened upon whole picket quickly gathered for time checked advance of enemy be too numerous to be kept at distance party of pressed forward on flank must retire till can find better shelter sub officer in command said will soon have reinforcement up from camp when be seen that be seriously engaged fall back men steadily take advantage of bit of cover keep a well together a possible without risk firing steadily made way down hill finally took up position among clump of rock two have be shot dead two others be wounded be because must not be left behind that stand be made two wounded men though partially disabled unable to crawl must still use rifle little party kept up so hot fire though enemy be massed from twenty to thirty yard away must not be brought to unite in general attack not even by shout yell of comrade behind furious beating of tom tom illustration lisle give alarm defender be lying down of having chosen position where must see through crevice between rock lisle be lying next to sergeant presently latter gave exclamation fired rifle shifted position behind rock mutteh ghar said have seen bring down three of skulking ruffian do see two there close together about forty yard away there be man behind who have just carried off two of finger keep eye on rock just above where touch other there be opening through can see snow behind be where fired from oblige by putting ball in head when raise couple of minute passed lisle be lying with rifle on spot presently opening be obscured fired at once thank sergeant said got sure enough head did not disappear to one side to other went straight back fancy that must have hit between eye presently enemy fire became still more furious several time of rose ran two pace forward only to fall prone under defender fire expect see help coming up lisle said be making last effort to wipe out before arrive think will try rush continued in louder voice see that magazine be filled up lad waste shot if come at minute later there be shrill prolonged cry at once twenty dark figure burst from shelter rushed forward defender also sprang to foot rifle flashed out with stream of fire vacancy thus caused in enemy rank be immediately filled now with bayonet sergeant shouted keep in close body do two wounded men cover with constant fire then with cheer six men sergeant rushed forward much a afridis feared bayonet confident in strength withstood charge have fortunately emptied rifle before rushing forward drawing knife fought fiercely however be match for bayonet consequently suffered heavily three of pioneer received severe gash group be brought to standstill stood in little circle while attack continued one sepoy be stabbed to heart by fanatic who rushed at bayonet pushing along fell dead a struck fatal blow thing be looking very bad scarce one have escaped without wound sergeant have dropped bleeding profusely when to delight volley burst from within fifty yard of in instant assailant turned bolted after sergeant have dropped lisle have somehow taken place cheering men on lending aid to most severely pressed once twice managed after despatching assailant to slip couple of cartridge into rifle so added to execution indeed be in small account due to exertion after sergeant fell that resistance be maintained minute later active little ghoorkhas rushed forward who first arrived passed little knot of defender with cheer set off in pursuit of enemy presently however one of officer came up have have stiff fight lad said by look of ground round about must have defended yourselves gallantly for there be dozen dead body lying near can see many more little way up hill have be loss sergeant raised on elbow have two killed a came down said two others wounded believe one have fallen here think most of be wounded with knife thrust well have done splendidly sergeant will detach men to help to carry wounded men down to camp others can accompany will take up work now be afraid sha' have fighting though may shoot down few a make off fancy however that lesson have given beggar have taken fight out of when down hill met party of pioneer coming out ghoorkhas at once handed wounded over to started up hill again sergeant have fainted from loss of blood question be asked till injured men be placed in little hospital tent wound attended to two of have bullet wound three have received knife wound on shoulder arm only lisle one other escaped unhurt a soon a wound have be attended to except sergeant two more seriously wounded than others be sent off to tent one of be lisle tent fellow said mutteh ghar know what to say to seem lad light hearted one have proved best of be lying next to will swear that brought down eight of with rifle before charged even while be fighting always heard voice like trumpet after sergeant have fallen seemed to take command a if be right saved life when bayoneted two of three who be grappling with seemed to be everywhere did what little must lisle said certainly did not intend to take command when sergeant fell somehow must not help shouting a circle have closed in so slipped out of place fought wherever pressure be greatest there be doubt soldier said seriously that mother statement be true one that fairy did promise to look after out of eleven of only one besides have escaped without wound yet none of exposed more than did will not forget that owe life to must find other name for ca be called 'the boy ' longer in morning one of colonel orderly be told to fetch colonel wish to see mutteh ghar lisle put on uniform with uneasiness be conscious that in excitement of fight of night before have frequently shouted in english feared that sergeant have reported however marched to spot where colonel group of officer be standing then stood at attention mutteh ghar colonel said sergeant morning made report state that though men behaved admirably distinguished in singular manner say that before final attack began have killed eight ten of pathan that be fighting beside when be wounded that then seemed to take command although lying on ground be able to see what be going on say that for cheer for manner in went to assistance of men hard pressed be convinced that whole detachment must have be killed before ghoorkhas arrived have idea of assuming command sir tongue always run fast dare say did shout almost unconsciously think sergeant have made more of doings than deserved think likely be small thing for so young soldier to so distinguish sergeant will not be able to resume duty for time therefore appoint corporal will put name in order today for very distinguished service how long be since joined regiment short time before marched well have done honour to corp in name of myself officer thank lisle saluted returned to line colonel have made corporal answered a others gathered round questioned cheer burst from for tent companion other men who have returned have spoken in highest term of conduct lisle be quite confused by heartiness of reception be wonderfully young fellow colonel said a left sergeant said that be young really look little more than boy curiously face reminds of someone though can not say whom yet if only joined short time before marched be not likely that must have noticed before be same thing with colonel major said have noticed several time on march while rest of regiment be plodding on in silence always seemed centre of merry group have often said to myself wished have few more men in regiment who must take hardship have to undergo a lightly a merrily a doe face have also struck a being somehow familiar be speaking to sergeant about said that be most popular man in company general favourite temperament be altogether different from of majority of soldier be earnest quiet two three of other officer also spoke of noticing cheerful influence seemed to have on men must have talk with colonel said after campaign be over find out something about be quite evident that pluck be a great a cheerfulness be certainly very extraordinary that young recently joined soldier must have influence with men many year older than if be not mistaken will find in rank of native officer before long considering age what have already done may well hope day if escape being killed to be risaldar major of regiment must almost fancy that must be son of native of good family without influence to secure post a officer that have run away to endeavour to fight way up to commission henceforth lisle stood in high regard among comrade be known a 'fighting boy ' in regiment be always ready to answer to name by be addressed have desire to push forward to prominence among of thinking way above comrade naturally be pleased at finding generally liked have come to see fighting take part in have thought of distinguishing especially a intended to leave regiment a soon a campaign be over carry out plan father have formed for feared to excite jealousy of comrade though there be sign of felt that promotion caused difference in manner of other men towards be so marked indeed that must not help thinking that men by whose side have fought have reported to comrade that in heat of fight have several time shouted in english that there be general suspicion a to identity a long a be not communicated to officer did not matter indeed be not likely for if feeling be noticed by native officer must soon come to ear of gholam singh who must at once order men to keep silence concerning gradually nickname changed became known among sepoys of regiment a young sahib protested against in vain be not however without advantage at end of long march men who have brought in firewood always handed men must offer to clean rifle cook dinner do other little office for must however never accept kind offer why do call sahib one of english officer asked when heard so addressed know answered be silly joke of men have protested against without success if chose to call 'colonel must not help suppose be because see that be like white officer always cheerful good tempered there be certainly no other reason that know of regiment have taken to call mutteh ghar young sahib ' officer reported at mess that day asked about say doubt be because be like always good tempered cheerful be certainly very unlike others major said have doubt men consider great compliment to to call so do know colonel one of subaltern said idea have struck that may be young bullen who may have joined regiment surreptitiously instead of going down to calcutta there be silence among others can hardly be that macdonald colonel said though be certainly curious that seemed to feel that knew face when came up before young scamp must never have played audacious trick upon know colonel major said be just sort of lad must try such scheme know have twice seen talking with butler who be a know captain bullen servant well may possibly be so colonel said at rate be only suspicion have better leave matter a stand if be young bullen know that have done bad thing for if go on a have begun experience will go long way towards getting commission will be great deal better off than if be grinding up for two year in england strong recommendation a must give must be of great value to moreover have claim on ground that father be killed on service at rate must take action whatever at present be slight thing have done be if be few of must care to go through campaign a sepoys work be terribly hard poor fellow to say nothing of unpleasantness of having to live among native certainly will consider that have well earned commission if come through campaign be too young for one major said must not think necessary to mention age in recommending colonel said know that be doing man work manfully have earned a say general liking of men be deal better fitted for commission than fellow send out to well may be mistaken may only be brave young fellow of good ancestry so will think more of at present will wait to see how thing turn out before showing sign of suspicion now however that idea have be mooted officer a went up down line looked closer at lisle than have hitherto done agreed that in spite of uniform colour be captain bullen son ignorant of suspicion lisle carried out work a usual a sub officer shared shelter tent of men performed duty regularly still carried rifle indeed if have not be rule must not have accepted promotion a preferred fighting with weapon to be accustomed work during day be little changed when regiment be marching in column four abreast have appointed place by side of when arrived in camp be part of duty to see that little tent be pitched ration distributed kit handed over men made a comfortable a possible sub officer be obeyed with greater alacrity when returned from picket in early morning always found ration ready cooked for be impossible for to help feeling pleased at sign of liking of men redoubled effort to cheer on line of march to aid men who seemed unable to climb up through snow by carrying rifle ammunition pouch for have long since grown accustomed to carrying weight be able to keep up with most seasoned marcher on two three occasion gholam singh be able to report favourably of conduct in thus relieving men of arm colonel always took communication in ordinary way there be doubt said when conversation turned on subject that gholam singh must have be accessory to young bullen plot have be looking up list of deceased sepoys find that recruit of same name died two day before marched in way young bullen if be really boy contrived to take dead man place name must have be very well done without of knowing none of be familiar with dead man appearance gholam singh of other native officer must have arranged that must take place if have be case will of course be obliged to speak sharply to risaldar major in reality will not be very angry with for will certainly have done young bullen good turn be sure be bullen one of officer said for when came up suddenly behind today heard whistling english tune of course may have be played by band when be in camp whistling be not common punjabi accomplishment know that ever heard native boy whistle before stopped directly came up must make mistake about tune for hung behind little be amused at seeing men marching by trying to keep step while be over knee in snow caught grin on face at failure though looked a grave a usual when saw well must let thing go on a be colonel said until get to chitral then will have up get to bottom of affair if turn out to be bullen must at once leave rank join again will then have to ask for commission for give temporary rank a junior lieutenant until answer to recommendation arrives even if be not bullen may be unlikely a seems other englishman in case must not allow englishman to be in rank think there be doubt about colonel major said have have good look at several time must almost swear to identity well a be got up lisle pursued regular course of work in happy unconsciousness that suspicion a to identity entered mind of officer spirit be now not forced fatiguing march night picket pressure of duty so occupied thought that have little time to dwell upon loss be now three month since father have died yet seemed to in far distance so much have happened since occasionally thought with disgust when be over must return to england to uncle have never seen become schoolboy spending day in study perhaps in end fail to pas examination must be stranger amongst stranger must not expect that uncle must feel particular interest in lad have never before seen drew picture to of long friendless interval before even at best must again don uniform upon such thought did not allow to dwell have to be done must supposed get through right might find friend among fellow at same crammer at rate three year must soon pas must make best of suppose crammer will be in london said everything there will be new to doubt will find very interesting say that be immense place to even biggest indian city be mere trifle will be curious to see everyone in dark clothes with none of gay colouring of india father often said that pleasantest time of life be year spent in england while be cramming for exam there be theatre sort of other place of amusement have best of companion after have finished work be at liberty to do pretty nearly whatever liked think will get uncle to send to same crammer a father went to if be still alive put down address once in pocketbook will be able to find again when get down to calcutta recover trap well need not worry by thinking of now will come day dare say will find pleasant enough when once get accustomed to such thought often passed through mind at night for during day have not minute to be almost sure now that men have discovered identity by many little mark of kindness have shown by manner in fellow sub officer always spoke to with certain air of respect however did not worry felt certain that must keep secret at end of campaign must of course disclose obtain discharge until then one must have time to think much of matter still le find opportunity of reporting to colonel kelly wondered how colonel must take when went up to say who be did not think must be very seriously angry though probably must wig sharply at rate have not done badly have brought no discredit to regiment have unconsciously adopted regimental belief that be lucky man must get through campaign unhurt be particularly anxious that must do so a be confined in hospital for few day must have opportunity of renewing stain in case must undoubtedly be detected have advanced so far now however that even if be discovered must hardly send back before got to chitral might of course be detained at reshun must be horrible nuisance one night camp mate said to ought to be with officer bullen sahib be not right for to be working a do why do call bullen sahib pertusal everyone know sahib little by little nave found out have suspicion from first now be sure of only father son must have fought a did on hill when came to look very closely at recognized in spite of dye then wish have fought quite so hard pertusal for have hoped that have escaped recognition thought must have gone through campaign without anyone suspecting who be did not suspect at first sahib quite took for one of cheerfulness with bore hardship readiness to assist anyone surprised be so different from that must not help wondering who be think of really suspected that be captain bullen son till fight know that when be busy fighting sorely pushed a be wondered when heard shout in english have heard call out so often when be playing cricket with officer recognized voice at once then wonder that felt about ceased seemed for moment impossible for have seen go off with sick convoy then seemed to that be just thing captain bullen son might be expected to do must naturally want to see fighting did wonder how managed to come back get enlisted into regiment remember now that wondered little first night joined be in uniform a rule recruit go into uniform for time after have joined be therefore remarkable that must turn up in uniform rifle be uniform of original mutteh ghar lisle said servant have managed to get story be man cousin be therefore permitted to take place be natural enough to pas of officer must have helped sahib well wo say anything about did manage to join in way wanted comrade be very kind to that be natural enough sahib be young recruit understood that be put with two old soldier in order that might teach duty be not long however before found that there be very little teaching necessary for at end of week knew work a well a man in regiment thought wonder kept thought to ourselves now that know who be regiment be proud that father son have come among shared lot down to smallest detail noticed that be rather clumsy with cooking even in respect soon learned how thing must be done suppose sahib will lose at end of campaign yes will have to start for england at once for in order to gain commission must study hard for two three year of course will then have to declare to officer in order to get discharge be afraid that colonel will be very angry can not help that be quite sure however that will let go a soon a know who be will be rather fun to see surprise of officer think colonel will be angry sahib might have be if have not done so well a be can not be pleased captain bullen son must have so distinguished even in nd pioneer who have reputation of being one of best fighting regiment in india well hope so pertusal at rate be extremely glad came have seen what fighting be that under most severe condition have proved to myself that can bear hardship without flinching will certainly be proud life have be one in column for relief of chitral be to say if be first will be first soldier said positively be hard work enough getting baggage over pass will be harder still for peshawar force encumbered with train a will have to take with ah sahib if only food be so condensed that must carry supply for twelve day about must not be able to do must rout fiercest tribe on frontier without difficulty must march about fifteen twenty mile day more than if necessary must do wonder indeed be afraid will never discover lisle said german soldier do indeed carry condensed meat in sausage can take three four day supply with have not yet discovered anything like food of men must carry twelve day supply may day be able to do even if weighed pound day must add heavily to load to be carried one must mind that pertusal said think what comfort must be if must make breakfast before starting eat little in middle of day be sure of supper directly got into camp instead of having to wait hour hour perhaps till next morning before baggage train arrived must willingly carry double present load if felt sure must gain that advantage know that officer have tin of condensed milk one of can make more than gallon that carry cocoa other thing of little go long way now if must condense rice ghee like must be able to carry be necessary with for twelve day mutton must always get on campaign for enemy flock be at disposal must be bare place indeed where must not find enough meat to keep going be against religion to eat beef few of must hesitate to do so on campaign ox be even more common than sheep be very little baggage must have to take with then twenty pony must carry sufficient for regiment if government did buy good mule must always rely upon getting into camp before dark see what advantage must be ten men must do for escort whereas at present hundred be not sufficient well wish must be so lisle said although article of food might be compressed think must ever be able to compress rice ghee handful of rice when be boiled make enough for meal imagine that must possibly be condensed more than well be getting late march at daylight fortunately have not to undress have only to turn in a be chapter in pass march after leaving dahimol be short one here be met by governor of upper part of valley gave very useful detail of state of party in chitral of road must have to follow accompanied force on next day march billeted troop in village for be thankful enough for be now getting pretty high up in hill night be decidedly cold be now crossing serious pas have reached snow line troop put on goggles have brought with to protect eye from dazzling glare of snow at two o'clock reached post at ghizr be held by body of kashmir sapper miner place have be fortified surrounded by strong zereba troop be billeted in neighbouring house halted for day in order to allow second detachment of pioneer gun to come up here also be joined by hundred men of native levy when prepared for start next morning found that hundred of cooly have bolted during night two officer be despatched to find fetch back fifty be fortunately discovered in village not far off with country pony force started passed up valley came upon narrow plain here snow be waist deep men be forced to move in single file leader changing place hundred yard so at last came to stop gun mule sank to girth in snow even then be unable to obtain footing men be sent out to try depth of snow on side of valley found improvement obviously be absolutely impossible for mule pony to get farther over snow in present state be already three o'clock in afternoon only eight mile have be covered force therefore retired to last village in valley two hundred pioneer under borradaile sapper hunza levy be left here with coolie transport borradaile order be to force way across pas next

to right rear of enemy position main body be to move forward at nine o'clock beynon encountered enormous difficulty in many place men have to go on four to get along succeeded however in driving off enemy who occupied number of sangars on hill who must have greatly harassed main body by rolling down rock upon enemy principal position consisted of sangars blocking road to river up to fan shaped alluvial piece of ground road led across ground to foot of steep shoot within five hundred yard of sangars on opposite side of river a be totally devoid of sort of shelter must be swept by avalanche of stone by few men placed on height for purpose when troop arrived within eight hundred yard volley firing be opened gun threw shell on sangar on extreme right of enemy position enemy be soon seen leaving fire be then directed on next place with same result meanwhile beynon have driven down of enemy who be posted on hill general panic set in gun pouring shrapnel into until be beyond range action be over in hour after firing of first shot loss on side be only one man severely three slightly wounded after short rest force again proceeded halted at small village mile half in advance ford be found column again started presently met portion of garrison who finding besieging force moving away came out to see reason in meantime baggage column be being fiercely attacked officer rode up with order that th company be to go back to assistance company be standing in reserve eager to go forward to join in fight without delay now went off at double be badly wanted baggage be struggling up last kotal that troop have passed rear guard be engaged in fierce fight with great number of enemy of whom be posted on rise while others came down so boldly that struggle be sometimes hand to hand when th company reached scene be at once scattered along line of baggage for time enemy fell back seeing that reinforcement be not strong one be emboldened to attack again assault be repulsed with loss column suffered severely from fire on height must stop here officer in command said will not get baggage through before then must have pretty well at mercy punjabi must go up clear enemy off hill till baggage have got through punjabi be soon gathered led by english officer advanced up hill at running pace until came to point so precipitous that be sheltered from enemy fire here be halted for couple of minute to gain breath then order be given to climb precipitous hill be seventy foot high be desperate work for there be point so steep that men be obliged to help other up happily be in shelter until got to within twenty foot of summit intervening distance being steep slope at point waited until whole party have come up then with cheer dashed up slope effect be instantaneous enemy though outnumbering by five to one must not for moment withstand line of glittering bayonet fled precipitately receiving volley after volley from pioneer a situation be commanded by still higher slope men be at once ordered to form breastwork from stone be lying about thickly after quarter of hour severe work be raised to height of three foot be sufficient to enable men to lie down in safety by time work be done enemy be again firing heavily at distance of four hundred yard bullet pattering against stone punjabi however did not return fire turning round directed attention to enemy on other side of valley who be also in considerable force illustration carefully aimed fired here officer said to lisle do think can pick off fellow in white burnoose be evidently important leader be through effort that enemy continues to make such fierce attack will try sir lisle replied in punjabi take that range must be from nine hundred to thousand yard be long distance for shot at single man lying down at full length carefully aimed fired officer be watching through field glass be good shot said missed man killed fellow closely following lower back sight trifle try again next shot also missed third be correctly aimed pathan dropped to ground of men at once carried off body fall created much dismay a at moment whole of punjabi began to pepper follower with volley firing lost heart quickly retired up hill put up sight to twelve hundred yard officer said must drive higher up if can for do a much harm firing from there a must lower down fire independently hurry take good aim be fine shot of yours mutteh ghar said to lisle by whose side be still standing for have gone so far down slope that be sheltered from fire behind for fall baggage guard must have have to fight hard for be evidently inciting men to make combined rush fall however took steam out of altogether how came to be such good shot father be fond of shooting lisle said used often to go out with well benefited by teaching anyhow officer said doubt if there be man in regiment who must have picked off fellow at distance in three shot have really be turning point of day see baggage be moving on again in hour will be through now lad turn attention to fellow on hill behind a have not be firing at for time will probably think be short of ammunition let show that pouch be still pretty full must drive farther away for if will get hot when go down to join rear guard begin with volley then continue with independent firing at four hundred yard tribesman be standing up against skyline now be careful at distance everyone ought to bring down man although be not accomplished number of men be seen to fall rest retired out of sight presently head appeared a more resolute crawled back to edge of crest regular duel now ensued four hundred yard be short range with martini rifle be not long before punjabi proved that be at least a good shot a tribesman have advantage too of breastwork behind to load have only to lift head to fire whereas pathan be obliged to load a lay presently firing ceased many black head dotting edge of crest testified to accurate aim of troop tribesman seeing that friend on other side of valley have withdrawn finding that own fire did not avail to drive assailant back have at last moved off for hour pioneer lay watching progress of baggage when last animal be seen to pas retired taking up position behind rear guard column arrived in camp just a night fell that young bullen can shoot officer who commanded company said that evening a officer gathered round fire when a told have driven off fellow on right of valley thing be looking bad on left where chief in white burnoose be working up strong force to make rush put young bullen on to pick off range be about nine hundred fifty yard first shot went behind chief did not see where next shot struck have doubt be close to anyhow third rolled over call that splendid shooting especially a be from height make much more difficult to judge distance chief fall took pluck out of tribesman a opened upon in volley soon went to right about peppered way up hill a must see from glass killed good many of however took fight out of made fresh attempt to harass column young fellow be first rate shot colonel said if remember carried off several prize certainly shot better than most of though there be one two of men who be match did not speak to in english hope villiers colonel said that be to go on a if did not know till reached chitral of course spoke to in punjabi one thing be certain if have not brought down chief enemy must have be among baggage in minute two so shot be really turning point of fight will make present of twenty rupee in morning colonel said be what must have given to sepoy who made so useful shot will be rather fun to see how take will see will take without winking major said will know very well that hesitation must be noticed will take a calmly a if be native accordingly next morning a regiment fell in colonel called lisle out from rank mutteh ghar said lieutenant villiers report that did great service yesterday in picking off leader of pathan who be attacking column from left here be twenty rupee a token of satisfaction lisle did not hesitate for moment took off turban held out for colonel to drop money into murmuring thanks a did so then put on turban again saluted retired told must not hesitate colonel major laughed young beggar be a cool a cucumber doubt if must catch napping however much tried be fine young fellow major will make splendid officer will be disappointed indeed if fail to get commission think be likely to fail colonel young fellow have really distinguished greatly even without that fact that enlisted to go through campaign took share with troop in fighting hardship must show that really deserved commission even putting aside fact of father death must be thousand pity if such promising young fellow must have to waste next three year of life cramming up classic mathematics must be like putting young thoroughbred into cart be so colonel said there be answering for war office saying what view may take of given subject however if get first to chitral a feel sure will do suppose will be in high favour wo like to refuse so small request backed a be by fact of case at half past five force marched into mastuj found garrison comfortably settled there well fed fort be square building with tower at corner at gateway late in evening baggage came in enemy have made no serious attack upon place moberley who be in command have even be able to send force to buni whence brought off jones survivor of ross force next day fatigue party be sent out to destroy enemy sangars on same day remaining half of pioneer came up day be spent by in fort

maidan found that be gentle grassy slope levy be in advance with two company in firing line two in support kashmir company in reserve in order pushed on until came under fire of sangars stewart brought gun into action after time fire of levy drove enemy from nearest sangar while three of pioneer company paid attention to sangar beynon be sent on to find way down into valley found path leading to nullah drop from edge be sheer for seventy foot then came ledge from thought must scramble down to edge of stream thence to opposite side where noticed track with information went back to report to colonel kelly sapper be brought up also reserve company of kashmir troop when beynon got back to nullah found pioneer extended along edge oldham sapper already at work aided by rope scaling

rifle be sent out to make reconnaissance be accompanied by captain townshend baird by surgeon captain whitchurch lieutenant gurdon rest be left in bazaar to hold road enemy one hundred fifty strong be seen on bare spur form right bank of ravine to test whether not be hostile single shot be fired over at once opened heavy fire on party at same time captain townshend became engaged with of enemy who be in hiding among rock evidently in considerable strength be subsequently discovered that very shortly after captain campbell party left fort before hostility began enemy have opened fire on fort have crossed river captain baird now advanced across mouth of ravine charged up spur enemy retreating before firing a went captain baird fell mortally wounded lieutenant gurdon who have carried message to be left in command enemy descended into ravine crossing to left bank took gurdon in rear in meantime affair have not be going well with captain townshend party have advanced within two hundred yard of hamlet keeping men a well a must under shelter firing in volley enemy however kept on advancing overlapping force on flank be well armed skilful marksman took shelter in such marvellous way that there be nothing for men to fire at except few puff of smoke captain campbell then ordered charge with bayonet to clear hamlet be gallantly led by captain townshend two native officer ground being perfectly open fire of enemy being steady continuous two native officer four sepoys be killed at once when got within forty yard of village be concealed in grove of tree found that be large place with wall three hundred foot in length behind enemy be posted in perfect cover there be nothing for to retreat captain campbell be at moment shot in knee captain townshend assumed command captain campbell be carried to rear force retired in alternate party retreat however be conducted slowly deliberately though enemy who came running out soon overlapped little column even getting behind while group of fanatic swordsman from time to time charged furiously down upon from hamlet passed through fire be opened upon by chitralis who be supposed to be friendly having gone over to other side so heavy be fire at last townshend ordered men to double did with great steadiness be able to rally without difficulty at small hamlet where found mr robertson encouraging men have brought out message be sent to fort for reinforcement lieutenant harley led out fifty of sikh covered retreat to fort in meantime gurdon with detachment captain baird be still far away on steep side of ravine dr whitchurch who have dressed baird wound be sent to take to rear be then that townshend party began to retreat after fierce fighting arrived at fort where found that whitchurch have not arrived doctor have with handful of sepoys kashmir rifle stretcher bearer under command of native officer matter have developed so rapidly that in very short time be behind townshend retreating party round enemy be swarming when retirement became rapid retreat dropped farther behind small detached party soon became aware of position attacked three men who be carrying stretcher be killed by successive shot when fourth be hit stretcher must be no longer carried so captain baird be partly carried partly dragged along ground enemy fire became so hot that party be compelled to make for river bank have to charge carry two three stone wall once be completely surrounded gallant kashmir charged enemy so furiously with rifle bayonet at last made way through reached fort where have be given up for lost thirteen men in came in only seven of have fought way through with whitchurch other six being fugitive who have joined just before have reached fort half of whitchurch little party be killed baird have be again twice wounded whitchurch marvellously escaped without wound finer action be ever performed than by little body total casualty of day be very heavy of hundred fifty men actually engaged twenty non commissioned officer men be killed twenty eight wounded of officer captain campbell be badly wounded captain baird died on following morning two native officer be killed enemy strength be computed to be from thousand to twelve hundred men of five hundred be umra khan men who be armed with martini many of others carried sniders whole of chitralis have now joined sher afzul most of doubtless being forced to do so by fear of consequence must ensue must refuse little fort thus stood isolated in midst of powerful enemy hostile population village stood on higher ground than fort from of constant fusillade be kept up on garrison while be engaged in difficult work of putting fort into better condition of defence first thing to be done be of course to take stock of store next to estimate how many day must last everyone be put upon half ration be calculated that must hold out two half month be found that have two hundred eighty round per man besides snider ammunition for kashmir rifle three hundred round of martini ammunition for sikh when fort be first occupied be found that there be exposed approach to river from water tower about thirty yard in width covered way be at once built going right down into water through siege covered way be main object of enemy attack for knew that if must cut off water must easily reduce garrison abutment in south wall of fort overlooking garden have be converted into little bastion worst feature of fort however be large number of little building immediately outside wall wall of garden be demolished by moonlight stable be on river face near water tower be loopholed effort be made to loophole basement wall of tower have to be abandoned a there be danger of disturbing foundation among various ingenious plan hit upon by besieged one proved particularly useful loophole be made in gun tower wall be built up in face of water gate fireplace be constructed by wood being laid on slab of stone be pushed out foot from wall must be drawn into fort when be necessary to replenish fire without attending being exposed fire proved invaluable when attack be made upon dark night projecting a did seven foot from wall threw into shadow so that enemy must not see what to fire at at same time lit up ground in front brilliantly so that defender must make out assailant fire with accuracy fort be eighty yard in length wall be twenty five foot in height five tower fifty foot lay in hollow in lowest part of valley be commanded on side by hill on enemy erected numerous sangars a from men moving about inside fort be clearly visible to enemy barricade of stone have to be erected along side of yard to afford cover to men a went to from post on march th letter be received from umra khan stating that british troop must leave chitral at once that must guarantee safe conduct offer be naturally refused next night enemy about two hundred strong made determined effort to fire water tower brought faggot with in spite of heavy volley poured upon managed under cover of darkness to creep into tunnel leading to water to light large fire underneath tower be however driven out three water carrier went into tunnel put out fire be just in time for flame have taken firm hold of wooden beam after twenty five men be always stationed in tower at night picket of twenty five men be placed in covered way leading to water entrance to at water side be exposed to enemy fire barricade of stone with interstice to allow water to go through be built into river formed efficient screen to water bearer on night of th enemy again made attack on water bearer be repulsed with loss water way be indeed source of constant anxiety between tree at northwest corner of fort there be stretch of seventy yard of sandy beach lying underneath overhanging bank entirely covered from fire of fort so that enemy be able to get right up to water tunnel without exposing on th sher afzul sent in messenger to say that party of sepoys have be defeated at reshun that officer be captive in camp next day letter be received from lieutenant edwardes truce be made for three day afterwards extended to six came to end on rd of march hostility again began prospect be gloomy men be beginning to suffer in health from long confinement paucity of ration terribly insanitary condition of fort have not heard of approach of colonel kelly force that under sir robert low during truce union jack have be made be now hoisted on flag tower a symbol of defiance cheered spirit of men depressed of enemy who began to see that task before be far more serious than have hitherto supposed gradually attack of enemy became more feeble although firing be almost continuous seemed a if assailant trusted rather to famine to reduce fort than to exertion on part on april th be very active making two large sangars close to main gate near only fifty yard away from gun tower be also hard at work day in summer house to east of fort garrison however now received news that relief force have already arrived at mastuj in consequence of be saved from further diminution of scanty ration be already under discussion officer be comparatively well off a have plenty of horse flesh sepoys must not eat supply of ghee form so prominent part in diet of native have already given out sepoys have nothing scanty allowance of flour to maintain life news that relief party have arrived at mastuj greatly cheered garrison relief must come sooner later have doubt have not even hoped that must be so near while however news thus raised spirit of defender at same time showed assailant that unless obtained speedy success game must be altogether up before daybreak on morning of th terrific fire be opened upon wall enemy be evidently in great strength in instant everyone be at post steady volley be poured into darkness on garden side of fort whence chief attack seemed to be coming suddenly strong light be seen near gun tower be found that enemy have heaped faggot against wall being constructed partly of wood gradually caught fire mr robertson with of levy horse keeper servant at once set to work to extinguish flame conflagration be too much for troop in reserve be then sent to aid work be dangerous difficult flame raged fiercely enemy kept up tremendous fire from behind wall of summer house nevertheless men worked hardest throwing down earth water on fire many be wounded at work fire be so fierce that large hole have to be knocked through lower story of tower through to attack flame be not until ten o'clock that effort of besieged be crowned with success be again quiet nothing must have exceeded bravery devotion shown by native levy non combatant officer servant water carrier syces even chitralis great precaution be taken to prevent similar attempt to fire of tower earth be brought up water stored water carrier slept with great leathern bag carried full special fire picket be organized when on evening of th enemy again tried to fire gun tower be repulsed without difficulty on following night determined attack in force be made on side of fort be defeated with much loss enemy now began to make great noise with drum pipe in summer house lasted continuously for several day one of native who be aware that enemy have started tunnelling guessed that stir might possibly be made to drown noise of mining men be put on to listen at midnight sentry in gun tower reported that heard noise next morning sound be distinctly audible within few foot of tower be evident that there be time to be lost at four o'clock in afternoon lieutenant harley hundred men issued from fort at garden gate rushed at summer house be held by forty of enemy who fired volley fled after sharp hand to hand fighting head of mine be found to be in summer house tunnel be full of chitralis harley stationed men in summer house to repel attack with five sepoys jumped down into mine chitralis about thirty in number came swarming out after fierce fight be bayoneted mine be then cleared gunpowder placed in position two chitralis who have lain quiet at other end of tunnel tried to make escape in turmoil one of sepoys fired must have hit bag of gunpowder for immediately there be violent explosion mine be blown up from end to end harley be knocked over sikh who be with have hair clothes singed none of party be otherwise hurt time sepoys in summer house have be subject to heavy fusillade from breastwork close by from loopholed wall in garden while from distant sangars hill continuous fire be opened native evidently believing that garrison be making last desperate sortie work done harley men hurried back to fort having be out of hour ten minute of hundred went out twenty two be hit nine mortally in around summer house thirty five of enemy be bayoneted dozen more shot that evening garrison began to drive couple of counter mine to intercept other mine that enemy might attempt to make on th enemy be very quiet in middle of night man approached fort called out that sher afzul have fled that relieving force be near at hand lieutenant gurdon be sent out to reconnoitre found that whole place be deserted next afternoon colonel kelly force arrived chapter promoted a be not now in uniform lisle kept carefully out of sight when general gatacre force marched in did very shortly after colonel kelly arrival be probably unnecessary caution for in addition to mr robertson there be two three other civilian in garrison be desirous of escaping observation until general low who must arrive next day must have heard of escapade at mess however several officer of general gatacre force dined with regiment who have exerted to utmost to provide banquet for guest most of have at one time other be cantoned with pioneer two three of junior officer be introduced to newcomer among lisle gentleman colonel said be mr lisle bullen son of late captain bullen who have doubtless heard be killed little time ago while storming hill fort be at present acting a temporary lieutenant of regiment officer looked with surprise at lisle still darkened face see be surprised gentleman colonel said there be tale hang to colour will relate to after dinner may say that bullen be not half caste a might think of pure english blood at moment dinner be announced temporary mess tent have be erected be open at side composed of many coloured cloth party sat down under there be cloth

story of doings of have at present heard only barest outline be rather long story colonel have nothing else to talk about here have seen newspaper for long time know nothing of what be going on outside therefore ca argue about express opinion a to whether not government have a usual blundered therefore more detail tell better pleased will be a know first army corp fourteen thousand strong be ordered early in march to concentrate so that when news came that garrison of chitral be in serious danger manoeuvre be being carried out be not until late in day that troop be able to move forward brigade marched to jellala without tent taking with supply sufficient for twenty day next morning nd rd brigade went on to dargai weather be cold wet road soft have be given out that st brigade be to go by shakot pas be only ruse to deceive enemy keep from concentrating on malakand subsequently officer rode up shakot pas found to be much more difficult than malakand more strongly fortified order

attack be expected troop lay down with fixed bayonet capture of pass spread great consternation through swat valley a tribe have always believed that be impregnable boasted that enemy have never entered territory have fought with desperate bravery to defeat although have quarrel with merely wished to get through country to reach chitral curiously enough have strong belief in magnanimity several of wounded actually came into camp to be attended to by surgeon on th of april st brigade remained day in camp nd brigade going on seven eight mile farther early on morning of th party went

more fight be slight one then news reached that position of chitral be serious general gatacre be hurried forward with force have tough fighting colonel said number of casualty must seem to show ours be stiffer task at same time must admit that if have be detained for six seven day at river must have beaten in race yes be mad a may well imagine at being detained so long there only hope be that small force must not be able to fight way through until advance took spirit out of native certainly fought very pluckily in attack upon force have crossed action came very close to being serious disaster flood washed away bridge upset calculation almost wonder that native when found that must not cross river did not hurry up to assistance of force be opposing if have done so must have be very awkward must have gone very hard with for be splendid skirmisher if have not have gun with to effectually prevent from concentrating anywhere have have to depend upon rifle fire alone have doubt whether little force must have be able to make way through defile well have be good undertaking altogether hope that punishment have be inflicted will keep tribe quiet for year will probably be quiet officer said till trouble break out in other quarter then will be swarming out like bee be nature to be troublesome colonel said be born fighter there be doubt that fact that most of have got rifle have puffed up with idea while must before hold pass against intruder must be now quite impossible for to force way in when must pick off at twelve hundred pace wish must get hold of of rascally trader who supply with rifle of kind must hang without mercy of course few of rifle have be stolen must not account in way for number have in hand law ought to be passed making punishable by death for trader to sell musket to native not only on frontier throughout india custom house officer must be forced to search for in ship arrives arm ammunition must be confiscated people to whom be consigned must be fined ten pound on rifle unless must be proved that consignment be made to of native prince who have desired for troop raised a subsidiary force to own colonel then related lisle story in

lisle nodded colonel did not give leave sir with aid of one of native officer with whom father be favourite obtained native uniform went through campaign a private officer looked upon with astonishment do mean to say that cooked with fought with lived with a one of be so sir be only at last fight that truth came out for then one of officer heard make remark to myself in english fortunately native officer gave very good account of conduct be one of small party descended cliff with rope did good deal towards driving chitralis out of position how be that be not recognized by soldier speak language a well a speak own lisle said quietly having lived with regiment life learned to speak like native well colonel said be plucky thing for to do idea of disguising in way be very happy one not many officer must like to go through campaign a private in pioneer other indian regiment well congratulate in having acquired officer who must at rate understand great deal of work who can talk to men in own language instead of a expected raw lad how old be mr bullen look very young be only little past sixteen lisle said with laugh suppose war office knew that colonel kelly be kind enough to send in strong recommendation on behalf stating believe fact have disguised a private in order to go to chitral with regiment that a be pleased to say distinguished at once appointed temporarily a officer a such remained with corp until return to peshawar also of course mentioned fact that be son of captain bullen who lost life in bravely attacking hill fort think thought necessary to mention age well have certainly managed very cleverly mr bullen be sure will be acquisition to regiment think can say safely that be youngest officer in service gentleman will drink to health of new comrade who have already shown that be of right sort of whom may be proud next day colonel received letter from colonel kelly ought to have arrived before lisle have be delayed by post spoke in very high term of conduct then said that be general favourite in regiment that be sure that must do credit to corp have joined next year half passed quietly lisle be soon a much liked in new regiment a have be by pioneer men must have done anything for for be always ready to chat with to enter into little grievance to do many kind action chapter unfair play five six of officer be married men have wife with when learned that young subaltern have disguised enlisted in pioneer in order to go up with to front took lively interest in made quite pet of two other regiment be at station at time consequently there be good deal of gaiety in way of lawn tennis croquet party small dinner dance after mess billiards whist lisle soon became expert in former game never touched billiard cue card though be interested spectator when others be playing baccarat be very popular with faster set at game play sometimes ran high there be captain in one of other regiment who scarcely ever sat down without winning at beginning of evening when play be low generally lost be certain to get back losings sometimes considerable sum over a stake rose higher one of lieutenant who be chum of lisle be particularly unlucky be of excitable disposition played high a evening went on lisle noticed that often paid in chit instead of money be not unusual custom a officer be often short of cash settle up when receive month pay lisle frequently remonstrated with friend on folly of proceeding young fellow declared that must retire from table if luck went against mania be too strong for be extraordinary what bad luck have said one day almost always win at beginning of evening then when get thoroughly set winning be swept away why get up when be winner must be very bad form bullen fellow who did must be considered cad must strongly advise to give up altogether lisle observed with regret that friend spirit fell that became moody irritable one day when went into quarter found sitting with look of misery upon face what be gordon asked hope be not in way well have come to young officer said be at end of tether will have to leave regiment nonsense lisle replied be true owe lot of money to fellow sander have bought up chit be note from saying that have waited two three month must now request to pay up without further delay besides pay have only eighteen hundred pound be left by old aunt will barely cover what owe of course can hold on on pay loss of so much money will make lot of difference fear will have to transfer be hard line because be now pretty high on list of lieutenant will of course have to go to bottom of list only alternative must be to enlist in white regiment have lately come out there be plenty of gentleman in rank certainly see other way have idea be so bad a gordon surely there must be other way out of difficulty must lend couple of hundred pound thank old fellow be so deeply in debt that must make difference be not sure that there be not something else to be done said lisle while sit watching play can see more than player can since have noticed that sander persistently win directly stake get high have watched very closely be convinced that doe not play fair have struck that withdraws money on card when see that dealer have strong hand add to stake when considers that dealer be weak now testimony a youngster must go very little way if unsupported against if will give solemn promise that will never play baccarat again will get two three fellow to watch then if can prove that play unfairly of course will be able to repudiate payment of money have won of good heaven must be saving of will willingly give promise want must surely be mistaken sander certainly have have wonderful luck have never heard suggestion that doe not play fair only know that there be good deal of shyness about playing with see be frightful thing to accuse man of cheating admit that be not pleasant if man cheat be found out be duty of honest man to denounce if detect well if mind will take lindsay holmes tritton into confidence play occasionally must let mention that be altogether in power that unless be detected will have to leave regiment mind watch play even more recklessly than usual will make bit careless well there be possibility that be right bullen if can detect will save from frightful disgrace will try anyhow bullen sent note to officer have mentioned asking to come to quarter a particularly wished to speak to in quarter of hour joined well what be up bullen tritton said what do want with be serious business tritton fellow sander owns chit of gordon to amount of fifteen hundred pound exclamation of dismay broke from hearer good heaven tritton exclaimed how must possibly have lost so much a know that play have be high still even with worst luck man must hardly lose so much a fancy after party in mess room have broken up several of used to adjourn to sander quarter be there that great bulk of money be lost what fool gordon have be lindsay said what madman good fellow too well of course nothing can be done if be only hundred two money must be subscribed at once fifteen hundred be utterly beyond what be thinking of doing well have eighteen hundred pound talked of drawing out amount paying up then exchanging into other regiment question however be whether ought to pay others looked up at in surprise why of course must pay tritton said at least must pay quit service disgraced man think there be alternative lisle said be why have sent for what alternative can there be well know play like sitting watching game be quite convinced that sander doe play fair say so tritton said be very serious accusation to make know bullen be perfectly aware of feel that must be mad for to make unsupported accusation against sander want three fellow to join in watching sander play word unsupported must be of avail if four of swore that saw cheating there must be doubt about result for one thing sander must have to leave army must be loss to service for be overbearing brute to say nothing of fact that several young officer have have to leave service owing to loss at play with know of two case lindsay said there be very strong feeling against one suspected of unfair play be who introduced baccarat here when regiment first came up have never be played here before may notice very few of fellow officer ever take hand well there will be harm in watching be thing one doe like doing when come to fellow officer being swindled be clearly duty to expose man who be doing very well then evening two of will take stand behind gordon other two behind sander how did cheat seems fair game enough doe in way put five sovereign under hand be limit know then look at card push out with hand still touching watch dealer if can see by face that card be good one can generally tell that withdraws hand with four of sovereign leaving only one on card if on other hand think be bad one leaf whole five there doe trick cleverly enough be certain have four five time seen do keep eye on hand will see that take up five sovereign from heap before that have in hand when push card out will notice how fix eye upon dealer that leaf one five a have said doe at time through evening especially when gordon be dealing for can tell by gordon face whether have good bad card of course can see too want to nod to when see done will let do two three time so that can swear to agreed to do so lisle then went to gordon quarter tritton lindsay holmes be going to watch with tonight think best thing will be for to answer sander note tell that will require time to draw money from england to pay that will play again tonight to see if luck turn that evening four young officer took place a arranged now that attention have be directed to saw that several time sander although took up five pound only left one on card that kept hand upon up to last moment in turn nodded to lisle noticed how intently sander watched dealer generally left two sovereign on card apparently when dealer have moderate card when have very low very high one trick be played after fully satisfying that have good proof just a sander be again withdrawing hand with four sovereign in lisle threw forward jerked hand upwards showed four sovereign lying under accuse captain sander of cheating have seen do trick dozen time sander shook free aimed heavy blow at lisle who however stepped aside before must repeat be seized by officer standing round tremendous hubbub arose in midst of colonel entered room what be about enquired din subsided at once two three officer said bullen accused captain sander of cheating be very serious accusation bullen colonel said sternly unless can substantiate may be of very serious consequence to yourself will tell what saw lisle related circumstance how fraud be accomplished mean to say that by watching dealer eye captain sander leaf one pound five on card be what said sir have seen do on several night tonight determined to expose tritton lindsay holmes have be watching with be induced to do so by fact that man have rooked lieutenant gordon of something like fifteen hundred pound for hold chit mr tritton hear what mr bullen say have also observed act of cheating of accuses captain sander yes sir have seen do several time evening believe have done more be prepared to swear to seven time colonel looked at lindsay who said have seen suspicious movement eleven time must not like to swear to more than four mr holmes can swear to five time believe did much oftener than what have to say captain sander say be conspiracy on part of four young officer to ruin be lie from beginning to end be afraid captain sander that will find very difficult to persuade anyone four officer who a far a know have ill feeling against must conspire to bring charge however will report matter to colonel tomorrow with written statement from four officer of what saw will of course take such step in matter a think fit without word sander turned on heel left room followed by angry glance of who be present mr bullen have behaved with great discretion colonel said in not making charge on first impression getting three other officer to watch man behaviour tomorrow will hold court of enquiry at major adjutant two other officer will sit with will of course be called will have to repeat story in full lieutenant gordon be shocked to hear that officer of regiment must gamble to extent a have done will of course be called tomorrow think at best will be advised to change into regiment need not say that after exposure chit that have given to captain sander become null void room will be closed for rest of evening officer however gathered in room below talked matter over there be not whisper of regret at disgrace have fallen upon sander reputation be bad one since regiment have be in india one young officer have shot three have be obliged to leave army in case be known that have lost large sum to matter have be hushed up a such scandal generally be in army still truth have be whispered about be because none of officer in regiment must play with that have come habitually to mess of pioneer by own regiment having be quartered in southern india until six month previously nothing be known of antecedent will have to be very careful when be looking on at play bullen one said laughing have given credit for having such sharp eye certainly sander did not either must never have tried game on while be standing watching be not playing see lisle said player trouble about onlooker keep attention directed to dealer standing there evening after evening be really easy to see what be doing for too kept attention fixed on dealer paid heed to who be looking on occasionally did look up at evidently concluded that be only innocent spectator when suspicion be aroused there be really difficulty in detecting how be that did not interfere before because be only word against of sander be only after gordon told how much be in debt to man that latter have that morning written to calling upon to pay up saw that something must be done so asked tritton lindsay holmes to watch closely evening along with well hope gordon wo have to go other said be awfully good fellow though have made abject as of think prosser that if be to sign petition to colonel to ask to overlook matter a gordon have received lesson will certainly last lifetime might do so depends upon how much matter becomes public of course there must be court of enquiry in other regiment if a be certain report be sent to commander in chief sander will be cashiered must fancy that gordon must be called upon to resign of course four gordon will have to give evidence before commission depends of course how colonel take be certain that sander will have to go fear gordon will too expect colonel will get wigging for allowing high play though a say greater part of money be lost in private play in sander room anyhow will be somewhat ugly thing for regiment in general will get nickname of 'the gambler throughout army next morning at eight o'clock little committee met four young officer gave evidence be put on paper in duplicate signed by copy being sent to colonel of sander regiment in short time that officer be seen to go into colonel tent hour later came out again went away few minute after have left four officer be summoned hope colonel said that have heard last of most unpleasant business colonel tell that morning a soon a turned out sander called upon said that have to go to england on urgent family business on arrival there must send in paper retire gave leave to go at once sander disposed of horse trap started by eight o'clock train for calcutta in circumstance have decided for credit of regiment that matter will be held over if a be morally certain leaf army nothing more need be said about of course if must return will be brought up must say however that there be chance whatever of beg of to impress upon officer of regiment indeed will myself do at mess to make allusion outside regiment to what have occurred le said about better if be at known got to ear of commander in chief know how gossip of kind spread colonel must get severe wigging for not sending in report of in case committee must be appointed to go into whole matter a result regiment must probably be sent to worst possible cantonment must find for gordon must be called upon to retire will therefore ask to give word that matter will not be alluded to outside regiment there be fear of of sander regiment hearing anything about a none of be present last night upon further consideration think that must be better to summon officer of regiment at once to impress upon necessity for keeping silence on matter five minute later officer call sounded when be assembled in anteroom colonel repeated to what have said to lisle companion obtained undertaking from individually that must maintain absolute silence on matter affair greatly added to estimation in lisle be held in regiment quickness in detecting swindle step have taken to obtain proof of suspicion showed that possessed other quality besides pluck determination be to be feared that at least of married officer did not regard promise of silence a affecting wife have told what have taken place before be requested to abstain from alluding to for three four of lady made sly allusion when talking to lisle showed that be cognizant of what have taken place well mr bullen one of said have up till now regarded a little more than boy in spite of pluck in going up a native soldier to chitral now will hold in much higher respect will regard a young man with exceptionally sharp eye exceptionally keen discernment think quite understand mr merritt lisle said innocently be very well for to put on air of ignorance suppose that married men can keep matter like from wife can tell admire very much manner in saved lieutenant gordon from having to leave service be favourite with though seems to have made great fool of must be sorry if have have to leave well see mr merritt be not married man must think not lady laughed know how much married men feel bound to keep secret from wife can therefore confess deny took part in incident to be referring silly boy see that know about that be ridiculous for to pretend to misunderstand pretend mr merritt only know have given promise will keep absolute silence on matter that exception be made a to lady of regiment that of course lie between husband well whether be so not mr bullen can tell that affair have very greatly raised in esteem liked before really did regard only a young officer who have proved that possessed uncommon amount of pluck determination in future will regard a gentleman who be ready to take inconsiderable risk on behalf of fellow officer thank mr merritt can assure that feel bit more of man than did before feel happy in having gained good opinion of lady of regiment after lisle came to be regarded a special pet of lady of regiment among officer became very general favourite popularity be increased by fact that be not only one of best shot one of best cricketer several time did efficient service by bowling in match between regiment others cantoned with then came news that tribe have risen that malakand have be attacked that chakdara fortified post on swat river be invested that tribe on side of panjkora be in revolt however be soon followed by report that post have be relieved that heavy loss have be inflicted upon tribesman that trouble be over for time frontier have be in state of tension mullah priest have be inciting tribesman to insurrection one especially who be called mad mullah have gone about from tribe to tribe stirring people up professed to be successor of great akhund of swat to have inherited power claimed to be able to work miracle heavenly host be said on side excited appeal to fanaticism exists in pathan be responded to in marvellous manner villager flew to arm still be thought hoped that when first excitement caused by appeal have died away matter must calm down again hope however be short lived for before long startling news came that mohmunds tribe whose territory lay near peshawar be in revolt that shabkadr village within frontier have be raided destroyed within next few day samana be invested khyber pas be in hand of afridis peshawar movable column

charged attacking force from end to end infantry retired in two section artillery came into action cavalry made way up one of ravine when got within charging distance went at enemy at gallop taking entire length of plateau about mile half charged attacking force from end to end drove demoralized into hill severity of morning fighting may be judged from fact that sixty percent of force engaged suffered casualty from time until be determined to send expedition into mohmund country force remained a corp of observation force drawn chiefly from peshawar garrison be speedily got together on th september have concentrated at about shabkadr fort general advance having be arranged for on th of month in meantime more serious trouble have arisen with zakka khels tribe be most powerful of pathan

bridge advanced across plain with two section of ten men supported by section of same strength rest of force consisting of forty men kept in reserve own that seemed to desperately risky thing for from what must see judged that enemy be about thousand strong grant led party put in charge of reserve very heavy fire be opened by enemy grant men steadily advanced succeeded in getting within hundred yard of enemy here came up with dashed into river carried enemy trench at point of bayonet hunted out from enclosure to enclosure till drew off by side of bridge be village of thobal a with so small force be impossible to advance against overwhelming number must meet before got to manipur fifteen mile away grant determined to hold thobal where must thought defend afford refuge to who have escaped

distant lad said 'we have got to run gauntlet need not be afraid of fire seeing so close to be sure to be wild then with cheer dashed across open enemy blazed at fire be wild confused be among before must reload killing dozen sending rest to right about many of wounded on returning to camp found that there be only fifty round left for snider rifle thirty round for martini strict order be therefore given that one be to fire till enemy be within close range however there be doubt that fight be taken out of by spirit with two little sortie have be made kept up steady fire till took good care not to show retired a soon a must do so in darkness be really end of fighting three day passed then letter arrived from officer in command of expedition ordering to fall back to tamu whence detachment have be despatched to meet order have fallen into hand of enemy doubt informed of content be so utterly glad to get rid of without further loss that gladly sent in to that night there be heavy thunderstorm with tremendous downpour of rain under cover of withdrew quietly before long be met by relieving force be splendid resistance magnificent certainly earned commission well tower now major let hear story of battle of ahmed kheyl where met fanatic in force doubt whether afridis will fight in same way may at rate story will be instructive well be seventeen year ago now major said be junior lieutenant be a know marching from kandahar to kabul under sir donald stewart at ahmed kheyl twenty three mile south of ghuzni met afghan in force estimated at fifteen thousand foot thousand horse for several day have known that be in neighbourhood cavalry scout must be seen marching parallel to about eight mile away on right flank on th of april marched at daybreak advance guard consisted of seven hundred rifle seven hundred fifty cavalry six gun main body of somewhat over thousand rifle three hundred forty nine sabre ten gun then came train hospital guarded by strong detachment on flank while rear guard be fourteen hundred infantry three hundred sixteen cavalry six mountain gun length of column be about six mile head have marched about seven mile when cavalry in advance caught sight of enemy in position three mile ahead preparation be made for receiving attack at eight o'clock march be resumed squadron of bengal lancer be sent to cover left front of infantry brigade be now close to range of low hill ran parallel to line of march for distance then made bend to east enemy be seen in position covering point of passage through hill also upon hill flanking road by division must advance when within mile half of enemy two battery moved out took up position to shell in front while infantry deployed line on left facing enemy on hill nd punjab cavalry be on right of gun whose escort consisted of squadron of th bengal lancer company of punjab infantry be general intention to advance to attack at nine o'clock before disposition be completed whole crest of hill held by enemy seemed to be swarming with men scarcely have gun opened fire when enemy swept down from hill in successive line of swordsman stretching out far beyond flank of force at same time large body of horse rode along hill threatening left flank a swordsman swept down on infantry gun afghan horse came out of two ravine charged bengal lancer before must acquire sufficient speed to meet fairly lancer be forced back disorganizing rd ghoorkhas who composed left battalion of line colonel of ghoorkhas threw men into company square stood ground lancer must not be rallied until have swept along almost whole rear of infantry in meantime swordsman on foot swept down with fanatical fury became necessary to bring up whole reserve into fighting line two battery of artillery on right be now firing grape shot at close range into mass of afghan fire of infantry supporting must check advance of enemy battery having used up case shot be compelled to retire two hundred yard right of infantry line be also forced back situation at moment be horribly critical flank be turned troop be good deal shaken by suddenness fierceness of attack enemy horseman however pushing round to left flank be checked by firmness of rd ghoorkhas who stood ground bravely by fire of battery on flank on right nd punjab cavalry charged drove back enemy thus giving time for two battery to take up fresh position again come into action infantry on right also recovered from confusion into have be temporarily thrown poured withering fire into afghan in centre nd sikh maintained through out fight steady unyielding front steady well directed fire of whole line aided by battery be creating terrible havoc among enemy after hour gallant strenuous exertion on flank effort began to slacken before long whole of be in flight leaving thousand dead wounded on ground be calculated that have at least two thousand casualty while own loss amounted to only one hundred forty one be not pursued a cavalry be required to guard baggage be grand fight major colonel said be at maiwand also be not yes must be hard to find greater contrast to fight have just described two british force be attacked under almost precisely similar circumstance one be splendidly commanded other must be confessed be badly led there be good deal against day be in july terribly hot at step troop took found power of sun increasing until heat became intense solitary traveller in such circumstance must make poor travelling of course be vastly worse for troop advancing heavily laden formed in column th foot have have tea light breakfast before starting native troop have have nothing to eat since night before one regiment indeed have water others have managed to fill canteen during halt at half past nine brigade at end of march be again ordered to change grenadier be pivot regiment did not slacken pace consequently centre be greatly exhausted in trying to keep up with be certainly in condition to take part in battle at whole thing be hideous mistake general burrow have brought line into position behind lay great nullah during course of battle enemy be enabled to bring gun up to within five hundred yard on front flank be ghastly day flank be driven back line became bent into form of horseshoe two cavalry regiment whose support must have be invaluable behaved badly early in fight left field after first line gave way everything went badly of troop stood died on ground held others soon became mob of fugitive loss a long a held position be comparatively slight grand total mounted up during retreat be hideous business one like to recall men staggered along overpowered by heat thirst falling in many case without resistance under sabre of pursuing enemy have fought properly be probable that not single man except cowardly cavalry must have reached kandahar to tell tale thank major be also believe in two three dashing affair before maiwand yes colonel certainly one of most successful be that cavagnari who be afterwards murdered at kabul made be not much of affair show what can be done with dash in be making canal to tap swat river at point where enters british territory naturally swat villager on other side of frontier considered that operation be deep laid plot for injuring be at village of sappri that chief went down with number of desperate men murdered cooly engaged in work cavagnari issued order that chief must pay heavy fine in money cattle that actual murderer must be tried for crime khan however took notice of demand forty mile southeast of sappri be british cantonment of murdan where corp of guide be permanently quartered greater portion of be however absent on expedition there remained available few squadron of cavalry eleven company of infantry cavagnari kept plan profound secret did not even give slightest hint of intention to commanding officer captain wigram battye so well indeed be secret kept that officer be playing game at racket when be called upon to start first intimation that men have of movement be serving out of ball cartridge when gate of fort be closed in evening old soldier be well aware that meant that fighting be at hand gave great shout be first intimation to officer that something be on foot be a glad a men mule have be got in readiness small detachment set off on long night march mule be picked animal in good condition be able to keep up with men after covering thirty two mile in seven hour halted at frontier fort of abazai seven mile south of sappri beyond point country be impracticable for cavalry force now consisting of two hundred twelve men dismounted marched forward on foot after seven mile of severe toil arrived in vicinity of hostile village captain battye placed men on surrounding high ground so a to completely command place cut off retreat disposition have be completed without arousing enemy in short time day broke cavagnari immediately sent in demand to khan to surrender outlaw pay fine khan refused to comply with term there be short desperate fight in guide be victorious khan many of leading men be killed village captured fine be then exacted troop marched back to fort abazai be fine example of punitive expedition thoroughly well managed movement be made with secrecy rapidity horse men mule be in readiness cavalry be on emergency prepared to perform role of infantry while little party of infantry be ready to ride thirty mile on mule with cavalry in raid guide covered forty eight mile without halt perfect success attended expedition be not often attained especially when a in case force be unprovided with gun two three little mountain gun make difference in expedition of kind for though afridis will stand musketry fire pluckily enough begin to flinch a soon a gun however small open upon there be more awkward business than attack upon hill fort be well held for of be really formidable be present at storming of nilt fort fight near chillas of awkward affair in fight at malandrai there have for time be state of hostility between malandrai two mile across border rustam on side of information be received that several of most important of enemy raider considerable number of cattle must on certain night be at malandrai be arranged that two company of guide must start in afternoon for rustam twenty five mile distant must reach after dark at place be to take short rest be then to follow difficult track through hill appear on commanding spur in rear of village at dawn frontal attack be to be made by six company who be to arrive before bridge in small hour of morning squadron of bengal cavalry be to move independently to cut off of enemy who might escape from frontal attack turning party arrived after march of eighteen hour through terribly rough country main body unfortunately miscalculated distance instead of halting in gorge leading to village in be known that picket have be placed came suddenly upon enemy outpost fired volley killing colonel of men surprise therefore a surprise failed attack be made in morning village taken turning party extricated from dangerous position be good example of difficulty of attacking hill fort instance be attack upon nilt fort place be one of great natural strength fort be large one faced junction of three precipitous cliff several hundred foot high where great ravine run into hunza river owing to nature of ground fort must not be seen till force be within three hundred yard of fire must not be properly opened upon until within two hundred fifty yard wall of fort be of solid stone cemented by mud strengthened by strong timber be fourteen foot in height eight foot in thickness be surmounted by flanking tower battlement afforded defender perfect cover in front of main gate be loopholed wall completely hiding gateway in front of again be very deep ditch filled with abattis while broad band of abattis filled space between ditch precipitous spur from adjacent mountain spur be unfortunately inaccessible for gun though infantry mounted fire have effect upon enemy sheltered a be behind battlement be therefore necessary to make direct attack storm fort on front of only sixty yard after vain attempt to make impression on fort with mountain gun order be given to advance ghoorkhas two hundred strong company of sapper dashed forward into ravine facing west wall few of managed to force way into weak point of abattis under heavy fire from fort worked round to gateway be soon hacked down then burst into courtyard captain aylmer re set to work to place charge of gun cotton against main entrenchment of fort after repeated failure fuse be lighted gate blown in captain aylmer be severely wounded in three place several of men killed so far attack have be so astonishingly bold quick that main body be unaware of success colonel duran thinking explosion be caused by bursting of one of enemy gun continued steadily firing at fort position of twenty men three officer be precarious indeed a be thus exposed to heavy fire from behind a well a in front with splendid heroism however held on to advantage have gained till reinforcement came up then pressing on through shattered gate captured fort for fortnight after force remained inactive for way of ascending great ravine be known at last however enterprising sepoy discovered way on th of december hundred men under two lieutenant be ordered to leave nilt fort under cover of darkness drop silently down into bed of ravine there await daylight portion of enemy position have be selected for attack be on extreme left on crest of cliff rose without break fifteen hundred foot from bed of ravine force hundred thirty five men six british officer with two gun be to cover advance of storming party at eight o'clock in morning fire be opened upon enemy a be anticipated that storming party be well up cliff by time unfortunately after ascending precipice halfway reached point where cliff be absolutely impracticable be obliged to descend again into ravine at two o'clock having discovered more practicable way ascended again foot by foot commander working way up with admirable judgment moving from point to point a opportunity offered between shower of stone enemy be now fully aware that precipice be being scaled be only well directed fire of covering party prevented from issuing from defence annihilating party with rock boulder summit be reached at half past eleven first of enemy work captured rushed sangar after sangar taking in rear driving out enemy pell mell killing many capturing large number of prisoner at last passage of great ravine be gained british force enabled to move forward again greatest credit be due to lieutenant manner smith whose conduct in storming height in broad daylight be simply magnificent result showed manner in even young officer can distinguish how native troop will follow unhesitatingly through danger must well appal even bravest be possible however to demand too much from troop a be shown in defence of chillas post be held in ' by three hundred men of kashmir maharajah bodyguard under command of two british officer major daniel lieutenant moberley for time daniel have be warned that might be attacked on night of mohammedan feast be understood that be on rd of march when night passed quietly be considered that alarm have be false one during next night however determined attack be made by about thousand men be repulsed by steady volley major daniel then determined to take offensive attack enemy who be swarming in great number into neighbouring village at half past three moberley with thirty five men went out to attack village after severe fighting loss effected lodgment in outer line of house being badly wounded finding village too strongly held for small party to make further progress retired with detachment to fort enemy continued heavy fire until half past eight when major daniel determined to attack again although number be now swollen to between four thousand five thousand men have with only hundred forty available men number being required to garrison fort dividing little force however attacked village on two side fight went on for two hour during one of two attacking party gained partial footing in village wounded men began to struggle back to fort reported that major daniel many men have be killed remnant of attacking party be brought back by native officer at half past eleven casualty in killed wounded be very heavy including two british officer four native officer forty six rank file fortunately native believing doubt that reinforcement must arrive scattered to home without further action here be case in native troop be ordered to perform what verged on impossible house in native village be almost always fortified to take hundred fifty men to attack place held by five thousand be asking more than best british soldier must be expected to achieve at rate story have told will give idea of work have before may quite assume force a be now being collected can be trusted to defeat afridis if venture to meet in open fight if resort solely to harassing tactic will have work cut out for must be remembered too that afridis be far better fighter more warlike of far better physique than men engaged in fight have be speaking of be splendid shot be almost armed with breech loading rifle sniders martini country be tremendously hilly although be wholly unknown to do know that there be ravine to be passed where handful of men must keep army at bay be with sikhim expedition in ' one of captain said at time be in derbyshires in case be wildness of country rather than stoutness of defence of thibetans caused difficulty force consisted of mountain battery of four gun two hundred men of regiment four hundred of bengal infantry seven hundred men of nd pioneer men be picked of good physique a be known that campaign must be most arduous one in addition to usual entrenching tool hundred twenty short sword be issued to regiment fifty per cent of follower be also supplied sword be to be used for clearing away jungle country be very rugged work have to be done at altitude of twelve thousand foot where mountain be mostly covered with forest tree undergrowth base from started be thirty mile northeast of darjeeling first objective of expedition be fort of lingtu forty mile distant advance be made in two column first consisting of two mountain gun hundred men of derbyshires three hundred of nd pioneer be to make for lingtu while rest be to operate towards intchi where rajah of sikhim resided thus prevent reinforcement from being sent to lingtu latter column met with opposition after accomplishing work retired first column came across enemy at jeluk five mile short of lingtu here thibetans have erected strong stockade at top of very steep ascent have barricaded road with stone breastwork position be attacked at seven in morning by hundred men of nd pioneer supported by seventy eight men of regiment gun have have to be left behind advance be slow owing to dense bamboo jungle through have to pas steepness of road great caution be necessary when have reached spot within few hundred yard of stockade fire be suddenly opened on pioneer however moved on steadily without replying till having worked way close up to stockade fired volley then with loud cheer charged with bayonet fixed derbyshire detachment moved up into support position be captured after sharp struggle small turning party under captain lumsden have be detached to left after proceeding short distance found that road have be cleared to where passed round precipice that be defended by party of enemy behind stone breastwork at ten yard range captain lumsden several of men be knocked over party be brought to complete stand so thick be jungle that did not know what be going on on side first intimation received of capture of fort be descent of party of derbyshires in rear of breastwork stockade when be examined turned out to be most formidable one about two hundred yard long flank resting on impassable precipice be constructed of log laid horizontally with thick abattis of twelve tree next morning advance on lingtu be continued in dense mist information be obtained from prisoner that must have to cross spot where there be stone shoot down avalanche of rock must be hurled by defender therefore advanced with great caution while party of pioneer crept along crest of ridge attacked from rear party gathered at head of stone shoot road be steep broken partially melted snow lay two foot deep on pioneer captured stone shoot without loss then pushed on over hill without firing shot charged straight at fort burst way through main gate before astonished thibetans have realized what be happening of course a be against enemy of such poor fighting quality a thibetans little affair affords idea of resistance that can expect in tirah doe show what can be accomplished by men in face of immense natural difficulty chapter dargai pas there be greatest joy among pioneer when received instruction to prepare for advance to khusalghar officer men alike be in highest spirit not least pleased be lisle who have begun to tire of monotony of camp life mention of place at be to assemble put end to discussion have long taken place a to route to be followed six day easy march along good road must take to shinawari in three four day more must get into heart of tirah illustration map illustrating tirah campaign much must depend on conduct of orakzais powerful tribe whose country lay between kenmora of zakka khels latter have indeed declared against be known to be very half hearted for felt lying a did close to british frontier must be sure to suffer most if obtained upper hand be hoped therefore after making show of resistance must try to come to term with regiment be told that must have to provide own carriage two three day be spent in buying up pony mule in neighbourhood heavy baggage be packed up left in store regiment marched from town in light order with drum fife playing merry march men in high spirit be worth two year in dull cantonment bullen one of lieutenant remarked to lisle be glorious lisle said though expect will have hard fighting for say that zakka khels ally can place fifty thousand in fighting line a column be reported to be twenty thousand strong will have work to do in open must of course have chance with a fighting will be done in guerrilla fashion from hill precipice task will be easy one guarding of tremendous convoy must take with will in be extremely difficult yes expect will get hot loss be almost sure to be heavy will not prevent from turning out of fastness wish must let carry rifle instead of sword lisle said will be beastly having nothing to do wave one sword while be potting at think must mind heaviest fire if must reply to to be compelled to stand by idly while men be blazing away must be enough to drive mad dare say when fighting begin bullen will soon find that there be plenty of rifle disengaged see reason why officer must not pick up one of take share in firing till have to lead men on to attack lisle be now nearly eighteen of medium height with light active figure likely to be able to undergo hardship on arrival at khusalghar found that several regiment be already there with enormous amount of store baggage officer lost time in examining fort have be so nobly held by party of sikh who having for long time held enemy in check have fought to last when burst in one by one noble fellow fell one wounded man lying on pallet shot three of enemy before be killed last survivor of little force shut up in little chamber killed twenty of assailant before be overcome not single man escaped defence of little fort be splendid example of fidelity bravery of sikh soldier after few day stay at place regiment marched on to shinawari here remained for little time until column be made up be known that zakka khels ally have marched down taken up position near dargai hill that orakzais have in spite of pressure brought to bear upon by other tribe determined to remain neutral dargai hill must not be confused with hill of same name at fierce fighting took place in expedition to chitral two year before at last welcome news came that advance be about to take place general lockhart with column be at fort thirty mile away intermediate ground be so broken force of enemy watching so strong that assistance must be obtained from force assembled at shinawari be strong one king own scottish borderer battery of royal artillery st battalion of gordons st dorsets with mountain battery yorkshire regiment royal west surrey company of th ghoorkhas be there rd sikh with two gun moved to left in khuram valley altogether something like fifty thousand transport animal accompanied with sixty thousand camp follower transport presented extraordinary appearance included class of bullock vehicle line of ill fed camel mule pony even tiny donkey on october th order be received from general lockhart that division at shinawari be to make reconnaissance in force towards khanki valley a enemy have be seen moving about on hill force consisting of rd th brigade moved forward object of reconnaissance be summit of hill directly overlooking shinawari over two thousand foot high from plain ascent appeared to be simple when started to climb found that be rugged almost impassable there be semblance of road men have to toil up goat path sheep track dargai ridge be from thousand to fifteen hundred foot above spot from started on near side be almost sheer precipice only mean of access to top be up three steep waterway converged to left of position be only two hundred fifty yard range from summit a soon a be crossed steepness of cliff afforded assailant shelter from enemy fire from point path zigzag up until men in single file can reach summit ridge then dip into hollow plateau where village lie then run up two hundred foot to cliff making descent of better part of mile on far side hill slope away to khanki valley be going to begin with sharpish climb lisle said to officer if fellow on top of cliff stick to work will have very hot time of expect gun will clear off other said may do for moment a get up to top will rush forward again if have same pluck a fellow fought against before a soon a advance began enemy came into action two battery opened upon fire slackened somewhat climb be severe one indeed road became worse worse a advanced at one place ridge between two spur have to be crossed with barely foot of purchase way sheer drop on side when be within two hundred yard from summit have to cross open space borderer ghoorkhas be in front latter be ordered to carry position while borderer covered advance ghoorkhas advanced in couple of rush a neared summit enemy bolted goorkhas pursued did not go far a general who have be with advance guard throughout recalled be found that village lay in hollow of plateau that sangars have be built along summit high up on hill covered crest general westmacott waited for two hour on summit supposing that general kempster must not make way up be about to withdraw men a large body of enemy be seen moving in direction threatened left rear a did so general kempster arrived have experienced considerable resistance have lost two officer have be hard work lisle companion said a returned to camp yes hardness consisted more in climbing than in fighting wonder be brought back again will probably have great deal harder work next time for enemy in khanki valley will doubt be up there waiting for that evening there be much discussion at mess upon expediency of evacuating pas when have once be occupied general opinion however be that be necessary general lockhart be at fort bearing name with regiment of th brigade nd battalion have remained in camp at shinawari st division be still on march to place be general lockhart intention to divide great force known to be in khanki valley reconnaissance have be ordered to ascertain if road really existed if be passable for baggage reason for retirement be that complete brigade must have be required to take place that picketing of road must have taken brigade that commissariat arrangement have be made for supply of force on plateau further not drop of water be available lastly if dargai have be held enemy must have massed whole force against whereas when force withdrew tribesman must be compelled to divide force in order to watch other road conclusion arrived at by member of mess be that retirement be probably necessary that next advance must assuredly meet with much greater opposition than first three day passed then at past four in morning advance guard of general yeatman biggs ' column left camp under general kempster proceeded up chagru pas be long weary pull up hill sapper have be working hard on road for past ten day be still very narrow for whole division three mountain battery at half past eight force reached summit advance guard sent back news that crest of dargai be held by enemy in force enemy must be plainly made out have with black banner showed that be kambar khels on far side of opposite range must be seen great mass of tribesman with dozen standard st nd ghoorkhas dorsets derby be sent on while gordons took up position to cover advance with long range volley a regiment climbed up three mountain gun massed on chagru kotal one have come in with northampton from fort lockhart opened enemy replied at long range upon advance guard of ghoorkhas a went up centre nullah little ghoorkhas came steadily on at six hundred yard opened fire in volley fire of gun be too much for tribesman who ceased to show dorsets have now joined ghoorkhas after halt again made rush across open to reach cover derby firing heavily to assist until men showed in open have knowledge in what force position be held three company of ghoorkhas managed to reach cover beneath cliff path be strewn with dead dying captain robinson after getting across with men tried to rejoin main body fell then dorsets endeavoured to join three gallant company of ghoorkhas rush after rush be made head of melted away a soon a fatal spot be reached at last after three fruitless attempt helio flashed back to general that position be impregnable that further attempt must be useless waste of life matter be looking serious be twelve o'clock enemy still held position general yeatman biggs realized that check must seriously alter course of campaign told general kempster that summit must be taken at cost latter started at once taking with gordons rd sikh took fresh troop best part of hour to climb up when five regiment of infantry highlander english sikh ghoorkhas stood massed in nullah general kempster helioed to gun asking three minute concentrated fire on summit there be two way to reach cover where company of ghoorkhas have be lying for three hour top ridge have be proved to be absolutely death passage there be path by general westmacott have forced way up three day before be shorter across open zone of fire fresh regiment be to take lead colonel collected men at edge of nullah said gordons general say that position must be taken at cost gordons be to do signal be given battery at once opened fire cliff be crowned with circle of bursting shrapnel then officer of gordons dashed over nullah pipe rolled out charge with clenched teeth highlander burst into open length of exposed zone be swept with leaden stream head of upper column melted away few struggled on others took place of fallen sikh derby ghoorkhas followed in rush a firing slackened cover halfway be won moment be allowed for breath then men be up again terrible rush terrible slaughter three company of ghoorkhas be reached when enemy saw that space be crossed left sangars streamed down reverse slope of hill must not face men who have passed that terrible passage forming at bend of perpendicular rock waited till have recovered breath then proceeded up zigzag path leading to summit of hill fighting be over loss have be great four officer have be killed ten wounded one of mortally total casualty be hundred ninety four killed wounded of thirty be gordons majority of remainder be dorsets ghoorkhas few of who fell wounded escaped with life comrade made desperate effort to carry off storm of bullet fired at so short range rendered impossible while wounded who attempted to rise return be riddled with bullet a soon a moved when fight be over whole force encamped on chagru kotal assailant be unable to make out why enemy did not defend zigzag path only two men must climb abreast advancing file must have be destroyed by dozen marksman with breech loader only reasonable supposition be that having be engaged for five hour ammunition be practically exhausted several act of heroism be performed in battle one of piper lance corporal milne be shot through leg still continued to play pipe in sitting position four other piper played right across fatal passage three of being wounded lieutenant tillard be first man across be fast runner stopped to encourage men midway by th whole of two division be encamped on two low hill at mouth of kapagh pas while stream of transport came gradually up by day six thousand four hundred british troop eleven thousand two hundred eighty native troop seventeen thousand follower two thousand four hundred camel be gathered there in morning foraging party went out when be returning to camp with supply also with hundred head of cattle enemy lined neighbouring height mountain battery came into action rearmost regiment covered retreat by volley tribesman have advantage of position with utmost determination followed even opened fire on camp causing several casualty total loss being over thirty by time troop be convinced that campaign must be most serious one before lay country of be absolutely ignorant into englishman have ever penetrated defended by enemy who be for most part armed with first class rifle be marvellous skirmisher if tribesman kept to guerrilla warfare there be saying how long campaign must last lisle have passed through fight unhurt have be almost bewildered a crossed fatal path running at top speed with men falling thickly around halfway across lieutenant blunt who be one of great chum have joined just before fell lisle sheathed sword threw down beside pressing to ground to prevent from moving while remained perfectly still when next rush of men came along lifted wounded friend with great effort on to back then ran on blunt be again twice hit lisle escaped almost by miracle arrived at foot of precipice minute after last man got in be loudly cheered by men a did so have satisfaction of knowing blunt wound although serious be not considered mortal when regiment halted on plateau lisle be warmly congratulated by colonel officer on feat have performed disclaimed particular merit when blunt fell said be most natural thing in world must go pick up did so almost mechanically luckily be light man even if have be heavy one think must have felt weight be scarcely conscious of bullet whistling round when fell knew that tribesman must shoot wounded man who tried to rise that only chance be to lie perfectly still until batch of men came along showed end of coolness colonel said idea of pressing down lying quietly beside showed that in spite of confusion brain be clear that have sens about be gallant action will not forget to mention when send in report deserve vc suppose will get so many gallant deed be done that only few can get cross two division marched on morning of th northampton th sikh have be detached to extremely high hill to cover advance have already be found that although afridis must fight well so long a have advantage of position be nevertheless extremely careful of skin after heavy firing into camp on night of return of reconnaissance place have be greatly strengthened position be changed night fact so entirely surprised enemy for time night attack ceased altogether general westmacott brigade advanced up khanki nullah to foot of sampagha pas general gazelee division moved along hill halted at village of ghandaki in afternoon reconnaissance pushed forward returned with news that pas appeared to be simple road good one tribesman be seen upon nearly crest be apparently building sangars upon roadway general gazelee be to make attack next morning general westmacott general kempster

scottish borderer northampton in dim light of early morning distant crest be marked by fire of enemy delay be caused by battery missing track by daybreak advanced at half past six enemy fired first shot then fell rapidly back regiment in first line moved steadily on at half past seven gun opened few shell be sufficient for enemy advance party scuttled back when ghoorkhas queen reached first ridge in pas enemy opened fire must not stand accurate fire of six battery mountain battery pushed up pas came into action on enemy first position pas widened out from point two leading regiment moved forward to sloping crest of third position queen have advanced on right with ghoorkhas on flank pathway be covered by fire of enemy hidden behind rock be so accurate that men must hardly show on path without being immediately shot down sikh borderer however pushed up hill drove enemy out defence of pas be not so determined a have be expected after stand shown at dargai reason doubt be that though be good skirmisher enemy did not care to expose to artillery fire close quarter fighting when last crest have be gained force proceeded down into mastura valley tribesman have deserted set fire to homestead village be only few hundred yard apart be well built valley contained many beautiful grove there be little food in camp ghoorkhas set to work to make chupatties with coarse flour found in village there have be very few casualty during day men began to hope that after lesson taught enemy at dargai other resolute stand must be made after day of rest in valley order be issued for rd th brigade to move at daybreak nd brigade be to follow st being left to garrison camp path be across low ridge connecting higher one offered great facility for resistance be overcome with exchange of few

last pas enemy have lost heart foraging party next day found tribesman in great force at other end of valley be compelled to retire party of enemy attempted to rush picket of th sikh strong force pounced upon baggage train killed several of driver then retiring till main guard have passed dashed out again killed three of guard wounded several others for present damage be done to homestead a be hoped that afridis must come in surrender next day foraging party be hotly attacked at night there be severe fighting round camp party of elder came in to ask what term must be given be told that tribesman must have to deliver up rifle pay heavy fine be evident from manner that although must be ready to pay fine must certainly not deliver up rifle troop have now settled down comfortably have ten day ration in camp camel convoy be coming in daily weather be delightful nightly firing into camp alone disturbed small party of forager be few day later fiercely attacked captain rowcroft who be in command have with only subadar dozen sepoys when heavy fire be opened upon party must have retired one of men be shot through thigh took three others to carry be presently left behind rowcroft went back to body to assure that man be dead pause gave enemy time to close up subadar be shot a well a man tending mule be luckily found subadar be sent to rear after two men be hit one for second time a be impossible for four sound men to carry off wounded face enemy a well rowcroft chose best spot determined to halt wait for help afridis must not bring to rush little party confined to keeping up heavy fire sikh be wounded dust caused by bullet almost blinded others who must scarcely see to reply at last just in nick of time relieving party arrived carried off on th general westmacott started with brigade to punish zakka khels for continued night firing commander have learned from prisoner be kept up by tribe brigade did work thoroughly by evening whole of eastern valley be in flame same

followed ghoorkhas clearing side of valley in short time passed into zakka khel section of bara valley curiously enough opposition ceased here may be that enemy feared to show on snow on hilltop that being short of ammunition decided to reserve for attack upon other brigade scarcely shot be fired until valley broadened out into akerkhel where small opposition be offered by villager on bank however be easily brushed aside advance guard of rd brigade almost caught up rear guard of th by four in afternoon baggage be coming along nicely so that must be in before rear guard of brigade consisting of gordons ghoorkhas nd punjab infantry have be harassed a soon a started a day wore on enemy increased greatly in number a flanking party fell back to join rear guard be so pressed that be a much a must do to keep at bay when about three mile from camp baggage took wrong road in trying piece of level ground became helplessly mixed up in swampy rice field enemy seeing opportunity have waited for outflanked rear guard began pouring heavy fire into baggage flanking party be weak for strain have be so severe that many men from hospital escort baggage guard have be withdrawn to dislodge enemy from surrounding spur pathan be almost among baggage when panic seized follower a night began to fall officer commanding gordons with two weak company of regiment two company of ghoorkhas company of nd punjab infantry ghoorkhas found in most serious position gun have limbered up pushed on rear guard remained surrounded by enemy hampered with wounded stranded with doolies a native bearer have fled

must entrench for night be in advance of actual rear guard attempting to hold house against fire of quite hundred tribesman collecting four men of regiment shouting wildly rushed at doorway in dusk enemy be uncertain of number of assailant in horror of bayonet fired one wild volley fled to continue ruse captain uniacke climbed to roof shouting word of command a if have company behind then blew whistle to attract rear guard a passed in dark whistle be heard in little group fell back with wounded to house be poor place capable of defence pathan drew off knowing that there be loot in abundance to be gained down by river a night wore on greatest anxiety prevailed when transport officer small party straggled in reported that tribesman be looting cutting up follower within mile of camp that have news to give of men who composed rear guard so anxious be headquarter staff that company of borderer be sent out to do what must lieutenant macalister took out going mile up river be able to collect many follower baggage animal must find sign of rear guard early in morning company of nd punjab infantry went out a search party got into communication with rear guard be safe in house must not move a be hampered with wounded be surrounded by enemy two regiment mountain battery therefore went out rescued from awkward predicament bringing into camp with a much baggage a must be found

village on side of nullah baggage of whole division followed main guard directly camp be left side of nullah enlarged for mile road lay through narrow ravine drop be rapid for river swollen by fallen snow have become literally torrent scene with baggage be one of extreme confusion recent disaster have given frenzied impulse to generally calm follower felt anxiety to press forward with impetus almost impossible to control mass of baggage became mixed in ravine at last be cleared off when valley opened moved forward at greatest speed now under perfect control after opposition became le village of gulikhel be reached by rd brigade village stand on left bank of bara immediately below nullah becomes narrow gorge almost impassable in present state of river be several mile long there be however road over neighbouring saddle path up from river be narrow sufficient to allow two loaded mule to pas abreast wound for seven mile over low hill until river bed be again reached next ford be barkhe advance guard be well up in hill by midday when met oxfordshire regiment have come out seven mile to meet force baggage of division filing out of river bed in pair be serious matter there be necessarily block in rear general westmacott moved a soon a baggage be off long before be through first defile picket be engaged general action followed enemy fighting with extraordinary boldness kept within few yard of picket follower with baggage animal be constantly hit a came up at half past ten rear guard regiment marched out of camp under cover of artillery fire fighting be so severe that within hour ammunition of rd ghoorkhas be expended shortly afterwards two regiment of rear guard be forced to call up first reserve ammunition mule march be continued at rapid pace until reached block caused by narrowness of path here whole river reach became choked with animal doolies wounded be coming in fast when pathan taking advantage of block attacked in great force hoping to compel retreating force to make way down long river defile general westmacott however defended right with energy rear guard regiment supporting other while battery be in continual action borderer sikh ghoorkhas stood well to task till last of baggage animal be got out of river bed country now have become rolling plateau intersected by ravine thickly covered with low jungle in enemy must creep up to within three four yard of fighting line progress be consequently very slow to be benighted in such country must have meant disaster so general westmacott selected ridge determined to hold for night wearied men be just filing up when tremendous rush be made by afridis for moment seemed a if must all be enveloped swept away officer threw into rank magazine be worked freely very bush seemed to melt away before hail of shot tribesman be swept back in darkness never tried second rush firing also slackened very much permitted men to form camp see to wounded day rear guard lost one officer killed three wounded eighteen men killed eighty three wounded six missing night in camp be terrible experience troop have be fighting since early morning frost be bitter have water food blanket general

kotal be passed enemy continued to harass retirement down to river where picket post of th ghoorkhas be reached retirement from tirah have cost hundred sixty four killed wounded a military achievement march of lockhart nd division must have prominent place in history of british army after quiet day force marched into swaikot next morning troop in camp there gathered on side of road cheering battle grimed comrade bringing down hot cake to be depressing sight men be pinched dishevelled bore on face mark of terrible ordeal through have just passed advance guard be followed by wounded th brigade followed be even more marked by hardship strife than who have preceded then rear guard marched in first phase of tirah expedition be at end expedition have carried out object successfully afridis have be severely punished have be taught what have hitherto believed impossible that defile be not impregnable that long arm of british government must reach in recess lesson have be very severe one have be attained at terrible cost be to be hoped that will never have to be repeated while regiment be resting quietly in cantonment there have be serious fighting on road to chitral after hesitation government have decided that post must remain in hand strong force be therefore stationed at malakand after clearing country remained quietly at station until news be received of attack on fort at

general meiklejohn have long arduous march on enemy left movement be successfully carried out enemy knowing that line of retreat towards morah pas be threatened broke up large portion streaming away to left remainder soon lost heart although desperate charge by handful of ghazis took place only sacrificed life without altering course of event enemy gathered on ridge in rear by eleven height commanding road be in hand of troop guide cavalry began to file past when got into pas behind ridge enemy be more than mile away must be seen in great number separated by several ravine captain palmer who have pushed forward in pursuit soon found ahead of men near be lieutenant greave thirty yard behind colonel adam lieutenant norman seeing that enemy be in considerable force colonel adam directed troop of cavalry who be coming up to hold graveyard through have passed until infantry must arrive owing however to noise of firing palmer greave did not hear charged up to foot of hill hoping to cut off tribesman who be hurrying towards palmer horse be at once killed greave fell among pathan adam fincastle two soldier galloped forward to assistance be able to help palmer back to shelter of graveyard meanwhile fincastle who have have horse killed tried to help greave on to adam horse while doing so greave be again shot through body adam horse wounded two trooper came to assistance

one of aide de camp in last fight be pleased to offer vacancy may take possession of horse until return when will of course be sold will be glad to have young officer of so much courage resource on staff thank sir be extremely obliged to for offer gladly accept feel very high honour indeed to be attached to staff very well mr bullen will put in order tomorrow morning on return to regiment lisle be warmly congratulated when heard honour have be bestowed on there be many expression of regret at leaving will not be for long said for suppose that in fortnight will be across frontier if have be at beginning of campaign must certainly have refused to accept general offer for must much rather have remained with regiment a be however must hardly refuse certainly not said one be always pull having be on staff even for short time staff always get name in order give fellow much better chance in future besides in campaign like where division get often broken up there be plenty of work to do well hope will soon be back with again next morning lisle took up new duty be soon fully occupied in carrying message from to headquarters one day received order to accompany one of senior member of staff to reconnoitre pas two mile from camp be level ride to mouth of gorge have scarcely entered when from behind rock hundred yard away heavy volley be fired colonel horse be shot dead be shot through leg lisle be unwounded leapt from horse ride for life bullen colonel said be shot through leg illustration horse must carry two sir ' lisle replied horse must carry two sir lisle replied lifting officer who be not wholly disabled placing in saddle jump up officer said tribesman be now within twenty yard lisle drew sword gave animal sharp prick be already frightened with shouting of tribesman went off like arrow lisle seeing that resistance be absolutely useless threw down sword stood with arm folded facing native order be shouted by man who be evidently leader pausing who be armed with breech loader fired after flying horseman totally disregarding lisle who have satisfaction of finding that sacrifice have be effectual for horse pursued way without faltering when be out of range chief turned to lisle afridis value courage above thing be filled with admiration at manner in young officer sacrificed for superior signalled to lisle to accompany surrounded by tribesman be taken back to rock from have first fired then guarded by four armed men be conducted to little village standing high among hill be just luck said to when be taken to room in principal house here be prisoner again just a troop be going to march away be awfully bad luck still if ever do get back suppose fact have saved colonel houghton life will count for something in favour be unlucky that there be not time for to jump up behind horse be in bad condition must have be good deal longer under fire however ought not to grumble at luck believe be only officer who have be taken prisoner a look a if be to be kept a hostage life must seem to be safe certainly expected nothing instant death when rushed down upon have doubt that by time messenger have reached camp saying that have got that if there be farther advance will put to death a know that general did not intend to go farther day be of importance in getting troop down before winter set in in earnest have doubt that will send back message saying that if harm come to will in spring return destroy house belonging to tribe think may consider safe will find plenty of employment in learning language may be useful to at time other expect that a soon a leave people here will go down into one of valley cold up here must be getting frightful a there be not tree anywhere near must not be able even to keep up fire a to escape fear will be impossible pass will be closed by snow have doubt that until be sure of will keep sharp lookout after later in day tribesman returned chief came into room by mean of sign few word lisle have picked up when be before prisoner signified to that if attempted to make escape must at once be killed otherwise must be well treated for four five day vigilant watch be kept over then be relaxed felt sure that army have marched away then preparation for move began lisle volunteered to assist aided to pack up scanty belonging filled bag with corn chief be evidently pleased with willingness several time gave friendly nod at last be in readiness occupant of village together with animal heavily laden even woman carrying heavy burden started on way be five day journey halted at last at small village be evidently private property down in plain at foot of mountain a lisle judged at very great distance from frontier line lisle now mixed good deal with native thus began to pick up good many word of language now that be down on plain two men with rifle be always on guard over be allowed to move freely about a liked fortnight after be established in new quarter party of native arrived there be long angry talk a far a lisle must understand be permanent occupant of portion of plain have be accustomed to receive small tribute from hill people who came down to seemed that on present occasion demanded largely increased sum in cattle sheep on ground so many of hill tribesman have come down land be eaten up by amount now demanded be larger than hill people must pay therefore flatly rejected term offered newcomer retired with threat of exterminating for next few day tribesman be busy in putting village in state of defence deep ditch be dug round be surmounted by abattis of bush fresh loophole be pierced in tower stone be gathered in upper story in readiness to throw down on assailant a soon a work be begun lisle signified to chief that be ready to take part in to aid in defence chief be pleased with offer gladly accepted lisle worked hard among needed to give advice accustomed to tribal war men be perfectly competent to carry out work there be three tower capable of defence in whole of villager be now gathered men woman alike worked at defence sheep cattle be driven into exterior line be only allowed to go out to graze under strong guard fortnight passed before there be sign of enemy then dark mass be seen approaching cattle be hastily driven in men gathered behind hedge lisle asked chief for rifle latter shook head have not enough for ourselves said here be pistol took from sword must do best can with be probable that before fight go on long there will be rifle without master will be able to find one be good shot yes very good one very well first becomes free will have assailant halted five hundred yard from village then one rode forward when came within hundred yard halted shouted be ready to pay tribute fixed upon be not chief said if took have must not be sufficient without animal must starve when got back to hill will pay twice amount previously demanded then will come take messenger said come take chief shouted messenger retired to main body who at once broke up when learned answer proceeded to surround village do think chief said to lisle that must hit man who be directing know exact distance lisle said think that if have two three shot must certainly knock over give rifle chief said to one of tribesman standing near now sahib let see what can do lisle took rifle examined to see that be right then leaning down on small rise of ground permitted to see over hedge took steady aim fired man aimed at fell at once well done indeed chief exclaimed be good shot will lend rifle be one of best only got short time since be not accustomed to thank chief will do best then waving arm round said will do more good by looking after men chief went up to house returned with old smooth bore gun bag of slug will do better with said when get close heavy fire be opened on side defender lying behind hedge have considerable advantage almost neutralized great superiority in number of assailant who be in open lisle lying down behind bank from have fired only lifting head above crest to take aim occupied exclusively with men who appeared to be leader of attack brought down several of assailant presently drew off gathered together be evident to lisle from lookout that there be considerable difference of opinion among at last scattered again round village lying down taking advantage of tuft of grass began to crawl forward on stomach although a line closed in several be killed be evident that must soon get near enough to make rush chief be evidently of same opinion for shouted order defender leapt to foot ran to three fortified house there be only three twenty of in lisle saw with satisfaction that have evidently received order beforehand from chief for seven be running to chief house making up garrison altogether to nine men seven be running to of others a enemy burst through bush be twenty five yard from house defender opened fire from loophole at so short distance shot told assailant recoiled leaving more than dozen dead behind while several of others be wounded now took up place in ditch fired through hedge lisle at once signed to chief to order men to cease firing to withdraw from loophole be good to fire now said let waste ammunition chief at once shouted order to men to cease firing to take place on lower story wall of being strongly built of stone be impenetrable by bullet while passed freely through lightly built story above enemy continued to fire rapidly for time then finding that reply be made gradually stopped there be long pause think be waiting till be dark lisle said tell men to make torch thrust out through loophole when enemy come chief nodded after lisle have repeated sentence in dozen different way at once ordered men to bring up rope to soak with oil then in low voice so that assailant must not hear repeated order to men in other house rope be cut up into length of three foot then there be nothing to do to wait attack have begun at three in afternoon by six be quite dark loud yell gave signal enemy rushed through hedge surrounded three house have wall round while assailant battered at door have be backed up with earth stone defender lighted torch thrust out through loophole in upper story then retired again to ground floor door soon gave way to attack upon assailant rushed in in crowd a did so defender poured in terrible fire from magazine rifle head of column melted away assailant fell back hastily think will try again lisle said if have lost a heavily in other two house a have here loss must have be heavy indeed torch be kept burning night there be repetition of attack in morning assailant be seen gathered mile away presently man be observed approaching waving green bough be met at hedge by chief brought offer that if afridis be allowed to carry off dead wounded must be content that same tribute a of old must be paid to take oath that must not in future be increased chief agreed to term on condition that only twenty men must be allowed to pas hedge that must there hand over dead to companion on returning to house made lisle understand after heavy loss have inflicted on assailant there must forever be blood feud between that in future must have to retire for winter to valley far away keep constant watch until spring came again when lisle have with great difficulty understood what chief said nodded can understand chief said think must keep very strong guard night till move away good man chief said have fought by side be no longer prisoner friend when spring come will go back to own people took hour to remove dead of whom there be forty three badly wounded who numbered twenty two there be doubt that many more have managed to crawl away lisle now set to work to learn language in boy be told off by chief to be companion at end of two month lisle be able to converse without difficulty chief have already told that must leave when liked that must be very dangerous for to endeavour to make way to frontier especially a tribe have fought against occupied intervening country when get among hill will give four men to act a escort down pass will have to go in disguise for after fighting have taken place destruction of village even if peace be made must not be safe for white man to travel among mountain must certainly be killed precaution be taken against attack six men be stationed at hedge night two three time noise be heard seemed to proceed from considerable body of men guard fired nothing more be heard evidently surprise have be intended directly be found that garrison be on watch prepared idea be abandoned for lesson have be so severe that even hope of revenge be not sufficient to induce to run risk of repetition lisle did not fret at enforced stay be very popular in little village be quite at home with chief family choicest bit of meat be always sent to be treated a honoured guest in way when return to people chief said one day please tell henceforth will regard a friend that if choose to march through country will do can to aid by mean in power will certainly tell so lisle replied kindness have shown will assuredly be rewarded regret that fought against chief said be misled will not take away rifle from hope for without must be at mercy of other tribe may give up many rifle be sure to retain though there be other village of clan must be easy prey if be known that be unarmed think can promise after friendly conduct to will not be required to make payment indeed for so small matter a twenty rifle assurance that must never again be used against must be taken into consideration when lisle have be in village about three month one of men came up to spoke in punjabi why how did learn punjabi said in surprise why did not speak to in before must have saved immense deal of trouble when first came be man said thought that must speak punjabi did not enter mind thought that be young white officer who have just come out from england learnt because served for fifteen year in nd punjabi did lisle said why nd punjabi be father regiment how long have left six year ago sahib then must remember father captain bullen truly remember man said be one of best kindest officer be father yes might remember too must have be eleven twelve year old man looked hard at think sir that remember face of course have changed good deal since then remember well for often came down line must speak language fluently be fond of talking to father be well be killed three year ago lisle said in attack on hill fort be sorry very sorry be good man so be officer in regiment lisle said left regiment in march to relief of chitral wanted to send home so darkened skin enlisted in regiment by aid of gholam singh went through campaign without even being suspected till just at end went a soldier man said in surprise never before have heard of white sahib passing a native enlisting in rank lived fought with men without being discovered truly be wonderful did not manage quite so well a ought to have done for found afterwards have be suspected before got to chitral then colonel kelly took out of rank made temporary officer afterwards got commission for be truly wonderful man repeated from time native took pain to show respect liking for son of old officer account gave to others of affection with young sahib father be regarded by regiment much increased cordiality with be generally treated spring came at last snow line gradually rose among distant hill at last chief announced that must now start for summer home news be received with general satisfaction for night watch constant expectation of attack weighed heavily upon decision be announced at dawn three hour afterwards animal be packed set out on march have started fortnight earlier than usual for if have waited till usual time old enemy must probably have placed ambush travelled without halt until be well among hill then wearied beast be unladen fire be lighted meal cooked even yet be not altogether safe from attack sentry be posted distance down hill to give notice of approach of enemy night however passed quietly next evening be high among hill camped for first time for three month with sense of security be determined to rest here for few day for have almost reached snow line be receding fast under hot ray of sun be certain that gorge must be full of fierce torrent until abated somewhat must be absolutely impassable week be extended into fortnight a snow melted grass grew a if by magic animal rapidly regained condition strength then started again after encountering little difficulty hardship arrived at mountain home now sahib chief said next morning will keep promise to will send four of men with to peshawar sun glare from snow have browned almost to colour so there will be occasion for to stain face in afghan costume must pas anywhere besides speak language so well that even if be questioned one must suspect that be not one of how many day will take chief in five day will be at peshawar know not whether will find army assembled there to march again into country hope that peace have be settled will take tribe year to rebuild house will be year before flock herd increase to what be before now have found that british troop can force way through strongest pass that can no longer defy white men to enter land will be very careful not to draw down anger of white man upon will have hard year of to

be none whom englishman must look at twice poor thing most of work of village be left to went out to cut grass fed cattle gathered firewood ground corn have doubt that be now occupied with work of tilling little patch of fertile ground beyond village besides lady must remember have vivid recollection of must alone have guarded against falling in love with dusky maiden rather doubt word mr bullen colonel wife said be always very ready to make pleasant do errand to make generally useful agreeable remember that ever ventured upon making compliment before must have learnt art somehow lady laughed must hardly help comparing with woman round really have vivid remembrance of kindness to in future mr bullen will consider a discharged from duty have heard of other gallant deed that have done henceforth will regard with real respect a officer who have brought great credit upon regiment be sure that henceforth will lose old nickname of 'the boy ' be regarded a hero hope not lisle said have be very pleasant to be regarded a boy therefore to act a sort of general fag to hope will continue to regard a so have always considered privilege to be able to make useful to must be very sorry to lose can assure still feel a boy know nothing of world have passed whole time a far back a can remember in camp have thoroughly enjoyed life suppose day will lose feeling that be still boy will certainly hold to a long a can suppose have difficulty in speaking with native doctor wife said at first have from continually talking with got to know language wo say a well a punjabi certainly very well will pas in at next examination wish subaltern be like colonel wife said most of who come out from england be puffed up with sense of own importance often wish must take by shoulder shake well

be to go to bazaar choose present for chief family what do mean to get think brace of revolver good store of ammunition for chief a to woman must suppose get something in way of dress for other men will get commoner thing everyone have be most kind to must certainly like to have remembrance of stay suppose that there be five month pay waiting for in paymaster chest must doubt extremely colonel said will get in time will have to wait have be struck off regimental pay list ever since be put down a dead expect paymaster will have to get special authorization before can draw back pay be only joking colonel agent at calcutta have money in hand have only to draw on so much better bullen be always nuisance getting into debt even when be certain that fund will be forthcoming will enable to repay what owe have enough to carry on till hear from agent plenty sir left money did not care to carry about with in regimental till then expect will find there still know that nothing have be done with short time since paymaster be speaking to about asking if knew address of of relation who be agent at calcutta said to ' will wait bit longer mr bullen turned up quite unexpectedly once before though fear there be not shadow of chance that will do so again will hold money for time be just possible that be held a hostage in case will probably hear of when pass be open lisle went to paymaster at once finding that have not parted with money drew fifty pound have difficulty in buying revolver cartridge be so completely at loss a to female garment price ought to pay that went back to cantonment asked two of lady to accompany shopping at once consented to do with aid laid in stock of female garment silk for chief wife simpler good useful material for most part of bright colour for

before work be finished then returned to mess with regiment suppose know yet whether be coming back to bullen major said sir general did not say for must very much rather join regiment staff appointment sound tempting must say must greatly prefer regimental work especially a must be very much junior to other officer of staff must feel out of place among have doubt that be right in respect staff appointment lead to promotion have ambition for promotion for present major be already five six up among senior lieutenant be quite high enough for one of age well perhaps be right be not good thing for young officer to be pushed on too fast two three year of regimental work will certainly do harm have not yet asked major whether be going up into tirah again spring fancy not already several deputation have come in from tribesman of bringing in fine imposed upon seem to say that there be general desire among afridis for peace that deputation from other tribe will shortly follow be glad to hear sir lisle said think have have quite enough of hill fighting think be of same opinion bullen be joke fighting enemy hidden behind rock armed with lee metford rifle trained to shoot a well a british marksman marching be even worse than fighting passing night on snow number of thousand foot above sea be worse than of must rather go through campaign against russian than have anything more to do with tirah though must admit that if be to begin at once must not have snow to contend with have be through several campaign last be infinitely hardest have not least desire to repeat whether tribe choose to send in accept term not make very great difference have have sharp lesson that will certainly be time before rise again in revolt there may be occasional cattle lifting raid across frontier one can put up with must be infinitely cheaper for government to compensate victim than for to get army in motion again to punish thief moreover having once taught that be stronger than must be pity to weaken still further for if russian army be to try force way into india fellow must make very hot for be full of fight although be independent of afghanistan have particular patriotic feeling thirst for plunder must bring like bee round invading army no thing have be well done expense have be enormous loss serious trust at rate a long a be stationed in northern india thing will be

regimental duty have written home giving account of gallant action telling how be not a reported killed recommending in strongest possible term for vc be greatly indebted to sir feel have done anything at out of way acted only on impulse of moment must not have done better have thought of for hour general said a also reported defence of hut have little doubt that will get well earned vc

england bestowing victoria cross upon lisle general lockhart came down from peshawar fixed to breast in presence of whole regiment drawn up in parade order outburst of cheering from men told unmistakably how popular be with how approved of honour bestowed upon general dined at mess be pleased to see how popular young officer be with men proposed lisle health latter be obliged to return thanks when sat down general said be clear mr bullen that have more presence of mind when engaged with enemy than have when surrounded with friend can hardly be said that eloquence be forte sir lisle

officer wife assembled to see off hope said colonel will come back in course of year thoroughly restored to health be in favour that have not be drinking man surgeon told that be convinced that brain have suffered serious injury that will be on foot again fit for work after twelve month leave moderate a always be must advise to eschew altogether alcoholic liquid men who have never have touch of

here drew from agent sum calculated must last for year at home to great pleasure on entering train met friend colonel houghton have be thinking for time lad said of applying for year leave have earned by twelve year service out here be with general when application for leave arrived made up mind to go home with therefore telegraphed to simla got leave at once so will be able to look after on voyage

sympathy kindness by time voyage be over lisle felt again brain have gradually cleared must again remember event of life stayed three four day at hotel in london where colonel put up then went down

africa soon got on friendly term with be of course obliged to tell how have won victoria cross recital greatly raised in estimation have fine weather throughout voyage be glad indeed when steamer anchored off cape coast although looking forward to arrival at cape coast officer be not in highest spirit of have applied for service in south africa where war be now raging to disappointment have be sent on minor expedition at other time must have be delighted at opportunity of taking part in now with great war going on seemed to very petty affair indeed cheered however by assumption that there be sure to be hard fighting opportunity for distinguishing at least a great a must meet with at cape where so vast number of men be engaged that must be difficult for one officer to distinguish beyond others until started lisle have scarcely more than heard name of ashanti though knew of course two expedition under sir garnet wolseley sir francis scott have reached capital latter dethroning king carrying away into captivity now however gathered full detail of situation from two officer belonging to native troop who have be hurriedly ordered to cut short leave go back to take place with corp to be attached there be doubt that ashantis be one of most formidable tribe in africa territory extended from river prah to sixty mile north of cape coast be feared by neighbour with whom be frequently at war not so much for sake of extending territory a for purpose of obtaining great number of men woman for hideous sacrifice at coomassie be in close alliance with tribe at elmina place have taken over from portuguese year before sir garnet wolseley expedition occupation be bitterly opposed by ashantis who felt that cut off from free trade with coast in return intercepted trade with coast from tribe behind finally seized white missionary at capital sent defiant message down to cape coast result be that sir garnet wolseley be sent out to take command of expedition with three white regiment small naval brigade west african regiment completely defeated ashantis in two pitched battle reached capital burnt unfortunately owing to want of carrier small amount of supply be sent up be obliged to fall back again to coast after occupying capital for only three day have be possible to leave sufficient force there spirit of ashantis must have be broken however must not be done gradually regained arrogant spirit carried out none of obligation twenty two year later having quite forgotten revers resumed raid across prah sir francis scott expedition be therefore organized marched to capital time former mistake be not committed small garrison be left to overawe inhabitant king be carried away prisoner expedition have encountered opposition reason for be never satisfactorily ascertained be probable that ashantis be taken by surprise thought better to wait until have obtained better arm in be successful for there be always rascally trader ready to supply enemy of country with arm on term of immense profit ashantis be evidently kept well informed by of tribesman settled in coast town of state of affair in europe in belief that england be fully occupied at cape that white soldier must be sent again rose in rebellion be ready to admit that white soldier be superior to entertained profound contempt for black troop whom be convinced must defeat without difficulty certainly force available at cape coast be altogether insufficient for purpose for consisted only of battalion of hausa constabulary two seven pounder gun sierra leone have permanent garrison of one battalion of west indian regiment west african regiment recruited on spot few of must be spared for sierra leone have own native trouble garrison of lagos be similar to of cape coast here also trouble be dreaded with neighbour at abeokuta southern nigeria have own regiment while northern nigeria have constabulary of royal niger company have at time just raised two battalion three battery fortunately recent dispute between people a to respective boundary have be temporarily arranged portion of troop must be utilized two regiment be numerically strong company amounting to hundred fifty men be armed with martini metford carbine company have vickers gun battery be provided with powerful gun capable of throwing twelve pound shell men be hausa yoruba with exception of one company of neupas contingent be supplied with khaki before starting rest be in blue uniform similar to worn by west indian regiment there be in addition small battalion of central african regiment with detachment of sikh who also supplied non commissioned officer that men must fight well believed force have be recently organized be questionable how must behave without backbone of white troop experiment be quite novel one a never before have war be carried on by with purely native troop collection of troop be difficult matter cost small time especially from northern nigeria be to supply much larger contingent than others troop be scattered in small body over large extent of country for most part hundred of mile from coast there be great paucity of officer too of many be about to take year leave home worn out weakened by unhealthy climate by prodigious exertion however be at last collected in readiness to proceed to scene of operation picking up troop at several point steamer at last arrived off cape coast not yet be to land strong wind be blowing surf beat with such violence on shore that be impossible even for surf boat to come out officer have nothing to do to watch shore even be only done under difficult circumstance for steamer be rolling rail under prospect however be not unpleasing from projecting point stood old dutch castle massive looking building on left be town on rising ground with whitewashed building behind in town rose palm tree made dark fringe along coast on hand doe look such bad sort of place one of officer said certainly ought to be healthy if be properly drained down to sea yet be home of fever one night ashore in bad season be almost certain death for white man believe that not dozen of white inhabitant be hardened by repeated attack of fever to at least three out of four newcomer succumb before have be here many month if be case here what must be in forest swamp behind be greatly relieved when wind abated on third day surf boat be seen making way out landing be exciting work surf be still very heavy seemed well nigh impossible that boat must live through native paddler however be thoroughly used to work ceased paddling when reached edge of breaker until wave larger than usual came up behind then with yell struck paddle into water worked for dear life higher higher rose wave behind till seemed that must be submerged by for moment boat stood almost upright then when rose to crest of wave boatman paddled harder than ever be swept forward with swiftness of arrow wave overtook carrying on dashed high up on beach paddler at once sprang out prevented boat from being carried out by receding wave then officer mounting men back be carried out for most part high dry although in case be wet to skin few yard away be entrance to castle here everything be bustle troop be filing out laden with cask case others be squatting in paved court ready to receive burden be laughing chatting merrily there be even troop of young girl of from ten to fifteen year old who be to carry parcel of le weight than brother two officer be moving about seeing that went on regularly number of men be bringing burden out from storehouse ranging in line ready for woman to take up district commissioner who be in charge of old castle received lisle companion cordially invited when day work be over to dine with room be placed at disposal a soon a be done went down to beach superintended landing of men store be carried on until nightfall then when last boat load be landed came up to dinner after hearty meal one of said will be glad sir if will tell have be happening here know be that fort of coomassie be surrounded that have come up to relieve be difficult to give anything like accurate account officer said for so many lying rumour have come down one hardly know what to believe one day hear that place have be carried by storm that garrison have be massacred then be told that sir frederick hodgson with survivor of garrison have burst way through be certain that most of force be unable to push way up that post be practically surrounded further on th of april first news that fort be being besieged reached cambarga three hundred forty mile from coomassie three day later three british officer hundred seventy men with maxim seven pounder marched under command of major morris to station of kintanpo after thirteen day marching force be increased to seven british officer three hundred thirty soldier eighty three native levy near n'quanta met with opposition two hour later have successful engagement with only three casualty on th fell into ambush incurred twelve casualty for two day after have more le continuous fighting in charging stockade major morris be severely wounded captain maguire then headed charge

sierra leone frontier police force have got farther position on main line of march be of vital service a overawes kokofu facilitates advance of further relief that gentleman be situation at present so far a know garrison of coomassie be amply sufficient to defend fort know that be short of ammunition also of supply to maintain large number of people shut up there be expecting vessel with main nigerian contingent tomorrow next day hope that reinforcement will enable advance to be made thank sir be evident that be in for tough fighting will have work cut out for there can be doubt of that commissioner said gravely difficulty have be greatly increased by erection of stockade new feature in ashanti war when bekwais put under protection instruction be given in stockading so that might resist force that ashantis might send against doubtless latter inspected defence adopted idea worst of be that be generally so covered by bush that be not seen by troop till arrive in front of chapter

fever here be accumulation of century for dutch governor who be frequently relieved have made effort towards draining marsh improving sanitary condition of place have british governor who followed shown more energy in direction doubtless mean be wanting for revenue of place be insufficient to pay for expense of garrison so town at very moderate expenditure might have be rendered comparatively

impossible to pas without cutting path with sword above bush towered giant of forest great cotton tree thirty forty foot in circumference rising to height of from two to three hundred foot round top of many bird be flitting in underbrush there be sign sound of life thorny creeper bound tree together in small clearing where deserted ruined village stood few flower be to be found here also great butterfly flew about moist air tainted with decaying vegetation entire absence of wind of movement among leaf profound silence broken only by occasional dropping of water weighed heavily on spirit of troop under foot soil be converted into mire by recent rain glad indeed be when reached mansu from village a have be case at previous halt number of carrier deserted in order to get on therefore be necessary to send out to surrounding village to gather in men to take place at same time telegram be sent down to cape coast requesting commandant there to arrest men who came in try to punish a deserter be satisfaction to know that must be flogged though did not obviate inconvenience caused by desertion mansu be pleasanter halting place than two preceding one be surrounded by clearing of considerable size contained two bungalow served a quarter for officer soldier got abundance of firewood from forest place presented picturesque appearance after nightfall with blazing fire reflection on deep circle of foliage march have be depressing one to officer native troop did not seem to find so chattered sang danced by fire three of officer found difficult to swallow food lisle young officer named hallett with whom have be special chum on board ship made hearty meal after be finished set out together for tour round camp to assure that everything be going on satisfactorily must be very different from experience in tirah hallett said yes to begin with be generally so cold at night even in valley that be glad of blanket cloak while among pass be bitter indeed then too greater portion of troop be white though be cheerful enough spirit be nothing to merriment of native then camp be crowded with animal while here there be only wretched carrier almost night be saluted with bullet from height lay down in readiness to oppose sudden attack suppose will have to do same when get into enemy country here be really only similarity between two expedition country too be mountainous except in valley there be few tree while here tramp along in single file through what be little better than swamp only get occasional glimpse of sky through overhanging foliage of course be hot in northern india very hot sometimes be generally dry heat quite different from close muggy heat of forest however say that when have once ascended adansi hill matter will be better hope so bullen found so close today must gladly have got rid of clothes be so drenched with perspiration must have wrung will have other thing to think about however when get across river for think of minor inconvenience when at moment volley may be poured into from bush yes idea be rather creepy say that ashantis always shoot high effect of enormous charge put into musket so that harm done bear proportion to noise expect maxim will come in very useful for clearing out bush doubt if ashantis will be able to stand for moment against bayonet a have weapon of sort good many of be armed with spear be deal longer than musket bayonet be not accustomed however to work together man fight for feel convinced that must not stand determined charge hallett said be very well to talk about charge how be going to charge through bush where step have to be cut however suppose fellow can get through a well a can must be horrid work bullen for of creeper be mass of spike must pretty nearly tear man to piece a be forcing way past in hurry yes be not pleasant idea own that if what say about stockade have formed be true will be even more formidable than bush for little gun will make impression upon say that be constructed with two row of timber eight foot apart intervening space being filled up with earth stone so that if be well defended ought to cost lot of men before carry well tomorrow will be at prahsu say be fine open camp a be completely cleared by wolseley expedition of course bush will have sprung up again fast a thing grow in climate can hardly have attained great height will have difficulty in clearing place again there be good rest house at place hear sha' be pigged in a be at akroful why must build better house there than at other station because when river be full there be way of getting across one may have to wait there for fortnight before fall on afternoon of next day prahsu be reached after march of twenty mile greater part of house be found to be occupied by office store fortunately however two three tent have be brought along troop soon ran up hut of bamboo palm leaf a there be small native village close by be soon able to sleep in shelter prah be found to be full of water be here about hundred fifty yard wide circled round three side of position there be bridge two old wooden pontoon be found relic of last expedition with aid of two old native canoe be only mean of crossing on morning after arrival despatch dated may be received from captain hall gave detail of attack on kokofu thousand of enemy be round that place in opinion advance must be made to coomassie till force be destroyed hour two later runner came in time from kwisa despatch brought gave detail of fighting force at place have have in trying to effect junction with captain column advanced rapidly in place where bush be particularly thick volley be fired into undergrowth by few men of advance guard for have be found by experience in nigeria that if fired upon native generally disclosed presence by replying went on unmolested until neared village of dompoasi native of town have sworn solemn oath to prevent reinforcement from going up to coomassie have erected stockade six foot high be built in zigzag shape so that flanking fire must be kept up from be about four hundred yard long with end doubled backwards to prevent enemy from turning position in rear be trench in must load in perfect shelter seat have be prepared on neighbouring tree for rifleman undergrowth be left untouched so that there must be nothing to excite suspicion stockade did not run across road parallel to distance varying from twenty to thirty yard thus anybody coming along path must notice nothing unusual though must be easily seen by defender road have be cut at back of entrenchment so a to give line of retreat to defender on northern side of village similar stockade have be constructed captain roupell who commanded advance became aware from numerous track footprint that enemy must be in force in neighbourhood advanced cautiously did not observe stockade however so well be hidden among bush just a reached farther end of tremendous fire be opened captain roupell be wounded many of men also killed wounded for moment troop be paralysed by hail of lead then replied with rifle two maxim eleven pounder be got to work captain roupell in spite of wound worked one of maxim lieutenant obealley other lieutenant edwardes gun captain roupell be again dangerously wounded lieutenant obealley so severely wounded that be forced to discontinue fire lieutenant edwardes although be hit early in action stuck to gun gun team be lying round killed wounded ran home shell with stick be shortly afterwards shot in left arm incapacitated from serving gun went worked maxim with right arm till shot in face compelled to have wound dressed colonel carter be wounded in head handed over command to colonel wilkinson who be slightly wounded at back of head men fell fast seven pounder other maxim be completely isolated distance up path existence of stockade be only discovered a undergrowth be cut away by rain of bullet officer commanding d company have be rear guard time consequently have not suffered be in hammock with fever colour sergeant mackenzie be in command at moment mackenzie came up asked leave to charge enemy proposal be at once sanctioned when half of company have arrived charged stockade other soldier officer near joining enemy must not stand determined attack evacuated position took to flight force now prepared to retire operation performed in orderly manner seven european officer have be wounded there be ninety casualty indeed if enemy have not fired too high column might have be annihilated order be sent to colonel carter telling to remain where be till reinforcement must arrive telegram be also sent to captain hall instructing to despatch company to increase garrison at kwisa in meantime two company of troop on prah be ordered to proceed instantly to relief of kwisa under command of captain melliss to lisle satisfaction of company be to form part of force started at two in afternoon be four before got across prah must only march ten mile that evening did through pouring rain early start be made next morning by eight o'clock reached fumsu be held by company of soldier under quartermaster sergeant thomas who informed that troop ahead be perilously situated short of food ammunition crippled with casualty tried to dissuade from going farther saying be simply walking into death trap be not fighting be murder be sure will never get there with only hundred men carrier however order have to be obeyed carrier be so limited in number that only few day food must be taken to kwisa garrison if cartridge be to go on hundred extra round be served out to man in addition to hundred already have so that there be risk of running short carrier must be relieved of much of weight of reserve must therefore carry up larger amount of provision hasty meal be eaten then stepped forward for twenty mile march before during halt found out how native signalled gun be fired from forest signal be repeated farther on continued to next war camp estimate be given of number composition of enemy by number of gun fired force learned afterwards that departure from prahsu have be signalled in way to adansis only darkness pouring rain delayed enemy movement have saved column from attack when march be continued therefore greatest precaution be taken against ambush small party of twelve men marched ahead of advance guard fired occasional volley where undergrowth be unusually thick scout moved abreast of cutting way with sword bayonet difficulty be so great that column moved only three quarter of mile hour carrier struggled on carrying burden with surprising cheerfulness staggering over slippery mud frequently falling gun carrier have worst time of for part into weapon divide be too heavy for single load have to be carried swung on bamboo pole by four men often at acute bend in path whole burden have to be supported by two nevertheless column managed to advance river fum be rising be still fordable crossed with difficulty be now necessary to give up scouting depend entirely on volley of men in front to discover ambuscade one two deserted thinly populated village be passed then after two hour of trying tramp advance guard came upon fum again at point volume width be more than doubled river be rising rapidly there be tree must be cut down with sword bayonet long enough to throw across at last by good luck at distance farther down native canoe be found caught in branch of fallen tree be clumsy craft be better than nothing two native hammock boy two soldier took place in set out for other side when reached centre of stream however eddy caught in instant capsized captain melliss at once plunged into river be strong swimmer have gained royal humane society medal for saving life at sea strength however have be taxed by climate have to call for aid luckily one be drowned intense chill caused by sudden immersion in almost ice cold water bite of ant swarmed over a made way back through undergrowth from spot where canoe have be washed ashore threatened attack of fever be averted by change of clothing glass of neat spirit dose of quinine be now agreed that nothing must be done force marched back to fumsu recrossed river by mean of rope stretched from bank to bank arrived long after dark next day be determined to make trial for long time one be able to suggest where crossing of swollen river might be effected be clearly impossible to build bridge after much discussion be agreed to make raft consisted of platform of plank built across empty barrel be lashed together by only rope at station couple of native took place upon with long pole effort to push against strong current be quite unavailing then something went wrong with rope raft gradually sank men swimming ashore on examination be found that not only be leaking cask gone rope tied together situation now appeared more hopeless than before be lisle who suggested possible way out of difficulty be wandering about deserted native hut when struck to see what mud wall be composed of how roof be supported drawing sword cut large hole in one of wall to surprise discovered that be strengthened by line of bamboo be afterwards plastered over seemed to that bamboo be extremely light a well a strong must be very useful material for raft communicated idea to captain melliss have solved difficulty captain bullen there be doubt that will do admirably in few minute whole of little force carrier be occupied in pulling down hut question arose how be stake to be tied together while matter be being discussed lisle said surely can use of creeper native tie up bundle with suggestion be at once adopted creeper be cut in forest four bundle of bamboo be tied up with cross piece of same material so that must be carried by four men like hammock four of load be similarly tied up telegraph wire be torn down from tree on bank on be arrested nearest insulator on opposite side be broken by shot so that wire hung down to water in gentle curve next insulator being fastened to tree at considerable distance one end of raft be then attached to wire by noose worked along contrivance enabled swiftest stream to be triumphantly crossed load of rice meanwhile being kept dry success of experiment created general feeling of relief on day escort of fifty soldier more ammunition came in to reinforce little garrison at full number asked for must not be spared a rumour have arrived that enemy must endeavour to cut off carrier who be making way up from coast next morning start be made at early hour four river have be crossed five mile of advance have be accomplished without enemy being seen troop began to hope that must reach kwisa without further molestation however in mounting steep rise after crossing river heavy fire be suddenly opened on have first experience of nature of ground chosen by enemy for ambuscade path zigzagged up hill while movement of troop must be seen by native on crest dense foliage prevented men toiling up from obtaining even glimpse of enemy volley be fired to right left enemy replied by firing volley after volley shower of leaf showed that bullet be flying high be difficult for officer to control extended line scattered soldier marching among carrier be altogether out of hand fired recklessly at last however be checked advance guard have suffered fire have quelled that of enemy rush be therefore made ambuscade carried enemy put to flight captain wilson be unfortunately killed in engagement body be put into hammock taken to fumsu march of thirty three mile force then returned to prah with wounded leaving only small garrison of fifty men under british corporal be terrible march river have swollen crossing took hour many of troop carrier not arriving until following day well bullen how doe campaign compare with in tirah be infinitely worse lisle said be only once twice bothered by river country be open when enemy crowning hill be turned out be able to go through pass without much opposition certainly often went to bed supperless on whole did not fare badly at least be generally dry though cold be severe be not unbearable at rate be better than marching through forest in single file with mud often up to one knee above air be fresh dry have not close atmosphere wet to struggle against fellow fight a well a afridis do be nothing like such good shot if have be must have be annihilated must rather go dozen time through tirah than once through country think be darkness in wood be most trying be bleached almost white uniform hang about loosely must have lost amount of weight of young officer have received wound be of so slight nature that have be able to keep place wonder what next move will be at rate will be in clover at prahsu be able to get into condition again by time make move plenty of store be sure to be lying there while expect that hall wilkinson will be on pretty short common well suppose be for best one day came upon swollen river be so deep a to be unfordable column be brought to halt pioneer on being questioned be of accord that must take at least two day to build bridge there be long consultation be agreed that unless something must be done column must retire for by time bridge be built supply of food must be exhausted if must get wire across engineer officer said certainly must build bridge in le time than stated will try to carry across sir lisle said be strong swimmer think must do yes ashantis be on opposite bank must be picked off before got halfway across must try after dark once got wire across fixed enough men must cross with assistance to clear other bank of enemy must find very hard work tugging wire across bullen stream must catch a be a much a can do to swim current without drawback must certainly carry down yes sir if asked for volunteer must find one without difficulty well mr bullen if volunteer to try will of course be very glad to accept offer especially a if keep tight hold of wire stream will only send back to bank a soon a be known that lisle be about to attempt to swim river several volunteer came forward from selected one of sikh soldier not only because be tall powerful man because must give order in punjabi a soon a night came on preparation be completed length of wire must be sufficient to cross river be laid out on bank from spot seemed to offer most advantage for bridge in way a swam out line must go with must be swept across river by pull until touched bank opposite to where other end of line be secured lisle took off tunic putty boot sikh also stripped to loincloth in placed bayonet lisle unloaded revolver put into waistband at same time placing in pocket packet of twenty cartridge in waterproof box must swim better without thing bullen doubt sir want to have mean of defence when get across stream of enemy may be lurking there now before start will get maxim to work sweep opposite bank when get ashore fasten end of wire to tree then give shout will stretch tight on side will send half company over without delay ought to be enough to enable to retain footing until join when be ready lisle fastened end of wire round body sikh be to take hold yard two below aid a swam then stepped into water struck out have swum only twenty yard when sikh cried out have cramp sahib can swim no longer let go hold of wire rapidly lisle thought over position be very important to get wire across now that sikh have gone felt that must pull under on other hand brave fellow have volunteered to go with must not see drown before eye accordingly slipped loop of wire over head struck out with stream so rapid have be course of thought that man be still within fifteen yard of must see faintly struggling swimming with long steady stroke soon overtook put arm on shoulder said will soon get ashore sikh did a be told lisle turned to make for shore have left to dismay however found that centre current be carrying to opposite side a soon a found to be case ceased effort allowed to float down doubtless ashantis must be on watch movement in water must catch eye must hear voice on bank occasionally shot be fired over head felt sure however that be still unseen determined to float quietly till course of current changed brought back to side from started felt sikh grasp relaxing threw arm round man neck quarter of hour passed then to dismay saw that be close to bush on wrong side of river be getting rapidly weaker felt that must not support weight of soldier much farther accordingly grasped branch overhung river pulled in to shore there lay at edge of mud when recovered breath began to calculate chance bush overhead seemed very thick resolved to shelter there for time occasionally must hear sound of voice close by be sure that ashantis be in force there companion must be sure regard a dead when on pulling on wire found that be loose after failure of attempt to establish bridge must probably start on return march without delay have therefore only to rely upon beyond what assistance must get from sikh when latter regained consciousness poured little spirit into man mouth presently have satisfaction of seeing move waiting until movement became more decided said must lie still be across on ashanti side know be here when be able to move will crawl down little distance hide in bush must hide in morning for be sure must not swim back to other side certainly must not do so be in tight place trust that will be able to get out of encumber with sikh said know have risked life to save must not do so again what be life of soldier to of officer must not get across even if be alone at rate be not going to desert now let keep quiet for hour then will be able to move on hour passed silently then lisle asked how be feeling now feel strong again sahib very well then let crawl on chapter narrow escape keeping in mud close to bank feeling way in dense growth produced by overhanging bush crawled forward sometimes water came up to bank have to swim a rule be able to keep on mud be so deep that sank far into head alone showing above in two hour have gone mile be thoroughly exhausted will lie here till day break lisle said a soon a be dawn will choose spot where bush be thickest shelter there be in hope now that be beyond ashantis dare say that will be able to get peep through bush if find coast clear will make way into forest there may be able to gather something to eat will want tomorrow will certainly be more comfortable than bed of mud must get rid of of before leave must be better to allow to dry on sahib white undergarment must betray at once if ashantis came upon for part colour be not so very different from theirs yes perhaps must be better must rub over face a well care for sahib sikh be not afraid to die after goodness to must do anything to save what be name pertab sahib well pertab think that a have proceeded so far will pull through somehow have bayonet have revolver will wash load before get out of will be match then for three four men may come across at rate will shoot if see that there be other way of escape must be thousand time better to die than be taken captive tortured to death good sahib will use bayonet think there will be occasion for will certainly die fighting must rather not be taken alive pertab will certainly fight till be killed can take own life do think that troop will be marched away sahib feel sure that will have only got provision enough to take back to camp a when pull wire in will find that have gone will feel quite sure that have be drowned must quite make up mind that have got to look after fortunately ashantis will not be able to cross river to harass in retreat unless indeed know of ford by can get over a soon a daylight began sikh went down into water washed mud from lisle cleaned loaded pistol then waited until be broad daylight a heard sound to indicate that ashantis be near lisle climbed up a noiselessly a must to bush looked cautiously round there be none of enemy in sight therefore called to sikh to join together made way into forest behind first thing to ascertain lisle said be whether enemy be still here to find out for certain whether friend have left if stay where be can swim river join if have retreated ashantis be still here will know that there be ford if however find that ashantis have gone will be sure that crossed at ford will be swarming round men in case will be impossible for to join must make way a best can kept close to edge of forest soldier occasionally using bayonet to cut away thorny creeper blocked course after hour walking lisle said be spot where troop be last night can see sign of now now for ashantis took greatest pain to avoid making noise until stepped out opposite point from have started evening before saw sign of enemy be bad lisle said can have doubt that have crossed river somewhere be swarming in forest opposite however now that know that have gone can look out for something to eat for three hour wandered about be fortunate enough to find deserted village where gathered banana pineapple of made hearty meal then carrying few banana returned to river swam across finding difficulty in doing so now that be unencumbered by wire have not be long across before heard sound of heavy firing two three mile away be a thought lisle said ashantis have crossed river somewhere be now attacking convoy will not of course overpower will continue to follow up till get near camp there be little chance of being able to rejoin before travelling on more than once heard sound of party of enemy running forward at top of speed evidently news have be sent round inhabitant of many village now poured in to share in attack upon white men be useless for to think of going farther at present lisle said will be mustering thickly round force expect will have stiff fighting to do before get back to camp mean column of course a for ourselves matter be quite uncertain may be sure however that wo be making search in bush a even in ashanti country can not go through bush unless cut path will be sheer accident if come across at rate may a well move slowly on doing little cutting only when path seems deserted if keep forty fifty yard from so a to be able to hear party going along to make sure that be moving in direction be can do of course everything will depend upon result of fight with column there be doubt that be going to be attacked in great force a far a go be better for if be only question of sniping by small body of men colonel must doubt push steadily on contenting with firing occasional volley into bush if be attacked by so strong body a there appears to be round will halt give battle if so may be pretty sure that will send flying into bush wo stop running till get back to river in case when have allowed to pas can go boldly on overtake column at halting place evening if on other hand fellow make running fight of enemy will follow till get near coomassie will have to make big detour to get in will be able to do so have doubt serious part of business be question of food however know that native can find food be hard if manage to get making necessary detour cutting way good deal through bush can calculate upon getting there in le than four day march have food enough for today very little will enable to hold on for next four day moved slowly on firing increased in violence be evident that very heavy engagement be going on two hour later heard sound of hurrying foot in path peering through bush saw crowd of ashantis running along in single file at top of speed hooray be evident that have got thorough licking lisle said will soon be past greatest fear will then be that few of most plucky of will rally in bush when see that none of troop come along troop be not likely to follow up a will be well content with victory have evidently gained resume march waited for hour when be on point of getting up making for path sikh said someone be coming in bush in minute four native came suddenly upon whether came from force have be routed be newly arriving from village behind two fugitive knew not indeed have time to consider threw at once into one of division at base of giant cotton tree division of there may be five six round tree form solid buttress four five inch thick projecting twenty thirty foot from front rising a many foot high thus affording tree immense support when assailed by tropical storm illustration two of fell before lisle revolver native seeing that two men be apparently unarmed rushed forward firing gun a did so two of fell before lisle revolver one of native rushed with clubbed musket at a delivered blow butt end of musket struck bough overhead flew out of man hand lisle putting revolver to head shot other man ran off lisle have now time to look round to dismay sikh be leaning against branch of tree be hit asked yes sahib ball have broken right leg be bad business indeed lisle said kneeling beside can not be helped sahib fate be meted out to have come to now must not drag from here carry must be impossible for weigh far more than do lisle be silent for moment see said that only thing can do be to push on to camp bring out assistance will leave pistol when have recharged so that if native who have run away must bring others down will be able to defend a however remained on foot will not know that be wounded will probably suppose that must at once push on to join companion still will be well for to have weapon now let lower down to ground seat a comfortably a can will leave banana by flask of water be lucky now that did not drink when started to cross river suppose will have halted at same camp a before be long march must still be ten twelve mile away from so fear will be dark long before get there be very good sahib think will be of use oh hope will so now give turban will wrap tightly round leg for bleeding must be stopped see have lost great deal of blood already bandaged wound a well a must then said will take sword bayonet with can be of use to if do happen to meet native upon road may come in very handy blessing of great one be upon sahib take safely to camp a for think that race be run must not think that lisle said cheerily must lie very quiet make up mind that a soon a be possible will be back here for then without more talk made way to edge of path there made long gash on bark of tree fifty yard made two similar gash then certain that must find place on return went off at trot along path be eight o'clock in evening before reached camp on way have met with nothing betokened danger there have be no voice in wood when about halfway to camp came across number of dead body on path looking into bush found many more scattered about be evident that little british force have turned upon assailant have effected crushing defeat upon be hailed by sentry a approached camp upon reply be allowed to pas a came to light of fire round white officer be sitting there be general shout of surprise pleasure be ghost bullen commanding officer exclaimed a leapt to foot be very solid person colonel a will see if offer anything to eat drink be pretty well exhausted now a have got twenty mile tramp before sleep may guess that will be glad of solid liquid refreshment will have dear boy have given up for dead when saw washed down be afraid that be lost only hope be that current might bring over to side again went two three mile down stream to look for hunted again still more carefully next morning be not until afternoon that moved encamped only three mile from river hoping still that might come up before morning started at daybreak morning be harassed from first affair became so serious that halted faced about left handful of men to protect cooly carrier then sent two company out into bush on side went at fortunately fought pluckily when at last gave way left must say at least third of number behind did not stop to count sent small party at full speed along path so a to keep on run then marched on here without further molestation now about how on earth have managed to get in well sir can tell in few word current took to opposite shore lay concealed under bush overhanging bank must hear enemy talking behind screen on following day voice ceased made way up to camp found a expected that have gone a guessed ashantis have set off in pursuit went on through forest of course heard firing in distance saw enemy coming along path terror stricken be waiting for bit felt sure that have passed when party of four men came from behind upon think belonged to force defeated be within twenty yard when saw jumped into one of hollow at foot of cotton tree whole four fired at then a supposed that be unarmed made rush shot two of a came on one of others aimed blow at with butt end of gun fortunately weapon caught one of creeper flew out of hand revolver have in way stuck came right just at moment shot fourth man bolted when looked round to see what sikh be doing be leaning against tree with blood streaming from leg bone having be broken by one of ball well sir bandaged up a well a must left revolver so that might shoot if there be likelihood of being captured then set off a hard a must go to fetch assistance for troop have have very heavy day bullen colonel said gravely how far away be that left man about ten mile must say well be willing fellow be serious thing to ask to start on twenty mile journey within hour two of getting into camp think sir if will allow to go down to where sikh be bivouacked ask for volunteer to bring in comrade will stand up to man lisle confidence in sikh be not misplaced a soon a heard that comrade who believed have be drowned while trying to get wire across river be lying alone wounded in forest declared willingness to start at once will take twenty lisle said will be ample have just come down path saw sign of enemy still of may be making way down to carry off dead if be however astonishment at seeing will be so great that will bolt at first volley be going back with sahib yes must do so must never find place where be lying will take two stretcher sergeant splendid man standing like most of companion well over six foot said will walk a far a be able then will carry when will march sahib be going to get something to eat drink first if will fall in in hour will be with again where be pertab wounded sahib be shot through leg three four inch above knee bone be broken did man get off sahib ca say for certain lisle said with smile four men attacked four fired shot three of with revolver fourth bolted whether be man who really shot comrade not can not say see chance be that be not grim face of sikh lit up with smile paid out anyhow sergeant said think be very deeply in debt lisle went back to campfire best must be found in camp be given to colonel handed own whisky flask while ate related story in full well be fine thing for to have done said colonel most creditable affair know that be pretty good marcher hardly think that after long day work can set out for march of nearly double length have fear of march colonel sikh have volunteered to carry stretcher for will of course not get into unless feel can not go foot farther mere fact that be there in readiness for will help to keep on sikh have done just a long march a have hope that will be able to hold on a long a can must hate to be beaten by native ah sikh be wonderful fellow seem to be made of iron march along a erect freely a start when even hausa yoruba be showing sign that be almost at end of power must say that consider sikh to be round best soldier in world can not beat tommy atkins when come to charge in matter of marching endurance tommy have to take back seat will hold on till fairly break down rather than give in if have ever campaigned with sikh must be first to allow that can march off foot have got spare pair of shoe in kit bullen yes then must advise to take have on off put on fresh pair will take advice sir really think that must be best to follow custom of native troop march barefooted must not do colonel said decidedly sol of foot be like leather must get dozen thorn in foot before have gone mile must stub toe against root projected across path stick to shoe lisle changed boot then went across to sikh who fell in a saw coming have got everything sergeant asked yes hundred thirty round of ball cartridge two stretcher food drink for comrade have got good supply of torch hope there may be small risk in carrying be convinced that ashantis will not venture to return tonight may do tomorrow with three torch one at head one in middle of line one in rear must be able to travel through path better than if have to grope way in dark little party at once moved off many of officer men gathering round to wish good luck safe return four hour took to spot where lisle have turned into path for last mile have have three torch burning in front so that must not overlook sign have made on tree there be sergeant said at last two slash other one be on left fifty yard on turned off when came to here be right pertab lisle said a came to tree allah be praised man said faintly seem to have be hearing noise in wood for long time when heard coming be by mean sure that be not illusion like others here be twenty of comrade with pertab will soon get into camp did expect till morning wounded man said thought that must be far too tired to come out without must not have found must have carried have be necessary managed to hold on pretty well now men get upon stretcher let be off pour content of bottle down throat will keep up till get back for four five mile lisle kept along to mortification be obliged at last to take to stretcher four sikh who carried made light of weight once twice on way dropping shot be fired at party be speedily silenced by volley two from rifle be four o'clock in morning when re entered camp fire be already lighted a party entered troop received with loud cheering called white officer out from shelter have done well fine fellow colonel said to sikh now get food at once then lie down for three four hour sleep will leave two company with think that after thrashing gave yesterday enemy be likely to trouble at rate not before afternoon by time will have rejoined can march on now sahib colonel said thirty six mile march through bush be great deal more than fair day march for anyone be not going to see such good men knocked up by asking too much of so just go do a order may be sure that will put deed have accomplished in order of today well mr bullen said a came to spot where lisle be sitting with shoe stocking off rubbing aching foot so must not outmarch sikh sir did not expect to do so went at head way there four five mile back must have have to give up even if have be told that big fortune awaited if got in on foot must have have to say 'well then somebody else may have can go farther well have done uncommonly well anyhow uncommonly well suppose there be five white men in camp who must have done so much after may be sure that if have need of expedition sikh must follow through fire water if be allowed to volunteer for service must have be glad to recommend for victoria cross for conduct right through affair have got fear that although must get credit for doings authority must consider that did not come under head of deed for victoria cross be given be sure have desire for vc even if two must be given attack be made on following day be evident that ashantis have taken to heart lesson have be given two day later column marched into fort colonel willcocks went out to meet colonel report have be sent in by runner a sikh came along colonel ordered to halt a lisle marched up at head of company made sign to to come up captain bullen said have much pleasure in congratulating on manner in saved life of sikh soldier who volunteered to swim river in flood in order to carry wire across still more for manner in made what must say be record march in country to bring in man who have be wounded in fight with small party of enemy then turned to sikh soldier

destroy stockade war camp former be found to be extremely strong have be manned by enemy work of capturing must have be very serious indeed when arrived at esumeja garrison there must scarcely believe that success have be so complete so sudden bekwai be reached a twilight be beginning here whole of garrison with colonel willcocks at head be drawn up to receive men be heartily cheered hausa company have done such splendid service be halted congratulated by colonel willcocks then after three cheer force have be on foot for sixteen hour be dismissed returned to quarter well hallett how do feel

manage to get picked up small rifle very pretty weapon do know quite approve of regulation in south africa that officer must carry rifle instead of sword have never be able to understand why must drag about sword be of use while with rifle must at least pot of enemy instead of standing looking like fool while men be doing work agree with there in tirah campaign several time got hold of rifle of fallen men did little shooting on own account officer must make good shot if knew that shooting must be of value even three officer with weak company must do really valuable service certainly found so when be with punjabi of course be not officer be really good shot with rifle succeeded in potting several pathan chief suppose hallett said mournfully that about time when leave army a general common sense will prevail sword will be done away with except on state occasion be very good of to look so far ahead hallett show that have abandoned idea of leaving army even if again put on flesh rather wonder that must modestly confine to retiring a general why not strive for position of field marshal who have possibility of becoming commander in chief may be old fellow that if shake together may yet attain dignity be always very jovial on board ship trust that when get out of horrible country will regain normal spirit be not so sure that will get out of country for often feel disposed to brain when wo let alone fear that one of day may give way to impulse must have to catch first lisle laughed a believe must run three foot to one chance of carrying out so diabolical impulse must be very small here be boy with supper have fairly earned to will certainly do justice what have got boy tin of preserved meat sah done up with curry let eat with thankfulness how much more curry have got

must march away to other village until carrier have load when force must return store result of raid remnant of reconcentrating ashanti army be reported to be somewhere in bush east of dompoasi be necessary to clear out before adansi country must be subdued line of communication be at safe consequently flying column of four hundred of west african field force one large one small gun of west indian rifle to be joined by kwisa company be despatched under command of major beddoes against enemy have to strike out into bush by almost unknown road great difficulty be encountered fortunately however captured prisoner who consented to lead to enemy camp on condition that life must be spared three day later advance be made on camp column have hardly started when be attacked enemy held strong series of fortified position be captured one after couple of mile farther again met with opposition enemy time occupied bank of stream maxim at once opened fire on did such great execution that ashantis rapidly became demoralized fled close to rear of spot be found newly constructed stockade three hundred yard in length fugitive continued flight without stopping to man when advanced little farther force be severely attacked on side enemy pushed up to within few yard of men once even attempted to rush seven pounder be repulsed by heavy volley of west indian rifle who be serving lieutenant phillips lieutenant swabey be severely wounded two other officer slightly so adansis made desperate attempt to cover camp be not finally driven back until nearly dusk be found that rebel

complete relief of coomassie by doubling garrison supply of store little party started tramped along intervening fifteen mile much more comfortably than usual a rain have temporarily ceased track have be greatly improved by king of bekwai pekki there be great difficulty in crossing bridge over ordah river gun be at last taken over safely arrived at pekki at past four in afternoon be received with delight by villager who have be in state of terrible fear war chief put house at disposal of officer fortunately attack be made by ashantis hasty fortification be erected rough bamboo barrack built for force here for first time since beginning of campaign hausa received small issue of meat delight be unbounded scout who have be sent out in neighbourhood of town brought in wounded hausa who have be left behind in governor retreat for six week have managed to hide in bush live upon root that found at night on afternoon of th of august colonel burroughs force arrived bringing with fresh half battalion of central african regiment with two large gun two seven pounder raised total strength to seven hundred fifty be decided that must be necessary to proceed without delay to coomassie for signal have be received from fort for two successive sunday there be rumour that ashantis have again attacked column therefore moved forward next day garrison when arrived be to be brought up to three hundred soldier ten white men stockade round coomassie be to be destroyed then relief column be to fight way down main road have be hitherto closed for traffic at first column met with opposition when reached treda people of place fired heavily upon after driving off force proceeded be soon met by ashanti force attacked only transport hospital tactic be clever have formed series of ambush connected by broad path head of column be allowed to pas unattacked then carrier be fired into heavily when tail of column passed ran along path to next ambush renewed tactic plan however be soon discovered in order to checkmate gun be placed in path crammed with case shot infantry be got ready to fire in volley maxim ranged for rapid fire presently enemy be seen hurrying along to occupy next ambush big gun poured content into midst while troop fired well directed volley at when fled in confusion down path maxim swept number of away attack immediately ceased column proceeded on way rejoicing that for once have beaten ashantis at own game arrived at fort at six o'clock in evening found that although garrison have be harassed by sniping serious attack have be made upon be known that there be still four stockade occupied by ashantis be decided that two column three hundred strong must sally out next morning carry two of fortification company under lisle hallett formed part of force under major melliss be to destroy stockade on bantama road while other under major cobbe be to attack that near kimtampo road after have be done arrangement be to be made for attack on other two stockade start be made at ten o'clock at first everything went well basel mission house be passed a marched on without seeing sign of life be believed that opposition must be met with advanced however with great caution suddenly news be sent back from advance guard that village of bantama have be sighted just ahead that enemy be running out from force advanced found fire in village still burning at other end track through divided defiance signal large vulture lying spread eagle fashion showed line fugitive have pursued be followed in short time stockade be seen at foot of slope eighty yard away how far extended into bush on side there be mean of knowing must be ascertained whether be defended for sign of life be visible carrier be ordered to bring up maxim before must get part of gun off head deafening volley flashed out from stockade several of carrier fell wounded by slug rest fled little weapon however be soon put together opened fire rifle bullet be useless against six foot tree trunk enemy be firing on flank be thought that might be working round to attack rear effort be therefore made to cut path through bush under impression that be not so thick inside jungle grass however prevented from being carried out heavy gun be therefore ordered up when began to play upon fort a far a must be determined enemy fire grew momentarily heavier then be seen that number of men be firing from high tree in rear of stockade colour sergeant foster turned maxim upon be severely wounded on left shoulder said nothing about poured shower of lead into tree that be at once deserted by enemy din be deafening white man belonging to leading company have be hit ground near gun maxim be strewn with dead dying major melliss gave word mass bugler form up left company charge bugler stood up waiting for word to blow one of be instantly wounded though blood be streaming down face stuck to work word sound way be given hausa sprang wildly forward dashed down slope major melliss at head contrary to custom ashantis be not terrified at sight of bayonet through loophole kept up heavy fire assailant however soon reached stockade two white men scrambled up timber be slippery with blood jumped down eight foot on other side where be soon joined by number of men enemy however stood ground bravely there be fierce hand to hand fight bayonet did work enemy who be getting more more outnumbered at last turned fled hotly pursued by victor turn in path revealed war camp be enormous one already last of garrison be disappearing in forest taking path afforded chance of safety assembly sounded pursuit be abandoned a company came forward at steady double with order to proceed up road to next village be to burn then return to war camp work of destroying war camp at once began troop lined outskirt while carrier cut down burnt hut then party set to work to pull down stockade turned out to be nearly three hundred yard long crescent shaped fact explained why have suffered so severely from crossfire at last sheet of flame showed that work be accomplished company have gone on in advance returned reported destruction of village behind little force then gathered proceeded to bantama sacred village at human sacrifice have be perpetrated for century place be razed to ground on left sound of continuous firing told that major cobbe be still heavily engaged there be however mean of moving through bush to assistance force therefore returned to fort be late before firing ceased major cobbe column came in with wounded on hammock stretcher first two signal shot have slightly wounded major cobbe white colour sergeant after prolonged fight former have finally turned right of enemy position with two company of central african regiment lost heavily owing to thick grass slow progress meanwhile west african company have engaged stockade similar to one have rushed horseshoe in form thus men have be almost completely surrounded by circle of fire when however flanking movement have at last be completed enemy be charged simultaneously from front flank whereupon broke fled large war camp behind have be looted burnt stockade pulled down gun have failed to penetrate defender be only driven out at point of bayonet after fight of two hour duration loss have be heavy half dozen white officer be wounded seventeen sikh have be killed wounded out of total of fifty who have gone into action total casualty mounted up to seventy chapter night surprise with exception of replenishing supply of ammunition cleaning rifle burying dead nothing further be done afternoon in evening consultation be held in fort among principal officer situation be difficult one immense amount of ammunition have be expended be decided that be out of question to draw upon supply have be sent up for garrison there be still two strongly entrenched position strong opposition be anticipated to clearing of main road round must therefore be required for work seemed to preclude idea of taking other two stockade choice therefore remained of making assault upon then returning through pekki of leaving going back by main road route laid down in instruction of plan be satisfactory for left programme undone be suggested that night attack might be attempted in case not shot must be fired attack must be made by bayonet alone moon rose early be almost high at eight o'clock of course be extremely risky to venture upon plan with superstitious black troop object of assault however must be located next day danger of losing way must thereby be reduced to minimum further be decided that dependence whatever be placed on native guide finally must be eminently undesirable to leave coomassie again in state of siege be clear that only one of stockade must be carried in manner a other must be placed on guard be therefore decided that one on accra coomassie road be most suitable first because joined main road to cape coast secondly because capture of stockade must isolate remaining one on ejesu road ashantis must probably abandon a adjacent camp have fallen into hand a result of decision captain loch be sent out at twelve o'clock on following day to reconnoitre position men by creeping through tall grass clambering among tall tree succeeded in reaching large cotton tree within seventy yard of enemy entrenchment climbing obtained good view of enemy stockade camp behind at moment roar of voice be heard hostile scout poured out from camp object of expedition however have be attained soldier retired rapidly without casualty at five in afternoon officer assembled at colonel burroughs quarter here detail of work be explained to be to fall in at eight o'clock deliver attack between nine ten maxim be to follow in rear of infantry other gun be to be taken only five hundred men be selected to go captain loch company be to take lead a reward for scouting have done in morning major melliss ' company be to follow company in rear be to move to flank when stockade have be taken so a to guard against attack from other war camp early meal be taken then officer sallied out for last inspection of company be by time assembling outside fort gate silently troop fell into allotted position then word be passed down line that be ready officer gave final order to men smoking no talking noise no firing bayonet only a if nothing unusual be occurring bugle from fort sounded last post at start pace be for time good after passing prempeh palace road became tortuous track at yard tall grass became thicker here there fallen tree lay across path dead silence prevailed rendered one nervous at last came in sight of great cotton tree here halted crouched down two leading company formed up be awaiting order when suddenly two signal gun be fired instantly line of timber be lit up by glare of fire crashing volley of slug be poured in lieutenant greer who be in front of column fell seriously wounded then with shout of rage almost drowned order charge leapt to foot dashed forward nothing must stop impetuous charge when reached stockade scaled poured headlong over in front of be war camp through ran road now crowded with panic stricken defender a enemy ran from hut be cut down in number with sword bayonet din be tremendous yell shout groan rent air path be strewn with corps headlong race continued three village have be passed there be fort behind also be carried then there be halt on account of exhaustion caused by speed with have run there be fear that panic stricken foe must rally there be possibility of counter attack by ashantis from war camp to left for be not known that panic have spread to also that too have fled in disorder never to return four camp be burnt one after stockade pulled down force still half mad with excitement of fight marched back to fort number of casualty be very small hardly one indeed have taken place except caused by first volley of enemy in one of house entered child be found asleep have be left behind have not be aroused by noise terrified a awoke clung to white man for protection be taken by to place of safety force reached camp at eleven o'clock having accomplished work with success altogether beyond expectation at eight o'clock next morning column paraded for march down wounded who be unfit for duty be left in fort not long after start scout sighted stockade troop formed up for attack found to surprise that be deserted stockade war camp behind be destroyed without opposition pressing forward passed entrenchment after entrenchment be deserted river after river be forded breast high enemy be met with although of entrenchment be exceedingly formidable must not have be carried without very heavy loss scout captured young girl from whom valuable information be obtained have be sent out like many of other woman to get supply for army at ejesu where queen mother be appeared that queen have be greatly upset by night attack capture of entrenchment have collected chief to decide what have best be done now that siege of coomassie have be raised then be understood why advance have not be opposed for council must have found stockade occupied in force expedition pushed on arrived at bekwai without having to fire shot garrison there be formed up to receive cheer what be still more appreciated ration of fresh meat round of medical comfort be served out well bullen hallett said next morning here be again wonder how long will get to rest wearied body for part said lisle sha' be sorry when be afoot again have be hard work there have be tough fighting anything be better than being stuck in one of dreary town fortunately have escaped bullet have merely have slight peppering of slug a have be put down in report a slightly wounded on three occasion may feel grateful a always doe fellow good to be mentioned in casualty list must help to attain position spoke of other day of commander in chief renounce dream utterly aspire to nothing higher than colonel must really be awful bore to be commander in chief fancy having to go down to office morning go into sort of question settle sort of business think that when get to be colonel aspiration will be satisfied know must care even about being colonel hallett long before get to rank be sure must have have quite enough of fighting to last for lifetime must be quite content to settle down in little place at home marry of course fellow like must be sure to be able to pick up wife with money thought incline way look forward to rag a conclusion of career there meet fellow know lie against other about past campaign eat capital dinner have rub of whist regularly of evening dear hallett think how must fatten out under regime oh hang fat bullen must not matter one way when have got to do up in uniform make tremendous march so on must not want to walk at must have chamber somewhere close to club must always charter hansom when wanted to go anywhere besides fat be eminently respectable in elderly man lisle laughed merrily dear hallett be useless to look forward so far into future let content with evil of today in spite of grumbling know that like life if bullet do spare have doubt that will be just a energetic soldier a have shown in campaign although must admit that have sometimes taken out in grumbling well be very difficult to be energetic in country think must be enthusiastic in anything like decent climate take spirit out of one think must have struggled over snow in tirah a did can conceive wearing dso in european war how can man keep pecker up when be wet through day continually fording river exposed time to pelting rain worse than seeing friend going down one after with beastly fever feeling sure that own turn will come next must not mind so much if always have dry hut to sleep in a often a not have to sleep on drenched ground in open consequently get up in morning more tired than when lie down have doubt that after be over will become cripple from rheumatism be laid up with other disorder suppose will do anything of sort hallett of course fever be very trying although men be being constantly sent down to coast number who die from be not great only six seven have succumbed expect that will return to regiment in pink of condition with medal on breast proud of fact that have gone through one of most perilous expedition ever achieved by british troop more wonderful except for handful of english officer non commissioned officer have be carried through successfully by purely native army think quite recognize at present what big affair have be have marched through almost impenetrable bush have suppressed rebellion over great extent of country admirably adapted for mode of warfare of enemy have smashed up army of well armed native in number ranging from six to ten to one against yes yes know say that have not be well managed business dare say will look back on with pleasure day when have forgotten misery have suffered besides though do grumble hope be not going to stick here long must do with week of eating drinking must be outside be wretched enough tramping through swamp think must prefer that to prolonged stay in hole for once agree with thoroughly hallett be bad enough to march in west africa be worse to sit still be only when try to do that find how much be pulled down longer sit still le disposed be to get up whereas on march be so full of idea that may be ambushed at moment that have time to think of fatigue yes there be doubt of bullen so mean to spend time have to spare here on back sleep if can continuously flatter that will be allowed to do that may be sure that will find ample work for lazy hand to do now be time to buckle on sword go out inspect fellow can see that be mustering already wish white non commissioned officer must not be so disgustingly punctual hallett grumbled be splendid when come to fighting never seem to know that there be time for work time for play at rate never let others play be splendid fellow lisle said really know what must have done without there must be talking of lying down going to sleep if be not there to look after men think must make difference to hallett said for seems to that be always looking after men so be hallett be just a keen about getting company into order a be only always try to look bored over be stupid plan old man for think that get kudos that deserve dear bullen may argue forever if think that can transform into bustling hustling fellow like can tell that be mistaken know do have to do perhaps may not do badly go beyond when say 'do ' do when say so do fancy come to about same thing in end suppose doe lisle laughed a issued from hut poor fellow look a if wanted rest more than do look horribly thin hallett said yes be well that black have such good spirit be always ready to chatter laugh when day work be over be if have not be exceptionally hard one well though care about staying long here do hope will give poor fellow time to get into condition again before starting fear however that there be very little chance of indeed turned out to be case two day later reinforcement arrived from coast to increase total strength available for punitive expedition two strong party then started under colonel haverstock colonel wilkinson be to travel by different route to join hand in neighbourhood of sacred fetish lake where large number of ashantis kokofu be reported to have assembled hausa company did not accompany column being largely composed of newly arrived troop who be of course eager to take share of fighting lisle hallett did little grumbling really felt that required longer period of rest must not help congratulating when column returned ten day after without having exchanged more than shot two with enemy found that country round lake be thickly inhabited many of village have be burnt in case sacred tree have be cut down be quite clear that spirit of enemy be greatly broken that end be approaching must certainly congratulate ourselves upon having comfortable time of here lisle said instead of ten day tramp without great result can manage to keep dry in hut now that men have covered thickly with palm leaf whereas have have to sleep in open pretty nearly night be good for hallett said fellow looked altogether too spick span when marched in be just a well that must get little experience of work have be doing for month saw a marched in look with astonishment at state of men garment rather may say rag must have grown haughty if have not have sample of work uniform looked very different when came back from what be when marched away there be nothing like fortnight roughing in bush to take man whether white black peg two down in own estimation be amused first day arrived when saw face at sight of ration be quite picture thank goodness have have nothing to grumble about in way since got box from coast chocolate for breakfast brandy water at dinner preserved meat be quite different thing from stuff manage to give two three ounce of meat about once week box of biscuit too have be invaluable ration biscuit be for most part wet through there be wholesome crunch in dozen of have certainly improved lot in appearance during last fortnight believe that be due to feeding more than rest be due no doubt to lisle said certainly feeding have have good deal to do with tin of soup said hallett have be really splendid believe have gained seven eight pound in weight in spite of sweltering heat have certainly filled out bit be rather thinking of asking to hand over soup to so that must not gain weight so fast must have be modest request indeed bullen be case of true friendship lisle laughed know how have appreciated loss of flesh be blowed hallett said if must run to dozen tin day can tell must take consequence well really do think hallett few case have saved from fever felt so utterly washed out when arrived here that began to think be in for bad attack same here bullen fought against feeling because dreaded that hospital tent still more being carried down country yes certainly did clever thing when bought up everything must day be in cape coast servant too have turned out most satisfactory poor beggar though weather have be so bad there have scarcely be night when have not managed to make little fire boil water to mix with tot of rum to make cup of tea yes have turned out uncommonly well must certainly make handsome present when be over be awfully lucky brought up good supply of tea with condensed milk be certain that hot drink at night did wonder in way of keeping off fever be so lisle there be nothing will keep wet out at least prevent from doing harm like cup of hot tea with allowance of rum in be sure know what must have done without that tea milk be that must bring especially a carrier be cut down to one man be idea lisle agree that have be saving of be rather in favour of bringing spirit quite admit now that must have be great mistake besides dozen pound of tea doe not weigh more than couple of bottle of spirit must have be gone in four five day while tea have held out for month never be much of tea drinker before be very well to take cup at afternoon tea fight be about extent of indulgence in beverage in future will become what be called votary will cut down spirit to narrowest limit must be running to opposite extreme hallett too much tea be just a bad a too much spirit ah well can breakfast with coffee cocoa next time go on march will take two three pound of cocoa in box many time have longed for cup when have started at three o'clock in morning have felt that must be well worth guinea cup now will have satisfaction of always starting with good warm drink be a good for hunger a thirst have often wondered how must have be fool enough not to bring supply with yes must have be very comforting lisle agreed will know better time trust that there will never be time like for will be ready to volunteer for service in part of world bar western africa say that troop at cape be going through hard time be convinced that be child play in comparison with work here why have hour indeed day sometimes without rain just think of dear fellow just think of when rain doe fall soon sink into sandy soil if lie down at night only get wet on one side have waterproof sheet to lie on just think of yet actually consider that be going through hardship say too that commissariat arrangement be splendid get meat ration day day mind hear even get jam be enough to fill one with envy remember be always fond of jam a boy can tell that when get back to civilization one of first cry will be for jam fancy jam spread thickly on new bread men who have luxury think that be roughing certainly human ingratitude be appalling lisle laughed must remember that there be compensation get fight two three day while have often to tramp two three hundred mile without catching sight of enemy at there be certainly something in hallett said must admit that be great consolation be satisfactory too that when do fight be fired at principally with slug know from experience be not pleasant customer at rate be great improvement upon rifle bullet pom pom shell of size yes even grudge jam when think how awful must be to be kept for month at miserable little station on railway guarding road get restless here at end of three four day fancy spending month at besides hallett in such place get ration regularly have nothing to do to eat get fat if be living under such condition must be something awful at end of six month of there be great deal in hallett said thoughtfully yes know that after gain advantage be not with indeed if have time to go over again must make fairly comfortable in first place must purchase large ground sheet might use a tent must have smaller one to lie upon biggest mackintosh that money must buy then a say with good supply of tea chocolate must make extremely happy can not think why authority did not point out necessity for thing before started must have known be going to rain like old boot time mean of course authority at cape coast because suppose of thing must have be picked up there must have be told when got order that such thing be essential really stupidity thoughtlessness of war office be beyond belief must advise to draw up memorial to pointing out want of thought care suggesting that in room there must be printed reminder mackintosh ground sheet be essential in campaign in western africa in wet season yes cocoa tea hallett said with laugh must like to hear remark of war office when communication be read must flutter dove cot very next steamer must bring out intimation lieutenant john hallett service be no longer required doubt must be case hallett think what inestimable service must have done in campaigning out here be very well bullen must recommend to try eloquence upon someone else perhaps might find someone of more self sacrificing nature who must take matter in hand perhaps might rather fancy must not only man who must do be willcocks after victory have won even war office must hardly have face to retire from service for making such suggestion besides public must never stand be just sort of fellow to carry out idea if took to agree with bullen a in end almost always do must suggest most strongly that lay matter before doubt if applied war office must send out hundred waterproof two hundred ground sheet for use of officer by next ship sailing from england might do lisle laughed if be not that rainy season will be at end before thing arrive here be very good excuse bullen hope that at rate will carry out idea before next wet season begin be if be kept on here a punishment for sin at moment one of non commissioned officer came in with letter hallett opened oh dear said in tone of deepest disgust be off again thank goodness lisle said know be just agreeing that have have enough of place often say foolish thing hallett said must not be taken too literally here be end to meat ration to other little luxury besides have be getting tunic washed will certainly take three four day to dry in steaming atmosphere well dear fellow can put on wet for be certain to be wet before have gone quarter of hour tunic have gone too at rate will both look more respectable for washing well suppose have better go across to headquarters find out what route be who be going a went out saw return of central african regiment have be more fortunate than other regiment having captured razed djarchi have taken enemy by surprise run right through town with only single casualty have ascertained that enemy have be commanded by brother of ashanti commander in chief that have be killed in fight very large amount of spoil have be captured first haul of importance have be made during campaign among loot be king of kokofu iron box containing much official correspondence union jack elephant tail other symbol of royalty together with gold ornament gold dust two hundred pound of english money number of brass nailed vellum backed chair part of ashanti chief regalia robe gun ammunition drum horn also sheep poultry company be at once despatched to sacred lake to join major cramer levy have be told off to act a locust eat up country colonel wilson be ordered to go to accra to reorganize recruit remnant of gold coast force so that when campaign be over must again take over military control of colony be also decided that bekwai must no longer be occupied that store there must be removed to esumeja a whole main road up to coomassie must shortly be open at last be in readiness for general final advance adansi country to south kokofu to east have be conquered road cleared next step be to clear northern ashanti neglecting altogether for present party of enemy between southern boundary of ashanti territory capital be therefore decided to move whole of headquarters staff advance base to coomassie esumeja being selected a point between kwisa to be held in force general plan be to send up store carrier troop via pekki a have be done on previous occasion must reduce chance of attack loss to minimum while simultaneously fighting column with smallest possible transport must follow road through kokofu take ejesu be residence of queen mother headquarters of remnant of ashanti army general opinion be that must be last fight of year colonel brake who be last arrival having have chance of fight hitherto be selected for command whole force be to advance five thousand carrier be required to effect movement there be general joy when be known that bekwai be to be evacuated be dull dirty place surrounded by dense dark forest be in terribly insanitary state european be rapidly losing strength epidemic of smallpox be raging among native of whom dozen more died daily on th of august colonel burroughs left bekwai with seven hundred fifty men three thousand carrier taking ammunition baggage column be fully two mile long have extremely heavy march did not arrive at destination till night carrier returned to bekwai next day so a to be ready to march out at daylight on th with second column troop at pekki being in enforced idleness half of marched out to attack enemy war camp have for so long threatened pekki place be found to be evacuated bush camp on way be burnt second column have now well started downfall of rain continued without intermission road became worse than ever day after first column left pekki colonel brake started with eight hundred men two gun news came in that king of akim have be asked by number of kokofu to intercede on behalf for peace messenger with flag of truce came in from djarchi district appearance of messenger be singular be completely clad in white even skin being painted that colour carried enormous white flag be well received be sent back with message that chief must come in on th colonel willcocks arrived next day whole force started in fighting formation for coomassie where arrived after twelve hour march distance be only twelve mile so condition of road may be well imagined by time column took to traverse chapter lost in forest on way up lisle met with very unpleasant adventure hallett have be sent out with small party of men to enter bush drive out of enemy who might be lurking for purpose of attacking carrier rear guard went distance into bush though came upon track have recently be cut saw none of enemy men be planted on of path two officer who have followed one little distance farther into bush be on point of turning when heard men cutting way through undergrowth behind hide hallett lisle exclaimed must be enemy illustration saw strong party of enemy crossing road a noiselessly a must took refuge in thick bush minute later saw strong party of enemy crossing road that have just passed along there be several hundred of thirty forty halted on path others continued to cut track through in five minute scattered fire be opened showing that have come in contact with troop fire be kept up for time then died away whether because troop have retired because native have turned off taken other line must not be sure later heard very heavy firing abreast of guessed that ashantis have followed other path come down on convoy peering through bush from time to time found that who have halted on path be still there probably in waiting for chief other who be to take command of be in nice mess bullen said hallett by sound convoy be still moving on so how be to rejoin know yes be certainly in hole if fellow stop here till night see chance of being able to move slightest rustle in bush must bring down upon in time firing be getting more more distant moment doubt big body of enemy have engaged fellow have be in good many tight place think be worst of only course so far a can see be to wait till then if fellow still stick here get into path again follow up till come to path going other way then will be pure question of luck whether hit upon enemy not if do of course must fight till last keeping last shot in revolver for ourselves have intention of falling into hand alive going through terrible torture before be put to death really seems to be only thing to be done bullen however must hope for best when night fell fire be lit by party on path beggar evidently mean to stay here lisle said even if moved away must be better off for a column will be ten mile away by now must really have chance of regaining when night fell crept out of bush taking greatest care not to make noise for native be thirty yard away crawled along for forty fifty yard then turn in path hiding from sight rose to foot pushed on found however that be easy matter to make headway be pitch dark owing to canopy of leaf have to feel way at step path moreover be constantly turning twisting after travelling for upwards of two hour came to point where two path met without knowing took one led off to left followed for hour then lay down to rest awoke at daybreak wonder where have got to hallett said be afraid somehow have gone wrong lisle exclaimed after looking round light seems to be coming from wrong quarter altogether must have turned off from main path without knowing tramped long distance in wrong direction believe be right bullen what on earth be to do now retrace step push on chance have choice of two evil hallett think must be better to go on than to turn back in first place however must search for something to eat crossed several little stream on way so think be likely to be hard up for water food must have native be always able to find food in forest if can not do that may come upon deserted village get banana might even steal at night from village be not deserted at rate be useless to stay here set out at once moving cautiously stopping frequently to listen for soft trail of naked foot came at last to spot where have left other track here held council decided that there be too much risk in turning on to main path again a be sure to be occupied by enemy who must be burying dead examining loot that have captured from carrier after proceeding two three mile came upon path on right path said lisle will take in proper direction doubt if will ever get there hallett said be feeling a hungry a rat already have seen nothing to put between lip since started out yesterday morning be little rough lisle said cheerfully must hit upon village presently must not mind if path went on straight hallett said zigzag so much that can never feel certain that be going in right direction well see said lisle have passed two track to left since struck into road can not help thinking that must lead to village that one be following be sort of connecting link between vote that stop at next one come to right old man seems to that will make great difference way go indeed so far a can make out by glimpse get of sun path have turned great deal be now going right back to that from started be afraid be right hallett however there be one thing certain ashantis cut path through forest without reason must not be surprised if come to large village not far ahead after walking for half hour found bush getting thinner must soon see light ahead went very cautiously now at last stood at end of large clearing in stood ashanti village thank god there be something to eat ahead said hallett there be lot of banana growing round village when get dark will get two big bunch must last time utterly exhausted lay down just inside bush many villager be moving about twice native runner came in afternoon passed very slowly at length sun set darkness fell quickly waited couple of hour to allow village to get comparatively quiet then crept forward cut two great bunch of banana from first tree came to returning to forest sat down ate hearty meal feel very much better hallett said when have finished now let talk over what have better do next must say have better keep along by edge of bush see if can strike other path must be useless to go back by one a must simply take to place started from hallett readily agreed to suggestion two officer started gradually worked round village presently struck path turning up again pushed forward carrying bunch of banana after walking two hour lay down darkness be so dense that rate of progress be extremely slow in morning went on again after walking for hour came suddenly upon four of enemy a soon a saw rushed on with yell firing gun a did so be struck with slug lisle be knocked down quickly jumped to foot again revolver in hand ashantis charged with spear revolver bullet be too much for one by one dropped last man being shot just a reached two be only wounded lisle shot must never do said for of to get to village bring occupant upon be of fit to do much running beggar must be sure to overtake be horrid hallett said though admit that be necessary for four day wandered on path never seemed to run straight though found plentiful supply of banana strength be gradually failing on fourth day came upon sheet doubtless portion of officer baggage have be looted hallett who be walking fast passed contemptuously lisle however picked up wound round body can lay over hallett at night will at least help to keep damp off sha' want long hallett said think game be almost up not bit of lisle said cheerfully in spite of turn twisting have made think can not be far from coomassie now thought heard sound of gun morning must have be from nowhere else late that afternoon came suddenly upon great war camp at once sat down in bush what be to be done now hallett said can not go back again be of fit to walk couple of mile lisle sat for minute without answering then said suddenly have idea will cut down sapling seven eight foot long fasten sheet to so a to make flag of truce then will walk boldly into village summon to surrender be bold stroke may succeed know most of be getting tired of war can give out that have lost way in bush if fellow take kindly well good if not will have revolver will of course use on be game to carry out bullen idea be splendid one anyhow be last chance really think must go mile farther know enough of language to make ourselves understood yes what with servant hausa carrier have picked up good deal of language with renewed spirit cut down sapling stripped of leaf branch fastening sheet to walked straight down towards camp there be immediate stir in camp many of ashantis ran for arm when saw that two officer be alone calmed down presently two chief advanced followed by twenty warrior now bullen muster up knowledge of language address lay on pretty thick chief lisle said be come to from governor of coomassie say that must be clear to now that can not stand against white man that will only bring ruin upon yourselves country by further resistance have therefore sent to say that if will surrender small fine only will be imposed upon that soldier may retire to village after having laid down arm while be talking about will be glad if will give provision for have lost way in bush coming here need food if follow into village one of chief said provision will be served to while talk over what say will be glad of peace for see that however strongly make stockade soldier always take men be beginning to long to return to people for have fought many time already have begun to complain do guarantee safety if return with to fort can promise lisle said respect brave men be anxious that there must be end to fighting when be over will again live under protection of government past will be forgotten attacked without reason have suffered heavily for be third time that have have to come up hope that will never be necessary to do so again recognize other valour have made sacrifice hope that when war be over will live together in peace have only be armed a be fortune of war might have gone differently have rifle gun must always give victory in long run will talk over chief said while do so will have food so saying turned led way to house in village where food native spirit be set before dodge have succeeded admirably hallett said a be waiting for meal think will surrender hope will lisle said at rate think will treat a coming in under flag of truce will perhaps send escort with back to camp however be preparing meal for if worst come to worst be much better to die full than fasting in quarter of hour two woman entered one carrying bowl with four chicken quantity of rice other large jug of water smaller one of native spirit not word be spoken while meal be being eaten at end nothing bone remained of four chicken thank god for good dinner hallett said after meal be over feel at present at peace with men can safely recommend chief when arrive at coomassie a being first rate fellow while be sure that chief will be greatly pleased that have secured submission of tribe will be big feather in cap when came in here thought must not go mile to save life now feel perfectly game for seven eight mile march to coomassie at moment noticed that there be great hubbub in camp hour later chief entered accept term bring one of said will go with on condition that if term be not a say will be allowed to return here unmolested that can promise lisle said have not come here without reason term offer be that can accept without dishonour can assure of a good treatment a have given permission to leave fort return to people if be dissatisfied with term quarter of hour later party consisting of two chief ten armed follower two officer set out camp be learned about six mile from coomassie after march of three hour emerged from forest into cleared space round fort when reached outlying sentry be challenged word from lisle sufficed to pas on a approached fort number of soldier gathered round when neared entrance colonel willcocks came out remain here with chief bullen will go on explain matter to chief lisle nodded hallett hurried forward while others halted why mr hallett colonel willcocks said have given up for dead mr bullen whom see over there have be doing now hallett gave brief account of adventure will probably be annoyed at for acting a messenger a have induced two leader of large war camp to come in trust that will be forgiven have promised permission for force to return unmolested to village may say from formidable stockade have made there result must not have be achieved otherwise without very heavy loss wish to say that idea be entirely bullen seemed to be only chance of getting through for be utterly exhausted when reached village think have done extremely well hallett be about to send force to capture camp be glad indeed of being relieved of necessity of doing so mean perhaps saving of couple of hundred life besides must probably not have caught quarter of rest must have taken to bush continued to give trouble tell exactly what term be upon be willing to surrender simply life freedom of chief permission to men to retire unmolested to village be exactly term have offered to of chief who have sent in to ask for term now will speak to accordingly walked forward with hallett to where chief be standing be glad indeed chief said that have decided to take further part in war will stay here with until hear that camp be broken up will then be at liberty to return to own ground thank for receiving messenger so kindly a reward for will when leave present with five hundred dollar henceforth trust that will always remain on good term with do can to aid by sending in carrier will accept rule frankly truly now will ask to come into fort where will be treated a guest until hear of dispersal of camp chief be much gratified by reception sent off escort at once to order camp to be abandoned burnt stockade to be pulled down then followed colonel willcocks into fort where room be assigned to everything done for comfort a soon a governor have retired with other officer flocked down round hallett lisle to learn adventure be warmly congratulated upon safe return lisle came in for large share of congratulation when in spite of protestation hallett insisted on giving largest share of credit for manner in have suggested scheme have unquestionably be mean of saving life hallett have everything to do with except that said be only accidental idea mutually helped other during long day of tramping be most fortunate for that be with for have be alone think must have have strength of mind body to hold on when prospect seemed altogether hopeless a went down to line of company be surrounded by delighted black who continued to cheer so heartily that be time before must get opportunity to tell what have taken place cheer again broke out when story be finished men insisted on shaking hand then started war dance to show satisfaction then retired to shelter erected for lying down slept for hour when awoke ate hearty meal after agreed that in day two must be fit for duty again will mention conduct in despatch colonel said next day have not only saved own life have rendered very important service in inducing two chief follower to submit from information that have be able to get camp be very strongly fortified must only have be taken after hard fighting even then a have happened on previous occasion main body must have escaped rallied again short distance away given trouble of dispersing once more a be have doubt that influence of chief will keep quiet indeed scattered a will be among village will be difficult to persuade to take up arm again on second thought allowed to leave morning with column be starting to collect arm of garrison seemed quite in earnest will have doubt succeed in inducing men to part with arm without squabble detachment indeed returned in evening success of mission have be complete native have handed over arm started off with chief into forest after burning camp razing stockade seemed highly pleased that must not be called upon for more fighting have individually taken oath that must never again fight white men several other flag of truce came in many chief surrendered queen mother most important of leader tendered submission colonel willcocks gave four day in to prove truth of submission by coming in in person shortly however before truce expired sent in impudent message that must fight till end of chief who have be foremost in opposition who have personally taken part in torture death of who fell into hand be tried by court martial shot hanged being necessary to prove to native even greatest chief be not spared certain punishment must be dealt out to who have taken part in murder of soldier carrier who have fallen into hand greatest tragedy of campaign became known on th of september through letter from native clerk who be with akim levy be commanded by captain willcox benson levy have worked up on right flank a advanced from south in same way a denkeras have done on west be a cowardly a terrified of ashantis a other neighbouring race in fact only work be fit for be living in deserted village cutting crop eating up produce three thousand of levy be ordered to cooperate with colonel brake column be met by ashantis bolted a soon a latter opened fire captain benson deserted by cowardly follower fell in letter have sent home few day before death expressed in strongest term opinion of men under command saying if come to real show after heaven help three quarter of protective army be arrant coward undisciplined quite impossible to hold native levy can not be compared with disciplined troop be simply motley mob armed with stray gun arm powder pay be what can loot whereas african private drill duty be identical with of british private order be given to in english knowledge of language be probably superior to of most indian egyptian soldier while british soldier in west africa be rarely able to understand language of men column have started at once to captain willcox assistance returned however in ten day having be unable to come up to a have retired fifty mile farther to east have fighting enemy having gone north ascertained that country immediately to south be free from rebel desirous of peace spot where captain benson action have be fought be strewn with dead body baggage rifle evidence of disordered flight seemed that levy bolted a soon a be fired on then with few trained volunteer white men hastily entrenched held out till late in afternoon when ammunition having run short be compelled to retire did fighting be during retreat captain benson be shot column came in on following day after five day reconnaissance have gone by same road by governor have broken out on rd of june road be entirely deserted village destroyed crop burnt made attempt to search bush on path found ninety eight headless skeleton painful testimony of number of soldier carrier who have died of privation hardship during retreat information now came in to north most reckless of ashantis have again concentrated be determined to make stand on th there be big review of seventeen hundred troop nine gun of garrison heavy gun be exercised on stockade similar to of enemy hitherto have not be altogether successful a be found that owing to large bursting charge range have to be estimated at double real distance six shot smashed barricade be six foot high by six foot thick friendly chief who be invited to witness experiment be profoundly impressed there can be doubt that feat be reported to enemy in field for raised stockade in future reverted to old plan of bush fighting heavy continuous rain be now rapidly bringing on sickness officer be attacked in form be quite novel to know what be matter with lisle said one morning be swollen round neck once have mumps when be little boy if be not so ridiculous must declare that have got again hallett burst into fit of laughter expect be going to have old illness again scarlet fever measles whooping cough rest must see that hut be fitted up for with something a much like bed a possible fire for making posset give be very well for to laugh hallett look at neck well be swollen hallett agreed expect that have caught cold when be wandering about in bush seriously must advise to

others certainly can not make out what be why came on so suddenly only thing can put down to be constant rain that have be having though really see why wet weather must have effect must advise to keep on hot poultice in evening patient came in lisle burst out laughing when saw that be hallett oh have come to nursery have hope have made up mind to go through scarlet fever measles hallett chaff be laughing matter thought took quite in light morning well see have got poultice on orderly will make one for at once face be bigger than be morning what be going to come to can not imagine although doctor said frankly that did not understand seemed to think that there be nothing very serious about next day swelling have abated two day later of be discharged from hospital to great delight for heard that column be just going to start company be included in on following day column started be nearly thousand strong with gun ration for twenty eight day force be to penetrate into northwestern country enemy here have sent impudent message that must not surrender that if be attacked intended to revert to former tactic direct effort to shooting down officer when be disposed of must have little difficulty in dealing with native troop on second day when twenty five mile from coomassie enemy be met with in force be found that message have sent be true for there be stockade enemy resorted entirely to sniping be commanded by kofia one of most turbulent determined of chief attack did not come a surprise for day before number of ashantis have be found in village be rushed active ally now searched wood thoroughly succeeded in ascertaining spot where enemy have war camp have be careful that ashantis have notion of approach number of be shot down by maxim rifle enemy who held strong position on hilltop rushed down attacked front flank number be estimated at four thousand three company on side entered bush soon succeeded in pressing enemy into path where be fiercely charged by west african field force under major melliss that officer be wounded captain stevenson who be close to be shot in chest for moment soldier wavered almost immediately dashed on again to avenge loss of officer charge be very effective of enemy who gradually assembled be bayoneted rest fled captain stevenson death be greatly regretted captain wright of company have asked for leave to accompany force a one have better claim than other colonel willcocks suggested that must toss for did so captain stevenson won what deemed good fortune cost life after fight be over there be short pause to reorganize force advance be made to village three mile ahead intention being to attack next morning that evening however flag came in with offer to surrender word be sent back that offer must be accepted if made unconditionally at seven o'clock in evening chief large number of men four hundred gun sheep arrived said that kofia be holding village farther on must again give fight there force

for purpose column twelve hundred strong with five gun available man in garrison who must carry gun moved out early on th to give battle be followed by supply column bulk of carrier nine mile be accomplished without opposition then small adansi outpost retired on approach commandant decided to halt for night at deserted village be miserable place hut have be burnt by rebel so that troop have to sleep in open in steady downpour of rain european tried to get rest in hastily constructed shelter perfect tornado of wind be blowing swept ground on be built next day troop marched in drenched clothes through heavy rain between seven eight however ceased almost at same moment tremendous fire burst out upon advance guard support at once became engaged enemy clung with such determination to position contested foot of ground so stoutly that two company of reinforcement have to be called up two company be sent out into bush eventually succeeded in getting partly behind enemy forcing to retreat more troop be sent out on left company be instructed to move through bush on extended line in way enemy be driven out of jungle forced to retire slowly up hill then main column started led by major melliss headed by sikh enemy however did not fly major melliss dashed into thick of with few men must collect ashanti fired at at close quarter native soldier ran man through a struggled on ground ashanti fired at major melliss hitting in foot be practically unarmed a must use sword revolver must have be killed have not officer come up shot wounded ashanti a head of column reached spot

prisoner over five hundred have be wounded defeat be crushing one several of most determined chief be found among dead so hopelessly demoralized be enemy that never rallied again victory have be achieved with very small loss owing to excellence of colonel willcocks force casualty consisted only of two officer severely two slightly wounded twenty six rank file killed wounded when wounded have be dressed scattered unit collected advance be made to next village where wearied troop slept a be still doubtful whether rebel might not rally major cobbe be sent on next morning with eight hundred men be to go a far a must to return next evening march be very trying one weather terrible after going four mile reached bank of unfordable river forty yard wide pioneer although have technical equipment succeeded in making rough bridge by afternoon major cobbe decided to push on to kofia at ten o'clock reached place to general relief be found to be deserted troop therefore marched in turned into hut amid howling tornado return journey next day be even worse track in many part be now covered with between two three foot of water bridge though submerged have fortunately not be carried away troop be able to cross march into camp same evening having carried out order without encountering smallest opposition chapter at home be now found necessary to give worn out troop long rest have be on constant service for month stream of invalid have be sent down to coast daily increased sick list have already reached appalling length want of fresh ration be very much felt large combination of troop not only caused great discomfort engendered various disease smallpox among in addition to a black soldier always go barefooted foot have got into deplorable state halt however have good effect there be general satisfaction that be unlikely that must be called upon to make further effort a news came of fresh gathering of enemy colonel willcocks now saw that time be come to issue proclamation

tribe have received lesson will not be forgotten for great number of year long before time may be hoped civilization will have made such stride there that there will be no more chance of trouble have be taught that be absolutely unable to stand against white man that distance thickness of forest stockade weather can check progress of british troop resistance can only draw down upon terrible loss destruction of village crop have received no such lesson in previous expedition that of governor sir charles have be entirely defeated governor killed expedition in met with total failure sir garnet wolseley in marched to coomassie though burnt place have at once to fall back to coast in sir francis scott led expedition for reason other met with resistance now ashanti have be swept from end to

be largely augmented at very short notice most of have learned that even without assistance of white soldier native troop whom have hitherto despised be superior in respect completion of railway to coomassie have enabled troop to be sent up from coast in few hour to heart of country numerous company formed to work gold mine will in prove great check to trouble a doubt miner will in future be well armed colonel willcocks left headquarters staff few day after despatch of telegram rode through two mile avenue of troop friendly native on arriving at cape coast have magnificent reception major
