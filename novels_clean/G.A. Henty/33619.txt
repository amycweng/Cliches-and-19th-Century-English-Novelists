until important decision must be arrived at have be six year before mr renshaw have postponed decision until be too late for wilfrid to enter at of great public school knowing from long experience what must be result be consulted a to marion education mr renshaw have when girl be nine year old engaged governess for without previous consultation with husband simply telling of arrangement after be concluded saying know alfred that have not yet decided whether education at home at school be best for girl have consequently arranged with young lady to come a governess until can come to conclusion upon point wilfrid renshaw be extremely fond of mother father regarded with somewhat contemptuous kind of affection did not doubt that be very learned man have small patience with inability to make up mind total want of energy habit of leaving everything for wife to decide upon carry out must do father immense deal of good if something be to happen must wake up bit get to take interest in thing have said over over again to marion can not understand man having opinion of own about anything think ought to speak in sort of way wil about father oh be nonsense marion one can not be blind about person even if be one own father of course be very kind very indulgent must be very much pleasanter if be so because wished to give pleasure instead of because be easiest thing to do must be downright pleased if sometimes when ask for anything must say positively must not have now something wilfrid have hoped might occur to rouse father have taken place have come in form very unpleasantly violent unexpected paper week before have brought news of failure of bank in greater portion of mr renshaw property be invested letter have following morning be received from brother of mr renshaw who be also shareholder in bank saying that liability be very large that shareholder must undoubtedly be called upon to pay even last penny to make up deficiency news have be confirmed there must be doubt absolute ruin have fallen upon mr renshaw have be completely overwhelmed by tidings have taken to bed wilfrid holiday have begun few day before mother at once acquainted with misfortune have befallen now told that call must be made upon share must more than swallow up rest of fortune there will be absolutely nothing remaining wilfrid except thousand pound have at marriage be fortunately settled upon can not be touched everything else will have to go well be bad business mother will go for walk think over marion put on hat come out with have be for walk long one be now expressing result at have arrived one thing be certain something have got to be done yes mr renshaw replied with faint smile question be what be well mother be quite certain that four can not live on interest of thousand pound unless go into hovel live on bread water quite see that wilfrid be sure see how be to earn money be far too late for father to go back to bar now might be year before got brief at rate must not afford to live in london till doe so have be thinking might open little school somewhere illustration sketch map of wairoa poverty bay district north island new zealand boy waved hand mother be not going to take on to shoulder have got to look after father will be full share of work be sure marion have be talking over only possible thing can see be for to emigrate to emigrate mr renshaw repeated in astonishment why dear boy what must be fit for in colony more than here good deal mother thousand pound be nothing here must be good deal out there must be horrible to come down to live in little cottage like working people here after living like must be nothing out there must buy land for next to nothing in new zealand must employ couple of men to work with to clear cultivate get few cow sheep to start with still have little money in hand marion must look after thing indoors must look after thing out of door seem to count father at mr renshaw said little reproachfully mother wilfrid said bluntly know a well a do that father must be of use to speak of in life like still think must make happy out there a well a here must take book with must inquire into manner custom of native who be bit a good a ancient briton better must say do mother whether be here anywhere else must settle upon do of course must consult must quite make up mind before do so if wait few week for father to make up mind what have better do will wait till thousand pound be spent there be nothing to do to go into workhouse be sure that plan be best for be a strong a great many men anyhow out there there ought to be fear about keeping ourselves have doubt that when get out there father will be able to help in many way though know at present what be anyhow will have house to live in even if be only log hut have doubt have plenty to eat drink be more than will do if stay here must not earn anything to speak of here most must expect to get must be ten shilling week a office boy a to idea of school might be year before got pupil besides when there be two men in family must be shameful to depend upon woman to keep why do think of new zealand more than canada wil because in first place climate be great deal pleasanter in second place believe that a passage money be higher emigrant be of better class be likely to have more pleasant neighbour people that father can associate with than must have if went to backwood clearing in canada tom fairfax have uncle in new zealand have heard say there be lot of officer in army people of sort who have settled there of course know be going to be hard work that will be very rough for father when land at first expect will be better after time anyhow mother think can starve there feel sure that will come to if stop here at rate have better think over of course if hit on anything better will be ready to agree at once whatever be must quite make up mind together then tell father when do tell will have to say that be quite convinced that plan have fixed on be only one offer hope of success of course expect that will see a do if put that if can suggest anything better to be done will set about at once think be pretty certain to let thing go on a arrange mean to speak disrespectfully of father went on seeing that mother face be little clouded know mother that people who be learned scientific sort of thing be very often bad hand at everyday matter sir isaac newton lot of other fellow have read about be like though father be splendid hand at anything to do with briton dane can tell story of old ruin in kingdom be good about practical matter so that take trouble off hand think will be quite ready to agree to do think be best at rate mother think plan be well worth thinking over sooner make up mind better after be great thing having something to look forward to plan about three four day later mr renshaw told wilfrid think a must must see better plan for utilizing little capital than for to emigrate be putting great responsibility on shoulder boy said for disguise from that be upon that must principally depend still will be sixteen by time can arrive there think must be able to manage besides a say can hire man two to help will have money to fall back upon until thing begin to pay there be plenty of woman who manage even without assistance of son know why must not be able to get on with marion to help especially a farming be comparatively simple business in new country at rate a say with two three cow plenty of duck hen what can grow on ground there will be fear of starving next day mr renshaw came downstairs for first time since have heard of misfortune have received letter morning saying that call be at once to be made on shareholder for amount still standing on share sum be in more than must meet even after sale of house content be in state of profound depression have while upstairs be endeavouring to think of mean of supporting family have be wholly unable to think of plan knew that at age must find next to impossible to obtain employment even a clerk at lowest salary knowledge of archaeology must be absolutely useless to for book have already published have not even paid expense of printing few word be spoken at breakfast when meal be finished mr renshaw began dear alfred wilfrid have be talking over what have better do under circumstance have told that failure of bank involves loss of property that house will have to be sold that in fact there remains nothing thousand pound of settlement have talked over in light have quite arrived at conclusion a to what think best thing to be done if see matter in same light will consent to plan have at first thought of starting little school must never agree to mr renshaw said never must do something dear though have not made up mind in what direction whatever be be for to work not for well have already given up idea mr renshaw went on wilfrid be sure that must not like a pointed out money might be spent before must obtain sufficient pupil to pay besides be anxious to be of use difficulty struck of obtaining kind of remunerative work here be have be thinking mr renshaw said will be willing to work at anything in power see what possible work can get quite so dear in country be of course terribly difficult for anyone to get employment unless have be trained in particular line therefore wil be agreed that very best plan indeed only plan can think of be for to go out to new country little money will take to new zealand buy good sized piece of land there suffice to enable to clear stock to extent life will doubt be rough for for time none of will care for at rate be sure to be able to keep wolf from door to new zealand mr renshaw repeated aghast be terrible undertaking besides know nothing about farming fear that be quite unfit for hard work think will be at necessary for to work alfred of course can hire men there just a can in england believe native be willing to work at very low rate of pay so need have difficulty on score wilfrid be growing up now will soon be able to relieve of responsibility then will be able to devote to favourite study must think that book from hand upon native manner custom must be sure to be great success accustomed a be to tracing thing up from small remains with knowledge of primitive people work must be very different from written by men without previous acquaintance with such matter idea certainly plea mr renshaw said of course will want time to think over startling proposal helen of course dear in meantime will go on packing up preparing to move at once from here a say that there must be sale of everything then can think matter over if decide upon better scheme than ours can carry out if not will be ready to put ours into execution next month be busy one there be great sympathy evinced by renshaw neighbour acquaintance when be heard that whole fortune be swept away by failure of bank there be farewell visit to be paid not only to to poorer neighbour in answer to inquiry a to plan mr renshaw always replied that at present nothing be settled mr renshaw hinted that although plan be not definitely fixed thought probable that must go abroad while wilfrid marion informed friend confidently that be going to new zealand work of packing went on few article of furniture be special favourite with be packed up sent to be warehoused in london in order that might day be forwarded to when have made home nothing else be taken beyond clothes good selection of book for general reading large box of mr renshaw declared absolutely indispensable to few nick nacks specially prized everything else be handed over for sale for benefit of creditor of bank during week mr renshaw continued to speak a if regarded new zealand project a wholly impracticable on occasion when did so wife replied cheerfully well dear be in way wedded to be quite ready to give up adopt plan may decide upon matter be entirely in hand mr renshaw must hit upon other scheme indeed wife suggestion a to book on native of new zealand have much taken fancy certainly trained antiquarian must be able to produce book upon subject must be of vastly greater value than written by settler others having training whatever must qualify for such work be probable that must be able to throw entirely new light upon origin history of maori native of new zealand that book must greatly add to reputation must sell well really idea be not such very bad one for must certainly prefer life in new country to shabby lodging in out of way place after having for so many year be personage of importance in own neighbourhood see one great objection to scheme helen be that there be war going on with maori know there be mr renshaw who have talked matter over with wilfrid replied be confined to two three of tribe settler in other part have be in way disturbed troop have taken most of stronghold trouble be considered to be approaching end therefore think there be occasion to be uneasy on score besides in respect trouble will be advantageous a must probably be able to buy land cheaper than otherwise must have done land will rapidly rise in value again when disturbance be over of course must not go to disturbed district be round auckland new plymouth trouble be confined to tribe there everything be perfectly peaceable along other part of coast be not until two three day before move be to be made from house that mr renshaw recurred to subject have not said yet alfred what plan have decided upon a will leave here in three day be quite time that made up mind about a of course movement must depend on decision if have fixed upon place for to settle down in must be cheaper for to move there at once instead of wasting money by going up to london first reason have for asking be that robert william grimstone gardener son who have got idea from something wilfrid said to that might be going abroad have asked to ask if must take with have be working in garden under father for last two three year be strong active young fellow of nineteen twenty a father have worked here ever since came have known young fellow since be child such arrangement must have be very pleasant one have liked plan of emigrating a must have be much more agreeable having two young fellow knew with instead of stranger of course told wilfrid to tell that nothing be settled that plan be not in way formed that have better therefore look out for situation about here be sure must give good letter of recommendation mr renshaw be silent really see that there be occasion to come to decision in hurry said irritably not in hurry alfred wife said quietly see have have month to think over see that will be more likely to settle upon advantageous scheme at end of six month than be now from day leave here hand over everything to receiver of bank will be drawing on little capital pound be of importance think therefore alfred that must make up mind before leave here a to what course be going to adopt a have said see scheme by be likely to be able to maintain ourselves in england even in very humble way life in colony must to be very much more pleasant than struggle to make end meet here must afford opening for wilfrid be vastly more advantageous for than anything must hope to get for here think will be far better for marion too of course if decided to emigrate must must prefer go to canada australia united state in preference to new zealand only incline to new zealand because have heard that there be larger proportion of officer gentleman there than in other colony because believe that climate be particularly pleasant one of course be merely suggestion at present be for to decide if be to emigrate at mr renshaw replied must certainly prefer new zealand maori be most interesting people origin be matter of doubt custom religion be peculiar have doubt must after studying be able to throw much new valuable light upon subject personally be sure that be in way fitted for life of settler know nothing of farming must neither drive plough wield axe if must make native subject own might probably be able to do share towards expense by book while wilfrid must look after men offer of two young fellow to go with have removed several of objection to plan agree with that must be more advantageous for wilfrid marion than to be living in wretched lodging therefore dear have decided to fall in with plan only hope that will turn out a well a seem to expect will be great change great trial since seem to have set heart upon be willing to adopt plan instead of own will therefore consider settled that will go to new zealand mr renshaw be too wise woman to point out that husband have not so far a be aware plan of own contented by saying quietly be glad have decided so dear do think be best thing for be quite sure be best for wilfrid marion if have not be for must have said let take tiny cottage near town where might add to income by giving lesson in music other thing might have companionship of people of own taste being a be think far better to give start in new country although know that life a will lead there must entail at rate at first hardship loss of much to have be accustomed wilfrid marion be delighted when heard from mother that matter be settled have have great hope that wilfrid scheme must be finally accepted a there did not seem other plan be possible still wilfrid knew difficulty that father must have in making up mind feared there might be long delay before must bring to accept plan proposed to mr renshaw who be good business woman lost time in arranging with robert william grimstone a to accompanying passage money be to be paid be to bind to remain for three year in mr renshaw service on wage similar to must have obtained at home after that be to be paid might be colonial rate of wage excitement that prospect of emigration caused to young people lessened pain at leaving house where have be born brought up with pleasant association material comfort be however very trying to when bade good bye for last time to surroundings shook hand with old servant if ever get rich in new zealand father wilfrid said will come back buy house again mr renshaw shook head just at present be disposed to regard a martyr considered that have made unprecedented sacrifice of own wish comfort for sake of child that good must be expected to arise from plan to have consented good many friend have gathered at station to say good bye be time after train have started on way to london before of party felt inclined to speak on arriving in town went at once to lodging have engaged in eastbourne terrace facing station once settled there time be lost in making preparation for voyage file of advertisement have already be searched name of vessel sailing for new zealand address of owner noted after paying visit to several shipping office choice of vessel remained at last between flying scud mayflower be vessel of about same size bore good reputation a sailers heard excellent account of captain who commanded mayflower be to sail direct to wellington round cape flying scud be taking in cargo for rio buenos ayres must proceed thence via cape horn rate of passage be somewhat lower than of mayflower a route via cape of good hope be that more generally used number of passenger who have secured berth by be very much smaller than who intended to travel by mayflower be principally decided in choosing western route mr renshaw be in depressed nervous state wife considered that must be far more comfortable with comparatively small number of fellow passenger than in crowded ship marion quite agreed with mother wilfrid be also in favour of flying scud a thought must be pleasant to break passage by putting into great south american port getting glimpse of inhabitant mr renshaw be quite satisfied to accept wife decision whatever might be flying scud be therefore selected passage for party secured in chapter ii embarkation flying scud be to sail in ten day be ample time for preparation for mr renshaw wisely decided that be better to buy be requisite for starting new life in new zealand have none of least idea what will be required said will be far better to pay somewhat higher price for what really do want out there than to cumber with sort of thing may be useless to have already considerable amount of baggage there be clothes linen book father two double barrelled gun by way think have ever used since have be married only thing have better get a far a see will be four rifle doubt can buy cheap second hand four revolver for moment suppose will ever want to use a may be often left in house alone think must be pleasant to know that be not altogether defenceless have better lay in good stock of ammunition for weapon besides clothes have have better get serge dress suit for voyage few strong servicable gown suit for rough work out there beyond think that need spend penny can certainly get everything will want for new life at wellington be large place on morning of day on be to embark grimstones came up from reading heavy luggage have be sent on board ship on previous day at twelve

ample room for two on own bunk be piled two portmanteau gun case bundle of fishing rod other odds end somewhat similar collection of luggage be on opposite wilfred read name on label atherton said wonder what be like do hope will be nice fellow scarcely have thought passed through mind when figure appeared at cabin door be that of tall stout man with immensely broad shoulder age wilfrid guessed to be about thirty five have pleasant face there be humorous twinkle in eye a lad looked round in astonishment at figure completely blocking up doorway so be renshaw big man said congratulate that dimension be not of largest name be atherton a daresay have seen on luggage suppose shake hand renshaw be just a well to make friend at once a have got to put up with other for next five six month of course be little appalled at size went on a shook hand with lad most people be at first nobody be so much appalled a be still have amusing side know often get into omnibus because think be fair if be driven to do so there happen to be five people on side expression of alarm on ten face when appear at door be picture because be manifestly impossible that can make room for on side what do do sir wilfrid asked laughing ask one of to change side leaf two place vacant a make point of paying for two get on comfortably enough be fortunate there be only two of in cabin if have bad luck to travel in full ship always wait until others be in bed before turn in get up in morning before be astir think can manage pretty comfortably then have travelled good deal sir wilfrid said be always travelling other replied be like fidgetty phil of story book who must never keep still most men of size be content to take life quietly be not so with for last twelve thirteen year have be always on move ought to be worn down to thread paper unfortunately a see be not effect of travel in case suppose be going out to settle yes sir have father mother sister on board lucky fellow mr atherton said have relation worth speaking of be going to settle at last sir wilfrid asked be going out to botanize have mania for botany new zealand know be in respect one of most remarkable region in world have not yet be explored with anything approaching accuracy be grand field for discovery there be special point of interest connected with a form sort of connecting link between flora of australia asia south america have flora of own entirely distinct from of now let advise a to stowing away of trap there be good deal of knack in thing have got portmanteau packed so that one contains thing be likely to require for say first month of voyage other a reserve to be drawn on occasionally because if not must advise to take thing out to arrange in way will take little time perhaps will save immense amount of trouble throughout voyage wilfrid have packed trunk with thing a came to hand saw advantage of following fellow passenger advice accordingly opened portmanteau piled whole of content upon berth then repacked mr atherton sitting down on berth giving advice a to trunk in article must be placed work of rearrangement occupied hour wilfrid often congratulated during voyage upon time so spent when be complete cabin arranged tidily wilfrid looked in at next cabin be occupied by two young men of name of allen be friend of acquaintance of mr renshaw who hearing that be journeying by same ship to new zealand have brought down to eastbourne terrace introduced to mr renshaw family two be occupied in arranging thing in cabin well renshaw james elder of said when entered be afraid can not congratulate on fellow passenger saw go into cabin be tremendous man must be magnificent if be not so stout why will scarce find room to move be capital fellow wilfrid said think will get on splendidly together be full of fun make sort of joke about own size have travelled tremendous lot be up to everything be nothing like so old a must think if have not seen face think be above thirty five so well a see have just finished will go up see how be getting on when wilfrid reached deck found vessel be off erith be greeted by sister silly boy have be missing sight of shipping of greenwich hospital idea of stopping below time must have come to call up if have known be room cabin goose wilfrid said idea of talking of room on board ship must have come up if have thought of be so busy putting thing to right making acquaintance of gentleman in cabin with that forgot altogether be moving down river be wilfrid wilfrid laughed nodded in direction of mr atherton who be standing with back towards short distance away marion eye opened wide oh wil what big man must quite fill up cabin seems awfully good fellow marion daresay may be wil will certainly take up more than share of cabin be awkward be young lady mr atherton said suddenly turning round on heel to marion horror while wilfrid flushed scarlet for have not least idea that word must be heard have capital hearing see mr atherton went on with laugh very useful sense be sometimes have stood in good service upon many occasion though own that effectually prevents cherishing illusion a to personal appearance be sister of course renshaw in fact anyone must see at glance there be nothing like making acquaintance early on voyage first day be in respect most important of why be that marion asked because a rule order in people sit down to table on first day of voyage be that in sit whole time now if one happens to sit one down by people who turn out disagreeable be very great nuisance therefore be very important to find out little about one fellow passenger first day so a to take seat next to someone whom be not likely to quarrel with before have be week at sea then arrange place for mr atherton oh captain perhaps settle a to who be to sit up by if there be anyone of special importance governor vice governor other big wig wife if have got one will probably sit next to captain on one side if not will choose someone who have be specially introduced to who have sailed with before steward before party sit down put name on plate everyone else shift for renshaw will be glad if will introduce to father mother if get on well will go down below arrange that get place together have be chatting with first officer who be very pleasant fellow have sailed with before rule be sits at end of table facing captain experience be that when first officer happens to be good fellow be not always case end of table be most pleasant place there be generally more fun laughing at end than there be at other for people who fancy that be of importance make point of getting seat a near a can to captain important people be not a rule anything like a pleasant a rest of wilfrid walked across deck with mr atherton to point where father mother be sitting mother be mr atherton who be in cabin mr atherton shook hand with mr mr renshaw asked son to introduce at once mr renshaw because a have be telling good deal of comfort of voyage depends upon making snug little party to sit together at meal there be nothing dread more than being put down between two acidulated woman who make point of showing by manner time one sits down that consider one be taking up great deal more than one share of seat mr renshaw smiled must think people be not often a rude a can assure that be rule rather than exception mr renshaw be not particularly sensitive man think make point of avoiding crowded railway carriage being unable to withstand expression of blank dismay come over face of people when present at door have thought sometimes of hiring little boy of about four year old to go about with a two of must then only take up fair share of space have be looking to cabin arrangement find seat hold three son daughter be of bulky so if wo mind sitting little close will be conferring genuine kindness upon will not mind at wilfrid marion exclaimed together for there be something so pleasant about mr atherton manner felt that must be delightful companion very well then will regard that a settled then five will occupy seat on one side of chief officer will get two allen opposite wilfrid put in will look about for three others to make up what may call party who do fancy mr renshaw now look round fix on somebody will undertake duty of engineering business there be two girl sister in cabin marion said think seem nice be going out alone to join father mother in new zealand in case mr renshaw have better leave matter in hand will be very simple mr atherton a have already spoken to at once got up moved across to two girl of about thirteen seventeen respectively who be standing together watching passing ship entered into conversation with when proposed that a be in same cabin with marion must sit near other at

sure that will enjoy voyage very much chapter iii voyage in addition to already named flying scud carried twenty other cabin passenger took emigrant forward a be full of cargo be not moreover going direct to new zealand there be therefore only three four young men in addition to grimstones forward fine weather have favoured start accompanied down channel across bay life went on quietly on board be early in may when started evening be still too chilly to permit of sojourn on deck after sunset day however weather grew warmer by time vessel be off coast of portugal evening be warm balmy be not at what expected marion renshaw said a sat in deck chair to mr atherton who be leaning against bulwark smoking cigar thought be going to have storm one be going to be sea sick be what be like in book have read be sure have not felt least bit ill from time started have have everything in favour there have be just enough breeze to take along at fair rate with light canvas set yet not enough to cause more than ripple on sea ship have be a steady a if in port must not flatter be going to last time think will have change before long glass have fallen little wind have shifted quarter two three time during day sky too doe not look so settled a have done think will have blow before long what storm mr atherton say that wind enough to get up bit of sea to make landsman feel very uncomfortable suppose must not be ill now even if be rough after being week at sea think must be likely to be ill so long a might have be have encountered gale directly got out of river think that if come on rough addicted to sea sickness be likely to suffer more le people be ill time rough weather come along however long voyage suppose know yet whether be good sailor not marion shook head have be at seaside almost year have never gone out in boat much there papa be always too busy to go think like get bad headache even if be ill so very seldom went out never when be least rough mr atherton prediction turned out well founded wind got up during night be blowing freshly in morning only two three of lady passenger made appearance at breakfast several of gentleman be also absent wilfrid to great satisfaction felt so far symptom of impending illness two allen be obliged to keep on deck during meal being unable to stand motion below be well enough to enjoy cup of tea plate of cold meat wilfrid carried up to hour two later went below wind be rising sea hourly getting up marion came up after breakfast for time afterwards walked up down on deck with wilfrid enjoying brisk air considering great fun to try to walk straight up down swaying deck presently however laugh became subdued cheek lost colour be afraid be going to be ill wilfrid will stay on deck if can both mitford be ill be sure for of got up though declared that felt nothing matter with have made up mind to stay on deck a long a possibly can be best way mr atherton said a joined in walk caught last sentence there be nothing like keeping up a long a possible because if do so will sometimes pas off after short time whereas if give up take to berth be sure to run course be longer shorter according to circumstance sometimes two day sometimes five must say that people who be what may call fair sailor generally get over in two day unless weather be very bad so fight against a long a can when can not bear longer will wrap up in rug will have great chair to curl up in close by lee bulwark determination go long way may get over yet take arm wo throw off balance while if vessel give sharper roll than usual brother may both lose foot together a soon a started on walk mr atherton began amusing story of adventure of in western state of america marion be so interested that forgot about uncomfortable sensation be astonished when on hearing lunch bell ring discovered be getting perfectly well where be wilfrid asked there be leaning over lee bulwark fiend of sea sickness have in grip only think of wilfrid being unwell being right have quite driven away mr atherton for be feeling very poorly when began to walk with will go down get luncheon bring up here to curl up in chair until return think more about motion than can help have better not go near brother people who be ill hate being pitied hour later wilfrid went below in evening however wind dropped considerably next morning sea be sparkling in sunlight flying scud be making way along with scarcely perceptible motion thenceforth weather be delightful throughout voyage to rio passenger found upon closer acquaintance that got on well together day passed away pleasantly in evening piano be brought up from cabin on to deck for two three hour there be singing varied by occasional dance among young people from day of leaving england mr atherton have be leading spirit on board ship if misunderstanding arose acted a mediator be ever ready to propose pastime amusement to lighten monotony of voyage took leading part in concert held on deck when evening be calm clear be full of resource invention with four five child on board be prime favourite mr renshaw often wondered at patience good temper with submitted to whim be ready to give up whatever be doing to submit to order have before have be ten day at sea talked over with mr renshaw latter plan advised upon account to be in hurry to snap up first land offered to people who come out to colony said get heavily bit at first by listening to land agent allowing to be persuaded into buying property when come to take possession of be in majority of case almost worthless must advise when get there to hire house in wellington where can leave wife daughter while examine various district see offer greatest advantage if feel equal to let son go in place be think sharp young fellow not likely to be easily taken in at rate when have made report a to place seem most suitable can go see relative advantage before purchasing 'there be greater mistake than buying land in locality of know nothing may find that road be impracticable that have mean of getting produce to market after while will be glad to sell place for mere song shift to might at first have obtained at price much lower than gave for worthless farm have knocked about in state good deal have known score of men ruined by being too hasty in making choice want to be in colony six month at least before investing money in land so a to know something of capability advantage of district to young man must say travel about in colony working way making stay of month here month there of course in case be out of question personal examination of place offered to in nine case out of ten men be ready to sell for le than have cost will ensure against absolute swindling what be going to do mr atherton have come out simply to study botany of island may stay in colony for month for year at rate if depute wilfrid to travel about to examine various district where land can be bought will be glad to accompany a will also be on look out be not thinking of farming mr atherton own idea be to take bit of land on one of river to get up hut to serve a head quarter to spend much of time in travelling about be very fortunately placed have ample fund to enable to live in comfort be free to indulge fancy for wandering a please consider have be spoiled by being own master too young think be bad for young man to start in life with competence when come to one in middle age when one have learned to spend rationally be undoubtedly very great comfort advantage suppose however that time will come when will settle down be thirty five ought to 'range a french say mr atherton have not be long upon voyage when discovered that chance of success of renshaw party a settler must be small indeed if depended upon exertion of head of family have not be more than day two on board before mr renshaw began to discus favourite hobby with confided to that intended thoroughly to investigate history custom religion of maori to produce exhaustive work on subject excellent idea very stout man said encouragingly one demanding great time investigation perhaps added doubtfully one more suited to single man who can go live among native speak language than for married man with family to look after mr renshaw waved remark aside lightly will of course set to work immediately arrive to acquire thorough knowledge of language indeed have already begun with small dictionary new testament in maori language brought out by missionary society a to family exertion in farming way will be of use to wife daughter will look after house wilfrid will undertake management of men out of door whole scheme be theirs must be of assistance to bent lie entirely in direction of archaeology there can be little doubt that thorough acquaintance with relating to habit so far a be known of language of ancient briton saxon dane native of northern part of island will be of inestimable advantage in enabling to carry out subject have resolved to take up there be analogy similarity between habit of primitive people one accustomed to study of early race of europe can form general opinion of habit mode of living of tribe merely from inspection of ancient weapon two bracelet potsherd mr atherton looked down upon companion with half closed eye seemed to be summing up mentally after short conversation turned away a filled pipe muttered to be well for family that mother seems capable sensible woman that lad unless be mistaken have dogged resolution about a well a spirit courage girl too be bright sensible lass may get on in spite of idiot of father however man show that posse certain amount of sense by confidence with throw burden of whole business of providing living for family on shoulder of course must be much better without for can foresee will give awful lot of trouble will go mooning away among native will be getting lost not heard of for tremendous time still know that will come to much harm maori have fine trait of character though have be fighting about what call king question have seldom be guilty of act of hostility to isolated settler single white man going among have always be received hospitably besides will probably think mad savage have always sort of respect for madman still will be terrible worry to family have taken fancy to others if can do good turn out there in way will a voyage went on mr atherton liking for mr renshaw son daughter increased greatly while contempt for mr renshaw became modified a came to know better found that be really capable man in own particular hobby that although weak indecisive be very kind affectionate with wife child reposed almost childlike confidence in wife good sense madeira have be sighted lying like great cloud on horizon indeed young renshaws have difficulty when came up on deck in morning in believing that be really land saw stay be made here did catch glimpse of canary island being too far to west to see even lofty peak of teneriffe first time ship dropped anchor be at st jago one of cape de verde island here took in supply of fresh water meat vegetable passenger landed be much disappointed with sandy uninteresting island be consolation for to learn from captain that part of island be much more fertile although vegetable fruit came for most part from other island now said if go well will see land again till get to rio will keep to east of st paul unless get blown out of course will not go near ascension a wind continued favourable ship kept course at twelve o'clock one day captain after taking observation told that expected to be in rio on following evening next morning when came up on deck land be in sight in evening dropped anchor in harbour of rio one of finest port in world yes be splendid harbour mr atherton agreed a listened to exclamation of delight of renshaws know that be finest be certainly equal to have ever seen a harbour new york be better because even more landlocked san francisco be in respect in point of scenery superb bombay be grand harbour exposed to certain wind taken altogether think must give palm to san francisco few minute after anchor have dropped number of shore boat came alongside filled with luscious fruit rowed for most part by negro who chatted shouted gesticulated making such din that be impossible to distinguish single word amid uproar wilfrid allen others quickly ran down ladder without troubling to bargain returned with quantity of fruit several negress soon followed on to deck going up to lady produced card letter testifying that be good washerwoman term reasonable captain have evening before told must take three four day to discharge cargo for rio that have better take advantage of opportunity if wanted washing done have therefore got everything in readiness in few minute numerous canvas bag filled with linen be deposited in boat in addition to fruit several great bouquet of gorgeous flower have be purchased cabin that evening presented festive appearance after became dark light of rio sparkled out agreed that scene be even more beautiful than by daylight air be deliciously balmy soft sea a a glass moon be nearly full whole line of shore must be distinctly seen boat flitted about between vessel strand fishing boat with sail hanging motionless slowly made way in by aid of oar sound of distant music in city came across water there be singing dancing on board flying scud that evening be content to sit quiet enjoy scene such conversation a there be be carried on in low tone a if be under spell feared to break next morning went ashore soon after breakfast upon assembling at dinner be found that general impression be one of disappointment be fine city not so fine a looked from water except main thoroughfare street be narrow a lady declared dirty young people however be not so critical have be delighted with stir movement bright costume variety of race colour novelty of everything saw negro amuse most marion said seem to be always laughing never saw such merry people be like child father said slightest thing cause amusement be one of sign of low type of intellect when people be given to laugh at trifle then native ought to be very intelligent marion said for a whole appeared to to be serious race of course saw many of laughing chattering most of be very quiet in manner old people seem to be wrinkled in wonderful way never saw english people so wrinkled southern race show age in way mr atherton said see marvellous old men woman in spain italy people who a far a look go might be hundred fifty little dried up specimen of humanity with face more like of monkey than men be negro slave mr atherton still have slavery in brazil do not certainly be not at according to idea of slave estate be mostly worked by negro slave mr atherton said doubt many of saw to day be also slave household slavery be seldom severe believe brazilian be generally kind master probably greater portion of negro saw be free may have purchased freedom with saving may have be freed by kind master be very unusual thing for brazilian at death to leave will giving freedom to slave government be doing best to bring about entire extinction of slavery believe that child born after certain date have be declared free have doubt that in time slavery will be abolished great change like take time to carry out even for sake of slave be better to proceed quietly gradually suppose nobody incline to go on shore again to night there be general negative day have be very warm having be walking about for hour one felt inclination to make fresh start following morning vessel began to unload cargo of older passenger declared that have have enough of shore must not land at rate until afternoon rest went ashore greater part of returned at lunch time heat in afternoon be so great that none cared to land again in evening two allen wilfrid agreed to go ashore to visit theatre mr atherton said that a have inclination to melt

watch be nearly twelve o'clock high time for to be on board started to make what thought must prove short cut down to landing place a usual short cut proved delusive soon found wandering in unknown street asked several person met way down to water none of understood english be considerable time before emerged from street on to line of quay be ever so much too far to right james allen said a looked round fancy be ship light not far from shore half mile away on left hope will find boatman to take off must be rather awkward finding here for night in place where one understands language

fidget on board if be not to turn up to night think must be alarmed james allen replied one be in bed asleep long ago must be on board in morning before steward went to cabin found that be missing

fellow to do chapter iv row on shore while wilfrid allen be talking be walking briskly in direction of landing place have arrived within hundred yard of when party of four men who be lying among pile of timber got up came across towards be rough looking fellow james allen said like look of chap think mean mischief look out a spoke men rushed at james allen gave loud shout for help then struck blow at man who rushed at fellow staggered backwards with fierce exclamation in portuguese drew knife moment later allen received sharp stab on shoulder be knocked to ground other two after short struggle

do for present said now will carry down to boat lifting young fellow up a though be feather started with will do anything with fellow mr atherton wilfrid asked leave a be what deserve be to be thrown into sea daresay friend will come back to look after presently in couple of minute arrived at landing place where two men be sitting in boat how did come to be here mr atherton wilfrid asked when have taken seat came to look after boy wilfrid got on board about eleven on going down to cabin found have not returned so thought must smoke cigar wait up for at twelve o'clock last party returned a thought might have difficulty in getting on board after got into boat rowed ashore engaged men to wait a long a wanted thought perhaps have missed way did not feel uneasy about for there being three of together be scarcely likely have got into bad scrape be beginning at last to think have perhaps gone to hotel for night that be use waiting longer when heard voice coming along quay night be so quiet that heard laugh distance away recognized then strolled along to meet when saw four fellow come out into moonlight from shadow in wood guessed that be up to mischief started to run at once be within fifty yard of when saw scuffle caught glint of moon on blade of knife five six second be up then there be end of now be close to ship go up a quietly a can make noise a go into cabin be use alarming people will carry jim down can walk now think mr atherton might do wo lad for if did must probably start wound bleeding afresh two have best take shoe off directly get on deck james allen be

atherton others exclaimed in surprise nothing to speak of lad fellow made slash at a closed with have just finished leader must do more than strike wildly a turned upon a spoke be taking off waistcoat shirt by jove have have narrow escape doctor said how take so coolly can not make out except a to bleeding be far more serious than allen one of wound be in left side about three inch below arm man have evidently struck at heart quickness with mr atherton have closed with have disconcerted aim knife have struck rather far back glancing behind rib have cut deep gash under shoulder blade other wound have be given by downright blow at right side have laid open flesh from below breast down to hip be only case for plaster mr atherton said be useful to have casing of fat sometimes be same thing with whale have got to drive harpoon in very deep to get at vitals see wound in front have bled very little have lost good deal of blood from other cut surgeon said will draw edge of wound together with needle thread will then put bandage on will have to keep quiet for day wound be much too serious to think of putting plaster on at present have have good deal more serious wound than mr atherton said cheerfully have have to ride seventy eighty mile on following day however will promise not to go ashore to morrow a captain say expects to be off next morning will be able to submit to order without great privation why did not say that be wounded mr atherton wilfrid said reproachfully a went to own cabin prepared to turn in to tell truth wilfrid hardly thought wound be a deep a be blood be up see when be case be scarcely conscious of pain felt sharp shooting sensation on side a grasped fellow by throat afterwards knew be bleeding bit at back for felt warmth of blood down in shoe there be nothing to prevent carrying young allen one person can carry wounded man with much more ease to than two can do unless of course have got stretcher next morning there be quite stir in ship when be known that two of passenger be wounded mr mr renshaw be greatly alarmed when heard of risk wilfrid have run neither of wounded men appeared at breakfast a surgeon insisted that must lie quiet for at least one day mr renshaw have paid visit to mr atherton directly have heard from wilfrid story of fray thanked most warmly for intervention on behalf of son wilfrid said have very little doubt that three must have be stabbed if have not come up say might not mr atherton said because resistance have raised men anger in country when man be angry generally us knife besides dead men raise alarm still might have contented with robbing however own that be lucky be on spot be not question of luck at mr renshaw insisted be there because have specially gone ashore to look after foolish young fellow being there be result of own thoughtfulness for not in way of chance there be quite crowd on quay mr renshaw captain said when gentleman went on deck suppose have found stain of blood in road conclude that crime have be committed oh here be boat putting out from landing place steward have be on shore to get fresh fruit for breakfast will tell be going on steward have gone ashore before news of encounter have be spread by surgeon what be excitement about on shore captain asked a stepped on deck well sir a far a must learn from chap who spoke little english there have be bad doings on shore in night two men be found morning lying dead there there be nothing uncommon about say there be wound on except skull be stove in a if have be struck by beam of wood at back of head besides that there be two three pool of blood in road seems one man walked back into town for there be mark of foot a if stepped in blood before starting in direction then there be line of blood spot down to landing place down step a if somebody have got into boat nobody seems to make head tail of business well must keep quiet if can captain said turning to mr renshaw if be known that of people be concerned in affair might keep here for three week month while be being investigated insist upon mr atherton son allen remaining behind a witness mr ryan called to first mate just come here moment matter be more serious than thought seems that mr atherton who a have heard dashed head of two of fellow together killed on spot sure thought a much when young allen be telling about mate said have seen mr atherton at work before thought to myself that unless fellow skull be made of iron thick at must have gone in when brought together worst of be captain went on have traced mark of blood down to landing stage of course have suspicion that someone concerned in affair took boat came off to one of ship went away in one of fishing craft know what fellow be if find out that anyone on board be mixed up in matter will keep ship here for month be true enough sir be mighty lucky must be if got away in month first thing be to see about boatman captain said of course if tell authority brought wounded man on board here late last night there be end of if hold tongue keep own council thing may not leak out to day will have anchor up get out evening if can have better tell crew that not word be to be said about matter will impress same on passenger when know that careless word may lead to month detention may be sure there will be no talking before speak to will go down see mr atherton hear what say about boatman returned in two three minute hope will be all right said atherton gave pound apiece told to hold tongue think be probable will do so for must know well enough that must a likely a not be clapped into prison kept there while investigation be going on so there be strong hope that may not leak out through must stop leave ashore mr ryan tell men whose turn be to go will have spree at buenos ayres if be to get drunk must be a likely a not to slip out will see to sir directly breakfast be over captain took boat went ashore have duly impressed upon passenger absolute necessity for silence several of went ashore with returned hour later having be up to british consulate affair be making quite stir in town not on account of two men being found dead there be nothing uncommon in especially a have be recognized a two notorious ruffian whole circumstance of affair puzzle doctor who have examined body have arrived pretty well at truth say that men have be gripped by throat for mark of finger be plainly visible head dashed together although be a know perfectly true one belief for doctor admit that doe not appear to possible that man must have have strength requisite to completely batter in skull of two others a have be done in case police be searching town for man whose footstep led in direction a know haunt of ruffian associate be likely enough that will find especially a face be sure to bear mark of atherton handiwork still if do find tell all know of business will not be much nearer to tracing actor in to ship be not probable that recovered sens until long after be on board boat can only say that while engaged in attempting to rob passer by be suddenly knocked down even be not likely to get out of first for will know that used knife be not likely to put in way of punishment if can help came off at once because heard at consulate that police be going to search ship in harbour to see if can find wounded man get clue to mystery so must ask doctor if two patient be fit to be dressed go up on deck doctor on being consulted said that must certainly have preferred that must have remained quiet day did not know that must do harm to get on deck for bit accordingly in hour mr atherton james allen came up doctor who have assisted to dress accompanied now mr atherton have better seat in great deck chair of yours with leg rest if sit there quietly reading when come on board be not likely to suspect of being desperate character to appreciate inch width of shoulder allen have better sit quiet till get alongside then slip that sling into pocket walk up down talking to one of lady with thumb in waistcoat so a to support arm look pale shaky be not accustomed to much colour here will pas well enough a soon a mr atherton have taken seat mr renshaw marion came up to how can thank enough mr atherton for risk have run to succour wilfrid for kind consideration in going on shore to wait for be nothing mr renshaw own to enjoying scrimmage when can go into one with feeling of being in right know that be very lazy man be just lazy men who do enjoy exerting occasionally be grand marion broke in ought not to talk a if be nothing mr atherton wilfrid said that thought be over with till saw big man flying down road perfect colossus of rhodes mr atherton laughed be not thing to joke about marion went on earnestly may seem very little to mr atherton be everything to know that one always joke when one be serious miss renshaw know that in church little thing that must scarcely notice at other time make inclined to laugh day in far distance when become woman will know truth of saying that smile tear be very close to other be getting to be woman now marion said with dignity for mr atherton always persisted in treating a if be child a be nearly seventeen be standing grievance to age doe not make woman miss renshaw saw skipping three day ago with little kate mitford brother young allen enjoyed a much a of be trying must keep up longest marion said wilfrid against other two be looking on believe must have liked to have skipped too think must mr atherton agreed young people skip half a well a used to when be boy must have given lesson if have not be afraid of shaking ship timber to piece how absurd be mr atherton marion said pettishly of course be not thin always talk of a if be something monstrous mr atherton laughed diversion have have desired effect have led away from subject of fight on shore there be galley putting off from shore with lot of official on board captain said coming up at moment be rowing to next ship suppose will visit next quarter of hour later galley came alongside three official mounted gangway captain went forward to meet be there anything can do for gentleman there have be crime committed on shore leader of party said be suspected that of concerned in matter be on board one of ship in harbour have authority to make strict search on board be perfectly welcome to do so sir captain said one of officer will show over ship must trouble to show list of passenger crew to muster men on deck first must ask did of boat return on board late captain replied last boat be hauled up to davit at past nine there be heavy day work before men to day therefore refused leave on men be ordered to be mustered while be collecting second mate went round ship with official saw that one be below in berth men name be called over from list official satisfied that be present in good health now for passenger said can not ask to muster captain observed will walk round with point out on list there be eight ten on shore will doubtless be off to lunch if leave officer on board will see that be by mean sort of people to take part in such affair a have happened on shore official went round deck saw nothing whatever to excite suspicion marion renshaw be laughing talking with mr atherton miss mitford walking up down poop in conversation with james allen after have finished investigation official left one of party to inspect remaining passenger a came on board to check off list then again took seat in galley be rowed to next ship by dint of great exertion cargo be got out by sunset sail be at once loosened anchor weighed before short twilight have faded away flying scud be making way with gentle breeze towards mouth of harbour be well out of mr atherton said a looked back at light of city think be very well out of indeed in more sens than one said surgeon who be standing next to have have wonderfully close shave of mr atherton inch of blow might have be fatal besides have be detained for month six week be a likely a not that what with heat what with annoyance wound must have taken bad turn now must let exercise authority order to berth immediately ought not to have be out of of two evil getting up detention chose least must be glad now if must go off at once if can assure may have on hand rest of voyage will obey order doctor more willingly because for last hour two back have be smarting unmercifully feel other wound much be because have be sitting still will find hurt when come to walk please go down carefully sudden movement might start wound again be two three day before mr atherton again appeared on deck left arm be bandaged tightly to body so a to prevent movement of shoulder blade walked stiffly to deck chair have be piled with cushion in readiness be glad to be out again mr renshaw mr atherton said a arranged cushion to suit husband with wilfrid two allen have kept company one other of time so can not say have be dull be much hotter below than be here however know doctor be right in keeping below for slightest movement gave great deal of pain however wound be going on nicely hope by time get to buenos ayres will be fit for trip on shore again hardly think so mr atherton for if weather continues a be now be nice steady breeze have be running ever since left rio think will be there long before be fit to go ashore particularly care about mr atherton said buenos ayres be not like rio be for most part quite modern town even in situation have little to recommend besides will be so far off that there will be running backwards forward between ship shore a there be at rio of course depends good deal on amount of water coming down river vessel sometimes have to anchor twelve mile above town be sure have desire to go ashore mr renshaw said after narrow escape wilfrid have at rio must be glad if did not set foot there again until arrive at end of voyage be not likely to get into scrape again mr atherton said of course must have be wiser not to have stopped so late a did in town of whose way knew nothing may be sure will be careful time besides fancy from what have heard thing be better managed there population be more peaceable orderly than at rio indeed such adventure a befell might very well have happened to stranger wandering late at night in slum of of english seaport there be general feeling of disappointment among passenger when flying scud dropped anchor in turbid water of la plata shore be five six mile away be low uninteresting tower spire of church of buenos ayres be plainly visible of town little must be seen a soon a anchor be dropped captain gig be lowered started for shore to make arrangement for landing cargo next morning steam tug brought out several flat work of unloading commenced few passenger went ashore in tug none of renshaws left ship two day sufficed for getting out good for buenos ayres passenger who have be staying at hotel on shore came off with last tug to ship stay ashore have be pleasant one liked town in point of cleanliness order considered to be in advance of rio chapter v boat expedition well be not sorry be off again marion renshaw said a men ran round with capstan bar anchor came up from willow water what contrast between rio be indeed mr atherton who be standing beside replied own must have liked to spend six month in snug little craft going up la plata parana especially latter la plata run through comparatively flat will not say unfertile country because be fertile enough country deficient in tree offering small attraction to botanist parana flow north paraguay be country little visited by european ought to be well worth investigation a say be glad enough to be out of willow water in short time will be looking out wrap again will want warmest thing for doubling cape horn rather what be called doubling cape horn because in point of fact double at do mean go round marion asked in surprise may may not miss renshaw will depend upon weather suppose most vessel now go through strait separate cape horn from tierra del fuego be strait of magellan be not oh mr atherton replied strait of magellan lie still further to north separate tierra del fuego from mainland wish that be going through for believe scenery be magnificent if lie further north must surely be shortest way so why must not go through if be in steamer might do so miss renshaw channel be so narrow intricate tide current run with such violence that sailing vessel hardly ever attempt passage strait will go through lie between tierra del fuego group of island of horn be most southerly be country inhabited yes by race of most debased savage with whom can assure have desire to make personal acquaintance not even to collect botanical specimen mr atherton girl asked smiling not even for purpose miss renshaw will do good deal in pursuance of favourite hobby draw line at savage of tierra del fuego very few white men have ever fallen into hand lived to tell tale certainly must have chance why must have le chance than other people mr atherton attraction must be irresistible mr atherton replied gravely must furnish meat for whole tribe how horrible marion exclaimed what be cannibal very much so indeed one can hardly blame for be only chance have of getting flesh existence be one long struggle with famine cold be not hunter be poor fisherman firmly believe that if be in place must be cannibal how can say such thing marion asked indignantly never know whether be in earnest mr atherton be sure must never be cannibal there be saying what one might be if one be driven to replied placidly anyhow trust will never be driven to in various journeying adventure be happy to say have never be forced to experience prolonged fast be one of thing have inclination to try weather be perfection be not went on changing subject flying scud be making capital way only hope may last be sad to think that will soon exchange balmy breeze for biting wind be just saying wilfrid went on a lad strolled up to that will soon have to lay aside white flannel put on greatcoat muffler will not be sorry wilfrid replied after month of hot weather one want bracing up bit always enjoy cold then must have gone out settled in iceland instead of new zealand must not have minded that mr atherton there be splendid fishing believe sealing sort of thing suppose others must have liked be sure father must not can not bear cold study at home used always to be kept up at almost temperature of oven winter must think new zealand must exactly suit before sun set have satisfaction of sailing out of muddy water of la plata of being once more in bright blue sea for next week flying scud sailed merrily southward without adventure air grew sensibly cooler day light garment of tropic be already exchanged for warmer covering do always get sort of weather down here captain mr renshaw asked not always mr renshaw weather be generally fine admit occasionally short very violent gale sweep down from off land be known a pamperos because suppose come from pampas be very dangerous from extreme suddenness with sweep down if be seen coming vessel can be stripped of canvas in time there be little danger to be apprehended for be a short a be violent have be wonderfully fortunate altogether so far mr renshaw said have not have single gale since left england trust that good luck will continue to end hope so too captain said grant that spell of such weather a have be favoured with be apt to become little monotonous generally find passenger have tendency after time to become snappish quarrelsome from sheer want of anything to occupy mind still must very much rather put up with than with chance of storm people must be very foolish to get out of temper because everything be going on well mr renshaw said be sure find perfectly delightful sailing on a do then see madam be indefatigable worker never see hand idle to people who work long voyage of unbroken weather must can very well understand be monotonous of course with who have duty to perform be different have often heard passenger wish for what call good gale have never heard sailor who have once experienced one express wish however staunch ship great gale be most anxious time for concerned in navigation of vessel be too time of unremitting hardship there be little sleep to be have hand be constantly on deck be continually wet to skin great sea sweep over ship man have literally life in hand for may at moment be torn from hold washed overboard have limb broken by spar hen coop other object swept along by sea always make angry when hear passenger express wish for gale in thoughtless ignorance of what be desiring if storm come must face like men in good ship like flying scud well trimmed not overladen with plenty of sea room may feel pretty confident a to result be very different thing from wishing to have one by time be fortnight out from buenos ayres mr atherton james allen be off sick list indeed latter have be week in doctor hand adventure have bound little party more closely together than before allen have quite settled that when friend once established on holding must if possible take one up in neighbourhood young renshaws often regretted that mr atherton be only bird of passage have intention of fixing permanently in colony air have grown very much colder of late light clothes have worn in tropic have already be discarded in evening be glad to put on warm wrap when came on deck think captain said a mr renshaw came up for customary walk before breakfast be going to have change glass have fallen good deal did not like look of sun when rose morning look to very much a usual mr renshaw replied shading eye looking at sun except perhaps that be not quite so bright not so bright by good deal captain said there be change in colour of sky be not so blue wind have fallen too fancy by twelve o'clock there will be calm of course can not be surprised if do have change have have splendid spell of weather be getting into stormy latitude now when passenger went up after breakfast found that flying scud be scarcely moving through water sail hung idly against mast yard creaked a vessel rose fell slightly on almost invisible swell must be good opportunity captain said cheerfully to get down light spar snugger be better for rounding horn mr ryan send hand aloft send down spar over topmast crew swarmed up rigging in two hour flying scud be stripped of upper yard lofty spar look very ugly marion renshaw said do not think so mary hideous mary mitford agreed be in fighting trim now mr atherton said yes who be going to fight marion asked be going to have skirmish with weather fancy miss renshaw say be going to have storm went on a girl looked anxiously up at sky can see for yourselves that there be change since yesterday wind have dropped sky be dull hazy sea look sullen bright little wave be accustomed to be gone a see by motion of vessel there be underground swell though can scarcely notice on water way do think wind will come from mr atherton mary mitford asked fancy will come from west perhaps north west look at light streak of cloud high up in air be travelling to southeast look how fast be going mary mitford said a looked up have not breath of wind here will have soon mr atherton said see that dark line on water coming up from west be glad to see be very much better to have wind freshen up gradually to gale than to lie becalmed until strike suddenly girl stood at poop rail watching sailor engaged in putting lashing on to movable object on deck in ten minute dark line came up to flying scud began to move through water course be brailed up stowed wind rapidly increased in strength captain presently requested passenger to go below at rate to give up seat there be nothing like having deck cleared said if come on to blow bit there be movement chair must be charging about from side to side will not only break up perhaps break someone leg four sailor folded up chair piled together passing cord over lashed to two ring bolt now mr ryan will get topsail reefed at once there be heavy bank there to windward have best get everything a snug a possible before come up to dark bank of mist rose rapidly sailor have just reached deck after closely reefing topsail before be close upon now lady please go below captain said sharply there be rain a well a wind in cloud will come down in bucketful when doe come have desired effect of sending most of male passenger down a well a lady few remained near companion ready to make dive below when squall struck suddenly wind ceased topsail flapped against mast there be confused roaring sound astern broad white line came along at race horse speed towards vessel get below lad mr atherton said a led way will be drenched in moment have just reached cabin when there be deafening roar overhead almost at same moment vessel started a if struck by heavy blow rain wind together mr atherton shouted in reply to chorus of question from below now have got to do be to make yourselves comfortable for there will be no going up again for time for five minute tremendous downpour continued then ceased a suddenly a commenced wind have dropped too silence after uproar be startling lasted few second then wind again struck ship with even greater force than before although a have not lost way blow be le felt by below in five minute captain came below with oil skin coat sou ' wester streaming with wet have just looked down to tell said cheerfully that everything be going on well first burst of gale be always critical point can congratulate ourselves that have got through without losing spar sail thanks to having have sufficient warning to get snug to gale striking gradually be afraid wo have very comfortable time of for next day two there be nothing to be at uneasy about gale be off land have sea room enough for anything now have got rid of cargo ship be in very best trim though may get deck washed bit by by will be none worse for so saying again went up on deck for next three day gale blew with fury there be regular meal taken below for vessel rolled so tremendously that nothing must have remained on plate dish passenger be forced to content with biscuit with occasional cup of coffee basin of soup that cook managed to warm up for lady for most part kept cabin a did many of male passenger absence of regular meal be le felt a majority be suffering from sea sickness wilfrid be occasionally ill managed to keep up from time to time went on deck for few minute while marion spent most of time on seat at top of companion looking out on sea be magnificent sight tremendous wave be following ship a approached lifting stern high in air driving along at speed seemed terrific then passing on leaving to sink down into valley behind air be thick with flying spray torn from crest of wave at first seemed a if sea came up behind vessel must break over stern drive head foremost down a wave passed after wave without damage sense of anxiety passed off marion be able to enjoy grandeur of sea wilfrid mr atherton allen often came in to sit with to take shelter for time from fury of wind talking be almost impossible roar of wind in rigging noise of wave a struck ship confused sound of battle of element being too great to allow voice to be heard except when raised almost to shouting point marion have inclination for talking snugly a mr atherton have wedged in with pillow cushion be a much a must do to retain seat a vessel rolled lower yard almost touched water be too absorbed in wild grandeur of scene to want companionship captain say glass be beginning to rise mr atherton said a met fourth morning of gale that think worst be over will be glad for sake of others marion replied for sea to go down father be quite worn out for be almost impossible for to sleep a might be thrown out of berth if did not hold on for be in hurry for gale to be over be so magnificently grand think so mr atherton be grand lassie doubt mr atherton said have rather weakness for dry clothes comfortable meal to say nothing of being able to walk sit perpendicularly not being obliged constantly to hold on for bare life morning feel that under happier circumstance must enjoy steak irish stew couple of egg biscuit cup of coffee be can hope for believe enjoy a much a do mr atherton girl said indignantly else why do stay upon deck time in spite of wind spray well see miss renshaw lady have objection to smoking pipe below besides what with groan moan from cabin clatter of swinging tray noise of wave one thing there be little to tempt to stay below really will be very glad when be over ship have be doing splendidly a wind have blown from same quarter whole time sea though very high be regular everything be going on well still gale be gale can never answer for vagary of wind if be to veer round to quarter for instance must in few hour get broken sea here must astonish must try quality of flying scud then again have be running south with tremendous speed for last three day if be to go on for few day longer might find down among ice therefore say sooner gale be over better will be pleased towards evening there be sensible abatement in force of wind following morning gale have so far abated that captain prepared to haul course for west have be running south at rate of fully three hundred mile day said be now very far down moment warm wind drop get from south will find that will need wrap have to keep warm if gale have lasted have made up mind to try to get head to to lie to be great deal too close to region of ice to be pleasant change in course of vessel be by mean appreciated by passenger for motion be very much rougher more unpleasant than to have now become accustomed however by following morning wind have died away to moderate breeze sea have very sensibly abated topsail be shaken out of reef although motion be still violent most of passenger emerged from cabin came on deck to enjoy sun be now streaming brightly through broken cloud captain be in high glee ship have weathered gale without slightest damage not rope have parted not sail be blown away result fully justified confidence felt in ship gear be comfort remarked to sail under liberal owner now people insist on having ship a well found a possible if condemn spar sail rope stay be replaced without question be cheapest policy in long run there be nothing so costly a stinginess on board ship giving way of stay may mean loss of mast gear may mean loss of ship blowing away of sail at critical moment may mean certain disaster yet there be many owner who grudge fathom of new rope bolt of canvas who will risk safety of vessel for petty economy of few pound next day wind have dropped entirely topgallant mast be sent up with yard sail by dinner time flying scud looked more like a soon a wind lulled on board be conscious of sudden fall of temperature bundle of wrap be undone greatcoat cloak got out although sun be still shining brightly poop of flying scud soon presented wintry appearance there be sitting about now even lady have abandoned usual work by sharp walking up down on deck be evident that even warm wrap be insufficient in that brisk exercise be necessary to keep up circulation well what do think of mr renshaw mr atherton asked like said decidedly be certainly wonderfully sudden change from summer to winter husband doe not like at never agreed on subject of temperature liked what call close study while enjoy sharp walk well wrapped up on winter day agree with mr atherton said can bear amount of cold heat completely knock up then see cold never have chance of penetrating to bone course will take now do suppose south of cape horn through strait will depend upon wind meet with imagine mr atherton replied if wind continues from south must say captain must keep well south of horn if head from west at may have to go through strait personally own must prefer have gone round nearly point since came on deck morning if go round bit more certainly will not be able to lay course round horn for think be far to south of now by evening wind have hauled farther to west ship head pointed more to north than have done in morning passenger enjoyed change for temperature have risen rapidly many of warm wrap have be got up be laid aside at twelve o'clock captain have taken observation found that ship position be nearly due south of falkland isle have narrow squeak of mr ryan said to first mate time be running before gale have that group of island on mind so have sir mate replied be praying time that wind must keep bit to west of north for knew that when began position be a near a may be due north of guessed what be thinking of when told man at wheel to edge away to east a much a dared though be mighty little by reckoning captain said must not have passed more than thirty mile to east of have made about eighty mile of westing since got on course be now just on longitude of westermost point of island be about hundred mile to north of wind continued from same quarter on taking observation on following day captain announced that if there be change reckoned upon just making mouth of strait between tierra del fuego island on going on deck two morning later land be seen on port bow there be cape captain said that lofty peak covered with island nearest to be herschel island large island not far from horn be wollaston island a see there be several others be not sort of place one must like to come down upon in gale if have have choice must rather have gone hundred mile south of horn wind must not allow to lie course after gale have other day have right to reckon upon finer weather in light wind might have taken two three day beating round wind be very light now mr renshaw remarked yes be afraid will be lighter still presently captain said vessel made slow way in afternoon wind dropped altogether flying scud be now two three mile from coast of tierra del fuego passenger examined inhospitable looking coast through glass at one two point light wreath of smoke be seen curling up telling of encampment of native think mr ryan captain said will take in anchor in one of bay breath of air might be enough to move through water if be going free be nearly dead ahead of now like idea of drifting night along coast besides may be able to get fish from native will be change for passenger vessel head be turned towards shore now that light air be well on beam sufficed to enable vessel to steal through water at rate of about knot hour at about four o'clock anchor be dropped in bay at distance of mile from land sail be furled passenger watched shore in hope that native craft might make appearance there be sign of life native have fish to sell rather exchange captain said for of course money be of use to be afraid of maybe have be massacring shipwrecked crew believe be ship of war come down to punish at rate seem determined not to show next morning sea be a smooth a glass there be not breath of air must let have boat captain mr atherton asked will make pleasant change perhaps of native might come off sell fish a must not be afraid of a might be of ship yes if like to make up party mr atherton can have boat must not land native be very treacherous must not be safe to set foot on shore mr ryan will get cutter into water after breakfast have better take with two three musket think there be fear of attack besides must out row native craft still be always a well to be prepared mr atherton soon made up party wilfrid two allen be delighted at offer marion miss mitford also petitioned to be allowed to go although mr atherton have not intended to take lady with two other young men named hardy wilson be also invited to join made up complement that cutter must carry in comfort crew consisted of six sailor at oar mr ryan took helm have better wrap up well mr atherton said to girl for will find cold sitting in boat thermometer must be down near freezing point mr atherton be last to take seat brought with rifle why what be going to shoot mr atherton marion asked know that be going to shoot anything replied be always well to be prepared see have made preparation in other way added a steward handed down large basket placed in stern sheet be only going for hour two mr atherton wilfrid remarked can not want anything to eat when have only just finished breakfast think at likely will want to open hamper wilfrid see be always best to be prepared weather look perfectly settled like native of part be treacherous a proposed expedition feel sort of responsibility have therefore see taken precaution against contingency think there be chance of change mr ryan said look a if calm might last for week still one can never be wrong in preparing for worst besides cold weather give one wonderful appetite drop of cratur never come amiss by time boat be fairly away from ship sailor who like passenger regarded expedition a pleasant change stretched out to oar mate steered for headland to west after passing kept boat at distance of few hundred yard from shore be there current here mr ryan wilfrid asked a watched rock low stunted tree very little mate replied sometimes run very strongly here at present be not much to speak of think be running more than quarter of mile hour past ship doubt there be good deal more farther out to disappointment of on board there be sign of native will be very tiresome if come out marion said want to see real cannibal so much care about cannibal miss renshaw want to see fish have not tasted really decent fish since left england in cold water ought to be a good a be at home believe native catch by spearing by torch light in case ought to be good sized fellow men after first start have dropped into long steady stroke a boat glided along past bay headland one paid attention to time until mate looking at watch said faith have be gone hour half clean forgot about time think have better be turning will be dinner time before reach ship a be boat head be turned think mate went on may a well steer from headland to headland instead of keeping round bay will save good bit of distance native evidently mean to show be very provoking miss mitford said can see smoke among tree over there have doubt that be watching although can not see ought to have waved handkerchief a came along miss mitford james allen remarked to have stood up shown yourselves must no doubt have come off then offered present in token of admiration girl laughed suppose must appreciate charm miss mitford said be not in line see that certainly be not miss mitford mate laughed saw of last time came through here hideous looking creature be wear clothes to speak of so laughing chatting with eye fixed on shore party never looked seaward until sudden exclamation from mate called attention to direction be jabers exclaimed here be sea fog rolling down on from south looked saw what seemed like wall of white smoke rolling along water towards at moment boat be about half way between two headland be mile half apart shore abreast of be three quarter of mile distant sun be shining brightly upon rolling mist girl uttered exclamation of admiration how fast come marion said why will be here directly mate put tiller starboard row men said in sharp voice for have for moment ceased to pull have compass mr atherton asked in low tone mate shook head be better than idiot to have come without one said who must have dreamt must want minute later light wreath of mist crossed boat almost immediately great fog bank rolled over exclamation broke from several of on board so sudden be change of temperature that seemed a if icy hand have be laid upon be fortunate that be not far from shore mr atherton said to mate there be nothing for to coast along close in be only thing to do mr ryan replied will be awkward business for a noticed when came along shore be in many place studded with rock however must risk that by going on slowly carefully may get off with slight damage even if hit one be not a if water be rough fog be so thick that must scarcely see end of oar blade how be to find ship marion asked there will be difficulty about miss renshaw will be sure to be firing gun a signal for there broke off a boom of cannon came across water besides with land on right hand icy breeze from south can not go far out of way row easy men mate commanded can not be far from shore now must begin to look out sharp for rock row light aisy make more noise with oar than can help native may be listening for want shower of spear in boat mr allen will go forward into bow keep sharp look out for rock james allen went forward two three minute later cried easy hold up quickly a order be obeyed boat stem grated on shore before way be lost back off lad mate cried a boat glided off into deep water again there be yell from shore dozen spear struck water round fortunately none of struck for be invisible to native who have be guided to spot by sound of oar not encouraging reception mr atherton remarked quietly well lady have not seen cannibal a yet have heard think best plan mr ryan will be to tear up one of rug muffle oar think may a well do so mate replied however sharp ear be sure to hear if be close inshore dare not go far out might lose bearing altogether think can do in first place see there be breeze brought down fog to guide in second gun of ship can not go far wrong with must say that when once get out a far a believe headland to lie best thing will be to steer direct for ship danger in way must certainly be far le than be from rock savage if keep near shore think be right will row straight out against wind for quarter of hour will take clear of headland will then shape course direct for gun chapter vi putting in refit boat rowed steadily in course be believed must take straight out to sea mate listening attentively for sound of distant gun report came up two three minute sound muffled by fog sure be mighty difficult to tell where sound come from think be well over there on beam think so mate asked mr atherton think so yes feel sure that be rowing nearly due south even without sound of gun must feel sure that can not at present be far out of course noticed that a came along hardly have to use helm that strength on side be very evenly balanced so that starting out a did from shore must be travelling pretty straight of course in long run must be sure to sweep round one way other lose bearing altogether be not for gun wilfrid will appoint time keeper what be to keep time of mr atherton be to keep time of gun think be firing about three minute have better time first two three if find three minute apart will be duty quarter of minute before gun be due to say in loud voice then conversation be to cease till hear report unless be silent listening be very difficult to judge exact direction from sound come be important to keep a straight line a can there be gun now begin to count illustration dozen spear struck water round page think can turn head in direction now mate said be just twenty minute since left shore ought to be fully mile out beyond headland quite agree with have certainly clear course now to ship if make blunder in keeping mate put tiller starboard wonder how long be to keep over said be queer sensation steering without having idea way be going next gun will tell whether have gone too far round not far enough mr atherton observed well will try that mate said after short pause must think ought to have made turn now stop wilfrid exclaimed minute later easy rowing lad listen for gun mate ordered silence in boat minute later report of gun be again heard there be general exclamation of surprise for instead of coming a expected from point somewhere ahead seemed to that sound be almost astern of now who must have thought that mate said have idea have gone round so far well must try again go to work more gently time row on men tiller be put slightly port boat continued way talk have gone on among passenger be now hushed mr atherton have be chatting gaily with girl from time fog came on except at moment when went ashore be attacked by native uneasiness have be felt for sound of gun have seemed to assurance that there must be difficulty in rejoining ship discovery that for moment have be actually going away from ship have for first time since rowed away from shore caused feeling of real uneasiness when wilfrid again gave notice that report must soon be heard listened intently there be general exclamation of satisfaction when sound be heard nearly ahead have got now mate said row on lad long steady stroke will be in before dinner be cold yet conversation now recommenced be use stopping here longer jim allen cried from bow because if not will come aft to be good deal warmer sitting together than be out here by yes may a well come aft mate replied a long a keep gun ahead know that be clear of rock certainly have come on bitterly cold there be general chorus of assent must think must be good thing ryan to get sail aft unlash from gaff put over leg will make lot of difference in warmth think that be very good idea mate assented lay in oar for minute johnson get sail aft sail be passed aft unlashed from yard spread out adding considerably to comfort of sitting astern now that ship gun be booming ahead have become accustomed to thick curtain of cloud hanging round feeling of uneasiness that girl have felt be entirely dissipated mr atherton have longer occasion to use best effort to keep up spirit laughed chatted over adventure a said far exceeded in interest anything have be promised when started from ship only drawback a agreed be cold be indeed really severe seem to come up to gun a ought to mr atherton said to mate after boat have be rowing for time be just what be thinking mr ryan replied fancy must have got strong current out here against expect have ryan tell what men have be rowing for hour now since left ship think must be good thing if youngster be to relieve of for spell what do say lad wilfrid allen hardy wilson exclaimed that must be delighted to take turn a must warm blood will be able to give spell mr atherton said for there be just six of be certainly not going to let pull scarcely out of doctor hand mate said bluntly why must be mad to think of thing here do take tiller will row stroke oar easy lad put on jacket four of come aft other two go into bow wish must row marion said regretfully a new crew bent to oar have done lot of rowing at home mr atherton say row very fairly be afraid must not be of much assistance here young lady mr atherton said be one thing to work light well balanced oar such a use in gig up river be very different one to tug away at one of heavy oar in sea going boat like with ten sitter in will want strength to get back may be sure there must be strong current against there be little chance of being back a hoped by dinner time after men have have hour rest mr ryan told to take seat double bank oar will travel faster said to mr atherton now that have got wind again be far better that must be rowing than sitting still gun be good deal nearer now think that ship can be more than mile mile half away suppose be mr atherton replied think will fire off rifle two three time ought to be able to hear now will relieve mind discharged rifle four five time fancied that heard shot in return hullo mr atherton exclaimed suddenly easy hold up hard although order be entirely unexpected be given so sharply that be instantly obeyed boat be brought to stand still before have advanced length then rower looked round to see what have be occasion of sudden order in front of scarce ten foot away towered up dark mass of rock must only see ahead of boat how high be how far extended on side knew not why what be mate said in astonishment did not notice island a came along have be narrow escape for at rate at be going through water must have stove in bow have run on have have narrower escape than deserve mr atherton said can not think how can have be so foolish what do mean mate asked why have be steering straight for gun have not of course have well ought not to have done so if ship have be lying well out from land must have be right be lying in deep bay of course straight course to from point started from must take just where be be ashore on other side of headland of course must ought to have kept well to seaward of gun till bore right on beam then headed in to well fortunately harm have be done have have mighty narrow escape if fog have be a thick a be when first came down upon must have gone right into before saw boat be turned rowed out to sea for distance then again headed in direction in wished to go keeping gun well in shore of until judged by sound that be nearly opposite to then rowed straight towards sound of oar be heard loud hail informed of exact position of ship two three minute later dark image loomed up in front of boat well mr ryan captain shouted well sir have given great fright captain went on expected back at least two hour ago thinking of course must have returned when fog set in even if have not done so before have turned sir before fog rolled in what with losing way difficulty of keeping course in fog fact that there be think strong current be running against further out have be long time coming back so see have double banked oar by time be lying by gangway be found that girl in spite of wrap be so stiff with cold that have to be assisted up gangway to deck exercise warmed blood of rest be soon on deck mr atherton who alone of men have not be rowing have little difficulty in getting up although a said have more right to feel cold than walrus protected a be by nature there have be much anxiety on board until shot fired by mr atherton be heard captain have ordered plenty of hot soup to be got ready girl soon felt in comfortable glow mr atherton gave comical account of adventure did not conceal fact that at one time position have be really perilous one that if have not be pretty vigilant might have fallen into hand of native well be well that end well mr renshaw said think will have more boat excursion a long a be in neighbourhood of cannibal of course one must have foreseen fog coming on so suddenly have evidently have narrow escape who have taken part in adventure however be highly pleased with share in agreed that although perhaps at time be unpleasant be very exciting be incident that must never forget life fog continued for three day at end of time easterly wind set in air cleared flying scud weighed anchor proceeded on voyage ten day later gale set in from south cold be intense spray a flew from bow cased fore rigging deck with ice wind increased hourly in fury captain decided to run before have plenty of sea room said will get out of bitter cold a get further north will not last long daresay day after day however gale continued seeming to increase rather than diminish in force on morning of sixth day after have begun passenger heard tremendous crash on deck wilfrid ran up companion looked out reported that mainmast fore top mast have gone overboard fortunately gust have done damage proved to be climax of gale by force have sensibly abated two day later fell to calm hand set to work to repair damage have spar will be of use for mainmast captain said must content with getting up fore top mast then under what sail can set upon mizzen make for one of island try to get good sized spar for mainmast reckon that be not more than two hundred fifty mile from austral group have be blown nearly twenty degree north three day later land be seen ahead captain after taking observation declared to be malayta one of largest island of group must rather have gone on under reduced sail said to mr atherton in whom have great confidence if have be sure of fine weather that can not reckon upon at time of year must not like to be caught in gale in crippled state so near island so of two evil consider least to go in try get spar will do for purpose what be evil of going in mr atherton asked native captain replied shortly be treacherous lot in island austral bear particularly bad reputation will have to be very careful in dealing with well a be forewarned be not likely to take by surprise captain a with crew passenger can muster pretty strong force ought to be able to beat off open attack yes think must do that captain agreed if did not think so must not put in must take chance of making way crippled a be to new zealand thing will have to guard against be sudden treacherous onslaught crew of many ship have be massacred owing to carelessness over confidence however will not be caught napping therefore hope to get off unscathed a neared land passenger be delighted with aspect of shore grove of tree came down to very edge of water in interior land be high be covered to summit of hill with foliage a approached captain gave order to prepare for anchoring must see number of native gathered on narrow strip of sand close to water be waving bough of tree in token of friendship be a far a must be seen by aid of telescope unarmed look friendly mother marion said after watching through glass wo be nice to land take walk among feathery looking tree there will be fear of fog cold here temperature be quite perfect will not land can assure young lady captain who be passing by overheard said fellow look friendly enough agree there be more treacherous rascal among islander of pacific will give a wide berth a can get if possible to cut spar tow out to instead of sending party on shore to fetch one will leave ship with permission unless be boat party armed to teeth to fetch water fellow be a treacherous a native of tierra del fuego vastly more warlike dangerous be cannibal captain mr renshaw asked that can not tell for certain mr renshaw be thief murderer whether eat human flesh be more than can tell doe not concern greatly whether if kill eat afterwards not mean to give chance of killing of can assure after character have given of have no longer slightest inclination to land captain a soon a vessel came to anchor number of canoe put out laden with yam cocoa nut other vegetable fruit for exchange have be allowed must have come alongside climbed up to deck captain must not permit to come within thirty forty yard although there be one on board who must speak language emphatic gesture be understood by native be sufficient to show that be not to be trifled with two boat only be allowed to approach at time guard of six sailor with musket be placed on deck with order to prevent anyone coming up to cover who descended gangway younger passenger thought that captain be unnecessarily timid ready a be to oblige on ordinary occasion saw that time must be no use to try to change determination that none must go on shore going down gangway bargained with native giving little article in exchange for fruit mr atherton be evidently of captain opinion a to necessity for prudence have stationed with rifle near gangway look quite peaceful cheerful marion renshaw said to do think there be really use in precaution mr atherton do indeed miss renshaw think one can be too careful when dealing with people who be notoriously so treacherous be good shot with rifle mr atherton yes although say be exceptionally good shot have practised great deal with rifle have suppose natural aptitude for for when fire be morally certain of hitting mark though be hardly conscious of taking aim when content of few boat have be taken on board captain made sign that required more native with look of evident discontent paddled back to shore will have chief off in morning captain said to day have kept in background seeing that be wary on guard will probably come off to morrow to view matter for will let perceive that be well prepared may be when see will be inclined to do little honest trading to bring off strong spar with can at anyrate make shift for mainmast will keep watch watch a if be at sea be a likely a not of canoe may be coming out in night to see if be to be caught napping be horrid kate mitford said a with sister marion several of younger passenger stood together that evening on poop looking towards shore young moon be sinking in west star shone with great brilliancy water be a smooth a glass outline of palm must be made out against sky in several place light of fire must be perceived stillness of evening be broken by hum of distant voice be really shame that can not go ashore be sure savage looked civil friendly must be delightful to wander about in such wood a two three voice be raised in assent have heard little story of spider fly miss kate mr atherton said moving across from other side of deck where be smoking cigar in case know be prettiest little bower that ever did espy perhaps fly admired just a much a admire that grove ashore result of visit must be identical in case on board other ship have be taken in by peaceful appearance of native loveliness of island result be fatal to personally must feel much more comfortable if saw savage putting out in body in canoe to attack ship than do now while be keeping up pretence of friendliness open danger one can meet when know treachery be intended have idea what form will take when mask of friendship will be thrown off be trying to nerve fortunately know character may hope to be ready when danger come still waiting be trying really feel that mr atherton marion renshaw asked do indeed miss renshaw may get away without trouble if so will be solely because native see that be prepared for be not to be taken by surprise seeing crippled state own opinion be that native will not let go off without making at least one attempt to surprise mr atherton spoke strongly for thought that be possible that of youngster might unless thoroughly roused to sense of danger do something foolish rash word have effect desired share in affair at rio have caused to be regarded with respect admiration by young men on board felt that if in opinion danger be grave be not for to doubt reality vigilant watch be kept night loaded musket be served out to watch on deck gun have be loaded before anchored spare musket be placed so a to be handy for watch below must be suddenly called up after moon went down light mist rose on surface of sea several time during night faint sound be heard near ship immediately officer of watch challenged silence reigned for considerable time how have night passed ryan mr atherton asked first officer a soon a came on deck just a daylight be breaking there have be of near night mr ryan replied think be in force wanted to see whether kept sharp watch think have satisfied a to for everytime slightest noise be heard hailed at once must like to have sent musket ball in direction of sound a must get spar if possible will be better for score two cask of fresh water wo do to begin to quarrel with once get what want on board beggar may attack a soon a like must do world of good to get handsomely thrashed to be taught that vessel be not to be plundered with impunity a say might do good hope there will be trouble have doubt that must beat off might lose life in doing besides have lady on board hope so too prepared a be must feel quite safe if be not for mast being gone know that be comparative cripple doubt looked upon a lawful booty when saw making in think will let be balked of prey without effort be just view of matter mean to keep sharp look out while be here will have hand full will get two three of young fellow to join with in keeping sharp watch over doings be good plan mate agreed there will a say be plenty for to do worry one to have to attend to work to keep one eye at back of one head at same time of course will always have watch set whatever be doing still have more faith in look out than in of dozen fo'castle hand when two allen wilfrid came on deck mr atherton drew aside look here lad began heard what said last night meant be sure be not wrong for there have be canoe hovering about night now in short time officer crew will be seeing about getting water on board if native bring out spar will do a jury mainmast there will be work of trimming getting into place rigging own opinion be that now native see be suspicious on watch will for time make show of being extremely friendly so a to throw off guard a officer sailor will be busy may possibly relax precaution little now propose that will constitute amateur watch from sunrise to dark after that men work will be done there will be fear of being taken by surprise real danger be think in daytime wilfrid will take second mate watch do two take first mate be if agree to proposal three young fellow at once expressed willingness to do a directed during respective watch mr atherton went on must keep attention directed solely to native there must be watching what be going on on board talking laughing with other passenger must consider a if on duty one of must take place on fo'castle other in waist native be sure to hang round ship in canoe watching what be doing offering thing for sale will be duty to keep vigilant eye upon to watch movement to give instant warning if number be at time larger than usual in fact to prevent possibility of closing suddenly in upon taking by surprise remember be case of absolute duty have volunteered to first officer to undertake will relying upon vigilance give attention to work will be armed mr atherton james allen asked yes james think that will be a well to have gun beside while on duty of course there be occasion to have on shoulder like sentry will be well to have always within reach of hand in case of sudden danger report of musket must give alarm far quicker more effectually than shout must do especially if men be at work on deck making noise well a agree will begin after breakfast how about meal sir tom allen asked if mean to make attack must think must be likely to choose meal time when passenger be below deck will be comparatively deserted must keep watch then also mr atherton said decidedly will speak to mr ryan ask to tell steward that two of will require something put on table for after others have done think that be likely to leave deck when captain be below two of who happen to be on duty can have meal when doe of course whenever on duty come down for purpose others will take place until return will change about day be supposed to be watch allen from four to eight wilfrid will begin work at hour will relieve at twelve will take watch from four to eight to morrow will take early watch so on will tell grimstones wilfrid who have always gone for daily chat with men forward said will be glad to join in watch must think other men forward must do so too know

appointed to watch other men to of allen at seven bell most of passenger came on deck to enjoy fresh morning air for hour before breakfast be not going to enjoy pleasure of wilfrid company at breakfast mr renshaw mr atherton said smiling to lady a stood with three girl round on poop why not mr atherton asked in surprise allen be going to do amateur sentry work a long a lie here mr renshaw crew will be busy refitting ship so have volunteered to undertake with assistance duty of keeping sharp eye on tricky gentleman ashore be in earnest mr atherton quite in earnest that be going to do so

in playing at sentinel when will get breakfast marion asked will bring up to mr atherton thank miss renshaw have arranged to have with mr ryan afterwards be much obliged to for offer just same be very kind one especially since will for once particularly enjoy breakfast a will have room for elbow be laughing at again mr atherton one must really think that take to be about ten year old think little teasing doe good miss renshaw be one of privilege of old fellow to try to do good to young friend girl of age lord so over brother brother friend that be good for to be teased little by elder must not think mother marion appealed that mr atherton by talk be somewhere about eighty be quite child agree with that be rather good thing for girl of age marion to be snubbed little occasionally especially on voyage like when there be several young fellow on board who have nothing better to do than to wait upon humour whim there be general laugh before fresh subject be started breakfast bell rang passenger went below mr atherton fetched rifle from cabin wilfrid be going to unpack double barrelled gun when friend said must not bother about now wilfrid take one of ship musket will make just a much noise if have to fire will not be alarming passenger by bringing gun backwards forward from cabin be going to hang up rifle when come off guard in ryan cabin on deck where will be handy take fo'castle two men can be in waist one on side will take poop just at present duty will be nominal one a canoe have not put out expect will be here before long before breakfast be over indeed large canoe be brought down from wood placed in water number of native appeared on shore first officer at once summoned captain on deck tell men to have arm handy mr ryan captain said a looked at gathering on shore suppose mean to attack in open way still may a well be upon guard order men not to show arm to go about work a usual wish to appear afraid of to take up position of hostility hope chief be coming off for friendly palaver in few minute canoe put off from shore first came great canoe be paddled by thirty men in bow stern be hideous image four native evidently of superior rank be seated near stern in bow stood man beating hand in time to stroke of paddle singing song be responded to by deep exclamation from rower at stroke man stood by side of singer waving green bough behind great canoe followed score of smaller one will receive in state mr ryan evidently intend to keep up appearance of friendliness at present will meet in same spirit fasten signal flag on to halyard run up to masthead let dozen men with cutlass take place at gangway a sort of guard of honour let rest go on with work keep arm handy for action when great canoe approached vessel men stopped paddling one of chief standing up made address to captain who be standing at top of gangway not word that said be understood address seemed to be of friendly nature chief held up cocoa nut yam a if to show desire to trade when have finished captain took off hat also spoke by gesture invited chief to come on board by time passenger have come on deck be watching proceeding with great interest do think safe to let on board first officer asked mr atherton who be intently watching native in smaller canoe quite safe replied so long a only few of follower come with there be fear of attempting anything while chief be in hand act a be a hostage for good conduct of people so far intention be clearly peaceful whether will last will depend upon whether think there be chance of success not at present have to do be to take advantage of to get what want on board by time canoe be approaching side of ship four chief ascended ladder followed by four five of lower rank who have be seated near a reached deck principal chief turned round shouted order in loud voice effect be immediate canoe in have arrived at once paddled away to short distance while smaller craft have before be drifting slowly towards vessel also retired lay huddled behind large canoe chapter vii savage surprise captain led way on to poop chief native with following while first officer with six sailor with sabre kept in rear once on quarter deck mr ryan ranged three of men by bulwark on side telling to sheath cutlass to be prepared for instant action in case of treachery chief preserved stolid demeanour scarce glancing at passenger who be gathered on poop at captain order steward brought up number of cushion placed on deck in circle captain seated on one motioned to chief to follow example did without hesitation mr ryan now brought up number of thing a present for chief be presented with hand mirror roll of scarlet cloth trinket a small supply of have be brought on board for trade with native in case of necessity arising head chief be in addition presented with axe roll of coloured cotton string of glass bead brass ring be given to inferior chief native appeared pleased with present captain then addressed endeavoured to explain that wanted supply of water empty barrel be brought up water poured into captain then pointed to shore by gesture intimated that wished barrel to be taken ashore filled chief evidently

boat hanging on davit placed axe in hand of one of men clearly signified that crew must go ashore cut down tree if chose captain shook head placed axe in hand of one of chief leader however went up to foremast by spreading out arm signified that be great size then held out small axe captain have presented to with action of disdain beggar mean that with one axe must never cut down tree of size first officer said be humbug ryan can bring down biggest tree for construction of canoe believe bring down by fire however be a well to humour tell carpenter to bring dozen ax be done ax laid down on deck there be now consultation between native after while nodded then made sign that someone must go ashore with to choose tree what do say ryan captain asked be of importance that must get stick will suit question be whether will be safe to trust man on shore with scoundrel will go ashore if like captain mr ryan replied like ryan captain said see must make mincemeat of armed crew in time must not propose to take crew sir must afford protection against number of native think beggar must assault single man see there must be nothing to gain by if did must put ship on guard game at present be evidently to be friendly think there be danger in affair if did not go might send off stick must be of use at to a came in on purpose to get mast be worth while risking something well ryan captain said after moment deliberation think perhaps be right that one man must be safe with be certainly of great importance for to get sort of stick want so a be ready to volunteer think justified in refusing offer captain then put hand on chief officer shoulder intimated to native that must accompany on shore party then returned to poop steward brought up tumbler two three bottle of rum chief eye glistened a liquor be poured out swallowed half tumbler of spirit with air of deepest satisfaction be present like best captain said suppose have better give for consumption on shore at rate will keep in good temper until ryan be back again accordingly two bottle of rum be presented to leading chief bottle to three next in rank two three bottle among others great canoe be hailed native again took place in accompanied by first officer boat then started for shore of smaller craft now came alongside process of barter be again commenced yam bread fruit other product of island be obtained for use of ship in exchange for bead empty bottle small mirror while passenger succeeded in obtaining many curiously carved weapon calabash woven cloth other memento of visit only two three of canoe be allowed alongside at time vigilant look out be maintained to see that others did not approach ship captain walked restlessly up down poop constantly turning glass upon shore hour after great canoe have reached exclaimed in tone of intense satisfaction there be ryan coming down to beach thank heaven be safe first mate be seen to take place in small canoe at once rowed off to ship captain shook heartily by hand a stepped on deck thank heaven have got back safely ryan have be hazardous business will take care to let owner know how have risked life by going ashore in service well how have succeeded found grand pine growing within thirty forty yard of water about quarter of mile beyond point to left a expected native have idea of using ax for purpose when left party be piling wood round foot of tree have doubt will soon get down in own way suppose will waste ten twelve foot at base be of consequence for tree be long enough to spare to make fair sized mainmast be right a be so close to water can send boat to see how be getting on how about water showed spring about fifty yard from beach nearly facing there be plenty of water there be perfectly fresh sweet for tasted if make bother about bringing off couple of boat with well armed party must fetch without difficulty a distance be so short that be capital ryan hope difficulty be pretty well over that will get off without trouble with fellow hope so sir certainly seemed friendly enough with on shore in evening mr ryan with crew of six men went in captain gig to see how native be getting on with tree men have musket cutlass laid under thwart in readiness for action native however appeared perfectly friendly crew of several of canoe near passed shouted sort of greeting paid other attention to on rounding point first officer steered straight for tree have chosen light smoke be ascending from foot dozen native be gathered there when close to spot ordered men to turn boat round back ashore be going to land lad said see how be getting on think that there be least danger have best keep in readiness to row off instant jump on board mr ryan then proceeded to tree found that circle of small fire have be built against be fed with dry wood be slowly steadily eating way into tree saw that only two three foot of base must be injured by action nodded approvingly to native muttered to be mighty slow way of bringing down tree be not much above three foot half in diameter even at base couple of men with ax must bring down in hour while there be saying how long will be with fire of theirs however must say that will get through to night time to morrow be fine stick run up a straight a arrow be thick enough for fifty foot for purpose walked quietly back to boat took seat be rowed back to ship where reported that native be carrying out promise that by next day tree must be down on visiting spot again on following morning be found that tree have fallen fellow know business mr ryan said to man who rowed stroke oar see that managed so that must fall towards water now lad can take to ax have brought with chop through at point where want cut will save trouble of getting off upper branch render much more handy for getting afloat leaving two of men in boat mr ryan other four leapt ashore be not long in cutting through tree half hour sufficed to lop off branch below point trunk be then ready for launching native stood round watching work with exclamation of surprise at speed with keen ax did work mr ryan have brought with from ship number of present distributed among party who have be engaged in felling tree know said to captain when returned whether mean to get stick in water bring here whether expect will do part of business think will wait until to morrow morning mr ryan if hear nothing of by then have better take two boat one with men to do work other to lie just off protect while do there be however occasion for for early next morning seven eight canoe be seen coming round point with much beating of tom tom sounding of conch horn here come spar captain exclaimed worst of difficulty be over thank goodness must keep eye open ryan if be mr atherton said a mate passed to give order for preparing to get spar on deck there be good many other canoe coming off from shore might take opportunity for making sudden attack right be mate said starboard watch shouted keep arm handy four men with musket take place at top of gangway show arm unless get order to do so trunk be towed alongside ship mr atherton party who have placed under order kept vigilant watch on canoe to see if occupant be armed there be deal of talking gesticulating going on among arm must be seen mr atherton soon concluded that if treachery be intended present be not time at must be shown crew be on deck native must have known arm be close at hand for day few of who came to trade have be permitted to come on deck partly to show confidence on part of on board partly that visitor might see arm lying in readiness for use be able to report on shore that ship be not to be taken by surprise sooner be spar alongside than couple of sailor lowered down passed rope round rope be then passed through block taken to capstan bar be fitted seized by dozen men boatswain whistle sounded starting anchor song men tramped round round rope tightened heavy spar be parbuckled up on to deck sooner be got on board than four chief who have before visited ship came alongside there be talk be presented with considerable number of present for follower a reward for service in sending off spar mr atherton wilfrid did not approach group of passenger round chief keeping attention vigilantly upon boat from danger if existed must come allen however in accordance with mr atherton instruction watched native closely noticed a came on deck cast quick scrutinizing glance round a if to see what be chance of surprise mr ryan however have when saw great canoe approaching placed ten men with musket on guard chief doubtless perceived that surprise must not be effected after stay of about quarter of hour chief departed with present of by care took of be evident that considered case of rum to be by far most precious sooner be trunk of pine fairly on board than gang of men provided with adz began under direction of carpenter to prepare bark be chipped off stump of branch shaved close then began to chip down to required thickness from end to end will make fine spar captain said in tone of great satisfaction after have examined think will do for permanent mast if will will save lot of trouble when get into wellington think will be little light sir mr ryan said by time have got perfectly smooth even still have seen lighter spar in ship of size certainly think be most fortunate in getting stick when do think will get ready watson must say will have nearly ready for getting into place by to morrow night mr ryan carpenter replied though may not quite finish until next day for see when come to getting smoothed mate must do by must not be particular about smoothing captain said of course must make so that will take spare iron have got for topmast will have plenty of time to put finishing touch to when get to wellington begin to think native be not so black a be painted mr ryan perhaps not sir maybe if have not seen that be so ready for there must be different tale to tell be so captain agreed there be doubt that best way of dealing with native be never to give chance carpenter gang continued steadily at work while first officer got up sheer leg hoisted stump of mainmast from place butt of new mainmast be cut to match on second day after arrived alongside be hoisted into position whole of stay rigging of mainmast have be cut away a soon a went overboard there be plenty of spare rope on board before evening new mast be firmly stayed in place be in readiness for hoisting spar be to serve a topmast native have watched proceeding with great interest quite crowd of canoe gathered round ship be greatly surprised at seeing heavy spar raised by sheers dropped into place replied to hearty cheer rose from crew passenger when be accomplished by wild yell cry sounding of horn begin to think captain said to mr atherton that native have got worse name than deserve mean of course that have not perpetrated several atrocious massacre expect must have be result of extreme carelessness on part of on ship perhaps of rough treatment for captain treat native of island like like dog a far a must have told there be excellent chance of attacking ship to day though know that kept up vigilant watch time yet nothing must have be more friendly than be there be doubt something in what say captain mr atherton agreed many of captain of ship who trade among island be certainly rough fellow who must think nothing of knocking native down others again be so culpably careless a to offer almost inducement to native to grasp what be to untold wealth still think be a well to be cautious of course will be cautious captain replied really think that others need bother yourselves to be always standing on sentry be trouble mr atherton said think will keep up until be fairly under weigh mr atherton be not pleased at seeing that captain next day relaxed somewhat in strictness of rule laid down crew be allowed to trade freely with native must be more vigilant than ever said to wilfrid allen captain be so pleased at having got mast on board that be disposed to view native with friendly eye if mean treachery be just what want finding that be too much on watch to be taken by surprise must naturally try to lull with sense of false security in afternoon chief again came off formally invited captain to feast on shore accepted invitation went back with accompanied by three four of passenger who have scoffed at idea of danger after stay of two three hour returned on board think mr ryan captain said that evening have better take couple of boat in morning go ashore for water will have everything ready for getting up anchor after dinner of course crew will be well armed take precaution think that there be slightest danger very well sir may be sure will keep weather eye open mr atherton shook head when in morning saw boat being lowered heard from first officer order have received from what say there be water enough to last to wellington if be put on somewhat shorter allowance must be infinitely better than running risk of going ashore water might last if go well mate said if be to get becalmed for time be likely enough in latitude must be in awkward fix will keep sharp look out on shore never fear distance to spring be a told not above fifty yard will keep men filling other half on guard if must mean mischief will give hot how many men will take sixteen ten in cutter six in gig must only leave ten on board mr atherton said if attack will attack too be moral certainty at rate will hint to of passenger that have better keep arm in readiness while be away mr atherton refused to go down to breakfast when allen came up to relieve after finishing meal will have watch on deck morning said will be very short handed while ryan party be away unfortunately captain be convinced there be not slightest danger snubbed morning quite smartly when said casually supposed that must not let of native on board while ryan be away a rest of passenger came up from breakfast mr atherton spoke to of with whom have be most intimate on voyage told that thought must be just a well for to bring arm on deck keep close at hand until watering party returned be great trouble said be just a well to be ready in case native mean mischief know that of youngster consider to be alarmist will give free leave to laugh at when be once safely out at sea stake be too heavy to admit of carelessness there be not only own life of lady to be thought of three four of passenger followed advice brought musket double barrelled gun on deck be good deal laughed at by rest who asked if have joined atherton army a little party who have kept watch be called however when boat pushed off with empty cask passenger saw how large be complement of crew who have left three of others strolled down to cabin got gun in hour great canoe with chief came off a approached ship mr atherton told wilfrid to go forward tell five men there to come aft be in readiness to mount to poop moment saw sign of trouble if there be row said have to hold poop there be only two ladder to defend can do must be useless to try to hold whole of ship a captain left poop went down into waist to receive chief mr atherton went up to where mr renshaw be sitting will take advice mr renshaw certainly will said smiling for be sure will be good whatever be then mr renshaw advise at once to go below with daughter miss mitford say that be going to have trouble if be be time pray oblige by doing a ask mr renshaw at once rose called marion other two girl who be gaily chatting with group of passenger asked to go below with wilfrid two allen be now on poop a mr atherton have told that have better remain there instead of placing at other point grimstones three other passenger forward be gathered near ladder a usual chief accompanied captain on to poop followed by dozen of minor chief mr atherton noticed that several of others instead of sitting quietly in canoe slipped up after on to deck flotilla of small canoe have a usual put out in train of large one be edging in towards vessel mr atherton leant over poop rail spoke to second officer who be engaged in waist with men mr rawlins quite like look of thing think that must be a well if be to gather a many of hand a can at foot of ladder here without of course alarming native a may be only fancy second mate nodded at once told men with to knock off from work get hold of cutlass quietly said gather near foot of starboard port ladder then going to gangway stopped native who be just climbing up from canoe motioned to that more be to come on board talk with chief be short one steward brought up two case of rum when be handed over to native rose a if to go suddenly leader drew axe from girdle with loud yell buried deep in captain head yell be echoed from hundred throat crew of canoe leapt to foot began to clamber up side of vessel while in smaller craft dashed paddle into water urged boat towards at same moment native on board drew concealed weapon so quick have be action of chief mr atherton have not time to prevent before body of captain touched deck that of chief be stretched beside with bullet through brain wilfrid allen seeing native rise to go have thought danger over two passenger have be struck down before brought rifle to shoulder be within few foot of chief of shot told for minute two there be scene of wild confusion native in waist fell furiously upon sailor fortunately put upon guard received attack with determination sound of lad rifle be followed almost instantly by sharp crack of revolver mr atherton produced from pocket shot told with fatal effect when revolver be empty not native remained alive on poop other passenger have be taken so completely by surprise even who have brought up arm did not join in fray until poop be cleared keep back there mr atherton shouted a native came swarming up ladder on port side several shot be fired passenger be too startled for aim to be true give musket renshaw mr atherton exclaimed snatching piece latter have just discharged from hand rifle be too good for work then clubbed weapon whirling round head a if have be straw fell upon native who be just pouring up on to poop shouting to passenger fire on mass below will keep fellow at bay blow fell stretched man lifeless on deck until who have gained poop unable to retreat owing to pressure of behind terrified by destruction wrought by giant sprang over bulwark into sea just a did so little party of sailor steerage passenger finding unable to resist pressure made way up to poop by starboard ladder hotly pressed by native by time several of male passenger who have rushed below for weapon ran up wilfred allen having reloaded discharge be poured into native on port ladder that survivor leapt down on to deck below attack for moment ceased whole of forward portion of ship be by time in hand of native three sailor who be at work there have be at once murdered only one of party having time to make escape up fore rigging spear now began to fly fast over poop must fall back bit mr rawlins will be riddled mr atherton said men have better run down get musket will keep fellow at bay think will make rush again just at present will see that door leading out on to waist be securely barricaded place two three men there mr renshaw will of other passenger carry down lady who have fainted assure that danger be really over mr atherton have so naturally taken command that second mate at once obeyed instruction most of lady have rushed below directly fray began two three have fainted be soon carried below male passenger eighteen in be now on deck several of looked very pale scared even most timid felt that life depended on making fight for perfect shower of spear be now flying over poop from native in canoe alongside from ship forward have best lie down gentleman mr atherton said if native make rush up ladder must be careful not to fire at once must be at mercy let

who be killed be young man with none on board to mourn other have left widow two child whose presence in midst be constant reminder of narrow escape from destruction voyage have produced very marked change in mr renshaw have brought in far closer connection with child than have ever be before with result advantageous to hitherto have scarcely ever seen except at meal even at time thought be so wholly taken up with writing on be engaged that have taken little part in general conversation beyond giving willing assent to request made evincing interest whatever in plan amusement now although for four five hour day worked diligently at study of maori language be at other time ready to join in be going on often walked deck by hour with wilfrid marion in time learned far more of past life of acquaintance amusement at old home than have ever known before be genial chatty with other passenger astonishment of child be unbounded when began to take lively part in various amusement by passenger whiled away long hour played at deck quoit bull latter game consists of board divided into twelve square numbered one to ten with two having bull head upon leaden disc covered with canvas be thrown on to board counting according to number on fall ten being lost for quoit lodged on square marked by bull head on evening of day before shore of new zealand came in sight mr renshaw be sitting by wife voyage be just finished helen said have be pleasant time be sorry be over very pleasant time alfred replied one of most pleasant have ever spent see now went on have made mistake of life instead of making amusement of hobby for archaeology have thrown away everything for have be worse than selfish have utterly neglected child why seem only to have made acquaintance with since came on board ship see now dear have broken marriage vow to have always loved always honoured have altogether failed to cherish have always be good kind alfred said softly man may be good kind to dog helen be not that wife have right to expect see now have blundered miserably can not change nature altogether dear that be too late can not develop fund of energy by merely wishing for can make happiness of wife child first thought object own pursuit second thought loss of money be terrible misfortune think so now feel have got wife again have gained two child come of venture here will feel that failure of bank have brought undeserved happiness to to also mr renshaw said softly a pressed husband hand feel sure that will be happier than have ever be before not that have be unhappy dear very far from still have not be life centre have be so different since voyage began be not bad fellow after mr atherton said a leaning against bulwark smoking cigar have glanced across at husband wife seated next to other talking in low tone evidently seeing nothing of what be passing around have brightened up wonderfully since started of course will never be strong man be more fit for settler life than be for habitation in moon still be getting more like other people thought be no longer two three thousand year back have become sociable pleasant fellow be sure be very fond of wife child be pity have not more backbone still think general outlook be better than expected taking altogether have be a pleasant voyage a have ever made there be satisfaction too that one may see something of one fellow passenger after land northern island be not after such very big place be worst of homeward voyage people who get to know like other when arrive in port scatter like bomb shell in direction chance be against ever running up against of afterwards somewhat similar idea occupied mind of most of passenger evening voyage have be pleasant one be almost sorry that be over there be pleasurable excitement at thought that must next day see land be to be home knowledge that must be staying for few day at wellington seemed to postpone break up of party for little time sooner be anchor dropped than number of shore boat came off to ship who have friend on shore be expecting to be met watched anxiously for familiar face cry of delight broke from two mitford a saw father mother in one of boat after first joyful greeting be over happy little party retired to cabin where must chat together undisturbed a passenger be on deck hour later returned to deck girl led father mother up to mr renshaw have to thank most heartily mr renshaw for great kindness to girl tell that have throughout voyage looked after a if have be own daughter there be looking after required can assure mr renshaw said be very pleased indeed to have in what may call little party be great advantage pleasure to own girl be going ashore at once mr mitford said girl tell that have acquaintance here own place be hundred of mile away be staying with friend while waiting arrival of ship therefore can not be sorry to say put up in other way in can be of assistance will be delighted to give aid in power girl say be thinking of making head quarter until decide upon district in mean to settle in case will of course be much better for to take house part of house than to stop at hotel if so will be best to settle upon one at once so a to go straight to avoid expense of moving twice be probable that friend jackson may know of suitable place if not will be glad to act a guide in house hunting mr renshaw here came up be introduced to mr mitford who repeated offer will be extremely glad mr renshaw replied though really think that be most unfair to take even for moment from girl after absence of five year oh never mind that mr mitford said will land at once will have morning to talk with if mr renshaw will come ashore at four o'clock in afternoon wife will meet at landing place if a suppose must prefer to do like to land morning have look at wellington for yourselves be address if will call at two o'clock time later will be at service must suggest though if do land early must first come round to because jackson may know place to suit if not be sure that will be glad to accompany act a guide must not like to trouble mr renshaw began dear sir know country everyone be glad to help new chum be name for fresh arrival to utmost of power if know anything about one think anything of trouble in case mr renshaw said smiling will gladly avail ourselves of offer must have be contented if voyage have lasted month longer being here all suppose want to get ashore a soon a possible therefore will probably call at address in course of hour so after get there wilfrid marion be indeed in such hurry to get ashore that very few minute after mitford left side of ship renshaws took boat started for shore most of other passenger also landed will go in alongside quay in hour time captain said a left so must look for there when have done sight seeing will begin to get baggage up at once for benefit of who be in hurry to get away to hotel will be glad for to make ship home until to morrow for hour after landing renshaws wandered about wellington found to be pretty well built town with wide street why be quite large place wilfrid exclaimed in surprise different of course from town at home with more open space expected must be much rougher than be be second town of island see mr renshaw said be important place well be glad did not cumber ourselves by bringing everything out from england for there will be difficulty in providing with everything require here after wandering about for hour proceeded to address mr mitford have given be house of considerable size standing in pretty garden quarter of mile from business part of town be warmly received by mitford introduced to mr mr jackson mr mitford have be telling that want to get house part of house for few week till look about decide where will settle down mr jackson said be land estate agent besides doing little in other way most of turn hand to anything present here have taken holiday for morning left clerk in charge so be quite at service will find difficult expensive if take whole house so must advise strongly to take lodging if be large party must be different only want sitting room three bed room must do with sitting room good sized bed room for wife small one for daughter mr renshaw said take bed room out for few night for wilfrid a will be starting with friend to journey through colony look out for piece of land to suit then there will be difficulty at will find lodging rather more expensive than in england mean more expensive than fashionable watering place certainly more expensive than in town of same kind at home house rent be high here then on other hand living will cost le than at home after hour search lodging be found in house at great distance from of mr jackson be small house kept by widow of owner captain of small trading ship have be lost year previously ship have fortunately be insured widow be able to keep on house in lived adding to income by letting portion of to new arrival who like renshaws intended to make stay of little time in wellington before taking step to establish a settler think mr jackson said when be settled be doing wisely by letting son here take run through colony there be greater mistake than for new comer to be in hurry settle in haste repent at leisure be rule mr mitford be saying that hoped that might settle down somewhere in locality at rate will be best to look round first there be plenty of land at present to be obtained anywhere there be many thing to be considered in choosing location carriage be of course vital consideration settler on river have great advantage over one who have to send produce long distance to market by waggon then again people prefer taking up virgin land clearing for while others be ready to pay higher sum to take possession of holding where much of hard work have already be done house stand ready for occupation at present one of course with wife daughter must think of settling in disturbed district although farm can be bought there for next to nothing war be hope nearly at end now that have ten british regiment in island have taken most of enemy pahs though have be prodigious time about colonist be very discontented with dilatory way in war have be carried on think that if thing have be left to ourselves must have stamped rebellion out in time red coat be much too slow too heavily weighted too cautious for sort of work maori defend pahs well inflict heavy loss upon assailant when latter at last make attack carry work maori manage to slip away next heard of be have erected fresh pah whole thing have to be gone through again however need not discus that now take that anyhow must not think of settling down anywhere in locality of tribe have be in revolt certainly not mr renshaw said be peaceful man if must get house land for nothing income thrown into bargain must refuse if must not go to bed without fear that place might be in flame before morning be bound to say that native have a whole behaved very well to settler must have be easy in great number of case for to have cut off have chosen to do so have fought fairly well according to rule of what may call honourable warfare tribesman be for most part christian have carried out christian precept in one case hearing that troop assembling to attack one of pahs be short of provision sent down boat load of potato other vegetable to saying that bible said 'if thine enemy hunger feed ' still in spite of instance of kind must certainly say go near disturbed district for one can not assert that if hostility continue will always be carried on in spirit however thing be at present perfectly peaceable throughout province of wellington hawke bay may be hoped may continue so have map plan of various district before son start will give information posse a to advantage disadvantage of locality nature of soil price at land can be purchased reputation of native in neighbourhood next day renshaws landed after breakfast took up abode in new lodging be plainly comfortably furnished after one of trunk containing nick nacks of description have be opened of content distributed room assumed comfortable home like appearance lodging have be obtained close by for two grimstones young fellow be heartily glad to be on shore again for life among steerage passenger during long voyage be dull monotonous mr renshaw have looked after during voyage have supplied from own store with many little comfort in way of food with book to assist to pas time still be very glad voyage be over when now told be probable that month even more might pas after arrival in colony before must settle on piece of land that during time must remain at wellington at once asked to get work of kind if must must be learning something about place sir must probably get food for work must be costing nothing must much rather do than loiter about town doing nothing mr renshaw approved of plan mentioned to mr jackson who on very day after landing spoke to settler who have come in from farm twenty mile in interior be active willing young fellow want pay only to be put up fed until man who have brought out here with get hold of farm will be extremely glad to have settler said be very busy time with couple of extra hand will be very useful will learn good deal a to way here in course of month a say must be far better for to be at work than to be loafing about place doing nothing accordingly next morning two grimstones went up country set to work chapter ix new zealand war for few day greater part of passenger who have arrived by flying scud remained in wellington mr atherton two allen have put up at same hotel latter intended to go out a shepherd in other capacity on farm for few month at rate before investing in land have two three letter of introduction to resident in wellington ten day after arrival of ship called at renshaws ' to say good bye a have arranged to go for month with settler up country promised to write regularly to wilfrid tell about part to be going mr atherton have promised to write to said tell about district visit with if discover anything particularly inviting will at rate come see if will give invitation when be settled look round there before buying land anywhere else must be very pleasant to be somewhere near will be very glad indeed to see mr renshaw said still more glad if take up piece of ground near having friend near be very great point in life a must be most agreeable having sort of little colony of own must have liked very much james allen said to say good bye to miss mitford a know father mother might seem strange for to call there think be at people to stand on ceremony mr renshaw said will put on bonnet go round with at once if like be accordingly done mr mitford have heard of young men a forming part of little group of passenger on board flying scud gave hearty invitation to pay visit if happened to be in neighbourhood next day started for farm on have engaged two day later there be general break up of party for mr mr mitford started with daughter in steamer bound to hawke bay will tell mr jackson what trouble in north have be about wilfrid asked that evening for have not be able to find out from paper be complicated question wilfrid when new zealand be first colonized native be very friendly early settler confidently pushed forward into heart of native district bought tract of land from chief settled there government purchased large block of land cut off by intervening native territory from main settlement sold land to settler without suspicion that be thereby dooming to ruin settler be mostly small farmer living in rough wooden house scattered about country surrounded by few field adjoining land be usually fern forest held by native fenced field turned cattle horse sheep at large in open country outside fence paying rent to native for privilege of doing so led to innumerable quarrel native plantation of wheat potato maize be seldom fenced in cattle of settler sometimes committed much devastation among for maori field be often situated at long distance from village cattle might therefore be day in patch before be found out on other hand gaunt long legged maori pig wander over country picking up own living be constantly getting through settler fence rooting up potato doing sort of damage in case settler always have worst of quarrel have weapon being isolated in midst of native dared not use while maori well armed numerous must come down waving tomahawk pointing gun settler however much in right be forced to give way natural result be that colonist be continually smarting under sense of wrong while maori grew insolent contemptuous be filled with overweening confidence in own power result of patience enforced submission of settler authority of queen over native have always be purely nominal one there be indeed treaty signed acknowledging government a none of chief put name to men who signed be person of inferior rank with authority to speak for rest treaty be not worth paper on be written maori from first exhibited great desire for education established numerous school in own district village in most case accepted nominally if not really christian religion studied history with good deal of intelligence of read that roman conquered england by making road everywhere through island native therefore determined that road must be constructed through land attempt on part of government to carry road beyond land have bought from be resisted so firmly angrily that attempt have to be abandoned native be well enough aware that behind despised settler be power of england that if necessary numerous army must be sent over relied absolutely upon almost impassable swamp river forest mountain here thought must maintain against force might be sent against relying upon became more more insolent overbearing for time before outbreak in one saw sooner later storm must burst matter have to be fought out until be driven from island native became thoroughly convinced of inability to oppose at first native have sold land willingly a number of european settler increased became jealous of obstacle be thrown in way of land sale by chief dispute be constantly arising owing to fact that absolute ownership of land be very ill defined perhaps dozen more person professed to have claim of sort other on piece of land have to be individually settled with before sale must be effected when a seemed be satisfactorily concluded fresh claimant must arise dispute be therefore of constant occurrence for there be authority outside principal settlement to enforce obedience to law even in auckland state of thing be almost unbearable drunken maori must indulge in insolent riotous behaviour in street for native must be imprisoned without risk of war with colonist scattered about over country risk be too great to be run in addition to want of rule authority to regulate dealing of native with english there be constant trouble between native tribe then began what be called king movement one of tribe invited others to join in establishing central authority who must at once put stop to tribal feud enforce something like law order thought that having king of own must improve condition must prevent land from being sold to white be protection to people at large enable to hold own against settler several of tribe joined in movement meeting be held in various part in imitation of colonial assembly fruit of much deliberation be that chief named potatau who be held in highest esteem not only by tribe of waikato throughout whole island a one of greatest of warrior wisest of chief be chosen a king movement excited much apprehension in auckland other settlement for be plain that if maori be governed by one man laid aside mutual enmity must become extremely formidable at great meeting be held bishop of new zealand head of wesleyan body several other missionary be present warned maori of danger must arise from course be taking warning be in vain potatau be chosen king mr fenton government official went on tour among native found that there be still what be called queen party king party be very much strongest for two year however thing went on somewhat a before be not until when quarrel arose over land in province of taranaki that trouble fairly began in district chief named wiremu kingi have established sort of land league given notice to governor that must not permit more land to be sold in district native named teira who owned land at waiteira offered for sale to government after examining title finding that be valid one land be purchased in spring of governor tried to take possession wiremu kingi forcibly resisted troop be called out war began wiremu kingi have unquestionably certain right on teira land for tribe be amicably settled upon have built house be making plantation of fact government be ignorant when bought land wiremu kingi at once joined king movement from have previously stood aloof meeting be held at waikato chief wiremu kingi mr m'lean native secretary addressed meeting potatau many of chief be of opinion that english have acted fairly in case many of younger chief however took part of taranaki native marched away joined unfortunately in first fight took place troop be driven back in attack upon pah news of success so fired mind of fighting men of waikato neighbouring tribe that flocked down to taranaki joined in plundering deserted home of settler in attack upon troop potatau council did must to stop men from going desire to distinguish to take part in victory over pakehas be what native call white be too strong for in midst of turmoil potatau died son matu taera be made king in fighting went on in taranaki discipline training soon began to make felt troop in colony be largely reinforced pah after pah be captured war went on though english regiment with strong force of artillery be engaged in can not be said that native have be conquered general cameron who came out assumed command found task before very difficult one there be for time pause in hostility when sir george grey came out a governor in place of governor brown native recommenced hostility by treacherous massacre near new plymouth fighting began again at once native pah near katikara river be attacked by column of infantry with artillery shelled by gun of ship of war maori be driven out of position that believed impregnable waikatos now rose murdered plundered many of settler force marched for first time into country carried formidable pah at koheroa although unprovided with artillery defeated maori in fight in thick bush very formidable position at merimeri lay surrounded by swamp near waikato river be next captured although held by eleven hundred maori led by great chief wiremu tamehana called by missionary william thompson next attack be upon strongly fortified position at rangiriri lying between waikato river waikare lake be successful nation be next thrashed at rangiawhia at kaitake on th of last march thus see in almost of fight succeeded in capturing enemy pah in defeating if fought in open unfortunately although engagement showed native that in fair fighting be match for troop have done little more when pahs be captured almost invariably managed to make way through dense bush can scarcely be said that do more than hold ground occupied by soldier so matter still go on fighting have be confined to taranaki auckland province may hope that will go further well be quite evident mr renshaw said that waikato country taranaki be fit place for quiet people to settle at present time suppose northern part of wellington be not much better can not say be mr jackson said wanganui tribe on river of name be in alliance with taranaki people have joined in fighting against believe that general cameron will shortly undertake campaign against must strongly advise to turn attention to eastern side of province to province of hawke bay higher up where have have trouble whatever where a know friend mitford be settled what be have heard about new religion have be started among maori there be little known about if be not must religion spread will add to difficulty one must think anything about one way other there be fellow named te ua who have always be looked upon a harmless lunatic doubt be lunatic still though whether will be harmless remains to be seen however little time ago gave out that archangel michael angel gabriel host of minor spirit visited gave permission to preach new religion bestowed on great power religion be to be called pai marire interpreted literally mean good peaceful be also called hau hau meaning of be obscure be special word of power that te ua professes to have specially received from angel gabriel a far a have be able to learn hau haus have special belief creed except leader have divine mission that say be to be implicitly obeyed certainly religion have spread quickly among tribe have latterly taken form of hostility to still may hope that will soon die out be said that te ua have told follower that be invulnerable if try conclusion with will very speedily find that have deceived be not likely to continue belief in then colonist mr jackson have taken little share in fighting so far oh yes have there have be several corp of ranger have done capital service corp led by major atkinson von tempsky m'donnell have done great service be far more dreaded by native than be slow moving regular troop fight native in own manner make raid into country attack position at night so much be dreaded that native in village in vicinity be in habit of leaving hut at night sleeping in bush lest must be surprised by active enemy general opinion among colonist be that ten company like von tempsky must do great deal more than ten british regiment towards bringing matter to conclusion in first place officer troop of regular army can not bring to regard native with respect deserve a foe movement be hampered by necessity of complicated system of transport operation accompanied a be by artillery waggon train be slow in extreme do what will native always slip through hand irregular corp on other hand thoroughly appreciate activity bravery of maori have lived among know custom way have suffered from arrogance insolence of native before outbreak of war most of have be ruined by destruction of farm loss of year of patient labour thus fight with personal feeling of enmity against foe fatigue danger be considered by if there be chance of inflicting blow upon enemy be convinced that at last imperial government will be so disgusted at failure of troop to bring war to conclusion at great expense loss of life entailed by operation that will recall regular leave colonist to manage affair in case have fear whatever a to bringing to prompt conclusion looking at matter from business point of view there be doubt mr renshaw that who like come out at present time will benefit considerably will get land at quarter price must have have to pay for have not be for trouble a soon a war be over tide of emigration will set in again more strongly than before land will go to price far exceeding ruled before outbreak began upon following morning mr atherton wilfrid embarked in schooner have be furnished by mr jackson with number of letter of introduction to settler in district be to visit will really only be of use to in small town said for in country district house be open have generally only to ride up to door put up horse walk in be almost sure to meet with hearty welcome still a be new comer have not rubbed off old country idea will be more pleasant for to take letter at port such a be may really find useful for will not find inn can strike out anywhere into back country without least fear of being inconvenienced by native two friend spent pleasant fortnight touching at settlement situated for most part at mouth of river spending time vessel remained there in short excursion into interior be most pleased with wairarapa valley running up from palliser bay being near wellington land be taken up there be many flourishing village small town be very nice wilfrid said price of land be far too high for might almost a well have taken to farming in england eastern coast of province be dotted by little settlement lying for most part at mouth of small river several of offered favourable facility for settlement passing on found that coast be bolder along province of hawke bay stopped at clive at mouth of bay for day two went up tukataki river in canoe to town of waipawa here found farm thick land comparatively expensive left schooner at napier chief town of province after making several excursion here went up

place yesterday wilfrid eldest girl said that agreed must suit father admirably be about ten mile up river be taken up only last year father say by young englishman who be going to make home for someone be engaged to in england few day since be killed by tree be cutting down falling upon lived twenty four hour after accident father rode out to when heard of directed to sell land for whatever must fetch to send money over to england there be two hundred acre on river comfortable log hut must of course be enlarged have about fifteen acre cleared cultivated scenery be beautiful much prettier than be here with lot of lovely tree fern there be many open patch so that more land can be cleared for cultivation easily mabel agreed when rode over there two day ago that must be just place for sound first rate wilfrid said just sort of place will suit how about miss mitford mr atherton asked have have interest at heart a well a of wilfrid people can take up next bit of land above mr mitford said langston be last settlement on river so can take up piece of land beyond at government upset price do a much fishing shooting a like for hear from daughter that be not thinking of permanently settling here be only bird of passage anyhow must not be bad investment for to buy considerable acreage for a soon a trouble be over there be sure to be rush of emigration there be very few place now where land be to be have on navigable river so that when be tired of life will be able to sell out at considerable profit sound tempting mr mitford will certainly have look at ground how much must piece of land be of mr langston poor fellow told to take anything must get said knew that at present be very difficult to sell land a new settler be coming out that must be very glad if get what gave for be ten shilling acre to throw in improvement have made so that hundred pound must buy really think that mr renshaw must do better if looked through island with cow two pen of pig score two of fowl must practically be able to live on land from hour settled there wilfrid be greatly pleased at idea knew that father mother have still eight hundred pound untouched two hundred pound together with proceeds of mother trinket jewel sale of pony pony carriage have be own property having sufficed to pay for passage of two labourer for expense up to time of arrival at wellington if must get piece of two hundred acre adjoining at same price think father must like to take said must give more room for horse cattle to graze of course must not want at first if a got on wanted more land have neighbour round must not get must be nuisance agree with mr mitford said two hundred acre be more than want if be going to put under plough be not enough if be going to raise cattle horse must certainly recommend to take up two hundred next land on side be still vacant poor langston chose spot because happened to be particularly pretty with open glade down to river land for fully two mile on side be unoccupied can get at ten shilling acre at present will see about for if make up mind after seeing langston place to take of course can not settle by sir not absolutely can only recommend to father a best place have seen if be a describe will be delighted well will ride over to morrow have look at only possible objection have be loneliness will improve in time native here be perfectly peaceful have never have slightest trouble with be good large party to begin with see wilfrid said having two men with will take away feeling of loneliness especially if mr atherton decides upon taking piece of land next to then there be two allen who came out with promised to write tell if found nice place said particularly that wanted ground on river if must get a be fond of boating fishing fancied that if there be other farm round that must until own place paid help to keep by taking neighbour crop down to market yes might pay if got large flat boat capable of carrying cargo a far a light good letter grocery from town be concerned indian must do cheaper in canoe however at present there be market for to come down to keep what call grocery store for benefit of two three score of settler there be on river make profit out of matter season get hogshead two of sugar couple of ton of flour barrel of molasses few chest of tea assortment of odds end such a pickle c with certain amount of rum whisky sell at price stand in at know what must do without here only open store on first monday of month then lay in what store require so give very little trouble generally take produce in return bill run on until get up to value of something customer want to sell horse two three dozen sheep that suit just a well a money a send cargo off to wellington two three month in time doubt settlement will spring up somewhere near mouth of river will have trader two establishing there at present be purveyor of district manage most of business of settler in way of buying selling at wellington so see if establish here will have choice to appoint grocer wilfrid laughed will be great advantage to to be able to get thing so close at hand be wondering how people did in back settlement generally send dray two three month down to nearest store may of course be fifty mile off even more here fortunately will not be obliged at first to have dray can send produce have to sell down by water be far cheaper more convenient mode of carriage will not have much to send for time so will not trouble at present oh will be quite content if can live on produce of farm for next year two laughed be mr mitford said immense advantage to settler when have sufficient fund to carry on for first two three year because in case gain natural increase of animal instead of having to sell off to pay way be wonderful how flock of sheep herd of cattle will increase if there be selling may take under favourable circumstance herd of cattle will nearly double two year allowing of course large proportion of bull calf to be sold off a soon a arrive at maturity sheep will increase even faster if can do without selling will be surprised if start with say fifty sheep ten cow in how short time will have a many animal a land will carry what be to do then sir well will then providing country have not in meantime become too thickly settled pay small sum to native for right of grazing cattle on unoccupied ground cultivate mere fraction of land in way can keep vastly larger herd than own ground must carry however be time to be turning in for night to morrow will start first thing after breakfast to inspect langston land chapter x glade when party assembled at breakfast next morning mr atherton first question be be there such thing a boat good sized canoe to be have mr mitford if have elephant here might manage a suppose keep animal in stud own must greatly prefer going by water to running risk of breaking horse back own neck if thing can not be obtained will get if will to let have native a guide will walk taking with small stock of provision can sleep at hut of langston for say frankly must not care about doing distance there back in one day have boat mr mitford said smiling will have couple of native to paddle up will give order for to be ready directly after breakfast will scarcely be there a soon a be will be there long before leave of course will spend time in going over ground will take boy with with luncheon basket so will find refreshment awaiting when get there will suit admirably mr atherton said boating excursion up unknown river be just thing like be when boat be reasonable size be once fool enough on amazon to allow to be persuaded that canoe at most two foot wide must carry torture suffered during expedition wedged in bottom of canoe holding on to side will never forget rascally indian made matter worse by occasionally giving sly lurch to boat being within ace of capsizing have two day of work before got to village where must obtain craft of reasonable size must think must have lost two stone in weight during time think that be rather advantage can see miss mitford broke off seeing smile upon girl face well yes must spare more must prefer that be abstracted by other mean than of agony of mind besides improvement be not permanent after hearty breakfast party prepared for start mr mitford have already said that must not accompany distance being longer than cared to ride four horse be therefore brought round mr atherton be first seen fairly on way in good sized boat paddled by two powerful maori mr mitford daughter wilfrid then mounted lad have already be asked if be accustomed to riding not lately replied used to have pony rode good deal when be small boy daresay can stick on wilfrid be delighted with ride through forest in other trip ashore way have led through open country with low scrub bush be first experience of new zealand forest fern be growing everywhere tree fern coated with scale rose from thirty to forty foot in air hymenophylla polypodia in extraordinary variety covered trunk of forest tree with luxuriant growth smaller fern grew between branch twig thick growth of fern of many specie extended everywhere over ground tree be for most part pine of different variety differing so widely in appearance from wilfrid have seen in england have not mr mitford assured that be really pine must never have guessed belonged to family mr mitford gave native name of many of totara matai be among largest most beautiful rimu be distinguished by hanging leaf branch tanekaha by parsley shaped leaf among towered up poplar shaped rewarewa hinau whose fruit mr mitford said be favourite food of parrot among great forest tree be several belonging to family of myrtle laurel especially rata whose trunk often measured forty foot in circumference on whose crown be branch of scarlet blossom be to fern orchid innumerable creeper covered ground with natural netting coiled round stem entwined among topmost branch that forest owed peculiar feature outside narrow cleared track along be riding must have be impossible for man to make way unless with assistance of knife hatchet especially a of climber be completely covered with thorn yet although so very beautiful appearance of forest be sombre melancholy great proportion of plant of new zealand bear flower except high up among of tree top gay blossom colour of kind meet eye to relieve monotony of verdure deep silence reigned wilfrid did not see butterfly during ride hear song even chirp of single bird be wilderness of tangled green unrelieved by life colour mr mitford must give name of only few of principal tree seeing infinite variety of foliage around wilfrid no longer wondered mr atherton must have made so long journey in order to study botany of island be unique for although many of tree shrub can be found elsewhere great number be entirely peculiar to island be there snake wilfrid asked can wander about without fear there be only one poisonous creature in new zealand be found north of port of tauranga forty fifty mile from here say exists only there round potaki near cook strait be small black spider with red stripe on back native say that bite be poisonous will not say cause death to healthy person though will make very ill there be instance of sickly person being killed by anyhow native dread very much however a beast be confined to two small locality need not trouble about thorn be only enemy have to dread a make way through forest be comfort anyhow wilfrid said must be great nuisance to have to be always on watch against snake road be traversing have be cleared of tree from one settler holding to stopped for few minute at three four of farmhouse of showed sign of comfort prosperity while one two be mere log cabin suppose people here have lately arrived wilfrid remarked a rode by one of without stopping have be here upwards of two year mr mitford replied place be not likely to improve be to be here ten be thriftless lazy lot content to raise just sufficient for actual want to pay for whisky be sort of people who bring discredit on colony by writing home declaring that there be getting on here that settler life be worse than dog people who come out with idea that colony be easy place to get living in be completely mistaken for man to succeed must work harder live harder here than must do at home be up with sun work until be too dark to work longer if employ men must set example to men will work here for master who work one who think that have only to pay hand can spend time in riding about country making visit in sitting quietly by fire will find that hand will soon be a lazy a be then living here be rougher than be at home for one in same condition of life fare be necessarily monotonous in hot weather meat will not keep more than day two settler can not afford to kill sheep day therefore have to depend upon bacon tinned meat can tell that continuance of such fare pall upon appetite one meal cease to be pleasure curse of country a of colony be whisky do think monotony of food have something to do with that if men must get greater variety in fare must not have same craving for drink be ruin of thousand young fellow who land here determines to work hard to abstain from liquor mean totally abstain though if have inclination at towards drink only safety be total abstinence be sure to get on make way while man who give way to drink be equally certain to remain at bottom of tree now be just passing boundary of holding have come to see see that piece of bark slashed off trunk of tree be what call blaze mark line of boundary after riding few minute further tree opened found in glade sloping down to river few acre of land have be ploughed up put under cultivation close by stood hut beyond grassy sward broken by few large tree stretched down to river be place mr mitford said very pretty one be poor young langston chose farm specially for bit of scenery be pretty wilfrid agreed be sure father mother will be delighted with a said be just like piece of park land at home hut be strongly built of log be about thirty foot long by twenty wide be divided into two room one furnished a kitchen living room other opening from a bed room there be not much furniture in mr mitford said what there be be strong serviceable be good deal better than generality of thing will find in new settler hut be getting thing in gradually a must afford so a to have really comfortably furnished by time came out to join of course place will not be large enough for party can easily add to at rate be vastly better coming to shanty like than arriving upon virgin ground having everything to do think be capital wilfrid said now will take ride over ground will show what be like of course will give more trouble clearing away forest than must do if settled upon land without tree upon forest land be generally best when be cleared think that to people like father mother land like be much preferable a in making clearing clump belt of tree can be left giving home like appearance to place of course upon bare land can plant tree be long time before grow to sufficient size to give character to homestead besides a told there be already several other natural clearing upon ground enough to afford grass for quite a many animal a will probably start with after hour ride over holding land adjoining mr mitford advised must be also taken up returned to hut shout greeted a arrived saw atherton walking up from river towards hut charming site for mansion said a rode up mr mitford think will make bid for on own account so cut out young friend wilfrid be afraid be too late mr mitford laughed have already agreed to give option of keeping open until can receive reply from father call too bad mr atherton grumbled however suppose must move on farther really seems charming place be sure mr renshaw will be delighted with why there must be thirty acre of natural clearing here about mr mitford replied there be two three other patch amount to about a much more other hundred forty be bush forest next lot have also patch of open land so that altogether out of four hundred acre there must be about hundred clear of bush how about next lot mr mitford fancy that there be about same proportion of open land have only once be up river higher than if remember right there be sort of low bluff rising forty fifty foot above river must form capital site for hut will set about work of exploration afternoon mr atherton said if next lot be anything like will be very well contented to settle down upon for bit have always have fancy for sort of robinson crusoe life think can get here tempered by change of occasional visit to friend when get tired of own company men have by time brought up basket of provision two girl be spreading cloth on grass in shade of tree at short distance from hut for agreed that must rather take lunch there than in abode so lately tenanted by young langston after meal be over party mounted horse rode back one of native who have come up from boat remained with mr atherton others started back in boat a mr atherton declared to be perfectly capable of making journey on foot when have finished exploration returned two day later said be quite satisfied with proposed site for hut with ground forest regard a only temporary inhabitant said will be well content if when be ready for move can get a much for ground a gave for in way will have lived rent free will have have enjoyment for nothing have doubt pleasant time to look back upon do never mean to settle down mr atherton mr mitford asked illustration wilfrid grimstones find hard work page in dim future may do so replied have be wandering ever since left college fifteen year ago return to london periodically spend few week occasionally few month there enjoy comfort of good living club life for bit then wandering fit seizes be off again nature altogether made mistake in case ought to have be thin wiry sort of man in case have doubt must have distinguished a african explorer something of sort unfortunately placed restless spirit in almost immovable frame of flesh consequence be circle of wandering be to certain extent limited make out to be much stouter than be mr atherton of course be stout not altogether out of proportion to height width of shoulder think put on good deal a excuse for laziness mr atherton laughed perhaps be right mr mitford though weight be really great drawback to carrying out view in regard to travel see be practically debarred from travelling in country where only mean of locomotion be riding on horse must not find animal in foreign country must carry for distance might in england grant find weight carrying cob capable of conveying twenty stone along good road might search asia in vain for horse while a for africa must take dozen native to carry in hammock no suppose will go on wandering pretty nearly to end of chapter will then settle down in quiet lodging somewhere in region of pall mall upon day after return from inspection of farm wilfrid wrote home to father describing location saying that thought be very thing to suit must be fortnight before answer must be received during time set to work at mr mitford place to acquire a much knowledge a possible of method of farming in colony answer arrived in due course with came two grimstones have suggested in letter that if father decided to take farm two men must be sent up at once to assist in adding to hut in preparing for coming that must follow fortnight later mr mitford also wrote offering warm invitation to stay for time with until own place must be ready for occupation mr mitford have inventory of furniture of hut be also sent in order that such further furniture a be needed might be purchased at wellington a soon a letter be received inclosing a did cheque for hundred pound wilfrid went over with two grimstones took possession mr mitford who be magistrate land commissioner for district drew up paper of application for plot of two hundred acre adjoining farm sent to wellington for mr renshaw signature said that in meantime wilfrid must consider land a belonging to a must be theirs a soon a necessary formality be completed money paid when wilfrid started two native whom mr mitford have hired for accompanied also

formerly occupied by young settler mr mitford came over next morning gave general instruction a to best way of setting about building of house have already advised that must be of class known a log hut be much cooler said in heat of summer than frame hut have advantage in very improbable event of trouble with native be much more defensible if like afterwards can easily face outside in with match board make a snug a like to begin with must certainly say build with log boy will tell tree have better cut down for work will take week to fell lop roughly square day week will send over team of bullock with native to drag up to spot work be begun at once dozen ax adz other tool have be brought up with supply from store work of felling commenced wilfrid must not have tree touched near hut there be just enough tree about here said must be awful pity to cut down merely to save little labour in hauling will not make great difference whether have team for week fortnight wilfrid two young englishman found chopping very hard work at first be perfectly astounded at rapidity with maori brought tree down of felling eight ten before new hand have managed to bring one to ground must not have believed if have not seen bob elder of two brother exclaimed a stood breathless with perspiration streaming from forehead that black chap must have beaten englishman like dozen stroke down topples tree while go chop chop chop seem to get nearer to will come in time wilfrid said suppose there be knack in like everything else look easy enough be not easy if know how to do be like rowing look easiest thing in world until try then find that be not easy at when work be done for day wilfrid grimstones must scarcely walk back to hut back felt a if be broken arm shoulder ached intolerably hand

damper have be cooked large piece of mutton be frizzling over fire wilfrid companion be almost too tired to eat enjoyed tea although missed milk to be accustomed be astonished at maori three native devouring amount of meat must have lasted others for week wonder work well when can put away such lot of food a bob grimstone said after watching for time in silent astonishment bill be always considered a being pretty good feeder one of chap must eat twice a much a two of must say mr wilfrid that in future best plan will be to let chap board why must be dear to have without pay if have to feed mutton be cheap out here wilfrid said can get five six pound for price one must cost at home still suppose give a much meat a can eat day must ask mr mitford about afterwards learned that native received ration of flour molasses tobacco that only occasionally salt pork fresh meat be issued to mr mitford advised that wilfrid must a long a be at work let feed with men will get good deal more

scale usually adopted in colony second day wilfrid grimstones be so stiff that must at first scarcely raise ax gradually wore off at end of three four day found that must get through far greater amount than at first with much le fatigue to even on last day of week must do little more than third of amount performed by native by time ample supply of tree have be felled trunk have be cut into suitable length roughly squared bullock arrived from mr mitford a soon a first log be brought up to house work of building be commenced maori carpenter now took lead under instruction wall of house

have erected small shelter twenty yard away from own have not quite shaken down yet said press to come over to see until have got everything into order be sure feel thankful to that expect to be tramping over to see after long day work here by time people arrive will have everything in order be expecting thing have written for own heavy baggage in few day from wellington glad a be to hear that father mother have arrived wilfrid must have preferred that coming must have be delayed until house be finished ready for after first greeting at water side said must not be disappointed mother at what will see now everything be in confusion ground be covered with log chip looked much prettier can assure when first saw will do so again when have finished cleared up will make allowance wilfrid mother replied a helped from boat see that allowance be necessary be indeed sweetly pretty spot look a said like park at home if tree have be planted with special view to effect must not have be better placed have done excellently wilfrid father said putting hand on shoulder mr mitford here have be telling how energetically have be working see that house have made wonderful progress marion have after first greeting leapt lightly from boat run up to house towards others proceeded at more leisurely pace stopping often looking round at pleasant prospect marion be full of question to wilfrid when arrived why be wall made so thick how be going to stop up crevice between log where be window door coming from be roof going to be made of be there going to be floor be ground inside going to be raised to level of door sill when did expect to get finished when must be ready to come in must get creeper to run up hide ugly log be to be painted to remain a be wilfrid answered question a well a be able there be to be floor over new portion of building mr mitford be getting up requisite number of plank from saw mill at next settlement crevice be to be stopped with moss must be for father to decide whether log must be covered with match boarding inside out whether must be left a be for present must probably take fortnight to finish roof at least week beyond before place must be fit for to move in see marion have built very much on plan decided upon on board ship only be obliged to make change in position of kitchen men room two grimstones be going to set to work to morrow to dig up portion of ploughed land behind house sow vegetable seed thing grow very fast here will soon get kitchen garden a to flower will leave to be decided when come here wish must come over

quite necessary for father mother must never eat food maori cook turn out then have got to learn to make butter cheese to cure bacon be most important point for must certainly keep pig cure own a mr mitford doe for stuff have got at most of place touched at be almost uneatable so see there be plenty to occupy time until move in here comfort will depend vast deal upon pain take to learn to do thing properly what be going to roof with wilfrid mr renshaw asked be going to use pole father will be split in two nailed with flat side down on rafter shingle be going to be nailed on will give good solid roof will keep out good deal of heat afterwards if like can put beam across room from wall to wall plank turn space above into storeroom of course will make house cooler room more comfortable a be not absolutely necessary thought might be left for while think wilfrid must like to have room done with board inside at once outside ceiling speak of can very well wait will be impossible to get room to look at neat tidy with rough log for wall certainly will be more comfortable wilfrid agreed mr mitford will get match board for will measure up wall evening let know how much will be required

daughter who have not accompanied have lunch ready spread out on grass meal be merry one mr renshaw be in high spirit at finding thing so much more home like comfortable than have expected wife be not only pleased for herself still more so at seeing that husband evinced willingness to look at matter in best light to enter upon life before without regret over past what be going to call place mr renshaw mr mitford asked be always important point have not thought about mr renshaw replied what do think oh there be lot of suitable name replied looking round might call riverside park glade think glade must be very pretty marion said riverside must suit so many place like glade too mr renshaw said have thought of anything wilfrid mother have never given thought think glade will do nicely so be settled success to glade be thereupon formally drunk in cup of tea month later renshaws took possession of new abode looked very neat with verandah in front of central portion creeper wilfrid have planted against wall on day after visit promised speedily to cover log of house be built inside flooring have be planed stained deep brown varnished while match boarding covered wall be stained light colour also varnished furniture have arrived day before from hawke bay be somewhat scanty wilfrid marion who have come over for purpose have made most of square of carpet rug gave cosy appearance to floor white curtain hung before window few favourite picture engraving have brought with from home broke bareness of wall altogether be very pretty snug little abode of mr mr renshaw took possession chapter xi hau haus next three month made great change in appearance of glade three four plot of gay flower cut in grass between house river gave brightness to appearance house be now covered a far a roof with greenery might well have be mistaken for rustic bungalow standing in pretty ground on bank of thames behind large kitchen garden be in full bearing be surrounded by wire network to keep out chicken duck goose wandered about picked up living a chose returning at night to long low shed erected for at distance from house receiving plentiful meal on arrival to prevent from lapsing into altogether wild condition forty acre of land have be reploughed sown crop have already made considerable progress in more distant clearing dozen horse twenty thirty cow small flock of hundred sheep grazed while distance up glade in house stood be pig sty whose occupant be fed with refuse from garden picking up however larger portion of living by rooting in wood long before mr mr renshaw moved into house wilfrid whose labour be now le severe have paid first visit to mr atherton hut be at once astonished delighted with contained indeed one room sixteen foot square that room have be made one of most comfortable den possible there be flooring ground have be beaten until be a hard a baked clay be almost covered with rug sheep skin sort of divan ran round three side of be also cushioned with skin log wall be covered with cow hide cured with hair on from hook bracket hung rifle fishing rod other article while horn other trophy of chase be fixed to wall while renshaws have contented with stove mr atherton have gone to expense trouble of having great open fireplace with brick chimney outside wall here even on hottest day two three log burnt upon old fashioned iron dog on wall above be sort of trophy of oriental weapon two very large comfortable easy chair stood by side of hearth in centre of room stood old oak table richly carved black with age book case of similar age make with shelf well filled with standard work stood against one wall unoccupied by divan wilfrid stood still with astonishment a looked in at door mr atherton have opened in response to knock come in wilfrid a told yesterday evening have just got thing little straight comfortable must think have got comfortable wilfrid said must not have thought that log cabin must have be made a pretty a why where did get thing surely can never have brought with indeed mr atherton laughed greatest portion of be product of country there be difficulty in purchasing skin arm set of horn trophy book few other thing brought with have theory people very often make uncomfortable merely to effect saving of pound two now rather like making snug carriage of thing did not add above five pound to expense surely that table book case be never made in new zealand certainly not wilfrid at time be made native of country hunted moa in happy ignorance of existence of white race regard getting possession of thing a special stroke of good luck be wandering in street of wellington on very day after arrival when saw in shop doubt have be brought out by well to do emigrant who clung to in remembrance of home in old country probably at death place came into hand of goth who preferred clean deal table to what considered old fashioned thing anyhow there be in shop bought at once a also arm chair be a comfortable a anything of kind have ever tried by way be good shot with rifle wilfrid sir never fired rifle in life before left england shot gun then think must do well to practise lad two men of yours must practise too never can say what may come of native disturbance rumour of progress of new religion among be not encouraging be quite true that native on side of island have hitherto be perfectly peaceable if get inoculated with new religious frenzy there be saying what may happen will speak to father about not in way to alarm will point out that be of use having brought out firearm if none of know how to use suggest that will be good thing if men be to make point of firing dozen shot morning at mark will add that might just a well do so that even lady might find amusement using of course light rifle firing from rest with ordinary rifle with light charge that might practice with revolver anyhow be certainly desirable that father men must learn to be good shot with weapon will gladly come over at first act a musketry instructor wilfrid embraced idea eagerly mr atherton on occasion of first visit to glade in casual sort of way remarked to mr renshaw that thought white man woman in outlying colony ought to be able to use firearm a although might never be called upon to use in earnest knowledge that must do so with effect must greatly add to feeling of security comfort mr renshaw at once took up idea accepted other offer to act a instructor accordingly a soon a renshaws be established upon farm became one of standing rule of place wilfrid two men must fire twelve shot at mark morning before starting for regular work at farm target be figure roughly cut out of wood representing size to extent outline of man figure be much better to accustom to fire at mark of kind than to practise always at target mr atherton said man may shoot wonderfully well at black mark in centre of white square yet make very poor practice at human figure with dull shade of colour irregular outline will not be able to tell where bullet hit wilfrid said especially after dummy have be hit good many time be not very material where hit man wilfrid so that do hit if man get heavy bullet whether in arm leg body there be more fight in can tell by sound of bullet if hit figure if hit have done what want to need to practise at distance over three hundred yard be quite outside range at must ever want to do shooting indeed from fifty to two hundred consider useful distance to practise at if get to shoot so well that can with certainty hit man between range may feel pretty comfortable in mind that can beat off attack might be made on house be defending when have learnt to do at full size figure can put in bush so that only head shoulder be visible a must be of native standing up to fire white target work be very well for shooting for prize if troop be trained to fire at dummy figure at from fifty to two hundred yard distance allowed plenty of ammunition for practice kept steadily at must see that single company must be more than match for whole regiment trained a soldier be with steady practice morning wilfrid two young men made very rapid progress at end of three month be very seldom that bullet be thrown away sometimes mr renshaw joined in practice more often fired few shot time during day with marion who became quite enthusiast in exercise mr renshaw declined to practise said that be content to remain non combatant must undertake work of binding up wound loading musket on saturday afternoon when men left off work somewhat earlier than usual there be always shooting for small prize twelve shot be fired by at figure placed in bush hundred yard away with only head shoulder visible after have fired shot hole be counted then filled up with mud so that next mark made be easily distinguishable mr renshaw be uniformly last grimstones marion generally ran other very close putting eight nine of bullet into figure wilfrid be always handicapped two shot a generally put whole of ten bullet into mark be in majority of case victor shooting party be sometimes swelled by presence of mr atherton two allen who have arrived fortnight after renshaws have taken up section of land next below mr atherton be incomparably best shot of party wilfrid indeed seldom missed took careful steady aim at object while mr atherton fired apparently without waiting to take aim at sometimes must not even lift gun to shoulder must fire from side standing with back to mark must turn round fire instantaneously that sort of thing be only attained by long practice must say in answer to wilfrid exclamation of astonishment see have be shooting in different part of world at different sort of game for fifteen year in many case quick shooting be of just a much importance a straight shooting be with revolver mr atherton most surprised friend must put six bullet into sheet of note paper at distance of fifty yard firing with such rapidity that weapon be emptied in two three second learned that said among cow boy in west of be perfectly marvellous shot be sole amusement spend inconsiderable portion of pay on cartridge seems to become instinct with however small object at fire be almost certain to hit be common thing with for one man to throw empty meat tin into air for to put six bullet in before touch ground so certain be of own others aim that one will hold halfpenny between finger thumb for to fire at from distance of twenty yard be common joke for one to knock pipe out of mouth when be quietly smoking a see though shooting seems to wonderful must be considered quite poor shot among cow boy of course with incessant practice such a have must shoot good deal better than do must never approach perfection for simple reason have not strength of wrist pas life in riding half broken horse incessant exercise hard work harden until muscle be like steel scarcely feel what to ordinary man be sharp wrench from recoil of heavily loaded colt life be in way pleasant at glade work of breaking up land went on steadily labour though hard be not excessive in evening allen mr atherton frequently dropped in occasionally mr mitford daughter rode over party came up in boat expense of living be small have ample supply of potato other vegetable from garden of egg from poultry of milk butter cheese from cow while salt meat be staple of food be varied occasionally by chicken duck goose while sheep now then afforded week supply of fresh meat mr renshaw have not altogether abandoned original idea have already learnt something of maori language from study on voyage rapidly acquired facility of speaking from conversation with two native permanently employed on farm one of be man of forty year old named wetini other be lad of sixteen son whose name be whakapanakai a name be voted altogether too long for conversational purpose be re christened jack wetini spoke few word of english jack who have be educated at one of mission school spoke fluently with wetini wife inhabited small hut situated at edge of wood at distance of about two hundred yard from house be mr renshaw custom to stroll over there of evening seating by fire however hot weather native always kept burning must converse with wetini upon manner custom religious belief ceremony of people in conversation jack at first acted a interpreter be not many week before mr renshaw gained such proficiency in tongue that such assistance be no longer needed period of peace tranquillity at glade be short one wilfrid learnt from jack who have attached specially to that there be report among native that prophet te ua be sending out missionary over island statement be true te ua have sent out four sub prophet with order to travel among tribe inform that te ua have be appointed by angel a prophet that be to found new religion to be called pai marire that legion of angel waited time when tribe having be converted general rising must take place pakeha be annihilated by assistance of angel after knowledge of language of art science must be bestowed upon pai marire have te ua instruction be carried out agent travelled quietly among tribe carefully abstaining from open hostility to white until whole of native population have be converted rising when came must have be terrible one might have ended in whole of white population being destroyed forced for time to abandon island fortunately sub prophet be men of ferocious character too impatient to await appointed time attacked settler a soon a collected sufficient convert to do so so brought about destruction of leader plan attack put colonist on guard enabled authority to collect troop stand on defensive what be still more important caused many of tribe have not be converted to pai marire faith to range on side of english not because loved white because from time immemorial tribe have be divided against other traditional hostility weighed more with than jealousy with white settler still although rumour a to spread of pai marire hau hau faith reached ear of settler there be few in western province who believed that there be real danger maori have always be peaceful friendly with must not believe that with whom have dwelt so long must suddenly without reason become bloodthirsty enemy wilfrid said nothing to parent a to what have heard from jack talked over with mr atherton allen latter be disposed to make light of mr atherton took matter seriously there be never saying how thing will go with native said savage seem to be alike up to certain point be intelligent sensible be like child be easily excited superstitious in extreme can be deceived without slightest difficulty by designing people of course to story of te ua sound absolutely absurd be reason why must appear absurd to people have embraced sort of christianity have read of miracle of sort will have more difficulty in believing that angel must destroy european in island than that assyrian army be miraculously destroyed before jerusalem without taking too much account of business think wilfrid that will be just a well if of in outlying settlement take certain amount of precaution will write down at once to agent at hawke bay asking to buy couple of dog send up by next ship will tell that doe not matter what sort of dog be so that be good watch dog though of course must prefer that must be decent dog of sort dog one must make companion of must advise to do same will ask mr mitford to get up at once heavy door shutter for window strong enough to stand assault here again must advise to do same can assign reason like to father with couple of dog to give alarm with strong door shutter need not be afraid of being taken by surprise be only surprise that have in first place to fear of course if there be to be anything like general rising must have to gather at central spot agreed upon else to quit settlement altogether until matter settle down still trust that nothing of sort will take place at rate have to fear prepare against at present be attack by small party of fanatic have difficulty in persuading father to order strong oak door shutter for window to get couple of dog began subject by saying mr atherton be going to get strong shutter to window father think must be good thing if be to get same for window what do want shutter for wilfrid for just same reason that have be learning to use firearm father suppose that native who be friendly with be going to turn treacherous still a there be bare possibility of such thing have taken pain in learning to shoot straight in same way must be just a well to have strong shutter put up at suppose be going to be attacked if be shutter must be invaluable must effectually prevent anything like night surprise expense must be great in unlikely event of native being troublesome in part of island must sleep much more soundly comfortably if knew that there be fear of being taken by surprise mr atherton be sending for couple of dog too have always thought that must be jolly to have dog two here if want a guard must be pleasant a companion when one be going about place few day after arrival of two large watch dog of heavy shutter door mr mitford rode in to glade chatted for few minute on ordinary subject then mr renshaw said be anything matter mr mitford look more serious than usual can hardly say that anything be exactly matter mr renshaw have batch of newspaper letter from wellington morning give rather stirring news hau haus have come into collision with again know that fortnight since have news that have attacked party of men under captain lloyd defeated contrary to native tradition have cut off head of slain among whom be captain lloyd be afraid that after must soon hear more of opinion have be completely justified on st of may two hundred of ngataiwa tribe three hundred other native under te ua prophet hepanaia parengi kingi of taranaki attacked strong fort on sentry hill garrisoned by fifty men of d regiment under major short ngataiwa took part in action hau haus charged with great bravery garrison fortunately being warned by yell of what be coming received with heavy fire that leading rank be swept away fell back in confusion made second charge be equally unsuccessful then fell back with loss of fifty two killed among whom be hau hau prophet parengi kingi other affair have taken place in wellington district matene of hau hau prophet came down to pipiriki tribe of wanganui people be bitterly hostile to a have taken part in of former fighting chief thirty six of men be killed tribe at once accepted new faith mr booth resident magistrate who be greatly respected among went up to try to smooth matter down be seized must have be put to death if have not be for interference in favour of young chief named hori patene who managed to get wife child safely down in canoe to town of wanganui hau haus prepared to move down river to attack town sent word to ngatihau branch of tribe who lived down river to join two other of wanganui tribe living on lower part of river refused to do so also refused to let pas down river sent challenge for regular battle to take place on island of moutoa in river challenge be accepted at dawn on following morning native three hundred fifty strong proceeded to appointed ground hundred picked men crossed on to island rest remained on bank a spectator of hundred fifty divided into three party under chief formed advance guard while other fifty remained in reserve at end of island two hundred yard away too far to be of much use in event of advance guard being defeated enemy party be hundred thirty strong be difficult to understand why larger body be not sent over to island to oppose especially a belief in invulnerability of hau haus be generally believed in even by native opposed to be curious fight quite in manner of traditional warfare between various tribe before arrival on island lower tribesman fought not for defence of town for be not very friendly with european having be strong supporter of king party simply for prestige of tribe hostile war party have ever forced river none ever must do so hau haus came down river in canoe landed without opposition then party of wanganui advance guard fired although hau haus be thirty yard distant none of fell return volley killed chief of two out of three section of advance guard many others disheartened by loss of chief two section gave way shouting that hau haus be invulnerable third section well led by chief held ground be driven slowly back by overwhelming force of enemy battle appeared to be lost when tamehana sub chief of one of flying section after vainly trying to rally men arrived on ground refusing to obey order to take cover from hau haus fire dashed at enemy killed two of with double barrelled last of three leader be at moment shot dead nearly men be more le severely wounded a hau haus rushed forward fired volley into at close quarter killing several still came on when tamehana again rushed at seizing spear of dead man drove into heart of hau hau catching up gun tomahawk of fallen man drove latter so deeply into head of foe that in wrenching out handle be broken finding that gun be unloaded dashed in face of foe snatching up be about to fire when bullet struck in arm nevertheless fired killed man next moment be brought to ground by bullet shattered knee at moment hainoma who commanded reserve came up with with fugitive whom have succeeded in rallying fired volley then charged down upon hau haus with tomahawk after desperate fight enemy be driven in confusion to upper end of island where rushed into water attempted to swim to right bank prophet be recognized among swimmer one of wanganui plunged in after overtook just a reached opposite bank in spite of prophet uttering magic word must have paralysed assailant killed with tomahawk swam back with body to hainoma seem to have be two serious affair mr renshaw said a hau haus be defeated in may hope that have heard last of for a prophet be killed belief in invulnerability of te ua follower must be at end wish must think so mr mitford said be terribly hard to kill superstition te ua will of course say that two prophet disobeyed positive instruction thus brought fate upon incident may therefore rather strengthen than decrease influence best part of business in mind be that of tribe have thrown in lot on side if not actually on side at rate against hau haus after need hardly fear general action of native against there be sort of obscure alliance between tribe arising from marriage from having fought on same side in far back struggle result be that tribe who have alliance with wanganui will henceforth range on same side will at rate hold aloof from pai marire movement will also force other tribe who might have be willing to join in general movement to stand neutral think now that although may have great deal of trouble with te ua follower may regard absolute danger to european population of island a past there may fear be isolated massacre for hau haus with cutting off of head carrying about have introduced entirely new savage feature into maori warfare be inclined to think precaution atherton be taking be rather superfluous after will certainly adopt everything be perfectly quiet here when see how readily whole tribe embrace new religion a soon a prophet arrives be ready at once to massacre man who have long dwelt among for whom have always evinced greatest respect liking be impossible longer to feel confident that native in part of country be to be relied upon a absolutely friendly trustworthy be sorry now have be to extent mean of inducing to settle here at time gave advice thing seemed settling down at other end of island hau hau movement reached only a vague rumour seemed so absurd in that one attached importance to pray blame mr mitford come of be delighted with choice have made be vastly more comfortable than have expected to be in so short time thing look promising far beyond expectation a say must have have reason to suppose that absurd movement be going to lead to such serious consequence indeed must have ground for supposing that be likely to cause trouble on side of island far removed a be from scene of trouble even now be in fact confined to district where fighting have be going on for last three four year taranaki neighbourhood for wanganui river although flow into sea in north of wellington district rise in of taranaki tribe who became hau haus came down river have already taken part in fighting with troop really see reason therefore for fearing that will spread in direction there be reason mr mitford agreed only unfortunately native seldom behave a expect to do generally act precisely a expect will not act at rate will set to work at once to construct strong stockade at back of house have long be talking of forming large cattle yard there so that will not in case be labour thrown away while if trouble must come will serve a rallying place to settler of district can drive in horse cattle for shelter where can if attacked hold own against native of district really think be looking at in almost too serious light mr mitford still fact that there be such rallying place in neighbourhood will of course add to comfort in case must hear alarming rumour quite so mr renshaw idea be there be nothing like being prepared though agree with that there be little chance of trouble in remote settlement be just a well to take precaution against worst chapter xii first alarm one morning mr mr renshaw went down to spend long day with mitford latter have sent up boat over night started first thing in morning for two three day previous jack young native have more than once spoken to wilfrid of propriety of hand keeping near house wilfrid have failed to obtain from specific reason for warning bad men come down from waikato said much talkee talkee among native what do talk about jack jack shook head jack hear talkee men come to hut talk with father other maori on land steal in talk too talk before jack always turn out send on errand jack hear sometimes word think that trouble come young master better not go far away by tell two white men to keep close to hut perhaps nothing come better to be on guard very well jack be obliged to for warning will tell grimstones not to go out to outlying clearing to occupy with what can find to do near home jack nodded that best master wilfrid talk too much with if people thought speak to then trouble come to jack wilfrid nodded without saying anything to father mother told grimstones to keep near house after have done shooting of morning said instead of bringing gun into house a usual take down with to place where be at work so that will be handy in case of necessity most likely there be danger whatever have heard rumour that people from waikato have come into neighbourhood if so doubt be trying to get tribe here to join hau haus think that there be much chance of succeeding for native have always be very friendly there have be dispute about land other grievance when one know how suddenly have risen in other place be better to take precaution after breakfast on morning when father mother have started wilfrid strolled out on to verandah stood for little time hesitating what must do grimstones have just started to look up cattle in one of distant clearing one of native hand having reported evening before two of animal be missing will go not far till come back said to garden want hoeing weed grow a fast here a do at home will be just job for be about to turn to enter house when saw four native emerge from tree make towards marion said through open door get gun down from rack see that be capped ready there be four native coming towards house daresay be friendly be probably only on way down river to look for work still a be alone can not be too careful hearing marion reply right lad leant against door in careless attitude awaited coming of native a approached saw be stranger to although knew most of native in neighbourhood by sight for not infrequently came in to barter pig sheep for tobacco sugar other thing necessary to native a came up gave usual salutation of good day to wilfrid replied be hungry tall maori who by dress appeared to be chief said will get something to eat wilfrid answered maori must have followed into house stopped said sharply allow stranger in house know be free to enter depart a choose have not seen of before if will sit down on bench outside will bring food soon reappeared with dish of maize boiled pork for supply be generally kept in readiness in case of native must come in shuffle about make noise said to marion a got dish from cupboard can not know who be inside if mean mischief honestly like look will be more likely to try on if think that be alone maori took food in silence a ate be amused to hear marion stamping heavily about inside occasionally speaking a if to father must see that men be listening exchanged word in low tone with other presently leader of party said drink wilfrid went in brought out pitcher of water gin chief said shortly have gin to give wilfrid replied keep spirit native rose to foot will come in see leader said wo wilfrid said firmly have given what food there be in house be welcome to stranger come into house unless be invited native laid hand on wilfrid shoulder to push aside four month of chopping digging have hardened muscle in lad body did not move inch jerked maori hand off shoulder with exclamation of anger native drew heavy knobbed stick from girdle round waist before must raise to strike figure appeared at door marion held gun in hand raised to shoulder drop that said in clear ringing voice fire taken by surprise seeing rifle pointed full at head chief instantly dropped club at same instant wilfrid sprang to door exclaiming go in marion before native have recovered from surprise door be shut barred have not be deceived by marion attempt to personate man sharp ear have told while eating meal that there be one person in house that be girl knew that there be other about having watched house for time have therefore anticipated that work of murder plunder must be accomplished without difficulty instant door be closed bounded away at top of speed to shelter of bush expecting moment to hear report of rifle behind renshaws have not thought of firing well done marion wilfrid exclaimed a soon a door be fastened be on point of springing upon when heard voice behind think must have tripped backwards if have done so others must have be upon with club now let close fasten shutter though think need have fear of coming back in case have heard of have always fallen on settler suddenly killed before have time for resistance think there be chance of trying to attack now that know be ready for expect that be passing down to of people below seeing a thought defenceless hut thought must be easy business to plunder knock on head anyone might find here now that have failed will probably go on journey again be horribly frightened wilfrid marion said when joined other in sitting room after making fastening secure did not look frightened bit marion certainly gave that fellow tremendous scare did drop club sharp now what do think have better do first thing be to get grimstones in fellow may have be watching for time saw go out have got gun with wilfrid native must surely not think of attacking two men with gun when have nothing club certainly must not think of doing marion chance be that have got gun that left in bush when sallied out a wanted to look peaceful take by surprise did not think of wilfrid yes perhaps have gun well know have always be agreed that in case of danger three shot must be fired a warning to who might be out if fire hear will hurry back yes might be shot a make way down to house be what be afraid of marion be silent for minute do know where have gone to wilfrid have gone in first place to clearing with two big tree standing in centre can not say where may go to afterwards for have to look for four five of cattle have strayed away can slip out from window in men room get into bush work round to clearing wilfrid fire three shot there must bring to at once see native must cross clearing here without having under gun marion wilfrid said decidedly be not to be thought of if saw going must work up through bush on side to top of clearing then follow think will fire three shot have talked over several time know grimstones have be told that if heard alarm must make way cautiously to top of clearing see what be going on before venture to make for house a soon a see can shout to to keep to bush on left till get opposite house everything be so still that one can hear shout long way feel sure must make understand a far off a end of clearing be a if be sure that fellow be still hanging about ready to attack probability be other way must have murdered if must have taken by surprise be different thing altogether to making attack now know be armed ready taking three of rifle wilfrid opened one of shutter at back of house fired with interval of about five second between shot then stood at window watched upper end of glade dear exclaimed suddenly be sorry fired why marion asked in surprise because mr atherton be sure to hear if be at home will come hurrying over if fellow be still there may come right into middle of think must do wilfrid marion said after thinking for moment two mr atherton be not like grimstones have be in sort of adventure though be sure will come to help a soon a can think must take precaution must know that native will be likely to come from above therefore be between must come along carefully so a not to be surprised hope so be sure wilfrid said for be awfully good fellow still a say be sure to keep eye opened unless surprise must back against four of in quarter of hour heard shout from edge of clearing there be allen wilfrid exclaimed a leapt to door forgot about although of course be nearer than mr atherton all right shouted can come on two allen ran across open space between wood house what be wilfrid exclaimed a came up fired alarm signal did not be breathless with speed at have run have be engaged in felling when heard shot have thrown down ax run into hut for gun made for glade at top of speed in few word wilfrid explained what have happened that there be reason to believe that four hostile neighbour be lurking in bush on opposite side of glade allen at once volunteered to go up to head of clearing to warn grimstones returning to point where have left forest made way among tree until reached upper end of clearing then sat down listened in few minute heard sound of breaking twig here come men elder allen said maori must come along noiselessly two three minute later grimstones came up at run accompanied by two dog way james allen said what be sir bob grimstone gasped be long way in wood when thought heard three shot be not quite sure about started back a fast a must come there be nothing wrong hope fortunately nothing have happened james allen replied four strange maori came up to house must certainly have murdered mr wilfrid sister if have not be prepared for whether be in bush now not know have come up to warn not to go up clearing a if be there might pick off a did so must come down under shelter of tree till be opposite house in ten minute reached house just a did so mr atherton appeared at edge of wood have just left thank god be safe said a strolled up to house three shot gave fright a heard more be relieved for signal told that have not be taken by surprise a there be more firing be clear have drawn off how did get to side of clearing mr atherton followed wood till within few hundred yard of clearing a made sure if there be hostile native about must be at edge of bush then got down into river waded along edge bank in front here be not high enough to hide though stooped a much a must reckoned that eye must be fixed on house be not likely must be noticed now what be about be sure must not have fired signal unless there have be good cause for alarm wilfrid related what have taken place well done miss marion mr atherton said when have finished be lucky for brother that did not go with father mother morning be lucky wilfrid agreed at same time if have be quite alone must have closed shutter door a came up kept indoors only ventured to meet outside because knew that marion have gun ready to hand to moment wanted yes see there be not time to hand gun wilfrid a turned out must have be knocked on head to certainty if sister have not come to rescue that certainly must know owe marion life what do think have better do now think can do anything wilfrid beyond trying to find out whether fellow who came here be alone be part of larger party where be native three men be chopping jack went out with grimstones to look for cattle be with when heard shot fired bob be with minute two before be following track after heard signal did not think anything more about whether followed went on looking after cattle know if go to door wilfrid give loud cooey will bring in if be within hearing may be sure that heard signal for ear be keener than of men must not rush straight back must come cautiously through wood according to nature wilfrid went to door gave loud cooey minute later maori issued from bush nearly opposite house ran in be just where native took to bush wilfrid said perhaps will be able to tell something about expect have be scouting mr atherton said coming boldly out from point be pretty sure proof that native have made off well jack so heard signal jack nodded what have be doing since wilfrid asked jack went through bush fast till got near house then a gun be not going off knew there must be attack thought black man might be lying in bush so crept crawled presently heard man talk then saw four maori walking fast away from house only heard say a passed use now too many pakehas come day finish ' jack be coming straight to house when heard cooey have seen nothing of father other two men jack maori boy shook head chop wood perhaps not heard signal more likely heard thought better to stay away wilfrid said got gun not fighting men jack said a if in excuse there be something in mr atherton said hau haus have always proved even more merciless towards friendly native than towards white men being unarmed might even with best disposition in world be afraid to come to house at rate be fellow have made off see be in position to shoot of if got chance while be scarce in position to return compliment why not james allen asked because although must have now doubt whatever a to intention have committed actual assault tried best to push way into house when wilfrid opposed one of drew club might say be only done to frighten that have thought of using if have fired shot must of course be justified in killing be to begin shooting whole tribe belong to must take up there must be cry for vengeance even if nothing be done at once must be marked down to be wiped out at first opportunity will learn in day two whether matter be serious not mr atherton went on if there be anything like general defection of native in part yours will not have be only place threatened will hear of attack on other settler if hear of such attack can safely put down that four fellow be mere haphazard passer like tramp at home who be tempted by fact that house contained only two person in case need feel further anxiety for a must be able to recognize if met anywhere must not be likely to come near part of district again at rate will set off with boy here one of dog will follow up track see if have gone well away have doubt have done so still will be more comfortable to make certain of by way bob wilfrid said take two dog out again think must be good for hunting cattle must be much more likely to frighten hunt away than to help to drive in at rate be bought a guard be to remain about house will go with mr atherton thank wilfrid jack will be enough to help follow track for what heard say be almost proof that have gone will go round to own place when have followed fairly off land will come round here to morrow morning when will hold general council of war be use coming back again evening a father others will not be here before time be possible that will bring news from mitford if there be trouble anywhere along river mitford be sure to be first to hear of will send message back by jack when have gone a far a necessary for purpose two hour later jack returned with news that maori have gone straight on without making stop mr mr renshaw be expected back at about ten o'clock be to breakfast early at mitford to come up with light canoe arrived however soon after eight o'clock be well mr renshaw shouted a stepped from boat well father marion replied running down to meet have little unpleasantness yesterday nothing of consequence what brings back so early must have started before daylight bad news came in yesterday evening must have come straight over if have be possible mr mitford must not let leave till morning have be very anxious about be news wilfrid asked native murdered two settler at farm four mile from mr mitford yesterday received letter from poverty bay napier saying that native be in very disturbed state hau hau prophet have be going about among that in district there have be several murder corp of volunteer be being raised at napier have sent to wellington for company of constabulary settler at poverty bay be also making preparation for defence mr mitford be asked to get colonist on river to arm prepare for attack of course news be very alarming in when two three hour later news came in of murder in own settlement be naturally most anxious about however a must not come over in dark through forest a mitford pointed out that house be well prepared for defence that must certainly be on alert have dog who must give notice of body of men coming consented to remain if must send home in canoe at five o'clock in morning now what be happened here yesterday be nothing very alarming father four native came up asked for food of course gave then wanted gin seeing be alone tried to push way into house tried to stop fellow snatched at club a did so marion appeared at door with levelled rifle fellow who have gun with took to heel gave alarm signal allen mr atherton came over at once grimstones ran in from work however native have made way off suppose will hear more of know wilfrid father said if have be only affair must not have thought much about native be often rude insolent men might not have meant to do more than help to bottle of spirit taken with account from napier poverty bay with murder yesterday think be very serious mr atherton allen promised to come over at ten o'clock father to chat matter over with hear whether have brought news of trouble elsewhere so will have quite council now let have breakfast be just going to sit down when heard call be sure must be a hungry a hunter after three hour on water breakfast be scarcely finished when mr atherton allen arrived be made acquainted with news of murder of two settler on previous day be clear mr atherton said that affair here yesterday be not a hoped mere incident such a might happen anywhere if party of ruffianly fellow arrived at lonely house thought must rob with impunity sad business tell of show that there be general movement among native result suppose of arrival of emissary from hau haus be awkward business what be mr mitford opinion on subject think will be well that settler on river capable of bearing arm must be enrolled a volunteer corp be in readiness to turn out at moment notice be of opinion that whose farm lie at distance from main body must drive in animal bring in such good a can carry to station a one of most central hut must be got up there animal kept at night in large stockaded yard in case native seem inclined to make regular attack woman child must be sent down river in boat put on board ship sent to napier fortunately there be seldom week without craft of sort putting into river there be doubt that must be safest plan mr atherton said must be serious thing for settler to abandon crop house to native unless be certain that danger be very great that be opinion mr renshaw said be certainly not disposed to have result of labour destroyed without struggle wilfrid looked alike surprised pleased be glad to hear say so father must be awful nuisance loss to have crop destroyed house burnt down to have to begin whole thing over again see what must have be use of getting everything ready for defence if be to run away directly there be danger think must be good thing to send animal down to mr mitford a be good enough to offer to take might send down three native to look after a of course will have to go out to graze in daytime keep jack here know about other men one doe seem able to trust native in slightest feel sure of jack must be useful to in many way in house besides being able to scout in wood far better than must do think that be right mr renshaw mr atherton said must propose a addition that allen here make head quarter while scare last must run up light shanty with few hour work just behind house allen must go over to work during day return here at night must wander about wood with gun a usual think need fear attack in daytime if come at will be at night at early morning native will know from men who be here that be well armed will try to catch napping wo be more trouble to than can help with addition of three gun think must defend against number of native what do think of proposal lad allen said at once that thought be excellent one if mr mr renshaw be willing to have trouble of will be trouble at mr renshaw said will be very great comfort with seven men to protect marion will feel perfectly safe will be in way pleasant to have here with see that need build hut outside at there will be difficulty in making up bed here in kitchen then will be together propose that must cook for mr renshaw if have hut of own boy must do for see be coming up here for own defence a well a yours must not think of thing mr renshaw said decidedly there be more trouble in cooking for nine than there be for six a have said will be real pleasure to to have stopping here very well then in case mr renshaw will accept invitation will bring over belonging to day store in loft above allen have better bring over anything want burnt by native still hope that outrage be work of few ruffian that native in general will not allow to be persuaded into hostility against still if worst come to worst be convinced that can hold house against quite a strong force a be likely to bring to attack there be one precaution must advise to take at once be to lay in store of water daresay have got empty molasses pork cask be if burn a soon a empty if not must set to work make strong wooden tank in case be really besieged must be fatal to if be caught without supply of water fortunately there be three four empty cask be taken down to river thoroughly washed filled with water rolled up to house while be being done wilfrid with grimstones native have gone out driven in animal from clearing a soon a be brought in wilfrid with native started to drive to mr mitford mr atherton went over to hut before night two native have brought over most valuable property next day hut be completely stripped allen only brought over few thing furniture be rough heavy contented by carrying out into forest near hiding in undergrowth wilfrid returned to glade in evening said that many of settler have come in be erecting shelter of hide canvas wood near mr mitford house men be being enrolled officer have be appointed native be likely to meet with stout resistance if ventured on hostility mr mitford have sent earnest invitation to mr renshaw marion to take up abode with mr mitford have approved of intention of holding house knew capability of defence thought that unless taken by surprise must be able to hold will be sort of outpost for colony said will add to safety for if strong body of native be approaching must probably attack before coming on here instant hear that be attacked will come up to aid will be able to muster in something like fifty mounted men strength sufficient to meet number of native likely to assemble in part chapter xiii attack on glade for three day thing went on quietly at glade first thing in morning jack went out with two of dog scouted in bush a soon a returned with news that must find sign of native household broke up allen went through bush to clearing continued work of felling tree mr atherton sauntered off with two dog into forest in search of plant wilfrid grimstones pursued work of digging planting in upper part of glade jack two dog be on watch round house mr renshaw worked at maori vocabulary wife daughter carried on business of house at night two of dog be chained up outside other two slept in kitchen while jack be allowed to sleep up in loft at daybreak on fourth day party be awoke by growl from one of dog outside of occupant of house have be allotted post in minute be standing rifle in hand at window be to guard mr atherton opened front door went out followed by jack be just getting light enough to make out object in clearing everything seemed quiet what be ponto said to dog who be standing with eye fixed upon bush to right ear pricked hair bristling what do hear old fellow dog uttered deep growl moment later there be loud yell number of dark figure leapt from edge of bush ran towards house have made out mr atherton figure knew that hope of surprising place be at end mr atherton levelled rifle fired one of native fell dead then stooping quietly unfastened dog chain from collar telling jack to do same to other dog come into house sir ordered be use being here to be shot shot have be answered by dozen rifle fired in haste a men be running none of bullet struck four shot be fired almost simultaneously from window looking towards bush three more native fell proof of accuracy of defender shooting staggered maori paused for moment then moved by exhortation of chief again rushed forward whole of defender be now gathered at window facing seven shot be fired in quick succession three native fell dead four others be wounded two so seriously that have to be carried off by comrade who at once ran back to bush from edge opened straggling fire against house shutter have be thrown open at two window be at once closed be what call beating off handsomely mr atherton said now see advantage wilfrid of pain have taken to learn to shoot straight there have be only eleven shot fired fancy there be at least ten casualty among call that very pretty average for young hand what will do next do think mr renshaw asked will not try open attack fancy may expect to try to work round jack do go to other side of house keep sharp look out on bush there wilfrid take post at window fired from peep out from time to time through loophole in shutter between time keep out of line of fire betting be thousand to one against bullet coming through still there be use in running risk if can be avoided jim allen will take up place at back of house may try to work up among crop in fact expect be course will take unless have have enough of already bob grimstone keep watch at one of front window think there be much chance of attack from side be a well to keep look out of may attempt to cross to opposite bush keeping down by river other three gun will be in reserve think be likely to go away now that have suffered so much loss mr renshaw asked can not say think so mr renshaw maori from what have heard always try to get revenge for death of kinsman fellow tribesman of course depends how many of there be must judge that there be about thirty showed if be there be of must say must not attack again at present must know by firing that there be seven eight of here must not rely altogether even upon for native regard a fully match man for man with white in fight with troop be often greatly superior in number still be one thing to defend strong pah to attack resolute men snugly sheltered behind bullet proof log may try again if there be more of people within reasonable distance fancy will be more likely to send for keep sharp watch round until come up now will go to post for quarter of hour two watcher at back of house saw sign of life then mr atherton said there be movement among corn jim do see there just in line with big tree at other end of clearing be moving in several place call brother young grimstone to side of house do take steady aim at moving patch will fire first think can pretty well mark spot where one of fellow be making way down if hit others be likely enough to start up then will be time for taking shot at a soon a others be in position ready mr atherton fired there be yell dark figure sprang up stood for instant then fell back almost at same instant half dozen others leapt to foot dashed away three rifle be fired two of native fell one almost immediately rose again followed others ought to have done better than at hundred yard mr atherton said two lad ought to have practised little more steadily than have be grimstone brought down man rifle went off second before yours man be falling when fired great thing in firing at native be that shot must tell be certainty of thing scare if hear bullet singing about with only occasionally man dropping gain confidence slow steady fire with shot telling shake nerve make very careful of showing hour later jack reported must see figure moving in bush on side soon afterwards fire be opened on hut from direction have worked round end of clearing mr atherton said now be turn to begin to fire have let have own way long enough there be plenty of light now think will soon be able to put stop to game now wilfrid do with one of grimstones take up place at loophole at end of house with other will take up mine on right keep sharp look out throw away shot if can help a have not answered fire have probably got careless be sure to expose a stand up to fire now bob went on a took place at loophole will take first who show think must miss be sure that will not be important not to make mistake first time minute later native showed head shoulder over bush a rose to fire before must raise gun to shoulder fell with bullet through head from mr atherton unerring rifle gentleman quietly reloaded have better take next again sir bob grimstone said quietly suppose must miss might do reckon on hitting small mark more than eight out of twelve time be nearly four minute before native showed think sir there be one standing behind big tree twenty yard in bush thought saw something move behind just now will watch bob mr atherton said raising rifle to shoulder looking along through loophole two minute passed then head shoulder appeared from behind tree instantaneously mr atherton rifle cracked native fell forward gun going off a did so need not stand here longer mr atherton said quietly there will be no more shooting from side for time mr atherton went to other end of house how be getting on wilfrid have have three shot fired twice bill once think missed once altogether other time native went down bill wounded man hit in shoulder think have fired since then can put down gun for present mr renshaw have just told that breakfast be ready mr renshaw marion have indeed gone quietly about work of preparing breakfast for defender so be non combatant morning miss marion mr atherton said a took place with rest of party with exception of grimstones who be placed on watch at table girl replied if thought there be danger of native fighting way into house of course must do best to help defend think that there be least fear of thing so be quite content to leave to doe not seem to that woman have business to fight unless absolutely driven to do so in defence of life if native really do come on get up close to house think ought to help to keep out be dreadful thing to have to shoot anyone at least seems so to be not pleasant thing when considered in cold blood when men go out of way to take one life feel slightest compunction in taking theirs native have cause of complaint against have assembled attacked settlement in treacherous manner without slightest warning of intention intention be to slay man woman child without mercy therefore regard a human tiger more deserving of pity at same time can quite enter into feeling think be perfectly right not to take active part in affair unless be pressed by savage then of course must be not only justified must think be absolute duty to do best to defend place do think that be over now mr atherton mr renshaw asked regard a commanding officer for be only one here who ever saw shot fired in anger before voyage out experience be invaluable to now indeed husband feel that be to suggestion that must put up strong shutter door that owe life of child for have not be for men who came first might have taken house when found alone in can not accept thanks for mr renshaw may be if go on that shutter will be found of greatest use indeed have probably stopped good many ball from coming in so saved of life on first occasion wilfrid daughter owed life to being prepared armed while native relying upon surprising have left gun in wood shutter be not closed until after made off have not be there four native must never have passed across clearing reached house under fire of two cool steady marksman a to first question whether be over depends entirely upon whether party who attacked be main force of native if so think will renew attack at present have suffered terribly know now that be almost certain death for of to show within range of gun have lost fourteen fifteen men think numbered above forty at first if be only detached party main body of tribe be making attack elsewhere perhaps upon settler at mitford messenger will by time have be despatched to may have much more serious attack to encounter to night to morrow morning have idea what tribe fellow belong to there be few of tribe can not put five hundred men on field while can put five time number so see be entirely in dark of course thing will depend good deal a to how main body if there be main body have fared if have be a feel sure will be if venture to attack mitford place roughly handled whole body may return home native have proved through war admirable in defence have by mean distinguished in attack have not so far a remember succeeded in single instance in capturing position stoutly held be one thing to fight behind strong palisade defended by interior work skilfully laid out quite to advance across open to assault defended position belief be that if be beaten at mitford a well a here will hear more of at present mind say that after think that must be safe to continue to live in outlying station like until matter have again settled down in part of island no doubt a soon a news be known at napier wellington force will be sent here perhaps to poverty bay be only twenty mile higher up coast be think from what hear better suited a base of operation than river must be force will doubt make expedition inland to punish tribe connected with affair for be of course most important to let native on side of island see that can not attack settlement with impunity after be done will doubt be safe to recommence operation here at present fear will find necessary for time to abandon place take up abode at mitford go down to napier wellington will of course involve loss of crop have planted possibly of house a have saved animal loss will be comparatively small easily repaired whether large small mr renshaw said can not hesitate over will a say be out of question to live here exposed at instant to attack never knowing what day night may bring forth house have not cost above hundred pound must put up with loss be fortunately in very much better position than most settler in having reserve to fall back upon so there will be hesitation on part in taking step furniture be worth more than hut suppose must go too not necessarily mr renshaw can not get away now for although can defend well enough here must not make way down through wood to mitford without great risk be accustomed to bush fighting a be still five to one against must be very serious matter to try to fight way down think that have choice to remain where be until be relieved be perfectly certain that have made off in case must then have ample time to make preparation for retiring must strip house send everything down in boat bullock cart might even get up potato cut such of crop a be ripe nearly ripe send down also corp have be got up among settler will be sure to join in expedition for punishment of scoundrel indeed be most probable that able bodied settler will be called out in case think will chip in a american say will have opportunity of going into little explored tract in interior adding to collection to tell truth feel anxious to take part in revenging massacre that treacherous native have committed unless get sharp lesson life of settler in outlying district in colony will be unsafe wilfrid glanced at mr atherton nodded to intimate that must be willing ready to join in such expedition thought better to say nothing at present two allen however said at once that if obliged to quit clearing must join one of irregular corp for defence of colony will get pay ration james allen said will keep going until thing get settled must certainly like to lend hand in punishing treacherous native be horrible to think of stealing upon defenceless people at night murdering men woman child be a bad a sepoy mutiny now troop have be almost withdrawn colony have be left to shift for think be more than duty of who have special tie to aid in defence against fanatical hau haus very well then james will march side by side when see give out will carry must be worse than fighting native james allen replied with laugh if be mr atherton must engage ten native to accompany with pole hammock be not bad idea mr atherton said calmly possibly may adopt in case will have to go a free lance for fear must scarcely be conducive to military discipline to see one of armed band carried along in rank none must have thought from cheerful tone of conversation that party be beleaguered by bloodthirsty enemy mr atherton purposely gave lively tone to conversation to keep up spirit felt a expressed perfectly confident that must beat off attack in daytime knew that if assailant be largely reinforced place attacked by night position must be very serious one even then be convinced that assailant must not be able to force way in must assuredly try to fire house although solid log must be difficult to ignite match board covering roof must both readily catch fire however hope lay in preventing native from firing a must be difficult in extreme to bring up burning branch under fire of defender be pity now wilfrid said to lad after breakfast be over have taken up place together at one of window that did not dissuade father from putting that boarding to log did not intend to have at first now add good deal to danger only thing be afraid of be fire though own think that there be much chance of of getting up with lighted brand under fire of rifle if native be not in bush at present moment must say that best thing by far to do must be for hand to set to work to tear off match boarding to get down whole of covering of roof must not well hurt then will do at once mr atherton must shoot down at leisure wilfrid be not to be thought of must run risk of fire now feel a said pretty confident that be too good shot to let men with fire get up to wall wish must send down word to mitford that be besieged here of course if be attacked must not help if be not know must come out at once with strong party to relief wonder whether native boy of yours must try to carry message none of must have chance of getting through fellow can crawl like snake by working up through crop to upper end of glade might gain bush unobserved will ask anyhow wilfrid said jack on being promised new suit of clothes present in money if must carry note through to mr mitford at once undertook mission mr renshaw on being told what be arranged wrote note stating position jack divesting of greater portion of clothes crept out through door at back of house lying down at once began to crawl through potato patch towards upper end of clearing from loophole of window defender watched progress although aware of approximate position be soon unable to trace progress will do mr atherton said if knowing line be taking can see nothing move may be sure that fellow in bush will not be able to make out well will have assistance in four five hour if mitford hand be free quarter of hour passed be still quiet be in bush by time mr atherton said now can take matter easy occasional shot be fired from bush shout raised mr renshaw interpreted to be threat of death extermination say that white men be to be driven into sea not one left alive on island well will see about mr atherton said be not getting on very fast at present a time went on be only occasional crack of gun accompanied by thud of bullet against log told that native be still present now never raised to fire kept well back in bush shifting position after shot time passed somewhat slowly inside until about four o'clock in afternoon sharp crack of rifle be heard there be mitford mr atherton exclaimed be not maori gun man loophole again must prevent of fellow on other side crossing to assistance of friend give to others hot if be driven out of shelter of bush rifle shot be speedily followed by others then came deeper report of maori musket english shout be heard mingled with yell of native fight be evidently sharp for jack have led relieving party down upon rear of native engaged in attacking house from left latter began to fall back defender of house presently caught sight of figure a flitted from tree to tree must be careful mr atherton said for bullet miss might strike friend think that have better reserve fire till make break across open can see by direction be firing sound of rifle mitford be closing in on flank so a to drive out of bush can trust not to miss will pick off when see of sheltering on side of tree there be fellow there just going to fire rifle cracked native fell among bush completed scare of native who have already be much disconcerted at unexpected attack made upon leader of party shouted order whole of made sudden rush through bush down towards river three four fell beneath rifle of white on side of rest burst through continued course down to river plunging in swam to other side without once giving defender of house chance of shot at now can sally out mr renshaw said door be opened hurried out just a party of white issued from wood ran towards house thanks for speedy aid mitford mr renshaw exclaimed a wrung hand of settler be heartily welcome dear sir party be just setting off to see how have fared when native boy arrived with note be great relief to to know that have repulsed attack with such heavy loss to be afraid that several others have not fared so well two three native servant have come in morning with news of massacre of whole family having managed to make escape in confusion be afraid that will hear of other similar case gallant defence of station have be of most important service to there be doubt that saved from attack at place there be good many native in bush round morning yelling shouting did not venture on attack have doubt be waiting for arrival of party told off to attack place on way do think that there be of still in bush on other side must hardly think so mr atherton replied there must have be fully half of in party attacked others be hardly likely to have waited after saw have defeated friend think that must be a well for party of to ascertain for if be still lurking there of may be shot down a move about outside house be quite strong enough now to venture upon step think so too mr mitford agreed there be ten men beside party have better leave four here rest of will make dash down to edge of bush then skirmish through mr renshaw two grimstones one of settler be appointed to remain behind to guard house rest of party then dashed at full speed across glade to edge of bush not shot be fired a did so having once gained shelter advanced through tree after pushing forward for mile came to conclusion that maori have retreated many sign be seen of presence there be mark of blood here there bush be broken down where have carried off who have fallen killed wounded in bush body of who have fallen in open still remained there upon return of party mr mitford be informed of determination have be arrived at met with cordial approval think mr renshaw said that best plan will be for husband daughter to return at once with will leave couple of men here with garrison in morning will come out with strong party three four bullock dray to fetch in portable property can make trip for potato such of crop a can be got in after sharp lesson native have have here be not likely to venture in neighbourhood again for time indeed now that find that whole settlement be aroused on guard doubt whether will hear anything more of at present possibly may when matter settle down again find house just a be left mr mr renshaw agreed to plan proposed in quarter of hour party started leaving glade under protection of garrison of eight men night passed off quietly at daybreak set to work to get up potato to cut down crop be sufficiently ripe at nine o'clock waggon arrived furniture store be loaded up by twelve o'clock next day work in field be completed waggon again loaded house be then locked up whole party proceeded to settlement found on arrival that strong stockade have be erected near mr mitford house that rough tent hut have be got up there for use of settler whole of animal belonging to various farmer on river have be driven into stockaded inclosure behind house here be decided that settler must remain until help arrived from wellington napier in meantime five twenty of younger men be enrolled a volunteer corp mr purcell who have served for year a officer in army being unanimously elected in command there still remained enough men capable of bearing arm to defend stockade in case of attack during absence of corp wilfrid two allen be among who enrolled mr atherton said that fully intended to accompany if possible upon expedition might make that must not become member of corp may have long march said through bush may when reinforcement arrive be called upon to make expedition into hill country to punish native must not possibly keep up with during heavy day marching so will like hal of wynd fight for own sword daresay will be there there about when there be work to be done must get there in own way in own time will have own commissariat train have have share of living on next to nothing have become somewhat of epicure know that sort of ration be likely to get on march through rough country must not suit constitution a said before hope if there be fighting done to be somewhere in neighbourhood chapter xiv fresh trouble three day later small steamer arrived from napier bringing reply to urgent request have be sent for despatch of body of constabulary for protection of settler sir donald m'lean superintendent of province sent word that be impossible at present a alarming news have just be received that notorious chief te kooti who have be captured imprisoned at chatham island have effected escape with whole of native confined in island have captured schooner have be reported landed near poverty bay be probable sir donald wrote that be news of landing have excited one of tribe of neighbourhood to make attack upon strong expedition will be fitted out will doubtless have to supply contingent can only advise to organize yourselves into militia to stand for present on defensive a soon a operation begin from poverty bay will be relieved from further danger a attention of hostile tribe will be fully occupied in direction hitherto province of hawke bay have be comparatively free from trouble have so long disturbed auckland taranaki northern portion of wellington only one rising have taken place have be so promptly crushed that tribe have since remained perfectly quiet in october party of hundred fighting men have suddenly appeared near meanee village principal chief have hitherto borne very high character have be employed by government to improve mail road between napier taupo colonel whitmore who be in command of colonial force for regular troop have now be almost entirely withdrawn from island have just returned from punishing native who have committed massacre higher up on coast be fortunately at napier at once despatched company of colonist under major fraser with thirty forty friendly native to hold native in check just a have be sent off news came that more numerous body of hau haus be advancing by way of petane to attack napier major fraser company be sent off to check while colonel whitmore with one hundred eighty of colonial militia marched against smaller force m'lean with two hundred friendly native established in rear of village occupied officer be sent in to summon to surrender a answer must be obtained from colonist advanced enemy fought with resolution colonist opened cross fire upon after fighting for time native be driven out of cover finding mode of retreat open to laid down arm who endeavoured to escape being cut off also captured native loss be twenty three killed twenty eight wounded many of mortally forty four taken prisoner only two three of whole party escaped upon same day major fraser little force attacked other party of hau haus killed chief with twelve of follower put rest to flight from time peace have be unbroken in hawke bay there have be several outbreak at poverty bay lay just north of province massacre at opotaki other place further to north almost continuous fighting in northern district of wellington news of te kooti escape of landing at poverty bay naturally caused considerable alarm among settler hope be entertained that white at poverty bay aided by friendly native must be able to recapture te kooti follower before must do harm next day small vessel came down from poverty bay with message from major biggs who commanded at settlement to ask for assistance if must be spared consultation be held be agreed that best plan of defending own settlement be to aid in recapture of te kooti that little force of twenty men must at once go up to aid settler under major biggs accordingly embarked without delay mr atherton making separate bargain with captain of craft for passage next morning arrived in poverty bay major biggs have a soon a news reached raised force of hundred european native found te kooti party hundred ninety strong holding very strong position near sea sent chief to to say that if must lay down arm must try smooth matter over with government defiant answer be returned major biggs gave order to commence attack native who formed bulk of force refused to move saying that hau haus be too numerous too strongly posted under circumstance attack be impossible for have little body of white be defeated whole settlement must have be open to ravage destruction during night te kooti men started for interior carrying with store provision have taken from schooner when be found have escaped major biggs ordered mr skipwith to follow with friendly native pressing on rear until ascertained line of retreat when be to cut across country join main body who be to march to paparatu point te kooti must in probability pas in retreat arrival of coaster with little band from mohaka river be hailed with joy by poverty bay settler arrived just in time to join major biggs raised force to fifty white men who with thirty maori started for paparatu arrived there on following morning european be commanded by captain westrupp wilson in afternoon mr atherton arrived with party of four native whom have hired to carry store of provision ammunition baggage so be in plenty of time said when came up must not bring to undertake night march a fellow have got to lug store have captured over mountain felt pretty sure must be in time be glad be in time mr atherton wilfrid said assistance of rifle be not to be despised sooner native come now better for have only brought four day provision in haversack hear that reserve force be to come up in two day with ration ammunition one can never calculate upon native camp be pitched in hollow to avoid observation of enemy be proposed to fight at point mile distant in position commanding spur of hill up native must advance after crossing ford on arai river four day passed there be news of convoy with provision supply in camp be almost exhausted that evening major biggs started to bring up supply with speed a otherwise starvation must compel force to retreat same day mr skipwith have arrived with news that te kooti be undoubtedly marching on paparatu be making slow progress owing to heavy load men be carrying fifth day passed slowly men being altogether without food mr atherton divided small stock of provision wine among then taking rifle went out among hill accompanied by two of native late in evening returned native bearing old boar have shot be great piece of luck for island contained wild animal fit for eating boar have probably escaped from settler farm native clearing when young taken to wood be at once cut up divided among hungry men next day mr skipwith with two native went out to reconnoitre soon returned at full speed saying that native be crossing river captain wilson with twenty men took possession of hill on right flank almost impregnable position while captain westrupp with main body marched to support picket have be placed on position have be arranged must occupy before must arrive there te kooti with overwhelming number have driven picket from ground occupied hill be going to be awkward business wilfrid mr atherton said have only thirty round of ammunition man have have nothing to eat for last forty eight hour mouthful of meat have suffered native to take position fixed on be outnumbered three to one there be not ten men in force who have have experience in fighting if worst come to worst wilfrid do allen take to bush mind be use trying to run from native if men be like party other day must keep fellow at bay for time be most of young hand will blaze away ammunition may be seized with panic will keep close to if thing do go badly will keep together sell life dearly must retake that place if possible lad captain westrupp said at moment spread out in skirmishing order take advantage of cover can find let there be stopping lagging behind must get up there together carry with rush there be time lost men spread out with cheer started up hill be received with storm of bullet native from eminence fired high without suffering loss reached small ridge near summit about twelve yard from enemy separated from by narrow gully here threw down fire at once caused hau haus to throw down among bush on side of gully position of colonist be fairly strong one on right flank ground be open with few scattered bush here there left be covered by steep ravine fell away sharply hau haus kept up heavy fire to colonist replied seldom officer continually impressing upon necessity for husbanding ammunition mr atherton have arrived breathless in rear of party have thrown down by wilfrid side two allen lying next in order for minute mr atherton did not speak lay panting heavily be nice preparation for shooting said presently however suppose hand will steady after bit have seen fellow head show under bush there twice time bullet came just over head will have talk with a soon a get wind back again be not bad position after providing work round to right ten minute later wilfrid who have eye fixed on bush from four five shot have be fired waiting for puff of smoke to indicate exact position in man be lying sharp report of mr atherton rifle have got suppose of course lad there be one le of yelling rascal to deal with wish must see biggs people coming along road behind if must get square meal round good supply of ammunition think must be able to turn table on fellow men be fighting very steadily be husbanding ammunition better than expected to see do fight went on for four hour then number of hau haus leapt to foot made rush towards settler volley received proved too much for several fell rest bolted back into shelter again again be tried time without success at three in afternoon men be seen coming along road behind towards deserted camp captain westrupp at once wrote note sent down by one of men to disappointment of settler soon returned with news that new arrival consisted of only nine maori carrying ration have opened rum bottle on way most of be excessively drunk two of who be sufficiently sober came up to help in defence one be shot dead almost immediately one of settler being killed many wounded more le severely just a evening be coming on force be startled by hearing hau hau bugle in rear presently made out party of enemy moving towards camp through broken ground on left rear be now evident that enemy must be driven off hill in front party must retire to position on hill behind camp captain westrupp determined to try former alternative first calling upon men to follow dashed across gully up on to crest held by maori men followed gallantly fire from maori hidden among bush be so heavy that be forced to fall back again seven more of number being wounded now retired in good order down to camp up hill behind be here joined by captain wilson with twenty men be now determined to throw up sort of intrenchment hold position until help came settler who have hitherto fought well be dispirited by want of success by non arrival of reinforcement be weak with long fast a soon a became dark began to steal off to make way back towards home in hour force have retreated officer held council be evident position must not long be held want of food ammunition must compel retreat in morning be therefore decided to fall back under cover of darkness chief of friendly native who have behaved admirably through fight offered to guide party across country officer be obliged to leave horse party of forty half starved men of whom fourth be wounded two so severely that be necessary to carry set out be terrible march for exhausted men up bed of mountain creek often waist deep in water over steep fern covered hill until just a day be breaking reached out station here managed to get two sheep just a have cooked eaten colonel whitmore commander of colonial force arrived with thirty volunteer from napier who have reached bay on previous day at once paraded men thanked for behaviour on previous day warned to be ready to start in pursuit of enemy at once one of settler acting a spokesman for rest stepped forward pointed out that have be fighting without intermission for twenty four hour that have be for last forty eight hour almost without food that be impossible for to set out on fresh march until have taken rest colonel whitmore be hot tempered man expressed so strongly that caused deep offence among settler remained firm in determination not to move until following day forward movement be therefore necessarily abandoned on day previous to fight lieutenant gascoigne have be despatched by major biggs to te wairoa with despatch for mr deighton who commanded at station warning to muster force at disposal prepare to intercept te kooti at waihau lake in case must fight way through captain westrupp force order be sent to friendly mahia tribe to muster hundred men at once assembled a have only four round of ammunition apiece nothing must be done until three cask of ammunition be obtained from of wairoa chief two day be lost in consequence gave time to te kooti then started eighteen european volunteer eighty native larger body of native preparing to follow a soon a possible after being met by messenger with several contradictory order arrived at waihau just before dark te kooti be seen crossing hill towards with whole force captain richardson determined to fight in position occupied native chief with sixty of follower at once bolted captain richardson be therefore obliged with remainder to fall back unfortunately in retreat one of native fell gun went off bursting injured hand be considered by native most unfortunate omen dissipated what little courage remained in wairoa tribe at eleven o'clock next morning enemy advanced action began wairoa chief with fifty of men again bolted at first shot captain richardson with remainder held position until four in afternoon when ammunition being almost exhausted retired quietly force fell back to wairoa where be reorganized increased to two hundred men in meantime colonel whitmore have be toiling on over terrible country in te kooti rear having with in about two hundred men a have be joined by major fraser with fifty of division armed constabulary when arrived at boundary of poverty bay district settler belonging to who have not recovered from indignation at colonel whitmore unfortunate remark refused to go further saying that militia regulation only obliged to defend own district colonel whitmore therefore with hundred thirty men of whom handful be white marched on to attack two hundred twenty hau haus posted in very strong position in gorge of river twelve of little party from mohaka river still remained with column one have be killed four wounded while five have remained behind completely knocked up by fatigue have encountered mr atherton have not gone on with after arrival of colonel whitmore be of use dear lad said to wilfrid know colonel whitmore well by reputation way in blew up morning because exhausted a be be physically unable to set out for fresh march confirms what have heard of be most gallant officer be capable of undergoing greatest fatigue hardship be of opinion that everyone else be a tireless energetic a be will drive along over mountain through river with food without food until come up to te kooti then will fight regardless of odds position anything else be fighting object to never must keep up with column on march must be physical impossibility be not going to attempt will take week to recover from fatigue of last night will go down stay quietly at settlement if te kooti take into head to come down there will have great pleasure in doing best towards putting stop to rampaging over country if doe not come down will a say await development will find plenty to do in way of botanizing mr atherton have not exaggerated fatigue hardship that force must be called upon to undergo be worn out exhausted when at last came upon track of hau haus when be resting for short halt captain carr late ra who be with force a volunteer reconnoitred short distance ahead found enemy fire still burning news infused fresh life into tired hungry men again went forward track led up bed of river ran between low steep cliff impossible to climb men have to advance in single file after marching for distance reached bend in river where narrow track ran through break in cliff up spur of hill advanced guard consisting of six men led by captain carr be within fifty yard of point when heavy fire be opened upon just where be river bank be sufficiently low to enable to climb take cover in thick scrub above whence replied vigorously to hau haus who be within few yard of in meantime enemy have opened fire from base of hill at river bend upon main body who standing in single file in river be unable to reply to scale steep bank take covering in scrub colonel whitmore captain tuke tried to lead men up to charge must only be done in single file fire of enemy be so hot that who attempted be killed wounded captain tuke being severely hurt rest found what shelter must among boulder in river bed remained here until advanced guard fell back hard pressed by enemy reported death of captain carr mr canning volunteer native now pressed through scrub above cliff to cut off retreat friendly native who be well behind be ordered to scale cliff then hold enemy in check one of be wounded rest hastily retreated down river constabulary settler altogether about fifty strong fell back to island about mile to rear here calmly awaited attack of enemy however drew off without disturbing disheartened by fact that te kooti have received wound in foot troop then retired only few of strongest men reached camp night rest knocked up by want of food fatigue lay down in pouring rain did not get in until following morning result of fight be most unfortunate even colonel whitmore saw that with force at disposal nothing must be done against te kooti who be daily becoming more powerful be being joined by tribe in vicinity believed that te kooti must carry out expressed intention of marching north to waikato after collecting there tribe of island march against auckland thinking therefore that poverty bay be not likely to be disturbed left settlement went round by sea to auckland to confer with government a to step to be taken to raise force capable of coping with what appeared to be greatest danger have a yet threatened island te kooti did not however move north remained in camp near scene of fight from th of august to th of october sending message over island with news of defeat have inflicted upon white proclaiming saviour of maori people from position occupied about equidistant from settlement at wairoa poverty bay be able to attack either by sudden march of two three day yet there be great uneasiness among settler force have operated against te kooti have be disbanded napier volunteer have returned constabulary withdrawn party of settler from mohaka river have returned home wilfrid renshaw have not gone with have be shot through leg in fight in river have be carried down to settlement here mr atherton who be lodging in one of settler house have taken charge of nursed assiduously unfortunately effect of wound be aggravated by exhaustion caused by fatigue insufficient food for week lad lay in state of prostration wasted by low fever at one time seemed a if must carry off be not until middle of october that matter took turn began slowly to mend for last three week mother have be by bedside for time mr atherton in letter have made light of wound when lad condition became very serious have written to mr renshaw saying that thought have better come to help in nursing a wilfrid be now suffering from sharp attack of fever brought on by hardship mr renshaw on arrival be dismayed at state in found son agreed however that be best not to alarm in letter home event on attack of settlement have much shaken mr renshaw be when left in nervous excited state saw that wilfrid must need moment of time be husband to come must probably do harm seriously interfere with own usefulness be when left on point of returning to farm with marion a there have be no further renewal of trouble in settlement have be arranged that two allen must take up residence at glade that four men belonging to small force have be raised among friendly native must also be stationed there must be thought render quite safe against sudden attack mr renshaw be looking eagerly forward to being at home again wife thought that necessity of superintending operation at farm must soothe nerve restore to health therefore in letter made best of thing although admitting that wilfrid be prostrated by sort of low fever needed care nursing at end of fortnight wilfrid be enabled to sit up take interest in what be going on around house be property of settler named sampson have be erected by predecessor of farmer be good deal larger than required though capacity be now taxed to utmost by addition of three lodger to family how be thing going on mr atherton wilfrid asked one day when mother be not present people here seem to think that be going on very well wilfrid think so mr atherton lad asked struck by dry tone in answer be given wilfrid can not say do seems to that people here be living in fool paradise a for major biggs regard a obstinate fool how be that wilfrid asked amused at friend vehemence well wilfrid a far a can see there be nothing in world to prevent te kooti coming down cutting throat whenever plea say so mr atherton do indeed be known that have sent message down to native here to remain apparently loyal get what arm can from white prepare to join will say for biggs that have repeatedly represented unprotected position of bay to government have obtained permission to place officer nine men on pay a scout to watch road leading to settlement gascoigne be in charge of there be two road by native can come one short one be being watched other much longer more difficult one be entirely open to if choose to use fact be biggs relies on fact that colonel lambert be at wairoa be collecting force of men there to attack te kooti belief that will get information from from spy have in neighbourhood of te kooti camp long before movement be actually made of course may do so consider be very risky thing to trust safety of whole settlement to chance ought to station four mounted men on track a near a dare to te kooti camp in case must be sure to get news in plenty of time to put able bodied men under arm before enemy must reach settlement have got stockade built be proposed at meeting of of settler that must be done biggs assured be altogether unnecessary know how be wilfrid take together englishman have fully fair share of common sense have observed over over again that in majority of case when englishman reach certain rank in official life seems to become obstinate blockhead have often wondered over can not account for anyhow state of affair here be excellent example of suppose in whole settlement there be not with exception of man in authority single person who doe not perceive that situation be dangerous one that possible precaution must be omitted yet man who be responsible for safety of throw cold water on proposal snub who be willing to give up time labour in order to ensure safety of place suppose considers that tone adopts show to be man superior to around possessing alike far greater knowledge of situation total freedom from cowardly fear of neighbour well well hope that event will justify course own sleep with rifle revolver loaded ready to hand mind say that chance may not be ten to one against te kooti making raid down here say if be hundred to one must be height of folly not to take possible precaution to ensure safety of here think mr atherton that must be better for mother to go home be getting right now can get on very well without be sure mother must not leave at present wilfrid think will be fit to be moved for fortnight yet te kooti have done nothing for two month may not move for a much more mother know nothing of what have told must not make anxious uncomfortable by giving even hint considered there be danger in air chapter xv massacre at poverty bay week passed wilfrid be able to walk about house garden ship be going down in three day mr atherton have arranged with captain to put into mohaka river land there change have taken place in situation there have be meeting of settler

time to cool down bit before arrive must not have come up at better place for be use trying to hide must track directly must make stand at mouth of defile be good place for defence if be not for rascally bush must have difficulty in keeping off even a be think can make good fight of now mr renshaw will mr sampson child go little way in sit down have doubt will be able to beat fellow back if do that can hope to make rest of journey without further molestation must be of use in loading rifle mr atherton think not mr renshaw may be long skirmish will have plenty of time to load being here with running risk of being hit must make nervous think if mind must much rather know that be in safety behind very well mr renshaw said quietly will do what think best will be praying for success until be over mr atherton looked round after two lady have gone on there be bush with wide ledge of flat ground behind said pointing to little clump of underwood ten foot above on side of ravine think with help can manage to clamber up there wilfrid lying down will be able to fire under bush be in fair shelter mr sampson will hold path here if make rush will be able to help with revolver up there will have advantage of being able to see movement among bush better than will can fire down at if come to hand to hand fight will be of more use there than down here wilfrid at once assented stand on hand will hoist up mr atherton raised wilfrid until be able to get on to ledge of rock behind bush wilfrid laid down there with knife cut off few of lower twig so that be able to get good view ahead keep well back lad raise head except to fire do see anything of yes be not more than quarter of mile away be scattering among bush doubt caught sight of a came up here think possible may intend to

instantaneously among bush whence moment later two three shot be fired mr atherton have stepped back settler lying down on ground worked forward until by raising head must command view of slope up to mouth of ravine for time be silent presently wilfrid rifle spoke out yell testified to fact that quick aim have taken at dark figure stealing among bush have be true be followed quickly by general discharge of piece by native bullet rattled thickly against rock cut leaf from bush behind wilfrid be lying have drawn back foot two moment fired ball passed harmlessly over not so missive despatched by mr atherton in direction of puff of smoke from bush forty yard away for figure behind remained still immovable while fray went on for upwards of hour exchange of shot continued then assailant be joined by fifteen other native who have be attracted to spot by sound of firing expect will pluck up courage to make rush now wilfrid mr atherton said if have not be for new arrival think must have soon drawn off for must have diminished number very considerably fire again for bit have best keep rifle loaded so a to be ready for when pluck up courage to charge when do be sure keep revolver a reserve for critical moment five minute later tremendous yell rose in air native leaped to foot from behind bush fired gun at hidden foe then tomahawk in hand rushed forward three shot rang out almost

be more in way than mine must roll twice round pole then sew if have needle thread if have not that must make hole in six inch tie with string unfortunately have string either think can manage mr atherton said walked rapidly away returned in few minute with long stalk that looked like coarse grass be very thing mr renshaw said be what be called new zealand flax have doubt will be strong enough for purpose in quarter of hour litter be completed just a be finished mr sampson uttered exclamation of joy turning round saw that husband have opened eye be looking round in dazed bewildered way be all right sampson mr atherton said cheerfully have thrashed native handsomely have bolted there be fear of coming back again have have clip on head with tomahawk think that will be much worse for at end of week two have just be manufacturing litter for now will lift on to now lady will take by shoulder will take by foot mr renshaw do mr sampson support head be way now will just roll up coat put

renshaw must go along bit by bit will carry patient here for mile then will come back fetch wilfrid up to point then will go on again so on hard work fall on mr atherton be too bad mr renshaw said with grateful tear in eye will do world of good mr renshaw must have lost over stone weight since yesterday if sort of thing be to go on for few week must get into fighting condition now be ready lift in short time came to point where wilfrid child be sitting down together wilfrid have be impressing upon that father be hurt that must be very good quiet walk along quietly by mother side so when came along got up approached with subdued awe struck air took hand mother held out to be father very bad mother asked in low tone be better than be dear must hope pray that will soon be well again at present must not speak to must be kept very quiet not allowed to talk sit where be wilfrid will come back for in hour mr atherton said that wo mr atherton wilfrid said getting up have have long rest for except for pulling trigger loading have done nothing since first short walk when started morning excitement have done lot of good feel a if must walk ever so far well put rifle in litter then mr atherton said weight will make difference to will make lot of difference to when be tired say so wilfrid struggled on resolutely refusing to stop until reached stream two mile from starting place here rested for hour settler wound be washed rebandaged others partook of meal of bread water then continued journey at end of half mile wilfrid be obliged to own that strength must hold out no longer refused positively to accept mr atherton proposal to come back for will not hear of mr atherton said from what mr sampson say be eight ten mile to mahia country there be not least fear of of hau haus following on track best way by far be will go hundred yard into bush lie down push on will be dark before finish journey a be must not get there till to morrow morning if have to keep on coming back for besides must never get on with litter after be dark leave piece of bread bottle of water rifle revolver will be a comfortable among bush there a if be in bed in morning can send out party of mahias to fetch in if break down small bough here by side of way will be quite sufficient to tell native where be to turn off from path to look for well really think be best plan wilfrid there be a say real danger in stopping here alone must be long job coming back for time halt be of importance to get mr sampson laid down quiet a soon a possible mr renshaw did not like leaving wilfrid alone saw that must be of real assistance to aid be absolutely required to carry wounded man therefore offered objection to proposal look downcast mother wilfrid said a kissed weather be fine there be hardship whatever in night in bush especially after what went through when be following te kooti wilfrid made way hundred yard back into bush then threw down under tree fern in very few minute be sound asleep next time awoke be dark around must have slept good many hour said feel precious hungry ate hunch of bread took drink of water from bottle soon fell asleep again morning be breaking when again woke quarter of hour later heard voice cocking rifle lying down full length on grass waited in minute to joy heard mr atherton voice shouting where be wilfrid where have hidden chapter xvi pursuit of te kooti leapt to foot ran forward mr atherton be approaching accompanied by party of six native why mr atherton be not expecting for three hour well see wilfrid mother be anxious about did not say anything for be plucky woman not given to complaining grumbling still must see be anxious so arranged with native to be ready to start three hour before daybreak so a to get here just a sun be rising be awfully kind of atherton surely native must have be able to find without troubling to come way again be sure must have be dreadfully tired after work yesterday well wilfrid perhaps be just little bit anxious about must have fussed fidgeted until got back so see quickest way to satisfy be to come with native what time did get in last night about eight o'clock in evening think be pretty well knocked up two lady bore bravely so see have excuse for grumbling be sure must not have grumbled anyhow wilfrid laughed know that when one be carrying anyone weight at head be more than double weight at foot be divided between while have heavy end to how be sampson think will do wilfrid native took in hand a soon a got there put leaf poultice to wound be very good at sort of thing so ought to be considering have be breaking other head almost from day of adam well let be off have brought stretcher with will get back in time wilfrid lay down upon stretcher four of native lifted went off at light swinging pace from time to time change be made other two native taking share have be alone native must have made ten mile journey under two hour mr atherton reduced speed directly after have started have not be killed by hau haus wilfrid mean to let be killed by friendly native three mile hour be pace except in case of extreme emergency never exceed have wish when get back to england to be exhibited a walking skeleton be good to hear laugh again lad went on a wilfrid burst into shout of laughter to astonishment of four bearer be afraid six week back that must never hear laugh again oh mr atherton wilfrid exclaimed few minute later be there other of poverty bay people there last night have heard what took place whether many besides know of have lost life yes be sorry to say have be very bad business a heard from butter dodd reppart be killed there be doubt that shepherd be also slaughtered major biggs poor fellow have paid for obstinacy over confidence with life wife baby servant be also killed news of be brought by boy employed in house who escaped by back door hid in flax bush captain wilson wife child have be murdered m'culloch be killed with wife baby little boy managed to escape got to redoubt at taranganui cadel be also killed fortunately firmin heard sound of musketry in night started at dawn to see what be matter met native who told that hau haus be massacring white at once rode off warned wylie stevenson benson hawthorne strong escaped with family with major westrupp got safely to mahia people boy who escaped from major biggs house reached bloomfield woman child there managed to escape how did heaven only know for hau haus be round be know at present hope that rest of settler of outlying station round matawhero succeeded in getting into taranganui whether hau haus will be satisfied with slaughter have effected will try to penetrate further into settlement attack taranganui remains to be seen of course people who have escaped be like ignorant of everything have taken place except what happened in immediate neighbourhood must fancy that however widespread massacre may have be hau haus started last night on way back must know that a soon a news reached wairoa force there will be on move to cut off do think will succeed wilfrid asked eagerly think so wilfrid if colonel whitmore be there must have routed out te kooti long ago colonel lambert seems man of different stamp altogether why heard last night that marched six day ago to whataroa quite close to te kooti place that prisoner took gave positive information that hau haus there have left to assist te kooti in raid upon poverty bay seems did not believe news at anyrate although mail left for poverty bay on day after returned to wairoa sent news whatever of report have heard if have done so there must have be plenty of time for settler to prepare for attack be one of most scandalous case of neglect that ever heard of lambert ought to be tried by court martial though must not bring people to life again however there be one thing certain news of affair will create such sensation throughout island even incapable government at auckland who have disregarded urgent request for aid against te kooti will be forced to do something sincerely hope will despatch whitmore with strong force of constabulary to wipe out te kooti band be curious how thing come about almost poor fellow who have be killed belonged to poverty bay militia who refused to press on with whitmore in pursuit of te kooti have done so addition of thirty white men to force might have made difference in fight have with in case te kooti must have be driven far up country massacre must never have taken place be great relief to mr renshaw when wilfrid reached village be not given to idle fear felt convinced that be running real danger for knew mr atherton must not have left by have not be perfectly convinced there be danger of pursuit still felt weight lifted off mind when saw party entering village well mother must have have terrible journey of yesterday wilfrid said after have assured that felt none worse for what have passed be indeed stronger better than have be two day before be terrible journey wilfrid fourteen mile doe not seem such very long distance to walk though suppose ever walked a far since be girl weight of stretcher made difference did not feel much when started soon got heavier a went on though changed side few minute seemed at last a if one arm be being pulled out of socket must never have done if have not be for mr atherton kept cheery whole time seems ridiculous to remember that have always be representing a unequal to exertion be carrying greater part of weight indeed five mile before got to end of journey seeing how exhausted be becoming tied two stick six foot long to end of pole in way made work great deal lighter for of course great deal heavier for declared hardly felt for by time have torn two wide strip from bottom of dress tied together put over shoulder fastened to two pole so that got weight on shoulder instead of hand in addition to mr sampson weight carried milly perched on shoulder last eight mile be noble fellow did not say anything about carrying milly wilfrid said of taking weight of litter be splendid fellow mother be terribly exhausted when got in mr renshaw said be looking almost a pale a death when went into light in hut where other fugitive have assembled a soon a others relieved of weight of litter lifted milly down from shoulder went out of hut a soon a have seen mr sampson well cared for went out to look for found have thrown down on ground outside be lying there thought at first insensible be stooped over said ' be right mr renshaw be not up to answering question in hour will be again own

native blanket to throw over to keep off dew will be right in morning feel a if must get on foot again to night if fortune depended on ' of course did a asked be perfectly stupefied morning when heard that have be up at two o'clock have gone off with party of native to bring in be awfully good of wilfrid said never said word to about where be looked round mr atherton have disappeared have seen mr atherton asked mr wylie a came out of large hut have be given up for use of fugitive have just have glass of spirit water unfortunately have tea to offer piece of bread have taken blanket have gone off to empty hut said intended to sleep until to morrow morning indeed be not until next day that mr atherton again appeared several friendly native arrived one after at village brought news that hau haus have attacked only colonist round matawairo that rest of settler be gathered at taranganui hau haus be plundering deserted house be shooting down native who refused to join be afterwards found

expired shortly after from effect of wound in week elapsed between date of massacre return to settlement wilfrid have regained strength wonderfully bracing air of hill excitement of event through passed have acted a complete restorative mr atherton too have completely recovered from fatigue indeed professed to have benefited greatly by a maintained that in three day have lost a many stone of flesh morning after return to taranganui have long talk about plan be settled that mr renshaw must at once return home be most anxious that wilfrid must accompany must not consent to mother said be duty everyone duty to aid in hunting down murderous scoundrel have massacred number of people who be very kind to when first became ill will do best to punish besides until te kooti band be destroyed there will be peace safety for of outlying settlement be just a likely to make attack on settlement a other indeed be nearest to therefore in fighting here be fighting for protection of home mr atherton also announced intention of accompanying column in pursuit of te kooti dislike fatigue amazingly said for several reason feel bound to see affair through to end in first place have attacked caused to undergo great fatigue in second have murdered number of acquaintance in third place have to look after boy see that get into mischief lastly really seems to that month two of sort of thing will absolutely reduce to ordinary dimension thing have for year given up even hoping for well wilfrid mr renshaw said at last suppose must have way do think that a say be duty of everyone to do that can to punish people who have committed massacre upon defenceless people be necessary for safety of settlement te kooti band will be destroyed be very hard on to know that only son be fighting other men a well have to leave perhaps wife child behind if only without tie be to go force must be small one indeed be comfort to mr atherton that have made up mind to go too sound selfish of to say so suppose mother be selfish when son be concerned understand feeling mr renshaw be quite natural do think that everyone who can carry musket ought to join in expedition flatter that wilfrid rifle mine be ally not to be despised anyhow mr renshaw promise that will not do what be called rash thing wo try to capture te kooti single handed think that can be much more useful covering attack than leading assault accordingly two day later mr renshaw embarked on coaster for mohaka river mr atherton wilfrid announced to lieutenant gascoyne that must accompany force a volunteer be heartily glad to hear that officer replied have heard from wylie of defence of pas against hau haus yesterday have talk with sampson who be getting round now gave history of affair from what say renshaw must have killed at least twenty hau haus for sampson admits that be not much of shot have very small share in total yes can shoot indifferently well mr atherton said carelessly can be trusted to hit maori if see within about four hundred yard of fancy that may be of service to in keeping down fire of enemy if be attacking pah there be nothing cow fellow so much a finding that be certain death to raise head from behind shelter to take aim of course will be ready generally to obey order be special work join for see renshaw be just recovering from illness build unsuits for violent exertion so if want to storm steep hill must not count on being with except so far a shooting go well will take on own term lieutenant gascoyne said smiling mr sampson told yesterday how disinclined be for violent exertion how have to help along on journey to te mahia mr atherton laughed there be exception to rule said be peaceful botanist have to fight hate exertion on occasion be forced to make effort terribly knocked up be over if becomes absolutely necessary may have to make effort again consider altogether outside province expedition started on following morning th of november consisted of nearly six hundred native belonging to napier tribe mahia marsuwai tribe next day came upon rear guard of hau hau tribe of patutahi shot two of great quantity of booty hau haus be unable to carry away be found there together with body of several friendly native next day encampment be come upon here cart taken from plundered farm be found at dusk on d column came up with main body of enemy who be encamped on te karetua creek heavy fire be opened on side native then charged be driven back with loss of five killed twelve wounded mr atherton wilfrid who be walking leisurely in rear of column when came on enemy arrived too late to take part in fight after repulse friendly native took up position on ridge overlooking hau hau position distant twelve hundred yard from rifle pit be dug for next week firing be kept up by side with occasional skirmish a one party other tried to take offensive neither cared to try determined attack on other hau haus have lost twenty men during first day fighting suffered more in distant firing especially whenever gathered a if for attack than did friendly be owing in small degree to accuracy of mr atherton fire have got of native to dig rifle pit three four hundred yard down hill in front of position here wilfrid ensconced morning before daybreak taking down with provision for day from point galled hau haus greatly with fire wilfrid knew that shooting must not be depended upon at distance mr atherton have be accustomed to fire at long range although at eight hundred yard rifle be not accurate did considerable execution so alarmed hau haus that scarcely dared to move by daylight from one part of intrenchment to other friend always left shelter retired to camp a soon a sun set hau haus be not however idle party of sixty men made long circuit came down in rear of column captured depot at patutahi with eight keg of ammunition great quantity of provision also seized number of pack animal on way up on d of december force be strengthened by arrival of chief rapata hotene with three hundred seventy men from te wairoa chiefly belonged to ngatiporou tribe who be far better fighter than napier mahia men a soon a reinforcement have arrived be decided at once to dislodge enemy from hill of have possession then to make general attack on intrenchment forty men of wairoa tribe under mr preece made dashing attack on hill just a carried rapata sent message to to say that tribesman be annoyed by enemy shot falling into camp be therefore determined to attack at once tribe sallying out carried two of enemy outwork with rush drove hau haus back to last line of rifle pit near river here be attacked by wairoa men on left rapata in centre tribesman from napier on right assailant carried intrenchment drove hau haus across river suffering heavy loss from firing of left column who from position commanded course of stream unfortunately fire though destructive to enemy be to certain extent in favour for prevented close pursuit of rapata men thirty four hau haus including three of fighting chief be found dead te kooti have narrow escape be still suffering from wound in ankle be carried up bed of creek on woman back great quantity of loot taken from settler be recaptured many of friendly native held prisoner by hau haus escaped during fight mr atherton wilfrid have joined rapata men in charge after fight be over former said well wilfrid be satisfaction to have got native with at last who will fight seemed at first a if plucky native have joined enemy rapata men be first rate fellow though wish that have rather easier name for ngatiporou be crack jaw word to pronounce unfortunately quarrel arose after battle between rapata men napier tribesman three hundred of latter went off next morning rapata tribe with remaining wairoa men marched out to attack position enemy occupied on top of hill two mile away mr preece led advanced party found defence consisted of two line of strong earthwork extending across flat shoulder end resting on cliff mr preece halted men until rapata came up with main body wilfrid mr atherton have attached to ngatiporou just a joined preece one of men fired off gun enemy answered with heavy volley instantly panic set in whole force with exception of sixteen eighteen men bolted one of chief under mr preece followed managed to stop persuaded to wait until rapata must return to agreed to do refused positively to return to attack mr preece returned to rapata who be in state of fury at defection of tribe will go on attack place by ourselves said perhaps coward will come up when hear be fighting mr preece at once agreed party consisting of two leader mr atherton wilfrid fourteen of rapata men worked back through low scrub until between twenty five yard of first line of earthwork when opened fire upon enemy be rather close work wilfrid mr atherton said have best of in respect because can not make out position among bush be obliged to stand up show head above parapet when fire ought never to miss at distance will soon teach that be fatal to pause moment to take aim so at worst will only blaze away at random for time fight continued then rapata requested mr preece to go down hill bring up more men only nine men must follow mr preece rapata be so disgusted that went down for distance managed to get thirty more one of men have brought bill up with with willow rifle pit be dug among bush affording shelter to men a lay flat while loading at three o'clock in afternoon chief called on tribesman to follow leaping up dashed at one of outpost carried man took news down hill chief thirty more men came up joined in fight at dusk rapata requested mr preece to return to camp try to get main body back with ammunition a own be almost exhausted mr preece must not induce native to start said must go in morning night fight went on before dawn rapata having expended last round of ammunition retired having lost six men killed four wounded a men came down strode through camp in single file not deigning to take slightest notice of fugitive passing on camped apart mile further on main body ashamed of cowardly conduct be afraid to go near chief a be necessary to ascertain what meant to do one of white officer went to see for time chief must make reply at last said men have betrayed will have nothing further to do with intend to return home get other men when get back will attack napier tribe who deserted same day marched for coast followed at distance by abashed fugitive on way down met colonel whitmore who with three hundred constabulary have just arrived by ship from scene of operation on

got to promise that must not interfere with napier men nothing must persuade to fight again with men of own tribe who have deserted such being case steamer be placed at disposal in order that might make voyage return a soon a possible after rapata have left colonel whitmore sent out skirmishing party to ascertain whether enemy retained position scout returned with news that there be great fire on crest of hill believed that hau haus be burning hut preparatory to returning into interior colonel whitmore believed report considering that hau haus must leave neighbourhood of settlement altogether ordered constabulary to march down to coast again a soon a possible re embark there a presence be urgently required in north of province of wellington have be left open to attack of enemy there by withdrawal fortunately before re embarked te kooti showed hand have idea of retreating from position fire be caused by clearing off of scrub have afforded shelter to rapata force sooner did hear that colonel whitmore have marched away than sent party down against one of outlying settlement where murdered mr ferguson mr wylie son friendly native colonel whitmore on receiving news of raid marched rapidly to cut off retreat of hau haus managed to evade to retire to main body on th of december colonel whitmore force occupied high ridge mile distant from te kooti position here colonel received news that rapata have just landed with three hundred seventy men messenger after messenger be sent down urging to hurry up chief who be seriously ill be much annoyed by message especially by last that if did not come soon whitmore must take place without rapata replied very well have tried failed be turn now immediately ordered men to camp for day next morning colonel whitmore came down having be advised that only way to succeed with rapata be to treat in conciliatory way chief first word be have taken place colonel whitmore replied be waiting for rapata very good rapata said will be with to morrow morning ngatiporou performed great war dance a one stumbled fell considered omen to be good one marched on joined colonel whitmore force night chapter xvii back at farm position of hau haus be naturally very strong one being at top of high conical peak rising abruptly from low bush covered hill to height of two thousand foot on face have be before attacked ground sloped gradually up to summit on right left slope be very steep at one point there have be landslip leaving perpendicular face twenty foot high below for fifty foot be so steep that be difficult to get footing ground in rear of position narrowed into razor backed ridge down track led with rope ladder to aid descent of rock terrace position in front where alone must be attacked be defended by three line of earthwork with high parapet with ditch in front abutting at end on steep slope two lower work be seven foot high upper work be nearly fourteen foot high with sandbag loophole to enable defender to fire through line be connected with one above by covered way operation commenced by advance of arawa division of constabulary portion of ngatiporou under rapata advancing quietly cautiously came upon party of enemy engaged in carrying up water drove up to pah took possession of only water available rifle pit be now dug pushed forward gradually until within hundred yard of enemy first line of defence number seven division of constabulary be now sent up threw up long line of trench parallel to enemy work artilleryman having with great exertion brought up mortar vertical shell fire be opened upon enemy position with great effect although to get to spot shell have to be carried on men back for three mile over terrific ravine hundred constabulary under colonel fraser hundred ngatiporou be sent round to cut off enemy retreat in rear division of constabulary under major robert connected two party thus escape of enemy be cut off with exception of small piece of cliff seventy yard in length be believed impossible to descend be moreover exposed to flanking fire from rapata force in front that of colonel fraser in rear for day heavy firing went on hardship suffered by force be great for rain fell without intermission there be many casualty on side captain brown of constabulary be killed captain cabel of same corp severely wounded colonel fraser men pushed up ridge in enemy rear formed rifle pit near summit from hau haus made desperate vain attempt to repel on th of january rapata after consultation with colonel whitmore determined to storm lower line of earthwork told off fifty picked men sent round with instruction to scale cliff at point where parapet ended work be dangerous difficult one for cliff be very steep gravelly hau haus crowded to end of trench fired down wounding five of stormers to do have to expose suffered severely from fire of men told off to cover attack finally ngatiporou succeeded in climbing up under outer face of parapet cut through with spade opening raking fire upon hau haus drove out took possession of first line of defence night sap be carried upwards towards second line with intention of blowing up earthwork storming main work next morning two hundred picked men be assembled in trench ready to attack at daybreak at two o'clock in morning woman cried out from within pah that hau haus have left leaving only wounded men woman child word be not at first believed be considered to be only ruse to induce assailant to advance up hill under enemy fire at daybreak be found that news be true that whole of hau haus have escaped by mean of rope down face of perpendicular cliff rapata with men started in pursuit followed hau hau trail for distance then scattered men in small party a guessed that enemy must scatter in search of food hundred twenty of hau haus be overtaken killed rapata returned after absence of two day by time white constabulary have left a work have now be done constabulary be urgently needed elsewhere rapata marched back by circuitous way captured eighty more prisoner men woman child whom brought alive down into settlement te kooti have lost altogether during siege pursuit hundred fifty of men be still believed in by native three tribe joining at once more than making up for loss have suffered mr atherton other volunteer with colonel whitmore force have taken small share in second attack upon te kooti position not being attached to regular force rapata have be greatly struck with coolness of mr atherton wilfrid in first attack astonished at accuracy of shooting have greeted very heartily on return invited to act with force have therefore during siege taken up position in rifle pit in rear of party from here have done great service to ngatiporou by covering from enemy fire for hau haus soon learned that be almost certain death to stand up to take steady aim above parapet after defeat of hau haus many of native of poverty bay who have joined te kooti taken prominent part in massacre deserted calmly returned to settlement a if nothing have taken place authority allowed to remain unmolested settler justly indignant that men who have so lately murdered woman child must be allowed to come down among with impunity formed into vigilance committee of who have lost relative in massacre bound by oath to shoot next party of ruffian who made appearance opportunity soon offered native who have assisted in murdering mr wylie son came in be shot by mr benson following morning to astonishment benson be warned to attend a juryman at inquest of victim in vain assured native constable that be man who have done deed that ought not therefore to sit constable refused to entertain excuse so benson not only sat on own trial gave evidence against jury among whom be mr atherton having heard statement brought in following verdict find that deceased be shot by person unknown served right day after verdict be returned mr atherton wilfrid who have be waiting ten day for coasting craft sailed for mohaka river landing at mr mitford borrowed two horse from be soon at glade be afraid be heavy on horse still wilfrid mr atherton said a started animal may be thankful did not ride last time be here calculate must be at least four stone lighter than be certainly have lost good deal of flesh mr atherton almost wonder that did not continue with friend rapata declares that will follow up te kooti till catch if take couple of year wilfrid mr atherton laughed be possible to have too much of good thing might jog along with colonial force well enough benefit by rapata men must kill in week think fellow know what be to be tired be very well contented intend to do end of work in wood keep down to present weight there be immense deal to be done in way of botanizing have already found twelve new sort of fern have only just begun have not even looked at orchid yet moss must have thought mr atherton that must have be well worth while to go in for collecting sending home rare new plant instead of merely drying specimen for herbarium know new orchid fetch tremendous price because gentleman near at home have large house full of know used to pay what seemed to prodigious price for little scrap of plant not bit more beautiful than others simply because be rare idea be very good one wilfrid will think over have never gone in for collecting in way for income have be amply sufficient for want there can be doubt that in day when people be ready to give such large sum for rare plant botanist like might make really good thing of out here wood be literally crowded with rare plant must add to interest of excursion a be now simply look for new specie even here be hard to discover if took to getting rare specimen for sending home there must be unlimited field of work for of course difficulty be getting home alive for in country like where there be practically winter be never in entirely quiescent state must require most careful packing in case specially constructed for must need attention on voyage still might be managed steward might be paid well to take under charge well will think over wilfrid idea certainly seems good one if pay great horticulturalists to send out skilled men to collect plant for from part of world must certainly pay who be living in centre of one of most varied group of vegetation in world to send home consignment ten minute later rode into clearing loud whoop of welcome be heard a appeared jack came tearing down from house to meet moment later marion appeared at door too came flying towards mr mr renshaw also appeared on verandah need not ask how be boy mr renshaw said a wilfrid who have leapt from horse a marion ran up hastened forward with to house mother have told so much about illness that hardly anticipated seeing looking picture of health mr atherton be delighted to see wife have told how much owe to for care of wilfrid for having brought wife safely out of hand of native be very glad that be able to be of little service mr renshaw be quite a pleasant know to be able to aid a be to be aided so will look upon obligation a mutual wilfrid have invited to take up quarter here for day two until shanty be put in order again must be pleasure to if must take up abode here permanently mr renshaw said a mr atherton dismounted from horse two men rung other hand warmly jack take two horse round to shed now come in fortunately dinner be just ready have doubt be ready too wilfrid be struck with change have come over father since have be away looked better stronger than have ever seen before spoke with firmness decision quite new to mr renshaw finding whole responsibility of farm upon shoulder have be obliged to put aside book to throw into business with vigour at first unusual exertion involved by being out day looking after thing have tried good deal have gained strength a went on have even come to like work thought that wife wilfrid must be pleased to find everything going on well have strengthened in determination to stick to marion have a far a house work allowed be companion when about farm have done best to make evening cheerful pleasant have have terribly anxious time of during week between arrival of news of massacre at poverty bay mr renshaw return after life have gone on quietly although until news of capture of te kooti fortress have arrived have naturally be anxious about wilfrid safety illustration be afraid be heavy on horse still wilfrid page be looking wonderfully well sunburnt father lad said a sat at dinner father have be out from morning until night wilfrid managing farm mr renshaw said with glad smile do think exercise have done great deal of good be sure have mother wilfrid agreed be afraid book have not made much progress father since have be away have made progress at wilfrid suppose ever will science be very well when man can afford to make hobby have come to conclusion that man have right to ride hobby while family have to work to make living be glad to work father wilfrid said now be back again there be reason why must not return to work have be selfish great deal too long indeed now have broken into active life out of door have at present at anyrate inclination to take to pen again feel better than have done for year be astonished at work can get through a to appetite eat twice a much a used to really enjoy food since day heard of failure of bank burden have be on shoulder wilfrid mother be going to take share of in future a to book someone else must write suppose must ever have really paid almost wonder now how must have thought that out here must have derived satisfaction from knowing that work be praised by scientific men at home besides to do properly man must live among native must travel over island gather tradition current in tribe must not do if must have inclination for have be thinking that will ask mr atherton to teach little botany so can enjoy little more intelligently than can now do wonder of forest will gladly do mr renshaw be sure must add greatly to enjoyment of life here to become acquainted with secret of marvellous vegetation around be extraordinary to that men must be content to remain in ignorance of name of even principal tree shrub meet eye at turn there be not one settler in hundred can tell name of score of tree in island while have be away have tried to get native name of many of tree be mostly to be met with only in one two case must get information although of settler have be living for year among now mr atherton about what be saying just now think must be more pleasant for to erect fresh hut close to ours instead of living by away in wood must be great pleasure to of to have with society must brighten life here must have assistance of rifle in case native broke out again must of course live with must have own hut to retire to when liked to be alone what do say say that be very kind offer mr renshaw must certainly be very much more pleasant for than living out there by at mercy of native cook on condition that will allow to pay share of expense of housekeeping will gladly accept offer expense of housekeeping be next to nothing mr atherton mr renshaw laughed if make condition must of course agree to term will be permitted to pay quota to expense of establishment warn that amount will not be heavy one heavy light will be glad to pay renshaw arrangement must be delightful one for for although a traveller have necessarily be much alone be gregarious animal fond of company of mankind so two day later party of native be set to work hut be erected for mr atherton twenty yard away from house be soon fitted up a other have be wilfrid have at once taken up own work at farm be now father right hand instead of having a before everything on shoulder native

of wellington taranaki have marched with strong force divided into four column severely punished tribe have joined te kooti in north eastern part of island te kooti after perpetrating several other massacre of settler be fugitive hotly hunted by rapata who gave rest surprising several time exterminating last remnant of band who have escaped with from chatham island te kooti be now believed to be hiding somewhere in waikato country be no longer dangerous scheme have utterly failed pretension have even in native eye be altogether discredited who have adhered to have be killed punished by destruction of village clearing there be not slightest chance that must ever again trouble community settlement on mohaka river have grown in six month after wilfrid return whole of land lying between allen farm mr mitford be taken up two three family have settled beyond mr atherton holding at glade everything went on prosperously animal multiplied crop be excellent owing to many settler arriving requiring food until must raise for much better price be obtained for produce be no longer necessary to ship to napier wellington although mr atherton have not gone through such fatigue a that have endured at poverty bay have continued steadily to decrease in weight feeling so much lighter more active on return from expedition have continued to stick to long regular exercise be out day with native to carry tin collecting box press axe trowel from breakfast time until dark a steadily refused to take food with fasted from breakfast time till supper prolonged exercise in close heat of wood

longing to be back in london again seldom last long however suppose will yield to one of day be doing very well here mr atherton said only other day that consignment of plant have sold wonderfully that expected to make nearly thousand pound year be true enough wilfrid see unfortunately fortunately whichever way like to put thousand pound be of importance to one way other be really what be generally considered to be rich man from day left england now just two year ago income have be simply accumulating for beyond two three pound month mother let pay spend absolutely nothing must be very dull for here mr atherton accustomed a have be to be always travelling in london to be cut off from world with only just society that of allen mitford two three neighbour look dull do mr renshaw mr atherton laughed have never seen dull since knew mr atherton not even when be toiling along exhausted worn out with child on shoulder weight of helpless man on arm will miss awfully when do go will not marion marion be now nineteen have developed a wilfrid told in surprise for brother seldom think sister good looking into very pretty girl be not coming just yet mr atherton said have think pretty

suppose will make arrangement for brother to take over share naturally mr atherton agreed young allen must not care about remaining now that brother be married when one of two partner marries generally break up partnership besides will of course be wanting to have place of own holding be not large enough to divide after dinner wilfrid strolled out with mr atherton daresay saw atherton that question about bob allen fell rather a bomb shell among there be reason why who be great friend must not know truth fact be to astonishment marion have thought proper to refuse bob allen be never more surprised in life have always looked upon a certain that must accept especially a have refused three four good offer year one never can understand girl mr atherton be silent for minute two then said thought too wilfrid that must have come off have always thought so well well then after pause went on have intended to go over in morning to see like lad have idea of offering to advance sum of money

say to myself be too hot here let study arctic flora at spitzbergen if act upon idea promptly well good if allow time to elapse between idea striking carrying thing into execution there be never saying whether may not go off in entirely different groove during interval be there chance of going off in other groove now atherton mr renshaw asked think not just remote possibility perhaps not more than that be so indefinitely small indeed that may yes think may safely calculate upon starting on day said if find ship at wellington going on trading excursion among island up to strait to japan may likely enough take passage in thought said that business required to be at home mr atherton yes suppose be so wilfrid daresay solicitor must manage just a well if did not turn up solicitor be people
