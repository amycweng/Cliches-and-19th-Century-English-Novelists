fortified house have called in aid of fire to finish work of destruction whole of present structure be therefore subsequent to date have be added to altered many time of owner have followed out own fancy in utter disregard of of predecessor consequently house represented medley of diverse style although doubtless architectural monstrosity be picturesque pleasing to eye of men ignorant of canon of art there be large tree near though clump rose few hundred yard behind took away effect of bareness must otherwise have have garden be well kept bright with flower be clear that blighting influence hung over must be thought over girl who with straw hat swinging in one hand basket moved among country people for six mile round firmly believed that curse lay on carne hold even among county family

change horse at carne arm must take up quarter there for there be rare fishing in dare in deep still pool above mill for three four mile higher up while sea trout be nowhere to be found plumper

foolishness landlord said hastily jacob meant nothing by ai foolishness john beaumont know for one know foolishness indeed here be reuben claphurst can tell if be know about if one doe think ought to be spoken of before stranger hiram powlett put in why not smith asked sturdily there be man on country side know about there can be harm in telling what one know though carnes be landlord john beaumont a long a pay rent ai beholden to a for hiram why one know a great grandfather bought right of mill from folk have have ever since besides there ai nothing what be true in if squire be here must say no to well well jacob there be something in what say landlord said in tone of man convinced against will indeed now that have done what considered duty by making protest have objection to story being told maybe be right though must not like said a affair of carnes be gossiped about here still a mr gulston might now that have heard about curse on family ask question hear sort of lie from a know a much about a do especially a reuben claphurst here doe maybe be better must get right of story from that being so sailor said perhaps will give yarn mr claphurst for own that have quite excited curiosity a to mysterious curse old clerk who have told story score of time rather prided on telling be nothing loth to begin there be something mysterious about sir a say so have always maintained so will maintain there be a will have a be curse on family for wickedness of old sir edgar so be surelie not in way mean having be one of officer of church here for over forty year knowing mind of old parson ay of who be before always take stand on be curse sure enough not in way a want to make out must do to say a curse of spanish woman have nowt to do with seeing a have authority curse doe sometimes work out there ai no proof to mind to mind of parson a have served under what call curse of carne hold ai matter of misfortune not a folk about here mostly think kind of judgment brought on by foreign heathen woman of course expect other people to see in light be in answer to grunt of dissent on part of blacksmith ai have advantage look at a father grandfather did before

expense to fight under howard blake against spaniard be in time first slice be cut off property for went up to court held own among best of made a brave show say a of noble there son took after slice

heavier for king charles than did might have got off a many one did if must have given up when be clear cause be lost whenever there be rising anywhere be off to join till at last house land be confiscated have to fly abroad how lived there one exactly know said a fought with spaniard against moor others think be not far from mark that went out to spanish main joined band of lawless men lived pirate life there one know about think one even in day did know anything except when came back with king charles brought with spanish wife there be many tale about said that have be nun that have carried off from convent in spain general belief be a there be good many devonshire lad who fought with rover on spanish main be likely that report be true that have be wife of spanish don whose

wish to enter society especially a wife be entirely ignorant of english tongue even in day there be tale brought down to village by servant who have be hired from here that sir edgar wife did not get on well together agreed that seemed unhappy must sit for hour brooding seeming to have care love for little boy set folk more against since seemed natural that even heathen woman must care for child said too there be often fierce quarrel between sir edgar a always talked in tongue one knew what be about when new house be finished moved into ruin of old hold be levelled to ground people thought then that sir edgar must naturally open house to county indeed entertainment be given whether be that believed story to disadvantage that shrank from strange hostess who say always looked on occasion stately cold who spoke word of language country gentry gradually fell away carne hold be left pretty much to owner soon afterwards child be born there be of course more servant now more state lady carne be a much alone a ever whether be determined to learn word of english whether be determined that must not at rate made attempt to acquire husband language many said that be shame did not get nurse maid who must speak tongue for in day of charles there be foreigner enough in england there must have be difficulty in procuring attendant of own religion race quarrelled more than ever servant be of opinion that whatever be about be doing more than be voice to be heard rising in passionate tone while said little agreed be polite courteous in manner to a for must walk for hour by up down terrace talking aloud to herself sometimes wringing hand throwing arm wildly about at time there began to be report among country round that lady carne be out of mind be more alone than ever now for sir edgar have taken to making journey up to town remaining for week at time there be whisper that played heavily unluckily so thing went on until third child be born fortnight afterwards servant from hold rode through village late at night on way for doctor stopped moment to tell news that there be terrible scene up at hold for during momentary absence of nurse lady carne have stabbed child to death when came away be raving wildly effort of sir edgar two of servant hardly sufficing to hold after one except inmate of hold ever saw mistress again window in one of wing be barred two strange woman be brought down from london waited attended on poor lady there be few other servant there for most of girl from about here soon left saying that scream cry rang at time through house be so terrible that must not bear indeed there be small occasion for servant for sir edgar be almost always away one night one of girl who have stayed on have be spending evening with friend went home late just a reached house saw white figure appear at one of barred window in moment figure began cry screaming to girl surprise many of word be english must have picked up without one knowing girl always declared that language made blood run cold be full of oath such a rough sailor men use doubt have picked up on ship board then poured curse upon carnes husband house descendant girl be so panic stricken that remained silent till in minute two two other woman appeared at window by main force tore lady carne from hold upon bar few day afterwards died be mostly believed by own hand though be never known none of servant except own attendant ever entered room doctor never opened lip on subject doubtless be well paid to keep silence anyhow death be not sir edgar work for be away at time only returned upon day after death so sir be how curse came to be laid on carne hold be terrible story mr gulston said when old clerk ceased terrible story be likely enough that rumour be true that carried off after capturing vessel killing husband perhaps rest of that have never recovered from shock be there ever question a to whether have be married there be question about good deal of question at sir edgar death next heir who be distant cousin set up claim lawyer produced two document sir edgar have given one be signed by jack priest who have be said be one of crew on board sir edgar ship

rite appending note saying that did so although husband be heretic being compelled enforced by armed men town being in possession of force from two ship have entered harbour night before a therefore pair have be married according to rite of church carnes have powerful friend at court matter dropped title have never since be disputed a to sir edgar fortunately only lived four year after wife death have lived much longer there must have be estate left to dispute a be gambled away wide acre how have curse worked mr gulston asked in natural way sir a be saying before have just be in natural way people may say there be nothing a have heard old parson lay down many time to show that poor creature wild raving have aught to do with followed taint in blood of sir edgar spanish wife be naturally inherited by descendant son showed sign of at least a far a have heard until be married wife have borne three son then burst out drew sword killed servant who have given imaginary offence then springing at wife who have thrown upon must have strangled have not servant run in torn off too ended day in confinement son showed sign of fatal taint eldest married in london for none of gentry of

man shuts up take exercise to speak of get out of sort dull like anyhow there be nothing wrong about be just a sane sensible a after waiting for two day longer finding wet weather continue mr gulston packed up rod fishing tackle returned to plymouth have learned little more about family at hold beyond fact that mr mervyn who inhabited house standing mile further up valley be aunt of reginald margaret carne having be sister of late possessor of hold in youth have be people said counterpart of niece be not therefore wonderful that clithero mervyn have in spite of advice of friend reputation of carnes taken what be considered in county hazardous step of making wife step have never repented for have like brother be one of most popular person in part of county universal mervyn estate have

appearance in strength man can make very useful at ball even if doe dance gulston doctor said young fellow always think chit of girl be only section of female sex who must be thought of who be going to look after mother if there be only boy present conversation of sensible man like be quite a great treat to chaperone a be pleasure of hopping about room with to girl conceit selfishness of lad surprise more more there be literally bound to how far be place off be about twenty mile by road about fifteen by train eight nine to drive afterwards happen to know about place a be close to village where be fishing fortnight ago then think chaperone will have to do without gulston be fond of studying human nature if involves staying up night coming back in morning special section of human nature there presented must go unstudied have be thinking that one can manage without doctor there be very snug little inn where be stopping in village le than mile from house propose that go over in afternoon dine at inn dress there then can get trap to take up to mervyns can either walk drive down again after be over come back by train with others according to hour how feel when ball be over well that alters case lad under condition will be one of party chapter ii margaret carne ronald mervyn be perhaps most popular man in regiment be proud of a one of most daring steeplechase rider in service a man who have greatly distinguished by deed of desperate valour in india be far away best cricketer in corp must sing capital song be excellent musician most pleasant of companion be always ready to do friend service many newly joined subaltern who got into scrape have be helped out by ronald mervyn purse yet at time a even who most liked admired must not admit ronald mervyn be queer fellow fit be few far between when occurred be altogether unlike while lasted must scarce exchange word with soul shut in room a soon a parade be over mounted horse rode off not to return probably until late at night mervyn mood be subject of many quiet joke among young officer of regiment declared that must have committed murder somewhere be occasionally troubled in conscience while insisted that mervyn strange behaviour be only assumed in order that might be more appreciated at other time among two three officer of regiment who came from that part of country knew something of family history of mervyns be whispered that have inherited slight share of curse of carnes not that be mad in slightest degree one must think of saying that of ronald mervyn have certainly queer mood perhaps knowledge that there be taint in blood affected in course of time began to brood over when mood be on soon after joining regiment have spoken to doctor about do know doctor be horrible sufferer from liver complaint look mervyn surgeon replied skin be clear eye be bright be always taking exercise muscle be a hard a nail can not believe that there be much matter with assure doctor at time for two three day be fit for nothing get into such state be not fit to exchange word with human being must quarrel with best friend if spoke to have tried sort of medicine nothing seems to cure suppose be liver know what else can be have spoken about to major asked if at time see look grumpy to say word to mess ask to leave to myself do wish must give something doctor have recommended course of various foreign water have given instruction to bathe head when felt coming on nothing have availed once year sometimes oftener ronald retired for two three day then emerged a well cheerful a before once when attack have be particularly severe have again consulted doctor time telling history of family on mother side asking frankly whether thought periodical attack have connection with family taint doctor who have already heard story in confidence from one of two men who knew replied well mervyn suppose that there be sort of distant connection between two thing think be likely to be seriously affected think can set mind at ease on score man of so vigorous frame a be leading so active healthy life be certainly not likely subject for insanity must dismiss matter altogether from mind old fellow many men with more than usual amount of animal spirit suffer at time from fit of depression in case perhaps due to extent to family history fit of depression be more severe than usual probably very circumstance that know history have something to do with for when depression be a have said not uncommon in case of men with high spirit be in fact sort of reaction come over doubt thought of taint in blood occurs to prey upon mind deeply intensifies depression be so doctor when be in state one thought be that be going mad sometimes feel then a if must be best to blow out brain have done with let fancy enter head mervyn doctor said earnestly can assure that think have chance whatever of becoming insane fit of depression be of course troublesome annoying be few far apart at other time be perfectly well healthy must therefore regard a do a sort of reaction very common among men of sanguine temperament due in very slight degree to malady formerly existent in family have watched closely since came to regiment believe that say solely to reassure when affirm that be full belief conviction that be a sane a other men be likely that a get on in life fit of depression will altogether disappear see mother uncle be perfectly free from suspicion of taint be more than probable that have altogether died out at rate chance be slight indeed of reappearing in case thank doctor can imagine what relief word be to worry about at other time indeed feel so thoroughly well that must laugh at idea be mooted during mood of mine have tried horribly if mind will get to write opinion down so that next time fit seizes can read over assure that apprehension be unfounded certainly one must associate idea of insanity with ronald mervyn a upon day before ball at mother house sat on edge of ante room table laughed talked with group of five young officer gathered round mind fellow must catch seven o'clock train else will be too late there will be eight mile to drive will have trap there to meet wo be there long before others begin to arrive be not fashionable in part of county will have enough partner for to begin to dance by past nine can promise a pretty partner a can find in ball room in england when have be quartered here bit longer will be ready to admit truth of general opinion that in point of pretty woman devonshire can hold own against county in england there be fear whatever of coming in too great strength of course in plymouth here one can overdo thing when one get beyond beat of garrison men be at premium saw mother list if have not be for regiment female element must have predominated terribly army navy india colony to say nothing of devouring london be scourge of country younger son take wing to fly spinster be left lamenting think there be more push go among younger son than there be in elder one of young officer said have not got same responsibility ronald laughed be easy to see be younger son charley there be jaunty air about forage cap swagger in walk must tell observant person that be free from responsibility must a latin grammar say sing before robber there be general laugh for charley mansfield be notoriously in general state of impecuniosity joined merrily in laugh can certainly say replied 'he who steal purse steal trash ' think must get even without tussle still what said be true think know elder brother be fearfully stately personage who on strength of two year difference of age heirship take upon periodically to inflict ponderous word of wisdom upon think lot of be like after a tell be younger son who have made england what be won battle furnished colony have done pretty nearly everything have be done while elder son have only turned into respectable landowner prosy magistrate very well charley sentiment do honour laughed there assembly be sounding waiter bring glass of sherry sentiment have so impressed charley that intend to drink solemnly to success of second son be not on duty be mervyn be starting in hour to get home will be wanted to aid in final preparation well will see to morrow night forget seven o'clock train expect will keep up till between three four then can smoke cigar at five

neighbourhood military naval officer did not come in uniform there be two three girl staying in house one of in course of evening when be dancing with ronald said consider have taken in captain mervyn made sure that must all be in uniform of course who live near plymouth be accustomed to in part red coat be rather novelty feel have be defrauded never go to ball miss blackmoor in uniform except when be regular naval military ball given by own regiment of regiment in garrison by navy be generally rule though perhaps in regiment be not so strictly adhered to a with then consider that be fraud upon public captain mervyn gentleman dress be so dingy monotonous that consider distinctly duty of soldier to give little light colour when get chance very well miss blackmoor will bear in mind next time mother give ball regiment if be within reach will come in uniform by way do know who be man cousin be dancing with there be lot of face know here being seven eight year away make difference in quiet country place be mr gulston be first lieutenant of flagship at plymouth know because be introduced to early in evening danced together capital dancer be too be uncommonly good looking fellow ronald said margaret carne seemed to think so too a danced with two three time in course of evening went down to supper on arm ronald having a son of house to divide attention a much a possible did not dance with cousin lieutenant gulston have be accompanied by third lieutenant by doctor who never missed opportunity of going to ball because a said gave opportunity of studying character see must argue on board ship one get only one side of human nature sailor may differ bit one from can be divided into two three class steady honest fellow who try to do work well reckless fellow who be ready to do work be up to sort of mischief devilment lazy loafing fellow who neglect duty whenever possibly can be always shamming sick in order to get off day other will settle on shore practise there want to learn something about people will have to deal with besides there be nothing more amusing than looking on at ball when have idea of dancing be astonishing what lot of human nature see if do keep wit about in course of evening came up to first lieutenant who be that man have just be talking to gulston have be watching for time have not be dancing have be standing in corner looking on be mr carne doctor cousin rather nephew of hostess be brother of pretty girl have be dancing with lieutenant nodded then be sorry for surgeon said bluntly sorry what for surgeon answered by question do know anything about family gulston have heard something about why never mind now surgeon said will tell in morning be hardly question to discus here turned away before lieutenant must ask further be four o'clock before dancing ceased last carriage rolled away then military naval men two three visitor from plymouth gathered in library smoked talked for hour be then conveyed to station to catch early train next day a be walking up down quarter deck first lieutenant said by way doctor what be be going to say last night about carnes said be sorry for miss carne asked if knew anything about history of family

suddenly in walk with exclamation of surprise pain what do mean mackenzie why do ask question have not answered mine be there insanity in blood there have be lieutenant said reluctantly felt sure of think have heard say father made special study of madness when be studying for profession have often accompanied to lunatic asylum devoted great deal of time to subject intending to make special branch also then rambling fit seized entered service have never missed following subject up have have opportunity have therefore visited asylum for lunatic whenever such existed at port have put into since have be in service when eye first fell upon mr carne be standing behind several other people watching dancing expression of face struck a soon a eye fell upon watched closely through evening did not dance rarely spoke to one unless addressed watched face hand hand be can tell almost a expressive a face have not smallest hesitation in saying that man be mad be possible not probable that at ordinary time may show sign of at time last night be one of time man be mad nay more must be inclined to think that madness be of dangerous type now that tell be hereditary be so far confirmed in opinion must not hesitate if called upon to do so to sign certificate to effect that in opinion be so far insane a to need most careful watching if not absolute confinement colour have faded from lieutenant face a doctor spoke be awfully sorry said in low tone trust to god doctor that be mistaken can not think that be be introduced to by sister be most civil polite indeed more than civil for asked if be fond of shooting when said be extremely so invited over to place said did not shoot that next week cousin mervyn one two others be coming to to have two three day pheasant shooting must be glad if must join party a may suppose gladly accepted invitation well doctor said drily so far a be concerned there be danger in doing so if a say doe shoot if did must advise to stay away in case if will take advice offer wo go will send excuse lieutenant made answer for minute two paced room in silence wo pretend to misunderstand mackenzie mean there be danger with think there may be from be what mean be doctor nodded saw be taken with gulston be why have spoken to about brother think confound man ca think lieutenant said angrily that there be anything matter with think so doctor said gravely must say certainly not know in case where be in blood sometimes lie dormant for generation then break out again asked somebody casually last night about father said that be capital fellow most popular in country so if be in blood passed over be showing again in son may pas over daughter reappear in child never know see do mind telling what know about family not now not at present will at other time have given shock must think over doctor nodded commenced to talk about other matter minute two later lieutenant made excuse turned into cabin dr mackenzie shook head lad be hard hit said be sorry for hope warning come in time will do if be fool young men be fool where woman be concerned will say for that have more sense than most must give good deal if have not happened lieutenant gulston be indeed hard hit have be much struck with momentary glance have obtained of margaret carne a stood on step of carne arm effect have be greatly heightened on previous day lieutenant gulston have since day when be middy indulged in many flirtation have never before felt serious have often laughed at impressibility of of comrade have scoffed at idea of love at first sight now that began to think matter seriously over pain doctor remark have given opened eye to fact that be good deal more than passing fancy thinking over in light acknowledged prudent course must be to send excuse to brother with expression of regret that found that matter of duty must prevent coming over a have promised for shooting then told that after doctor might be mistaken that must be only right that must judge for if there be anything in of course must go no more to hold harm must be done margaret be certainly very charming be more than charming be most lovable woman have ever met still of course if there be chance of inheriting dreadful thing must see more after more harm must be done in couple of day than have be done already be not such fool that must draw back in time so after changing mind dozen time resolved to go over for shooting ruth want to speak to seriously margaret carne said to maid two day after ball ruth powlett be miller daughter village gossip have be greatly surprised when year before heard that be going up to hold to be miss carne own maid for although old mill be small one did more than local business hiram be accounted to have laid by snug penny a ruth be only child be generally regarded a richest heiress in carnesford that hiram must then let go out into service even a maid to miss carne at hold struck one with surprise be generally assumed that step have be taken because hiram powlett wanted peace in house have after death of first wife ruth mother married again general verdict be that have made mistake in first place hiram be staunch churchman one of churchwarden at carnesford wife who be dareport woman that alone be in opinion of carnesford greatly against be dissenter attended little chapel at dareport entertained strongest view a to prospect chance of neighbour in future state in second place perhaps in consequence of religious opinion be generally on bad term with neighbour when hiram married have good figure line of face have not hardened a afterwards did have persuaded that must make excellent mother for ruth indeed have not be intentionally unkind although have brought up strictly believed that have thoroughly done duty lamenting only that effort have be thwarted by obstinacy perverseness of husband in insisting that little maid must trot to church by side instead of going with to chapel at dareport ruth have grown up quiet somewhat serious girl have blossomed out into prettiness in old mill folk in village be divided a to whether lucy carey smith daughter be prettiest girl in carnesford not that there be other matter in comparison between for lucy be somewhat gay flirty have dozen avowed admirer while ruth have from childhood made secret of preference for george forester son of little farmer whose land came down to dare just where hiram powlett mill stood be five year older than be have fished out of mill stream when fell into when be eight year old from time have be hero have be content to follow about like dog to sit by side for hour while fished in deep pool above mill under shadow of tree quite content with occasional word notice took part heartily when stepmother denounced a idlest most impertinent boy in parish when soon after be fifteen one day mentioned that a matter of course must day be wife accepted a thing of have never entertained doubt hiram now took alarm one day told that be to give up consorting with young forester be no longer child ruth if go on meeting young forester down at pool people will be beginning to talk of course know that be good girl must never for moment think of taking up with george forester one know what sort of young fellow be never doe day work on farm be in out of 'carne arm at hour associate with worst lot in village be only other day that when parson tried to speak to seriously answered in way be enough to make one hair stand on end ruth obeyed father be more seen about with george forester believed tale to disadvantage when at time met with accidentally told frankly enough that though father did like going about with loved meant to love always whatever might say upon other point father will be law to upon be firm two year

gravity of manner showed that have not forgotten shook head sadly when one afternoon lieutenant have obtained leave until following day wish have never spoken have not be old fool must have known well enough that be fairly taken by have sailed together for twelve year now there be end to friendship hope will be that will not have reason to be sorry did not take advice drop in time of course may have escaped think that have done so be terrible risk terrible must give year pay that must have happened hour before lieutenant gulston left ship ronald mervyn have started for hold word have be said by young officer of flagship who be dining at mess have caught ear be concerning first lieutenant be got quite fishing mania at present twice week go off for day to place twenty mile away carnesford think be doe not seem to have much luck anyhow never brings fish home be awfully good fellow gulston best first lieutenant ever sailed with by long way what ronald mervyn heard be not pleasant to have noticed attention gulston have paid to margaret carne at ball have be by mean pleased at meeting installed at hold with shooting party thought that have be twice week over in neighbourhood caused angry surprise next morning therefore telegraphed home for horse to meet at station started a soon a lunch be over stayed hour at home for house lay on road between station carne hold answer received from sister to question put did not add to good temper oh yes mr gulston have called day two after have be to shooting party have heard have be at hold several time since when arrived there ronald found that margaret brother be in drawing room stood chatting with there for time rather chatting with margaret for reginald be dull moody at last latter sauntered away what be matter with sir margaret said to cousin seem to be quite be weather reginald be duller more silent than usual have hardly spoken word to day be not weather replied sharply want to ask question margaret well if ask civilly girl replied will answer certainly not otherwise hear that sailor fellow have be coming here several time what doe mean margaret carne threw back head haughtily what do mean ronald by speaking in tone be out of mind not more than family in general replied grimly have not answered question have not asked lieutenant gulston what come here for said coldly besides recognise right to ask question not recognise right repeated passionately must have thought that man have right to ask question of woman be going to marry going to marry repeated scornfully at rate be first have heard of have always be settled thing said know a well a do promised ten year ago that must be wife day ten year ago be child ronald how can talk like know have always be a brother sister together have never thought of anything else of late have be home four five month anyhow have have plenty of time to speak if wanted to never said word to lead to believe that thought of in other way than a cousin thought understood other margaret thought so too girl replied not in same way oh ronald say have always be such friend perhaps year ago might have thought must be something more since then have grown up grown wiser even if have loved in way speak of must not have married because be sure must be bad for have terrible curse in blood if there be not man in world must not marry believe must have said so month ago ronald mervyn said looking darkly at gulston have come between be what be can not deny be not behaving like gentleman ronald girl said quietly have right to say such thing have right to say anything burst out have fooled spoilt life will regret think after year be to be thrown by like old glove no by heaven may throw over swear will never marry sailor one else do to prevent say have curse of carnes in blood be right will have cause to regret leapt from window margaret have thrown open short time before for fire have overheated room ran down to stable leapt on horse rode off at furious pace margaret have noticed that moment before man passed along walk close under window be lieutenant gulston paused for moment a heard name uttered in angry tone opened hall door without ceremony hurried towards that of drawing room reginald carne be standing close to flashed across gulston mind that have be listening turned head at sailor quick step go in there just at present gulston fancy margaret be having quarrel with cousin be quiet now have best leave alone be using very strong language sailor said hotly caught word two a passed window be family failing fancy have gone now will go in see think be best for to walk off for few minute then come back again people may quarrel with relative know often care for other people to be behind scene be quite right gulston answered fact be for moment be fairly frightened by violence of tone really feared that be going to do something violent be foolish of course really beg pardon yes what say be quite right if will allow will have horse put in trap again got out at gate walked across garden telling man to take horse straight round to stable think have better go come again day after scene a have gone through miss carne will not care about having stranger here think must be best reginald carne said must wonder why did not come must likely enough hear from maid that have be gone away again might guess have heard something of talking in there think have better do a said go away come again in few minute lieutenant accordingly went out walked about shrubbery for short time then returned miss carne did not appear at dinner sent down message to say that have so bad headache must not be able to appear downstairs that evening reginald carne did not play part of host so well a usual at time be gloomy abstracted then roused talked rapidly lieutenant gulston thought that be seriously discomposed at quarrel between sister cousin determined at rate not to take present occasion to carry out intention have formed of telling reginald carne that be in love with sister hoped must have objection to telling so a have good income besides pay a first lieutenant when men have be sitting silently for time after wine be put on table said think carne will not stop here to night sister be evidently quite upset with affair wonder will feel horribly de trop must rather come again other time if will let if will let man put horse in trap will catch ten o'clock train comfortably perhaps must be best gulston be not very lively companion at best of time family quarrel be unpleasant enough for stranger few minute later lieutenant gulston be on way to station have much to think about on way home in one respect have reason to be well satisfied with what have heard a have left doubt whatever in mind that margaret carne have refused offer of cousin that latter have believed that have be refused because loved charlie gulston of course have not said so still must not have denied cousin wrath must not have be turned against then be sorry that quarrel have taken place a must probably lead to breach between two family knew margaret be very fond of aunt girl then violence with ronald mervyn have spoken caused deal of uneasiness be possible that sane man must have gone on like be possible that curse of carnes be still working be unpleasant thought that followed be still more anxious certainly from tone of voice have believed that ronald mervyn be on point of using violence to margaret if man be really not altogether right in head there be saying what might do a for laughed at threat have be uttered against mad sane have not slightest fear of ronald mervyn if a be likely enough mad brained fellow tried to fix quarrel upon in public way might be horribly unpleasant so unpleasant that did not care to think of consoled by hoping that when mervyn first burst of passion have calmed down might look at matter in more reasonable light see at rate must not bring about public quarrel without margaret name being in way drawn into that cousin must not wish however angry might be with be unpleasant business if margaret accepted must take away from association be marvellous that be so bright cheerful knowing horrible story about spanish woman that there be taint in blood that brother of hers too be enough to keep story always in mind doctor be certainly right about of course be mad there be something strange about at time caught looking at in unpleasant sort of way be always very civil lieutenant muttered to in fact wonderfully civil hospitable still never feel quite at ease with if have be rich man have be hard up must have certainly suspected there be design in invitation that wanted to marry margaret of course be absurd ca tell have penny beyond pay girl like margaret might marry one liked at rate out of devonshire perhaps may not have liked idea of marrying cousin of hers doubt be right there seeing a daresay did see be taken with margaret thought better to give chance than to let marry care snap whether relation be mad not know that be a free from taint a be ca be wholesome for girl to live in such atmosphere next time go over will put question meant to put evening if say yes will very soon get out of then lieutenant indulged in vision of pretty house with bright garden looking over sea finally concluded that little place near ryde cowes must be in way best most convenient a being handy to portsmouth far removed from devonshire association hope to get step in about year then will go on half pay have capital interest daresay cousin in admiralty will be able to get dockyard appointment of sort at portsmouth if not will of course give up be not going to knock about world after be married train of thought occupied until almost mechanically left train walked down to water hailed boat be taken alongside ship chapter iv terrible discovery margaret carne message a to inability to come down to dinner be scarcely veracious one be not given to headache have not so far a must remember be once laid up with after have be said did not feel equal to going downstairs facing charlie gulston have never quite admitted to herself that loved young sailor who have for last few week be so much at house of whose reason for so coming have little doubt now a sat alone in room knew well enough answer must give to question when came at present however discovery of own feeling caused alarm rather than pleasure there have be sign of fear in face when cousin raged threatened did not believe that threat be empty one have often frightened when be child by furious burst of passion although be many year now since have seen thus felt sure that must do a have threatened be likely enough to take violent step might occur to in passion to carry out threat although have put bold front on margaret felt at heart that reproach be not altogether unjustified there have be boy girl understanding between although have not be formally ratified of late year existence be tacitly recognised in family until few month before have considered that in natural course of event must day be ronald wife have reproached gently must have frankly admitted must have asked to forgive for changing mind now that year have wrought change in feeling harshness suddenness of attack have roused pride driven to take up ground that there be formal engagement between that a have not renewed subject for year be at perfect liberty to consider free have spoken truth in saying that near relationship be in eye bar to marriage of late year have thought much more than have when girl over history of family curse of carnes although have tried best to prevent from brooding over idea must not disguise from herself that brother be at time strange unlike other men recollection of ronald outburst of temper a boy induced suspicion that too have not altogether escaped fatal taint still have not charlie gulston come across path be probable that must have drifted on a before must when time came have accepted ronald mervyn a husband next morning when ruth powlett went a usual to call mistress started with surprise a opened door for blind be already up window open closing door behind went in placed jug of hot water carried by washstand then turned round to arouse mistress a did so low cry burst from lip grasped chair for support white linen be stained with blood margaret lay there

coroner ought to be informed at once will speak to carne about if do morning will have time to send over evening summon jury for to morrow sooner be over better directly chief constable arrives will

miss carne sat quiet over indeed jacob carey affirmed bringing down fist with heavy thump on knee squire sister be well liked for one must have helped duck one spoke against in dare be most liked perhaps because of bright face kind word being so much down here among squire be well liked too be not one to laugh talk a be be good landlord will always give quarter rent to man a get behindhand for

theft idea be new one to listener smoked over silently for minute lord what evil way there be in world reuben claphurst said at last wickedness without end now what do make out of mister of course thing come natural to detective shook head be too early to form opinion yet mr claphurst much too early dare say will put two two together make four presently at present see have got to learn fact who live close ought to know more than do to be able to put on track to begin with point out clue will follow best dog ca hunt until take up scent be true enough blacksmith said approvingly have there be

partly curse a heathen woman a sir edgar brought home a wife laid on place old clerk said positively will go on working a long a carne hold stand be what say think a one else here will gainsay be right enough blacksmith agreed think be with there mr claphurst ought to have be pulled down long ago after what have happened there why if mr carne be to say to 'have house garden rent free jacob carey a long a like ' must say 'thank squire must move into not if give enough beside to keep up ' call just flying in face of providence only look at hiram powlett there sends daughter up to be miss carne maid at hold what come of why tumble down hill going up there lie three week with doctor coming to see day be clear warning if ever there be one who ever heard of girl falling down hurting like one must not have happened if have be for curse of carne hold must go so far a hiram powlett said what happened to lass have nothing to do with hold might have be walking up hill at time might have slipped down at time girl may put foot on loose stone fall without having anything to say to hold one way other besides have never heard said a curse have aught to do except with family know about that smith replied that servant be killed by spanish woman son how about seems to a curse worked on bit too so did so did hiram agreed ca gainsay there jacob carey now put so see there be something in though never before have heard of there being anything in curse except in family why did mile jefferies father of one of boy a be in stable get brain kicked out by one of old squire horse so did jacob so did still groom doe get brain kicked out at other place besides hold there be something in what say if have thought of before must never have let ruth go up there to service thought be for best at

into bad company down at dareport be what led to poaching business expect because there be call for to go poaching father got tidy farm wanted for nothing if have be there must have wanted to steal miss carne jewellery be passionate enough know many quarrel have have with father nothing must have made believe even if have be here that old jim forester son have hand in black business like so go to take notion a into head must not be likely to have quarrel with miss carne detective asked quarrel hiram replied sharply for resented idea that possible suspicion of margaret carne murder must be attached to man with whom ruth name have be connected suppose miss carne ever spoke word to in life what must speak to for why have left sunday school year before took to seeing after 'tai a if have be one of boy of village a jacob carey reuben claphurst landlord gave assenting murmur to hiram word detective did not think while to pursue point further for there really seemed nothing to connect george forester in way with margaret carne death well said taking up hat will go round to beershop speak of make inquiry a to whether tramp have be staying there be quite certain young lady did put end to herself what have got to find out be who be man did chapter v inquest be six o'clock already quite dark when a lieutenant gulston be writing in cabin servant told that dr mackenzie have just come off from shore must be glad if must spare few minute conversation tell will be on quarter deck in minute added few line to letter be writing put in envelope taking cap went out dropping letter into post bag that hung near cabin then went on to quarter deck be rather pleased with doctor summons for highly esteemed regretted slight estrangement have arisen between well doctor asked cheerily have of men be getting into mischief ashore lad no doctor replied first lieutenant felt that something more serious be matter for since have obtained rank of first lieutenant doctor have dropped former habit of calling lad have heard news ashore will affect seriously be sorry dear lad very sorry may have thought that be foolish will make difference now what be doctor lieutenant gulston asked with vague alarm at gravity of doctor manner of treating evening paper came out with early edition gulston boy be shouting out news of terrible affair most terrible affair at friend carnes be steady lad be steady be heavy blow for man to have to bear miss carne be dead dead margaret dead lieutenant repeated incredulously what be saying doctor there must be mistake be well yesterday for be over there in evening did not leave until nine o'clock ca be true be true lad unhappily there be mistake be found dead in bed morning lieutenant be almost stunned by blow good god murmured seems impossible doctor walked away left for minute two to have not told a yet lad went on when returned make difference to poor girl none passed out of life seems painlessly instantly be worse for who be left paused moment be found stabbed to heart by midnight robber exclamation of horror broke from sailor murdered good heaven ay lad be true seems to have be done in sleep death be instantaneous there will leave for while now will put paper in cabin so that when feel equal to reading detail can do so try think be for best lad one know what trouble might have darkened life yours have thing not happened know will not be able to think so now will feel so day hour later lieutenant gulston entered doctor cabin there be look of anger a well a of grief on face that doctor did not understand doctor believe be murder by wandering tramp a paper say believe be done from revenge that thing be stolen simply to throw people off scent will tell took place yesterday drove up a far a gate in garden there one road sweep round in front of house other go straight to stable so got down told man might a well drive straight in while walked up to house road follows close under drawing room window one of being open a passed heard man voice raised loud in anger so loudly so passionately indeed that involuntarily stopped word be a nearly a can recollect 'you have fooled spoilt life will regret think after year be to be thrown off like old glove no by heaven may throw over swear will never marry sailor anybody else may have to do to prevent say have curse of carnes in blood be right will have cause to regret ' voice be so loud passionate believed speaker be about to do injury to margaret for did not doubt that be to be speaking ran round through hall door to door of room found carne standing there too suppose when have be about to enter have heard word said ' go in just at present margaret cousin be having quarrel think be over now ' seeing that be there at hand went away for bit found afterwards that mervyn have jumped from window gone to stable ridden straight off margaret did come down to dinner making excuse that be unwell now what do think of doctor know that mervyn mother be carne that have mad blood that warned against in vein there be threat given in what be almost mad outburst of passion be found dead morning what do think of know what to think of gulston know little of mervyn have heard men in regiment say that be queer fellow though generally most cheery pleasant companion have at time fit of silence moroseness similar must say to of cousin reginald carne be possible lad though like to think so when there be madness in blood one can say when may blaze out what course can take idea be terrible one yet be possible may indeed be so for madness in family have twice before led to murder presumption be certainly grave one for although messmate may consider mervyn to be a say queer fellow think must find of to say be mad anything like remember gulston must be terrible accusation to bring against man even if can prove a probably can prove that be at home here in plymouth at time of murder charge that be mad notoriety charge must obtain be enough to ruin man for life ca help that lieutenant said gloomily heard threaten margaret will say so at coroner inquest to morrow if man be such coward a to threaten woman must put up with consequence may happen to befall coroner jury met in dining room at hold be carnesford men hiram powlett jacob carey landlord of carne arm be upon for summoning officer have be careful to choose on important occasion leading men of village after having gone upstairs to view body coroner opened proceeding room be crowded many of gentry of neighbourhood be present lieutenant gulston with hard set look upon face stood in corner of room with doctor beside ronald mervyn looking a of carnesford people remarked in whisper ten year older than did when drove through village few day before stood on other side of table talking in low tone to of neighbour will first gentleman coroner said hear evidence a to finding of body ruth powlett maid of deceased lady be first witness minute later there be stir at door ruth be led in by constable be evidently so weak unhinged that coroner told to take chair now miss powlett tell saw when entered mistress room upon opening door ruth said in calmer more steady voice than be expected from appearance saw that window be open blind up be surprised at for miss carne did not sleep with window open in winter blind be always down walked straight to washstand placed can of hot water there then turned round to wake miss carne saw lying there with great patch of blood on nightdress knew by face that be dead then fainted know how long lay there when came to got up went to door went downstairs to kitchen gave alarm did not notice that of miss carne thing have be taken from table coroner asked sir be there sign of struggle having taken place sir did not see miss carne lay a if be sleeping quietly be lying on side bedclothes be not disarranged sir except that clothes be turned down short distance be greatly attached to mistress miss powlett yes sir be generally liked be not yes sir one who knew miss carne be fond of have of further question to ask coroner asked jury there be reply thank miss powlett will not trouble further at present cook then gave testimony dr arrowsmith be next called testified to effect that upon arrival found that room have not be disturbed in way one have entered with exception a understood of miss carne maid cook mr carne door be locked when went in found deceased be dead be opinion from coldness rigidity of body that must have be dead seven eight hour be just nine o'clock when arrived must think therefore death have taken place between one half past two in morning death have be caused by stab given either with knife dagger blow be exactly over heart extended down into substance of heart death must have be absolutely instantaneous deceased lay in natural position a if asleep clothes have be turned down about foot just low enough to uncover region of heart after making examination of body examined room with constable found that jewel box on table be open content gone watch chain of deceased have also disappeared looked out of window saw that must be entered by active man by climbing up thick stem of ivy that grew close by observed several leaf lying on ground be of opinion that assassin entered there from what say dr arrowsmith be opinion that struggle took place be sure that there be struggle doctor replied have question that miss carne be murdered in sleep must say that bedclothes be drawn down so lightly that be not disturbed doe not appear extraordinary thing to dr arrowsmith if a seems miss carne did not awake murderer must have taken life very extraordinary doctor said emphatically be wholly unable to account for can understand have woke sat up burglar might have killed to secure own safety that must have quietly deliberately set to murder in sleep be to most extraordinary will note circumstance gentleman coroner said to jury be quite contrary to one usual experience in case a rule thief be not murderer to secure own safety may take life a rule avoid running risk of capital punishment object be to effect robbery without rousing inmate of house at present evidence certainly point to premeditated murder rather than to murder arising out of robbery be true that robbery have taken place might be merely blind know of one dr arrowsmith who must have be likely to entertain feeling of hostility against miss carne certainly not sir be must say universally popular certainly among people of carnesford be regarded with great affection for be continually doing good among be prepared to give evidence on point voice said from corner of room there be general movement of surprise a one turned round to look at speaker then perhaps sir may a well hear evidence next coroner said because may throw light upon matter enable to ask question to point of further witness lieutenant moved forward to table name be charles gulston be first lieutenant of tenebreuse flagship at plymouth have honour of acquaintance of mr miss carne have spent day two here on several occasion may say be deeply attached to miss carne have hoped day to make wife day before yesterday came over here upon mr carne invitation to dine spend night dogcart met at station a drove up to last gate that leading into garden alighted from trap told man to drive straight to stable while walked across lawn to house drawing room window be open a passed heard voice of man raised in tone of extreme passion so much so that stopped involuntarily word be 'you have fooled spoilt life will regret think that after year be to be thrown off like old glove no by heaven may throw over vow that will never marry sailor one else may have to do to prevent say have curse of carnes in blood be right will have cause to regret ' word be so loud tone so threatening that ran round into house to door must have entered have not mr carne who be standing there having apparently just come up begged not to do so saying that sister cousin be having quarrel that be over now a be there went away for few minute when returned found that miss carne have gone upstairs that cousin have left having a mr carne told left by open window while lieutenant gulston be speaking deep silence reigned in room a mentioned what reginald carne have said eye turned towards ronald mervyn who stood with face a white a death one arm with clenched hand across breast glaring at speaker do mean sir burst out a lieutenant ceased coroner at once intervened must pray to keep silent for present captain mervyn will have opportunity of speaking presently a to word overheard mr gulston did recognise speaker of before heard from mr carne who be with sister in drawing room certainly recognised voice at once a of captain mervyn whom have met on several occasion be impressed with word did strike a mere outburst of temper be so impressed with tone in be spoken that ran round to drawing room to protect miss carne from violence be impression upon thinking of afterwards that word be meant a menace to miss carne sir impression left upon mind be that captain mervyn intended to fix quarrel on a have doubt that be to alluded in threat matter dwelt in mind evening for naturally nothing must have be more unpleasant than public quarrel with near relative of lady to whom one be attached there be long silence then coroner asked usual question of juryman none of have question to ask indeed be so confounded by new light thrown upon matter that have power of framing question job harpur be then called testified to entering bedroom of deceased with dr arrowsmith to examination have made of there have found jewel box opened content abstracted watch gone must find nothing else disarranged in room trace must give clue a to identity of murderer then looked out of window with dr arrowsmith saw by few leaf lying on ground by mark upon bark of ivy that one have got up down dr arrowsmith have suggested that must take up post there not allow one to approach a careful search might show footstep other mark must be obliterated be people allowed to approach window when captain hendricks came examined ground together must find sign of footstep at distance of ten yard at foot of wall found torn glove produced have reason in connecting with case in way suppose constable coroner asked a glove be laid on table before might have be lying there for time suppose might sir be dog skin glove stitched with red with three line of black red stitching down back while glove be produced examined by jury ronald mervyn be talking in whisper to friend standing round wish to draw attention lieutenant gulston said in low tone to captain hendricks captain mervyn be at moment holding in hand glove in point of colour exactly match that on table be brighter yellow than usual chief constable glanced at glove then whispered to coroner latter started then said captain mervyn must kindly hand glove have in hand be suggested to that colour closely resembles that of glove on table mervyn who have not be listening to last part of constable evidence turned round upon being spoken to glove yes here be what do want for coroner took glove laid by other colour stitching matched exactly there must be doubt that be pair smothered exclamation broke from almost man in room what be ronald mervyn asked constable have just testified captain mervyn that found glove few foot from window of deceased doubt can account for being there until matter be explained have of course somewhat serious aspect coupled with evidence of lieutenant gulston again ronald mervyn whitened to hair do understand sir said in low voice be accused of murder of cousin one be at present accused coroner said quietly be only taking evidence of who know anything about matter have doubt whatever that will be able to explain matter perfectly to prove that be physically impossible that must have have connection with ronald mervyn passed hand across forehead perhaps coroner continued if have fellow of glove now handed to in pocket will kindly produce a will of course put end to part of subject can not ronald mervyn answered found a be starting to come out morning that one of glove be missing may say at once have doubt that other glove be one lost though how can have got near place where be found can not explain men standing near fell back little evidence given by mr gulston have surprised have scarcely affected opinion of neighbour strong piece of confirmatory evidence gave terrible shock to confidence in mr carne be next called testified to being summoned while dressing by cry of servant to having found sister lying dead now mr carne coroner said have heard evidence of lieutenant gulston a to quarrel appears to have taken place on afternoon of sad event between sister captain mervyn seems from what said that also overheard portion of beg to state attach importance to reginald carne said absolutely refuse to give credence to supposition that cousin captain mervyn be in way instrumental in death of sister think that mr carne at same time must beg to say what know about matter know very little about reginald carne said quietly be about to enter drawing room where knew cousin sister be certainly heard voice raised loudly opened door quietly a be way be about to enter when heard word showed that quarrel be somewhat serious felt that have better leave alone therefore quietly closed door again few second later lieutenant gulston rushed in from front door be about to enter when stopped seeing that be mere family wrangle be better that third person must interfere in especially a myself be at hand ready to do so if necessary be sure be not be word that overheard mr carne reginald carne hesitated think be of consequence said be sure be spoken on heat of moment meant nothing be for to judge mr carne must thank to give a nearly a can recollect said then reginald carne said reluctantly ' swear will never marry sailor one else may have to do to prevent ' be heard do suppose allusion be to lieutenant gulston thought so at time be one of reason why did not wish to enter thought by cousin tone did lieutenant gulston enter at moment assault might take place what happened after lieutenant in compliance with request left waited minute two then went in sister be alone be naturally much vexed at what have taken place will tell exactly what said again reginald carne hesitated really think said after pause that sister meant what said be indignant excited think that word must be taken a evidence jury will make allowance mr carne have to ask to tell word can not tell precise word said for spoke for little time began by saying that have be grossly insulted by cousin that must insist that did not enter house again for if did must certainly leave said be mad with passion that be in such state that did not feel life be safe with be sure gentleman did not at mean what said be in passion herself must be sure when be cool have spoken very differently there be deep silence in room at last coroner said just two more question mr carne then have done captain mervyn say have left room when entered be there other door to drawing room than at be standing sir there be other door window be wide open a be only three foot from ground have doubt went out that way heard gallop off minute two later so that must have run straight round to stable in going from drawing room window to stable must pas under window of sister room reginald replied be quite other side of house then in fact glove be found there must not have be accidentally dropped on way from drawing room to stable must not reginald carne admitted reluctantly thank if none of jury wish to ask question be will require at present jury shook head be altogether too horrified at turn matter be taking to think of question to point chief constable then called gardener who testified that have swept lawn on afternoon of day murder be committed have glove be lying at time on spot where be discovered must have noticed when man have done captain hendricks intimated that be evidence that have at present to call now captain mervyn coroner said will have opportunity of explaining matter doubt will be able to tell where be at time miss carne met death to produce witness who will at once set mysterious affair a far a be concerned at rest ronald mervyn made step forward be still very pale look of anger with have first heard evidence against have passed face be grave quiet admit sir began in steady voice whole fact have be testified acknowledge that on afternoon have serious quarrel with cousin margaret carne subject be painful one to touch upon be compelled to do so have almost from boyhood regarded a future wife there be boy girl understanding between to effect although formal engagement have taken place have never said anything to lead to believe that have changed mind on subject think may say that in of family be considered probable at time other must be married on afternoon spoke sharply to admit that a to receiving attention of man upon denying altogether right to speak to on subject repudiating idea of engagement between certainly admit with greatest grief lost temper unfortunately have be from child given to occasional fit of passion be long since have done so upon occasion suddenness of shock bitterness of disappointment carried beyond admit used word lieutenant gulston have repeated to declare have idea whatever even at moment of making personal threat against what be in mind be to endeavour in way other to prevent marrying man here paused for minute so far effect of word have be most favourable a stopped friend breathed more easily jury furtively nodded to other with air of relief a to glove ronald mervyn went on deliberately can not account for being in place where be found certainly have glove on when rode over here how lost where lost be wholly unable to say may also add that admit went direct from drawing room to stable did not pas round side of house where glove be found again paused a to where be between one o'clock half past two next morning can give evidence whatever gasp of dismay broke from almost one in room be becoming dark when mounted horse said rode straight away be custom a fellow officer will tell when be out of spirit anything have upset to ride away for hour until fit have left have sometimes be out night be so on occasion mounted rode away can not say road took for when ride upon such occasion be absorbed in thought horse go where will of know exactly at what hour got home asked stableman who took horse next morning said clock over stable gate have just struck half past three when rode in know have anything more to say silence be almost oppressive for minute two after have finished then coroner said room will now be cleared of except jury public trooped out in silence man looked in neighbour face to see what thought one ventured upon word until have gone through hall out into garden then broke up in little knot began in low tone to discus scene in dining room shock given by news of murder of miss carne be scarcely greater than have now be caused by proceeding before coroner greater part of present at inquest be personal friend of carnes together with three four farmer having large holding under very few of villager be present being felt that although doubt one have right to admission to inquest be not for folk at carnesford to thrust into affair of family at hold ronald mervyn have like rest left room when be cleared a went out into garden two three of friend be about to speak to turned off with wave of hand paced up down front of house walking slowly with head bent be horribly awkward business for mervyn one of young men who must have spoken to said of course mervyn be innocent still be most unfortunate that ca prove where be most unfortunate repeated then there be that affair of glove quarrel thing look very awkward must say of course believe for moment mervyn did because know know what view jury of stranger might take of two three of others be silent there be present in mind story of hold admitted fact of insanity in family of ronald mervyn be in close connection with carnes have be one else too must have disbelieved possibility of ronald mervyn having murdered margaret carne a be doubted there have be other murder in history of carnes one gave utterance to thought be friend acquaintance of mervyn family ronald might yet be able to clear completely at rate at present one be inclined to admit that there must be doubt of innocence well what do think doctor now lieutenant gulston asked friend a separated from rest strolled across garden quite know what to think dr mackenzie said after pause gulston said in surprise why seems to a clear a sun at day what heard seemed pretty conclusive now there be confirmation of finding of glove cock bull story of riding about for hour not knowing where be yes give due weight to thing doctor said after pause admit that constitute formidable circumstantial evidence ca account for glove being found there admit be certainly awkward fact to get over ride regard a unfortunate rather than damnatory especially if a say fellow officer can prove at time when upset be in habit of going off for hour on horseback who else must have done mackenzie see evidence of doctor went to show that be murdered when asleep common burglar must have taken life needlessly have run risk of hanging whole thing point to fact that be done out of revenge out of ill feeling of sort have not be shown that there be not soul in world except mervyn who have shadow of ill feeling against no have not be shown doctor said quietly one be enemy so far a witness who be asked knew be very different thing be very difficult thing to prove that one in world have enemy miss carne may have have servant may have be discharged upon complaint may have given deep offence to one other there be never saying of course be possible said lieutenant again evidence go against one man who be known to have enmity against who have to say least of taint of insanity in blood what be ground on doubt principally on own statement gulston watched narrowly from time that gave evidence own that impression be that be innocent give weight to evidence that afforded by glove to being unable to prove where be yet alike from face manner tone of voice think that be capable of murder other word be spoken for time then lieutenant asked do think that insane person must commit crime of kind have memory of in saner moment be difficult question gulston do believe that person in sudden paroxysm of madness might commit murder upon recovery be perfectly unconscious of for moment believe that madman sufficiently sane to act with cunning here shown in mode of obtaining access by quiet stealthiness in victim be killed whilst in sleep by attempt to divert suspicion by abstraction of trinket must lose memory of action afterwards if captain mervyn did thing be sure must be conscious of be convinced a said that be not conscious what will jury think lieutenant asked after long pause think be sure to return verdict against coroner jury be not supposed to go to bottom of matter be simply to declare whether there be prima facie evidence connecting one with crime such evidence a be sufficient to justify in coming to conclusion that must at rate be further examined into be very different thing with jury at trial have whole of evidence can be obtained before have light can be thrown on question by counsel on side assistance of summing up of judge have then to decide if guilt of man be absolutely proven coroner jury be not supposed to go into whole merit of case finding mean more than decision of magistrate to commit prisoner for trial think coroner will tell jury that in case such evidence a there be before point to fact that captain mervyn committed murder that will be duty to find such verdict a will ensure case being further gone into most of jury be tenant of carnes gulston said two three of know be for met at inn when be over here fishing will scarcely like to find against relation of family suppose will doctor argued at same time coroner will not improbably point out to that verdict will simply lead to further investigation of case that even for captain mervyn own sake be desirable that must take place for that matter must not possibly rest here be to acquit imagine chief constable must at once arrest bring before magistrate who upon hearing repetition of evidence given to day must have choice to commit for trial suppose must do anyhow lieutenant gulston said not necessarily fancy man can be tried upon finding of coroner jury a well a upon of magistrate perhaps however if coroner jury find against may be formally brought up before magistrate portion of evidence heard sufficient to justify in committing for trial see people be going into house again probably have thrown door open jury be going to give finding think need go in chapter vi ruth powlett lieutenant gulston companion have not long to wait to learn verdict for in few minute people began to pour out of house constable came out after looking round walked up to lieutenant mr gulston said presence will be required to morrow at eleven o'clock at mr volkes captain

crowd have collected by time have come down jury upon being questioned admitted that have found ronald mervyn guilty when fact be grasped sort of awed silence fell upon hearer why be thinking of one of men said why must have be downright mad find captain mervyn be murderer of own cousin mr carne own landlord too never heard tell of such thing jury indeed be regarded almost a culprit even to now

by if see sign of change sprinkle little water on face send for may pour few drop of brandy down throat if breathing continues regular a slow a be at present hing until return for fortnight ruth powlett lay between life death then turned corner very slowly gradually began to recover six week have passed by be about again mere shadow of former self further evidence of kind have be obtained with reference to murder at hold mr mervyn have detective down from london have spent day in calling at village within twenty mile in endeavour to find one who have heard horseman pas between hour of twelve three however failed to do have tracked course of ronald mervyn up to ten o'clock after hour must gather information even reward of fifty pound failed to bring tidings of horseman after hour ronald mervyn have followed circuitous route apparently going quite at random when heard of at ten o'clock be thirteen mile distant must have left ample margin of time for to have ridden to hold carried out design description of margaret carne watch jewellery have be circulated by police throughout england so far none of appeared to have be offered for sale at jeweller pawnbroker in country in south devonshire people be divided into two party on subject of ronald mervyn guilt innocence one remained neutral on subject be absolutely convinced that in spite of appearance be innocent others be equally positive that be guilty former insisted that original hypothesis a to murder be correct one that have be committed by tramp a to impossibility of man having killed margaret carne in sleep declared that there be nothing in one knew tramp be rough subject man might be especially atrocious one anyhow be thousand time more probable that be how came about than ronald mervyn must have murdered cousin other party be ready to admit that be improbable that man must murder cousin fell back upon evidence showed one else have done also upon well known curse upon carne hold fact mervyn on mother side have carne blood in vein one knew argued that mad people murder husband wife child why then not cousin there be similar difference of opinion on subject among little conclave in snuggery at carne arm jacob carey old clerk be of opinion that ronald mervyn be guilty former basing opinion solely upon evidence latter upon curse of carnes landlord maintained diplomatic reserve be not for to offend section of customer by taking decided side therefore contented by saying there be great deal in what say to argument brought forward in coffee room tap room snuggery carne arm be doing larger trade than have ever done before there be two detective staying in house day coach brought load of visitor from plymouth while on saturday monday hundred of people tramped over from railway station coming from plymouth exeter to have view of house where tragedy have taken place pressure of business be indeed so great that landlord have be obliged to take on two extra hand in kitchen to hire three girl from village to attend to customer in coffee room tap room hiram powlett be captain mervyn champion in snuggery be true have few argument to adduce in favour of belief allowed smith reuben claphurst to do greater part of talking while smoked pipe silently always winding up discussion by saying well neighbour ca do much in way of arguing allow what say be right enough for believe captain mervyn to be innocent daughter ruth wo hear word said a to being guilty think with hiram powlett wife have indeed done best to carry out doctor order that nothing must be said in ruth hearing of murder girl a soon a be sufficiently recovered to talk be always asking question a to whether further clue have be discovered a to murderer be indeed so anxious urgent on matter that doctor have felt better to withdraw interdict to allow father to tell little scrap of gossip have picked up idea have evidently got possession of mind hiram doctor said be very attached to mistress be doubt most anxious that murderer will be brought to justice have changed opinion think now that have better not shirk subject have be good deal more feverish again last day two of course must stay here now until after trial will come off in fortnight when be over must strongly recommend to send away from here for time doe matter where go to so that be away from here if have friend relation can send to let go to if not will see about home for convalescent patient where must be taken in there be several of about one at isle of wight believe must suit very well a climate be mild anyhow must not stop here will be heartily glad when trial be over go where will hear nothing else talked about one attends to own business amount of drunkenness in place have trebled if have way must have regulation inflicting heavy fine upon one who after conclusion of trial ventured to make allusion however slight to be disgusting to see number of people who come here day go up hill to have look at house a day for trial approached ruth powlett became more more anxious nervous about kept awake at night brooded on during day for hour must sit with eye fixed upon fire without opening lip doctor became seriously anxious lest must be again laid up before became necessary to give evidence there be indeed terrible fight going on in ruth mind knew that captain mervyn be innocent knew that george forester be guilty yet memory of past life be still so strong in that must not bring to denounce unless became absolutely necessary to do so to save ronald mervyn life ronald have insulted threatened mistress have not george forester be beforehand with might have done grievous harm might perhaps have murdered lieutenant gulston for whom ruth felt strong attraction because have discerned that margaret loved be right then that ronald mervyn must suffer be not right that must be hung if must clear without being obliged to denounce george forester let do so if not if be found guilty then have other course open to must come forward produce knife describe how have found confess why have so long concealed must be very terrible pictured to herself amazement of court disapproval with conduct must be received way in must be blamed by who knew need there must be for going away from home afterwards living somewhere where one must know story not for did ever waver in determination ronald mervyn must be saved from hanging for must be a bad a murderess if kept silent suffered to be executed for crime knew that have not committed still must not do until last thing not till everything else failed must denounce george forester a murderer loved no longer knew that have not be interrupted must perhaps have killed be partly thought of boy girl life of hour have spent together by side of dare softened heart thought of misery of kind old man father understand ruth doctor said one day to mr powlett ought to get better faster than doe of course have have terrible shock quite understand affecting a did just a be recovering from former illness doe not mend a ought to do have lost strength instead of gaining during past week be flushed feverish have hunted look about eye if have known nothing of circumstance of case must have said that have something on mind there be nothing can have on mind hesba powlett replied know have trouble with about good for nothing george forester doctor nodded be pretty well known throughout village how matter stood gave up week week ago just at time went away when be wanted for share have in poaching business up in carne wood told father that saw have be right must have nothing more to say to be week more before have that fall on hill have never heard mention name since feel sure that be not fretting about ruth have always be sensible girl once have made up mind be likely to turn back again must not say that be fretting on account mr powlett fretting in young woman show in lowness of spirit general depression want of tone in case appears to to be rather sort of anxiety though about what can not guess if have be other girl in village must have have suspicion that have taken fancy in way to ronald mervyn be anxious about trial of course be out of question in ruth case doubt be anxious about trial have nervous dread of being obliged to stand up describe scene again in crowded court perhaps be questioned cross questioned be trying thing for one still more so of course for girl whose nerve have be shattered who be in weak debilitated state of health well will be heartily glad when be over settle down into ordinary way what do think will be verdict sir do think will find captain mervyn guilty like to give opinion mr powlett depends so much on jury on way counsel judge put hardly think that evidence be sufficient to hang man there be of course grave ground for suspicion must doubt whether jury must find mervyn guilty upon must be amply sufficient if be merely case of robbery men like to find verdict when there be possibility of finding out too late to save man life that have be mistaken at rate mr powlett do best to keep ruth thought from dwelling on subject wish be summer weather that must sit out in garden of course be not strong enough to be able to walk except for hundred yard so must get to take little turn if be only once round garden now then think must walk if must sir when be speaking other day about getting well enough to go out for walk turned white shivered said did want to go outside door again not for ever so long that fall got seems to have changed altogether well well must get away a said mr powlett want more bracing air than have got here to have wind coming straight off sea else to be in hilly breezy place be sure know how be to be managed ca go by see how be to leave hiram will have to leave hiram for day two take wherever fix upon a best place settle there hiram will get on very well without for day two be more fit to travel alone than baby however must be off keep up spirit a well a can let brood over business at last day when ronald mervyn be to be tried for murder arrived assize be at exeter never in memory of man have there be such numerous application to sheriff other official for seat in court interest in case have extended far beyond limit of devonshire rank in life of victim accused cold blooded nature of murder nature of evidence rendered affair cause celebre pro con of case be discussed far wide story of curse of carne hold have be given at full length by reporter of local paper copied by journal of kingdom fact that madness be hereditary in family went for much in argument of who held captain mervyn be guilty have not be for tide of public feeling must have be distinctly in favour of accused by rest of evidence be inconclusive men who have be jilted not unfrequently use strong language even threat without anything coming of fact of glove having be found where be be certainly suspicious after that in did not count for much glove might have be blown to where be found dog might have picked up carried there dozen explanation possible even if not probable must be given for presence before man must be found guilty of murder upon circumstantial evidence there must be room left for doubt therefore quarrel finding of glove even fact that captain mervyn be unable to prove alibi must scarcely have caused public opinion to decide against have not be for fact of taint of insanity in blood call dog mad hang call man mad public will easily credit with commission of most desperate crime therefore feeling of majority of who assembled at court house at exeter be unfavourable to ronald attitude of prisoner did much to dispel impression be grave a one might well be with such charge hanging over there be nothing moody sombre still le wild in expression looked calmly round court acknowledged encouraging nod given by of fellow officer who have come over to bear witness on point of character who to man believed to be innocent certainly there be nothing to suggest in slightest degree suspicion of madness in appearance many of who have before be impressed by story of family taint now veered round whispered to friend that story of insanity be nonsense that ronald mervyn looked wholly incapable of such crime a of be accused dr arrowsmith have brought ruth over under personal charge a came out when called in trap to take to station be surprised at change have taken place since saw evening before anxious nervous expression of face be gone looked calm composed there be indeed certain determined expression in face led doctor to believe that have by great effort conquered fear of ordeal to be to be exposed have nerved to go through unflinchingly a journeyed in train asked will be in court time doctor ruth think will be in court fancy witness remain in room together until be wanted will be in court a solicitor for defence be personal friend of mine will give place at table do think sir that after have given evidence must let stand there until be done must hardly think so ruth be sure must be very bad thing for have particular reason for wanting to be there dr arrowsmith to hear to end most particular reason ca tell what be must be there doctor looked at in surprise think will not feel suspense a much if be in court a must outside ruth be that what mean be partly sir anyhow feel must be there very well ruth if see in way will do what can for will ask captain hendricks to speak to policeman in court tell to let remain there after have given evidence there will be great crowd know will be very close altogether think be foolish wrong of be sorry think so sir do want to be there happens to afterwards of course can do a like ruth probability be that will faint before have be there five minute will try not to sir think will be only when get sudden shock faint think can get one there chapter vii verdict trial of ronald mervyn for murder of margaret carne be marked by none of unexpected turn sudden surprise that not unfrequently give such dramatic interest to proceeding effort of police have failed in unearthing fact must throw new light upon subject evidence brought forward be almost identical with given at coroner inquest counsel asked great many question elicited new fact of importance only witness called for defence be a to character one after officer of mervyn regiment came forward to testify that be eminently popular that have never observed in sign of madness said that at time got out of spirit be in habit of withdrawing from society on occasion not infrequently went for long ride be absent many hour be perhaps what might be called little queer certainly not in slightest degree mad old servant of family many neighbour gave testimony to same effect dr arrowsmith testified that have attended from childhood that have never seen sign of insanity in word action ruth have escaped one question dreaded whether have seen anything in room must afford clue to discovery of perpetrator of crime have thought question over hundred time have pondered over answer must give be firmly resolved not to tell actual lie to evade question by replying that when recovered sens made straight to door without looking round if forced to reply directly to refuse to answer whatever consequence might be be then with sigh of deep relief that left witness box took up station at point to policeman made way for a did so however whispered think have better go out girl think be fit place for look like to drop now shook head silently took up station in corner grasping in one hand something done up in many fold of paper in pocket same question have be asked other witness by counsel for defence have made considerable point of fact that constable dr arrowsmith testified that candle be standing one on side of looking glass although room have be carefully searched half burnt match have be discovered in address for defence have animadverted strongly upon point be dark night gentleman dark night in november will remember have evidence that whoever committed murder must have moved about room noiselessly evidence show that murderer drew down clothes so gently softly that did not awaken sleeper now a intelligent men can not agree with that man must have made way about absolutely dark room with table furniture carried out murder in way stated without making noise must be utter impossibility what be conclusion be either provided with light be forced to strike match light candle in latter case must have be provided with silent match noise must have awakened sleeper of one thing may be sure captain mervyn have not provided with silent match even have not sound of ordinary match being struck awakened sleeper surely sudden light must have done so ask from own experience whether however soundly might be sleeping effect of candle being lit in room must not awaken therefore think safe to assume that in first place because match be found in second place because have candle be lit must assuredly have awakened sleeper know that be not awakened that candle be lighted in room how then did assassin manage after entering room to avoid dressing table chair other furniture to see to manipulate bedclothes so gently that sleeper be not awakened why gentleman by mean of implement carried by professional burglar mean of course dark lantern opening shade slightly carefully abstaining from throwing light towards bed burglar must make way towards showing sufficient light to carry out diabolical purpose then opening freely to examine room open trinket box carry away valuable counsel for prosecution gentleman have not even ventured to suggest that prisoner captain mervyn be possessed of such article course have be traced through village that rode up to ten o'clock at night by time shop have long be closed have stopped anywhere to buy article must surely have heard of therefore gentleman maintain that even if fact stood alone ought to convince of innocence of prisoner in reply counsel for prosecution have admitted that weight must be attached to point that be quite possible that entered window might have felt on table until found candlestick lit stooping down behind table at bottom of bed so shading with coat that light must not fall on face of sleeper a for point made that match have be found no great weight must be attached to prisoner might have put in pocket thrown out of window when defence be concluded counsel for prosecution rose to speak feeling in court be still against prisoner in have be said evidence pointed against only a author of crime hint of suspicion have be dropped against other person manner in crime have be committed indicated strongly that be act of person actuated by jealousy animosity rather than of mere burglar view of case be strongly brought out by counsel for prosecution theory of prosecution be said not that unfortunate gentleman while in full possession of sens slew lady to whom be nearly related for whom have long cherished sincere affection character have heard given by so many witness must certainly seem to show to be man incapable of such crime theory be that latent taint of insanity in blood that insanity a have heard from dr arrowsmith other witness be hereditary in ancestor on mother side have before now caused calamity almost if not quite a serious a suddenly flamed out believe that a have be shown by witness galloped away many mile over country believe that at last wrought up to highest pitch of frenzy returned scaled wall opened window murdered miss carne have heard that be subject to moody fit when shunned society fit wild ride have heard of be symptom of disordered mind perhaps have gone happily with malady must not have shown in more serious form unfortunately a know there be sharp sudden unhappiness such unhappiness a try fibre even of sanest men might well have struck fatal blow to mind be not because see now calm possessed that be to conclude that theory be mistaken one many even most dangerous madman have long interval when apparently sanity be a perfect a of other people then suddenly sometimes altogether without warning change take place quiet possessed man becomes dangerous lunatic perhaps murderer such gentleman be theory of prosecution will of course weigh carefully in mind will be duty if agree with to give expression to opinion in verdict judge summed up case with great care after going through evidence piecemeal told jury while counsel for defence have insisted upon uncertainty of circumstantial evidence numerous instance of error have resulted from be duty to tell that in majority of case of murder there must be from nature of thing only circumstantial evidence to go upon for men did not commit murder in open street in sight of other people at same time when circumstantial evidence alone be forthcoming be necessary that must be of most conclusive character that jury must before finding verdict of guilty be convinced that fact showed that be prisoner only who must have done deed be for gentleman to decide whether evidence have be submitted to doe prove absolutely conclusively to mind that prisoner must have be man who murdered miss carne counsel on side have alluded to unquestioned fact that madness be hereditary in family of prisoner whether not be inherited by be also for to decide in considering verdict will have to conclude first whether prisoner did did not commit murder if believe that did so that while did so be insane incapable of governing action duty will be to find not guilty upon ground of insanity general tenor of summing up certainly showed that in opinion of judge evidence although strong must not be considered a absolutely conclusive still bias be not strongly expressed when jury retired opinion in court be nearly equally divided a to what verdict must be when left witness box dr arrowsmith made way to corner in one of policeman have placed ruth after giving evidence have done with steadiness composure have surprised doctor have fortunately escaped much questioning for counsel saw how fragile weak looked a have entered room seen mistress dead fainted left again there be little to ask question put be be jewellery safe in box when left room night before did remember whether window be fastened not to reply be negative miss carne have shut when went up in afternoon have not noticed whether be fastened be blind venetian ordinary roller blind roller blind then if window opened must be pushed aside without noise did notice whether candlestick be standing where have left noticed that be on table in about same place where be standing night before must not say exactly want to go out ruth dr arrowsmith said when reached after jury have retired may be hour more before make up mind be a white a death child let lead out ruth shook head murmured must stay doctor shrugged shoulder returned to seat be hour half before door opened foreman of jury entered a be unaccompanied be evident wanted to ask question lord said be unanimous a to one part of verdict ca agree about other how do mean sir judge asked want to know what be unanimous about understand what mean about being unanimous about one part of verdict not unanimous on other foreman hesitated then to astonishment of court prisoner broke in in clear steady voice will not accept acquittal sir on ground of insanity be not mad if have be event of last two month must have driven so demand that verdict be guilty not guilty judge be too surprised to attempt to check prisoner when first began to speak although attempted to do so before have finished interruption be ineffectual go back sir judge then said to foreman must be unanimous a to whole of verdict interruption of prisoner have enlightened in court a to nature of foreman question undoubtedly have divined rightly jury be in favour of verdict not guilty of must have added on ground of insanity interruption although irregular if not unprecedented have favourable effect upon hearer quickness with accused have seized point steady resolute voice in have spoken told in favour many who before have be in jury box must have returned verdict of not guilty on ground of insanity now doubted whether must add concluding word quarter of hour later jury returned be now unanimous lord say that prisoner at bar be not guilty sound like sigh of relief went through court then one got up there be movement to door policeman lifted bar ronald mervyn stepped out free man in moment be surrounded by number of fellow officer while of neighbour also pressed forward to shake by hand will shake hand with man said drawing back will greet man so long a cloud hang over so long a be unproved who murdered margaret carne mean mervyn will think better of in few day one of fellow officer said a emerged into open air what have gone through have be awful trial now that be proved to be innocent will get over be not proved to be innocent though be not proved to be guilty have given benefit of doubt to end of life world will believe did do think must go through life to be pointed at a man who murdered cousin must rather blow out brain to night will never see again till verdict of guilty have be passed on wretch who murdered cousin good bye know that believe innocent will not take hand now when think over will see a well a do that must have man in regiment against whom men a passed must whisper beurderer god bless ronald mervyn turned walked rapidly away one two of officer must have followed colonel stopped leave alone lad leave alone must feel a doe be in place good heaven how must have suffered still be right however much pity can not think otherwise at present moment be clear that must not remain in regiment a soon a crowd have turned away dr arrowsmith made way to point where ruth have be standing somewhat to surprise found still on foot be leaning back in corner with eye closed tear streaming down cheek come dear said putting arm under hers let be moving thank god have ended right thank god indeed doctor murmured have hardly hoped yet have prayed so much that might be so doctor found that though able to stand while supported by wall ruth be unable to walk with aid of policeman supported from court placed in vehicle took to hotel there dear said when ruth have be assisted up to bedroom by two of maid now go to bed lie there till to morrow morning will have basin of strong sent up presently be quite out of question thinking of going home to night have several friend in town be glad of excuse to stay over night will call for at ten o'clock in morning train go at half past ten will have breakfast sent up here will go down to station now there be lot of people over here from carnesford will send messenger back to mother saying that have got through better than expected wanted to have night rest will be home in morning thank doctor be kind of ruth murmured help into bed girl have be ill have have very trying day ask question just get into bed a soon a can then doctor went downstairs ordered broth glass of sherry for ruth bedroom for then went off to see friend in morning be surprised when ruth came downstairs to see how much better looked prescription have done good ruth be glad to see look wonderfully better brighter feel so sir went to sleep directly have taken broth wine sent up did not wake till called at half past eight have not slept for hour together for week feel a if there be such load taken off mind why ruth did know captain mervyn to speak to did that must feel such interest in doctor said looking at sharply sir have never once spoken to that know of then why do care so much about being acquitted must have be dreadful if have be found guilty when be innocent time then one knew be innocent for certain doctor said felt sure be innocent ruth replied why did feel sure ruth ca exactly say sir did feel that be innocent doctor looked puzzled at moment cab arrived at station subject be not renewed doctor afterwards wondered to more than once whether ruth must have particular reason for assurance of ronald mervyn innocence for ten day mervyn trial be great topic of conversation throughout country verdict be canvassed with almost a much keenness heat a crime have be before trial now that ronald mervyn be longer in hazard of life feeling of pity have before told so strongly in favour be wanting if man so far forgets a to use threat to woman must not be surprised if get into trouble of course now jury have given verdict of not guilty there be more to be said there be doubt be very lucky fellow jury have given benefit of doubt still if have done who have killed margaret carne such be general opinion although ronald have still staunch adherent in own neighbourhood tide of feeling ran against two month after trial mr mervyn died broken down by grief while naturally caused renewal of talk heightened rather than otherwise feeling against son general verdict be that be doing whether killed margaret carne not there be doubt that have killed mother be doubtless unfair be not unnatural only who believed thoroughly in ronald innocence felt how hard additional pain must be for immediately funeral be over two girl moved away to london house be advertised to let odour of recent tragedy hung over one cared to take house with story be connected month two later there be sale of furniture house be then shut up lost to county ten day after trial be announced in gazette ronald mervyn have retired from service upon sale of commission one have seen after have left court free man horse be sold week later other belonging forwarded from regiment to address gave in london mother sister have few day later gone up for day to town have met there have already written to that intended to go abroad did not seek to combat resolution can never come back mother unless be cleared up must feel a well a do can not show face anywhere be surprised have got off indeed if be not that be sure never got off horse that night must sometimes suspect must for time have be really mad have done what accuse of have already sent down detective to village there must be clue to if one must only hit upon own at present see where be to be looked for believe that be done by passing tramp agree with word be said at trial in respect everything point to fact that be deliberately murdered though who except must have entertained feeling of animosity against margaret god only know there be one comfort mother only one said with hard laugh can set mind at ease on one point have never felt sure about before be have not inherited curse of carnes have done so last two month must have made raving lunatic of whereas have never felt head cooler reason clearer than have since day be arrested must grieve for more than can help mother now that be over feel more for girl than do for have sort of conviction that somehow though see how thing will be cleared up day anyhow mean to go lead rough life somewhere to keep from brooding over weight will really fall upon far more than upon must strongly advise to shut up house let if can come up here settle in place brighton hastings where story will be soon forgotten one will associate name with terrible business about time stranger arrived at carnesford announced that be carpenter from north that suffered from weak lung have be recommended to live down south after staying for week at carne arm stated that liked village so much that must settle there if saw chance of making livelihood a happened that there be carpenter in village idea be received with favour week later be established in cottage happened to be vacant a be man who seemed to have travelled about england good deal be well spoken informed soon took good position in place be even admitted to form one of party in snuggery where must talk well upon occasion be specially popular a excellent listener when spring came there be fresh sensation gardener at hold in digging up ground at edge of shrubbery to plant rhododendron there turned up missing watch jewellery of margaret carne be buried together few inch below soil without wrapper covering of kind captain hendricks arrived at carnesford a soon a news of discovery reached reginald carne be away having be absent ever since trial took place most of servant have left at once old cook niece of hers alone remaining in charge two stableman from garden also staying in house nothing came of discovery of course renewed interest in mystery of margaret carne death general opinion be that be fortunate indeed for ronald mervyn that discovery have not be made before trial for completely demolished theory that murder be work of burglar be possible of course that man knowing active hue cry must be set on foot that must be dangerous to offer jewellery for sale still more dangerous to keep about have at once buried intending to go back

eye must see be nothing succession of bare sandy flat beyond hill sprinkled with bush occasional clump of aloe elephant tree upon following morning troop marched followed by waggon containing baggage provision drawn by ten ox little naked boy marched at head of ox a guide be driven by hottentot armed with tremendous whip of immense length made of plaited hide fastened to top of bamboo pole after

kei river so doe nominally other said country a far a be declared to be forfeited in point of fact kaffir remained in possession of land on condition that declared allegiance to crown that chief be made responsible for cattle other robbery spoor of must be traced to kraal of course agreed to a in fact must agree to anything resolving naturally to break condition a soon a suited local magistrate commissioner be scattered about among there have be lot of school missionary station started say that be having great success well will see about in last war so called christian native be among first

must move have at last to drive whole lot down with aid of native two picked up on way however there have be pretty good order along frontier for last two year partly due to chief having to pay for cattle traced to kraal partly to fact that have got four hundred kaffir police uncommon smart lot of fellow be scattered along frontier instead of being like kept principally in town see be considered more a military body of course have much easier time of than if be knocking about in small party among border settlement there be lot more excitement in sort of life hope that if there be trouble will send out to protect settlement hope so ronald said cordially barrack life at dull little town be slowest thing in world must never have enlisted for sort of thing well if what settler say turn out right will have plenty of excitement can tell be in last war know want to go through for beggar fight great deal too well for to be pleasant can tell job of carrying despatch escorting waggon through

voyage on line of march ronald quickness alacrity acquaintance with duty convinced that adjutant supposition be correct one by jove twentyman officer of st said a be standing beside when ronald rode up delivered message fellow of yours be wonderfully well mounted be fine soldierly looking fellow too know why face seems quite familiar to fancy have be officer captain twentyman replied have several in corp men who have be obliged for reason other to sell out who finding nothing else to do have enlisted with see pay be good deal higher than be in regular cavalry men a whole be superior class for see find own horse uniform so life be altogether more pleasant than regular service for man of kind almost men be of respectable family certainly seem to know face said officer thoughtfully although where saw have not least idea what be name enlisted a harry blunt doubt be not real name very few men of kind who enlist in army do so under own name know one of name officer said certainly fancy have

marching reached destination country be fertile one farmhouse be frequent most of embedded in orchard vineyard showing sign of comfort prosperity be first place have seen since reached colony ronald said to trooper riding next to where must care about settling there be good many similar spot in part of country man said believe folk here be everywhere doing well must do better if be not for native trouble suffered lot in last war will of course bear brunt of if native break out again there be good many english scotch settler in part there be of course dutch a rule go in more for cattle farming on big scale besides care about english neighbour be unsociable set of brute dutch keep to a much a possible chapter ix outbreak a be possible that detachment might remain for time in present quarter lieutenant daniel at once set to work to erect couple of hut capable of holding ten men several of farmer sent two three of native labourer to assist in cutting bringing to spot timber for framework supplying straw for thatching roof operation be not long one wall be made with wattle plastered with mud work be accomplished in couple of day men be glad of shelter for although heat be very great during day night be cold sharp horse be picketed behind hut officer took up quarter at farmhouse hundred yard away once housed men have little to do for in daytime there be fear of kaffir coming down on plundering expedition such attempt being only made at night when evening fell saddle be placed on horse men lay down in clothes simply taking off jacket jack boot so a to be in readiness to turn out at moment alarm sometimes rode out in small party patrolling whole country not with idea of finding cattle thief merely to give confidence to settler whose kaffir servant be sure to give intelligence to friend in bush of presence of mounted rifle in neighbourhood when have be there fortnight heard that governor have come to king williamstown have summoned various chief to assemble there have come with exception of paramount chief sandilli have assured governor of fidelity sworn allegiance anew ratified by kissing stick of peace governor be so satisfied with assurance that issued reply to petition of colonist saying that report throughout british kaffraria be most satisfactory that chief be astonished at sudden arrival of troop that hoped to arrest of kaffir who have spread alarming report governor gave solemn assurance to of settler who have left farm that there be occasion for alarm commission however appointed by to investigate numerous complaint of settler speedily forwarded to such alarming account of critical state of affair that again left for frontier taking with from cape town rd regiment detachment of artillery proclamation be at once issued for establishment of police force enrolment of new levy of corp of volunteer for self defence so a to leave whole of military at liberty for operation one day towards end of november ronald comrade have ridden twelve mile out of station when saw young lady on horseback riding towards drew rein when reached have have fifty cattle driven off in night said of neighbour have followed trail be riding over to report fact to officer can report ronald said save trouble of riding further if like will ride back with first see if can be of service be afraid will be use girl said will be in wood before can be overtaken then know there will be nothing to do to report where trail ended wait for chance of getting compensation from chief by time be galloping back with tale be similar to score of others have heard since arrival in valley knew that there be slight chance of recovering trail order being stringent that be on account to enter bush cattle therefore be a good a lost for be well aware that in present state of thing there be little prospect of receiving compensation from chief party found indeed upon arrival at farmhouse be large comfortable one furnished in english style that neighbour have returned having traced spoor of stolen cattle up to edge of bush farmer came out to door a daughter rode up come in said to trooper have refreshment rascal have got away again expect that be of old servant for knew trick of fastening have have put to gate of cattle kraal must certainly have puzzled of kaffir now sit down make yourselves at home other settler be already seated at table that hottentot a be always called tottie servant have laid with profusion of food young lady still in blue riding habit did not sit down to table moved about seeing that tottie girl attended to want of guest be ronald thought about eighteen year old have graceful active figure so common among girl who spend much of time on horseback be strikingly pretty expression of delicacy refinement be unusual among daughter of colonial farmer be not surprised at when glanced at father who be fine looking man with gray moustache be always glad to see uniform again said presently to ronald served when be young man be ensign in rifle at waterloo got tired of soldiering in time of peace came out to cape thirty year ago so can well understand be fond of sight of uniform again especially that of corp be nearly colour of own well have have pretty nearly enough of cape intend in year two to go back home have moved good many time a may imagine since came out like running away besides just at present must get nothing for farm can imagine that farm be rather drug in market just now ronald replied especially at edge of frontier however must hope that trouble will blow over now that governor be a hear coming round with rd kaffir may think better of think have made up mind to give little trouble settler said witch doctor umlanjeni have be stirring up with sort of prediction sandilli who doubt set to work have know be intriguing with other chief sudden disappearance of kaffir servant from farm of part of country be of course in obedience to order be certainly ominous say that there be altogether three thousand musket six million round of ball cartridge million assagai in hand of native have be suicidal business allowing trade in firearm ammunition to be carried on with wish that talkative fool at cape town who manage affair be located down on frontier might learn sense then a to way of dealing with native worst sign of be that a have heard to day from of hottentot order have be given by umlanjeni to slay eat to slay eat ronald repeated in surprise what doe mean sir ah question show have not be long in colony settler said know kaffir live at ordinary time entirely upon vegetable diet be custom upon approach of war to eat meat believing that flesh give courage ferocity however a be only three week ago that chief swore to be peaceable faithful hardly think that there be danger of outbreak for time to come perhaps not for month see be just midsummer now crop be nearly fit for cutting sent most of cattle away fortnight since when have got crop in will shut up house move into grahamstown have many friend there will stop there until see what come of business when be over will dispose of farm think there be real danger here have always be on excellent term with native anta who be chief of tribe in part often come down here begs bottle of cape smoke pound of tobacco have smoked many pipe in room treacherous a people be can not think that must allow men to do harm generally address a white brother active conversation be at same time going on between other guest who be discussing farm at must be best for neighbour to assemble in case of attack settler whose name be armstrong have placed ronald next while comrade be at other end of table being only seat vacant at table when entered ronald settler chatted quietly together for time mary armstrong who have taken place leaning on back of father chair when have seen guest attended to occasionally joined in mr armstrong be pleased with guest hope next time when ride over in direction will call in again said can assure that will be heartily glad to see if can get leave off duty for night to put up be real pleasure to to have chat with one fresh from england to hear how thing look after year why will hardly know country again cut up a seems to be with railway after meal be over ronald friend rode back to quarter be nice looking little girl trooper said a rode away from house say father be richest man in part that owns lot of property at cape if be must live there instead of in out of way place suppose be fond of country life ronald replied ignoring first part of remark must think that society in cape town be not very interesting know that other replied know that if have money enough to settle down there must find many hour knocking about here a trooper be matter of taste ronald replied when be at home lived in country prefer to town like active life in open air better than anything cape town must give be nice young fellow mary man in cape rifle mr armstrong said to daughter same evening must say be altogether above position think so know that thought much about father yes suppose be like ordinary soldier not at mary not at fancy from what have heard that there be good many young men of decent family serving in corp be thousand time better for young fellow who be got money interest to come out here than to stay at home breaking heart in trying to get something to do yes must say from talk especially from tone of voice that have seen better day be pity colony ca afford to keep on foot four five regiment of mounted rifle must not hear much of native trouble if did native be much more afraid of than of soldier wonder in first place be more accustomed to country in second place be armed with weapon will kill at considerable distance while brown be be of use at over hundred yard well hope that young fellow will drop in again must like chat with be pleasant change to meet one who be willing to talk on subject other than native crop cattle week later ronald be sent with despatch to king williamstown there will be answer blunt lieutenant daniel said a handed to at least answer of consequence so can stay day in town if like thank sir a care for town will if will allow stop on way back at mr armstrong be where cattle be stolen other day will not be far out of way from king williamstown invited to stay there for day if must get leave certainly can do so lieutenant said can hear if there be news of kaffir stirring in neighbourhood seem to have be bit more quiet for last week so two day later ronald drew rein in front of mr armstrong house late in afternoon have taken at word mr armstrong said a farmer came to door be glad to see other said cordially be not mere flying visit hope will be able to stay with till to morrow thank yes be not due at station till to morrow evening be own master till then have be carrying despatch to williamstown have have of kaffir police here to day farmer said to while be at supper what do think of seem smart fellow well up to duty so far a can see be just sort of men for border police work yes mr armstrong agreed on other border to mind be much too closely related to fellow in bush to be trustworthy be well enough for following up trail arresting stray thief must dare say be quite reliable if opposed to tribe to be not akin doubt whether will stand to if there be trouble with sandilli macomo rest of see how powerful influence of chief be when order came pretty nearly kaffir in colony left instantly many of leaving considerable arrears of wage behind if tribal tie be so strong that men entirely beyond reach of chief come home instant be summoned how can be expected that kaffir in police force will fight against own kindred doe not seem reasonable to expect thing certainly ronald agreed can not think why did not raise force among fingoes be just a fine race a kaffir speak same language yet be bitterly hostile to yes must have be better mr armstrong said think that there be prejudice against fingoes in first place be not powerful people like gaikas galega basuto good many of have escaped from chief who held in subjection came in loafed about colony a kaffir be given to thieving drunkenness whenever get chance colonist looked down upon more than upon other native not that there be reason for doing so except that saw more of for kaffir be same in respect do think be safe stopping here mr armstrong ronald asked have be talking of various cattle stealing raid have taken place at various point of frontier still think so for present by new year day will have got crop in then will go into town a told must in meantime five six of nearest neighbour have agreed to move in here have largest farm hereabout must stand stout siege be glad to hear that mr armstrong same thing have be done in good many place in way must be quite safe quite think kaffir capable of coming down in small party attacking isolated house murdering occupant after late protestation of fidelity can not believe that chief must permit anything like large party to sally out to make war be idea be treacherous hound there be never trusting if can manage to send one of fingoes off with news to may be sure will be with in shortest possible time will soon make mincemeat of be too sure of say in open must stand against force of cavalry anywhere approaching own number can tell that in bush consider be fully match for troop man to man what chance have soldier with clothes fifty sixty pound weight on back who go crashing along through bush snapping twig with heavy boot against native who can crawl along stark naked without making slightest noise who give first intimation of presence by shot from behind tree stab with spear when came out here have naturally same idea a have scoffed at notion of naked savage standing up against regular soldier can tell have changed opinion if tribe under sandilli be really in earnest promise that will want five time a many troop a have got in colony to tackle two day later message arrived with order to lieutenant daniel to rejoin with detachment at once on th of december whole of troop in albany british kaffraria be assembled moved under commander in chief towards amatolas object being to overawe gaikas without resorting to force be to be carefully avoided troop consisted of th rd rd regiment cape mounted rifle altogether about strong with two division

put prisoner to death with atrocious torture anyhow friend owe life to for sooner later end must have come to now what be going to do think of pushing on further hope think must be useless ronald said massacre be apparently universal evidently began at same time along line must be too late to warn one now still said rising suddenly from seat might not be too late to rescue there may be other party holding out have thought of have better push on further doubt if horse can go further one of men said mine must scarcely carry for last five mile yes be so ronald said think horse be good for twenty

to first place have visited here found that kaffir after have left have made determined attack upon place have be beaten off with much loss after several hour fighting settler be now however occupied in preparing to leave farm a attack might at moment be renewed perhaps with overwhelming number party of mounted police remained in village until following morning a horse after heavy work on previous day be not fit to take long journey back to camp on following morning saw settler fairly on way then galloped off to rejoin corp at fort cox a ascended piece of rising ground within mile of fort obtained fair view of reined in horse simultaneously fort appeared silent deserted at distance of few hundred yard from must see large number of men moving about be not soldier ronald exclaimed must be kaffir by jove place be absolutely besieged look at puff of smoke yes there can be doubt about expect column have gone out again kaffir be trying to take before return well lad be too late in afternoon now for to do anything have better ride back two three mile then camp for night in morning must try find out what have taken place where troop have got to agreed that be best plan accordingly rode quietly back a for aught must tell keen eye might be upon did not attempt to halt until be quite dark when turned off at right angle to former course after riding for about mile encamped in clump of bush have plenty of cold meat with for settler have before starting filled haversack there be therefore occasion to light fire indeed must in case have done a must kaffir catch sight of light must assuredly bring overpowering force down upon will have two out on sentry relieve guard hour ronald said can eat meal in comfort first there be fear of coming down upon at present at rate manner in have led in attack on kaffir have greatly impressed men yielded a ready willing obedience a if corporal have be officer after meal be over ronald placed sentry on side of bush will relieve at end of hour said keep ear open will go out for bit reconnoitre mind shoot a come back will give low whistle like when get near if hear one approaching doe whistle challenge shout too loud might be heard by kaffir who may be in search of if answer challenge again then step into bush if come on be sure be man fire fire if have slightest doubt for might be stray animal rifle might bring kaffir down on during greater part of night ronald moved about keeping about hundred yard from clump returning hour to see sentry changed towards morning having heard nothing to lead to suppose that there be kaffir in neighbourhood returned to bush threw down for couple of hour sleep at daybreak be in saddle again approaching a near a dared to fort concealed presently succeeded in capturing kaffir woman who be out collecting stick one of troop knew little of language from learnt that greater part of soldier have marched away on previous morning also gathered direction have taken keeping up vigilant look out rode in direction presently met detachment of st own troop of rifle marching back to fort cox force be under command of colonel somerset colonel of cape mounted rifle captain twentyman to whom ronald reported rode forward at once to colonel with news that fort cox be invested by enemy ronald be sent for questioned a to strength of kaffir said that owing to position from have seen only commanded view of portion of ground there appeared to to be seven eight hundred men so far a must see of course there might have be double force on other side well think ought to push forward at once colonel said to officer commanding infantry governor be in fort force for defence be very small one at rate must try to relieve troop be halted for hour a news soon spread that kaffir be beleaguering fort cox that must probably have to fight way through formed up with alacrity a soon a order be given cape mounted rifle went out in skirmishing order ahead of infantry keeping vigilant look out for lurking foe men have learned from ronald party of massacre at border settlement be burning with impatience to get at enemy after marching two mile column came to spot where broad belt of wood extended across country a mounted men approached several assagai be hurled from bush cavalry replied with rifle then fell back upon infantry who advanced with cheer against wood cavalry be dismounted handing horse to comrade advanced on foot ronald be one of who remained behind keeping up heavy fire at invisible foe st advanced into wood trooper with horse listened anxiously to sound of fray rattle of musketry loud report of kaffir rifle shrill yell amid british cheer must be occasionally heard be hot work in there corporal lieutenant daniel said too hot to be pleasant must say judging by yelling wood must be full of kaffir must think so too sir ronald agreed fancy kaffir be capable of doing immense amount of yelling still a say wood must be full of to make such terrific noise a that quarter of hour passed then rifle emerged from wood with horse at once galloped forward to meet soon be in saddle ronald heard captain twentyman who have led dismounted party say to lieutenant there be too many of daniel wood be crowded with take troop draw off to right will take other half to left st will fall back directly a come out prepare to charge kaffir in flank if pursue now redcoat began to appear at edge of wood be in pair two men be carrying wounded comrade presently main body came out in regular order with face to enemy with yell of triumph kaffir poured out from wood rifle fidgeted in saddle for order to charge lieutenant daniel have eye upon other wing of troop captain twentyman did not give order to advance until saw that kaffir be so far out upon plain that must not get back to wood before must be upon then gave order to charge a men got into motion lieutenant daniel gave same order a saw cavalry sweeping down colonel somerset gave word st poured tremendous volley into kaffir moment later two body of cavalry swept down on flank with yell of fear kaffir ran for wood number of be cut down before must gain shelter then cavalry fell back joined infantry be found there have be desperate hand to hand struggle bayonet against assagai two officer twenty private have be killed great many of men wounded afterwards learned that kaffir loss in killed have exceeded two hundred party then fell back rejoined colonel mackinnon there be now anxious consultation when be decided that a fort cox must probably resist attack of enemy must be better not to attempt advance to relief until junction have be effected with other column be now at considerable distance away on st news reached that morning governor with small body of cape mounted rifle have made dash right through enemy have ridden to king williamstown twelve mile away where have at once issued proclamation calling upon colonist to rise en masse to assist troop to expel gaikas from amatolas while force of fingoes be at once ordered to be raised in meantime kaffir be plundering destroying over country settler entirely abandoned farm road to williamstown grahamstown beaufort be blocked with great herd of cattle driven in news came that gaikas have be joined by tbelambies tambookies numbering not le than men be reported that influential chief kairie who must put men in field be preparing to make common cause with rebel hottentot of london missionary station at cat river who have for year be fed clothed by government put into free possession of beautiful fertile district joined kaffir took leading part in attack on settler example be speedily followed by so called christian hottentot at missionary settlement of shiloh theopolis against such overpowering force a be now leagued against governor must hing with small body of troop at disposal be forced to remain inactive at williamstown until reinforcement must arrive contented therefore with throwing supply into fort cox white hare being accomplished only after severe contest with native body of kaffir have now completely overrun colony rendering even communication between town dangerous in extreme unless sent by messenger escorted by considerable body of troop on arriving at king williamstown ronald mervyn be greatly disappointed to find that armstrong have gone on to grahamstown found letter awaiting from mr armstrong saying that be very sorry to leave without opportunity of thanking for immense service have rendered said daughter now that be over be terribly shaken by have gone through think necessary to get to place little further removed from trouble will probably leave for england before long hope to see before go if not will write to giving address in england will be very glad to see if return a hope will that before long will never forget how much owe perhaps be better so ronald said a finished letter must only have made harder for if have seen again for if there be one thing more certain than be that can never ask woman to be wife cape town rifle be before long joined by two troop from cape town elizabeth town be continually employed in escorting convoy carrying despatch batch of twenty recruit also came up to fill vacancy have already be made by war to bring troop engaged up to full force one of four men who joined captain twentyman troop gave slight start of surprise a eye fell upon ronald mervyn looked at several time slight smile stole across face who be that corporal asked one of trooper corporal blunt man said fine fellow be too led small detachment of men splendidly in affair down by kabousie river why do ask have ever seen before man said carelessly reminded of one knew at home be first rate soldier man said expect will get first vacancy among sergeant think have be officer though never talk about be best tempered fellow possible can never get to talk about past however that make difference to not bit recruit agreed dare say be only one with queer history in regiment did say have queer history man replied angrily be a good comrade a good fellow a one want to meet there be not man in troop grudge being pushed on meant offence recruit said man reminded of have queer history suppose be what put into head well if want head punched have better say nothing against blunt trooper grumbled either in hearing out of recruit turned away occupied in grooming horse be rum start said to who must have thought of meeting captain mervyn out here saw in one of paper soon after came out account of trial wonder how must have felt if have be standing in place so have changed name suppose arrived at cape when be up country must have enlisted at once for be nearly three month since joined depot draft have only sailed day before at rate be not likely will know not that must do harm if did still be always useful to know man to know something against especially when doe know if ever get into row can put screw on nicely a recruit who have enlisted in name of jim smith have expected must be case ronald mervyn eye showed sign of recognition a fell upon face thought new recruit be strapping fellow must be good man to have beside one in hand to hand fight with kaffir beyond gave further thought considerable number of fingo ally have now arrived at king williamstown have idea whatever of discipline looked bit a wild a kaffir foe there be doubt be ready to fight for be eager to be led against kaffir who have so long kept in slavery have be armed with musket carried heavy knobkerrie at present have nothing to do to sleep eat to dance war dance to get drunk whenever must obtain sufficient money to indulge in luxury be accompanied by wife who not only waited upon cooked for earned money by going out into wood bringing in bundle of faggot number of hottentot woman be engaged upon same work while men of same tribe looked after great herd of cattle furnished driver for waggon helped in commissariat store so far a lazy nature permitted made useful if be general ronald said one day to sergeant menzies must have hottentot about place believe that be in league with enemy look how went over from missionary station farmer tell left in majority of case on day before massacre be quite evident that kaffir somehow always get information of movement how must have laid that ambush for at keiskamma river if have not known column be going way how be be ready to attack detachment went with provision to fort must not have be from own people for not kaffir have be near since trouble began believe be hateful little hottentot be hateful sergeant said whether be traitor not except bushman do believe that be most disgusting race on face of earth with stunted body yellow face filthy disgusting way know must turn out of camp if be general must certainly order to be washed if get dozen of on windy side of be enough to make sick wonder kaffir did exterminate little brute ronald mervyn said suppose must have done if have not be for dutch first afterwards missionary made pet of nice pet have turned out be just same thing in india be very dreg of people missionary always pick up with chapter xi attack on waggon train sergeant blunt will take detachment of fourteen men ride down to port elizabeth escort waggon back here there will be party of native levy to come back with so that with party will make pretty strong force dangerous point be of course addoo bush be hear full of kaffir villain going down will pas through by daylight travelling fast there be fear of interfering with party like yours coming back fingoes will let know of danger must hardly think that native will venture to attack so strong party still a waggon will be laden with ammunition fellow always seem in way other to know exactly what be going on can not be too careful very well sir will do best in matter hour later ronald started with detachment travelled rapidly reached port elizabeth on third day after starting without adventure waggon be not ready to start for heavy sea be setting in boat must not continue work of unloading ship have arrived with ammunition two day before ronald after seeing that horse be well cared for ration served out cooking commenced strolled down to beach to watch heavy surf breaking on shore encampment of native levy be on shore white officer be inspecting arm when ronald arrived stood for time watching motley group of fingoes of be in blanket others in karosses of cow skin many with feather stuck in hair grinning highly amused at effort of officer to get to stand in regular line to hold musket at even slope on shoulder of wife be looking on laughing others be squatting about by shelter have erected cooking mealie for dinner officer who be quite young man seeing ronald looking on said ruefully think there be making soldier out of fellow sergeant think must be better for if must sir ronald said fellow will fight after own fashion think amount of drill must improve in slightest in fact must only puzzle confuse to try to teach discipline must skirmish with kaffir in kaffir fashion when come to regular fighting must be done by troop can expect of native levy be that will act a scout find out where enemy be hiding prevent surprise pursue when have defeated do not try to drill up at front not at sir must be quite useless to attempt so that attend on parade in right number own head man look after nothing more be expected of march in straggling body anyhow when come to fighting fight in own way very useful way be well be very glad to hear say so sergeant have be doing best can to give idea of drill have a see failed altogether have order except to take command of fellow supposed be expected to drill to extent still if say have given up a hopeless in front need not bother about think need sir can assure that attempt be made to drill in way at front young officer with air of relief at once dismissed native from parade be in charge of party of rifle going up with to morrow sir at least a soon a waggon be ready for oh be sergeant heard that detachment of corp be to accompany suppose have just arrived from king williamstown came in about hour ago sir have just be seeing that men be comfortable did meet with kaffir on way down saw sign of came through addoo bush be most dangerous point at trot not that there be much chance of attacking native seldom attack unless there be something to be got by will have to be careful a go back will be fairly strong party others a strong have be attacked fact of having ammunition thing of others want be of course against how will know that be carrying ammunition from hottentot who keep informed of everything ronald said at least have doubt that be hottentot of course general doe think so if did suppose must keep out of camp there be only one opinion in rank about conversation be interrupted by yell scream from native general rush down to beach there be something matter young officer exclaimed ronald ran

there be only one thing that be a clever at a thieving be lying calmness with native will tell good circumstantial lie be enough to take one breath away ronald knew enough of native to feel that be probable enough that fowl be stolen sense of morality be not sufficiently keen for to hurt woman feeling by rejecting offering kaffir have proved such ungrateful set of scoundrel argued to that be refreshing to see exception for once a soon a ammunition be on shore be loaded into three waggon on following morning party started be slow work after rapid pace at ronald men have come down from king williamstown halting place be same a at troop have encamped on march up country five month before greatest caution be observed in passage through great addoo bush for although be so far from main

when approached ronald advised young officer in command of fingoes to camp outside pas through by daylight illustration greatest caution be observed in passage through great addoo bush there be making rush said must move slowly on account of waggon there will be evading kaffir think there be much chance of attacking strong party a be if be attacked can beat off great deal better in daylight than at night in darkness lose advantage of better weapon besides fellow can see great deal better than can in dark started a soon a be light fingoes who be hundred strong be to skirmish along road ahead in wood on flank of waggon round detachment of rifle be to keep in close body fingo woman child walking just ahead of bullock scarcely word be spoken after entered forest waggon creaked groaned sound of sharp crack of driver whip alone broke silence rifle rode with arm in readiness for instant use while fingoes flitted in out among tree like dark shadow blanket karosses have be handed to woman to carry have oiled body until shone again step always taken by native when engaged in expedition in bush with view of giving more suppleness to limb also of enabling to glide through thorny thicket without being severely scratched have got about way through bush without anything being seen of lurking enemy when sudden outburst of firing mingled with yell shout be heard about quarter of mile ahead scoundrel be attacking convoy coming down ronald exclaimed will push on to aid sergeant young officer who be riding next to ronald asked can not leave waggon ronald said if must take men on sir will be up a soon a can officer shouted to fingoes at run native dashed forward to scene of conflict while ronald urged driver men pricked bullock with sword until broke into lumbering trot in few minute arrived on scene of action number of waggon be standing in road round fight be going on between fingoes greatly superior number of kaffir ronald gave word men charged down into middle of fight kaffir did not await onslaught glided away among tree fingoes following in hot pursuit until recalled by officer who feared that foe might turn upon when beyond reach of rifle of trooper ronald saw at once a rode up that although fingoes have arrived in time to save waggon have come too late to be of service to majority of defender half dozen men gathered in body be still on foot score of others lay dead desperately wounded by side of waggon a soon a fingoes returned reported kaffir in full flight ronald troop dismounted to see what aid must render went up to group of white men most of whom be wounded be bad job one of said thought that a there be about thirty of kaffir must venture to attack be on alert sprang so suddenly out of bush that half of be speared before have time to draw trigger what have better do sir go on go back question be addressed to young officer must think that now have got so far have better go on said kaffir be not likely to return for little time will give fingoes to escort on through wood think will be best plan sergeant think so sir will let have half men to go back with rest of have better stay here until return first of will see to poor fellow may not be dead most of however be found to be so kaffir having sprung upon cut throat a soon a have fallen two of who have fallen near group have maintained resistance be however found to be still living be lifted into waggon just a party be going to move on towards coast groan be heard among bush by side of road ronald two of trooper at once proceeded to spot good heaven former exclaimed a leaned over man who be lying there be mr armstrong be lifted up carried into road assegai have passed through leg have transfixed body near right shoulder point projected inch through back shaft having

off to men be there not woman in waggon asked yes there be three of man said girl two woman woman be wife of two of men who have be killed girl be daughter of suppose native must have carried off for see sign of ronald uttered exclamation of horror knew terrible fate of woman who fell into hand of kaffir returned to officer what be sergeant asked fresh misfortune young lady sir daughter of poor fellow have just picked up two other woman have be carried off by native good heaven young man said be dreadful have thousand time better have be shot with friend what be to be done sergeant know ronald said ca think yet at rate instead of waiting till party with waggon come back will push straight on out of wood will then send rest of men back at full gallop to meet then can come on together think said must take command of party going back with waggon two train be at once set in motion ronald party met with further interruption until be clear of bush a soon a be well away from sent back rifle to join other party return with through forest went on for mile further then halted waggon dismounted mr armstrong have be placed in one of waggon going up country a be nearer to town way than to port elizabeth besides ronald knew that if recovered consciousness must for many reason prefer being up country ronald walked up down restless excited meditating what step have best take for be determined that in way other must attempt to rescue mary armstrong from hand of native presently head man of fingoes came up to said in mixture of english own tongue white friend be troubled can kreta help be troubled terribly troubled kreta one of white lady who have be carried off by kaffir be friend of mine must get out of hand kreta looked grave hard thing sir if go into bush get chopped to piece must risk that ronald said be going to try save whether cost life not kreta will go with white friend chief said white man good by must kreta ronald asked eagerly have right to take into such danger a that have wife child have one to depend upon kreta must not have child if have not be for white friend kreta said if go kreta will go with will take of men be good fellow kreta ronald said shaking chief heartily by hand now what be best way of setting about fingo thought for little time then asked be white woman young pretty yes ronald replied rather surprised at question then think be safe for little while if old ugly torture kill quick if pretty young most likely send a present to big chief perhaps macomo sandilli kreli one of other great chief tribe belong to ca hing to day might crawl into wood if find how can get out be not possible best thing will be will send two of young men into bush to try find out what do with where be going to take then at night try to cut off a go across country if meet go straight to amatolas to find out kraal to take then see how to get off how many men will take kreta five men chief said holding up one hand five enough to creep crawl use to try force too many kaffir five men might do five hundred good think be right chief must be done by craft if at then will send off two young men at once chief said go long way round enter bush on other side then creep through bush hear kaffir talk if kaffir see think own people must talk if do kaffir notice difference of tongue one two word noticed if talk much find out directly then there be nothing for to do to night ronald said chief shook head good till quite dark in case will go on with convoy a far a bushman river where halt to night very well chief said go on with there then come back here meet young men who will tell what have found out chief went away ronald saw speaking to of men then two young fellow of about twenty year old laid aside blanket put gun into one of waggon then after five minute conversation with chief who be evidently giving minute instruction went off at slinging trot across country in le than hour party be escorting settler waggon through bush mounted men who have gone to meet returned together having seen sign of enemy waggon be set in motion march continued ronald mervyn rode up to officer of native levy be going sir to make what may seem most extraordinary request indeed be one be think out of power to grant if give approval will to extent lessen responsibility what be sergeant young officer asked in surprise want when arrive at halting place to hand over command of detachment to corporal for to let go away on own affair want also to allow head man kreta five of men leave of absence young officer be astonished of course be in command of convoy so have authority over so long a be with a received order direct from own officer to take detachment down to coast return with waggon be sure have power to grant leave to go away sir be just what thought at same time if report that although be unable to grant leave approved of absence will make much easier for not that make difference sir because admit frankly must go in case be probable may be reduced to rank think that under circumstance will punish more severely than be circumstance sergeant can scarcely imagine circumstance must make approve of intention to leave command on march like be just going to tell sir may say that think at probable that there will be further attack on convoy there be more large bush to pas between williamstown so far a have heard attempt have be made further on road to stop convoy that poor fellow who be lying wounded in waggon be mr armstrong be officer in service when be young man fought told at waterloo place be near spot where be quartered for two month just before outbreak showed great kindness treated a friend well sir one of three woman who be a heard carried off in waggon be mr armstrong daughter now sir know what fate will be in hand of savage dishonour torture death be going to save if can know whether will succeed most likely will not life be of great consequence to have so far be failure want to try rescue whether cost life not kreta have offered to accompany with five of men alone must certainly fail with aid there be chance of succeeding by jove be brave fellow sergeant young officer said honour for determination have formed waiving military etiquette shook ronald warmly by hand assuredly will so far a be in power give leave to go will take good care that in case fail conduct in thus risking life will be appreciated how do mean to set about ronald gave sketch of plan have be determined upon by kreta well think have chance at rate officer said when concluded of course risk of detection in midst of kaffir will be tremendous still there seems just chance of escape in case one can possibly disapprove of endeavour to save young lady from awful fate will certainly be hers unless can rescue poor girl even though know make blood run cold to think of english lady in hand of savage if be not in command of convoy must gladly go with take chance a soon a encampment be reached kreta came up to ronald must change clothes said go a kaffir ronald nodded head a have already decided that step be absolutely necessary must paint black chief went on how do that only way can see be to powder burnt

woman who be carried off morning out of hand of kaffir corporal looked at a if have doubt a to sanity may not succeed ronald went on be going to try at rate hand over command to quite understand that mr nolan can not give leave that run risk of punishment for leaving convoy have made up mind to risk well of course know best sergeant seems to that punishment punishment there be not much chance of rejoining corp be just throwing away life going among savage think be a bad a ronald said although of course there be risk of at rate corporal can take convoy safely into king williamstown be part of business ronald then returned to encampment of native levy number of stick be charred then scraped there be oil to be found a substitute charcoal be mixed with little cart grease ronald then stripped be smeared over with ointment be then rubbed into more powdered charcoal be then sprinkled over also rubbed until be shiny black operation affording great amusement to fingoes then sort of petticoat consisting of strip of hide reaching half way down to knee sewn to leathern belt be put round waist toilet be complete nothing must be done a to hair be already cut quite short to prevent forming receptacle for dust kaffir have a rule scarcely hair on head nothing must have made ronald head resemble theirs a however disguise be only meant to pas at night did not matter when be done fingoes applauded by clapping hand performing wild dance round ronald while woman who now crowded up shrieked with laughter chief walked gravely round two three time then pronounced that must pas muster bandolier for cartridge of native make be slung over shoulder with rifle in one hand spear in other two three necklace of brass bead round neck ronald must at short distance pas muster a kaffir warrior in order to test appearance strolled across to where mr nolan be inspecting serving out of ration what do want officer asked allowance for men have be served out already if have got yours must

chief fingo never loses way chief replied find way in dark same a day in spite of chief assurance ronald be fidgety anxious wrapped blanket round walked restlessly up down be nearly hour before chief

be useful by by may want to send to settlement perhaps must be a well ronald agreed message be of real importance after three hour fast travelling native going at run in spite of darkness of night ronald leaving rein loose trusting to horse to feel way came to river after making narrow examination of bank chief pronounced ford to be quarter of mile lower down in few minute came upon spot where road crossed river think way be most likely to take chief said when have crossed stream country more broken way further from town not so much chance of meeting soldier four men will stay here three men go on to other ford then if cross there send one man to tell other two follow see way go do know amatolas at chief not know incos never be there travel about part in last war never go up to amatolas then of course know at where macomo kraal be not know at follow men sure enough get there three men have not started above five minute when chief said in low tone be coming gave order to one of men who at once set off at top of speed to overtake others bring back be nearly ten minute before ronald must hear slightest sound then became conscious of low murmur of voice in air minute two later there be splashing of water at ford fifty yard from spot where have lain down under bush one of native have at kreta order taken horse away chief telling to go mile off a be to paw ground suddenly make noise attention of kaffir if within hearing must be instantly drawn to dark a night be figure of crossing water must be dimly made out ronald judged there must be fully three hundred of after first few have passed came along in such close body that be unable to make out whether there be female among number of kaffir sufficed to show there be chance whatever of effecting rescue of mary armstrong while surrounded by so large body a soon a have crossed two of fingoes followed close upon trace five minute afterwards started scarcely have gone when three men who have be sent to other ford returned with messenger who have recalled left at short interval after other then ronald mounted horse have now be fetched up followed with kreta there be fear of missing chief fear of incos star over there shine over amatolas go straight for besides two men behind can hear talking if turn off one come back to tell did not turn off kept on for hour in straight undeviating line travelling at fast walk roland mervyn kept wondering how mary armstrong be bearing up be strong active girl accustomed to plenty of exercise at ordinary time must doubtless have walked long distance event of day sudden attack upon waggon capture by kaffir uncertainty a to fate of father harrowing torture of companion have probably be compelled to witness hopelessness of own fate might well have broken down be sure that kaffir must compel to walk a long a must drag limb along a be destined a present to chief might when must go further carry groaned at helplessness to aid have not have perfect faith in cunning of companion in ability to follow up wherever be taken must have be inclined to take mad step of charging right in among kaffir upon one chance of snatching up carrying off from among roland mervyn of cape rifle be very different man from captain mervyn of borderer terrible event have caused to throw up commission leave country have in other respect be of great advantage have for year be haunted by fear of madness whenever felt low out of spirit fear of insanity have almost overpowered trial have cured of have convinced have inherited slightest taint of curse of carnes must have gone mad while be awaiting trial that have kept head perfect under such circumstance seemed to absolute proof that be a sane a other men henceforth banished fear have so long haunted be in truth that fear have held back so long from entering into formal engagement with cousin margaret looked upon a absolutely settled thing that must be married day have almost unconsciously shrunk from making day definite one although for moment have burst into fit of wild anger at being a considered thrown aside have since acknowledged to that margaret decision have be wise one that be better that two must not have wedded have always be blessed with good spirit except at time when fit of depression seized since have be at cape be on active duty have entirely passed away unvarying good temper under circumstance have often be subject of remark among comrade a rode along night acknowledged what have never before admitted to that loved mary armstrong admission be bitter rather than pleasant one will never marry now have said to mother at last interview with wife child of mine will ever hear whispered that husband father be murderer unless cloud be day lifted how can be heaven only know must go through world alone so thought still might be that a harry blunt might settle down in colony never be recognised must always have fear that at moment officer have known man of regiment emigrant from own county might recognise that news must be passed round that harry blunt be captain mervyn who escaped only from want of legal proof from being hung a murderer of cousin did think be such fool muttered to a to be caught by pretty face however will make difference will never know if father recovers be doubtful will go back with to old country if not will go back alone for without friend relative can not stay here will never dream that sergeant of cape rifle who have luck twice to save life be if do save be fool enough to fall in love with hour before morning one of fingoes came back from front with news that kaffir have turned off into kloof be going to halt there party soon collected retired to clump of tree mile back one of be ordered to act a sentry near kloof bring back word at once must movement take place rest of party upon reaching shelter of tree threw upon ground be soon fast asleep even ronald anxious a be remaining awake few minute after others sun be high before awoke a be eating breakfast sentry returned be despatched to take place man reported that have seen nothing of main body of kaffir four of be placed on watch near kloof kreta led ronald to edge of wood pointing to jagged range of hill in distance said amatolas how far be away kreta six hour fast walking chief said get to foot of hill to night if macomo kraal anywhere side may get there if not wait rest bit then go on need travel fast when get to hill know very well white soldier there what have better do do think have plenty of men always on look out sure to be on hill will send two men after fellow creep crawl through bush find out way bring news to then when come back will start must be there in evening ronald said must be there chief do hear yes incos seems to that do good to throw life away if say go kreta will go too if killed girl will be killed too good that kreta can see if go in daytime killed sure enough not possible to get into amatolas without being seen grass smooth land at foot of hill on hill place tree there manage very well open space there see wish to throw life away chief if wanted to throw own away have right to sacrifice yours men scout on look out must surely take at distance for party of own men returning from plundering expedition probably a part of party ahead who have hung back for purpose on road great many kraal great many people in amatolas chief said sure to meet one begin to ask question see very soon not kaffir see directly not kaffir might pas at night very well pas in day perhaps have time incos chief wander about hold council meet other perhaps macomo not at home very likely away when get there pray god may be so ronald said despairingly seems only hope have well kreta put in hand know much more about than do a say will do good to miss armstrong by throwing away life therefore put aside own plan trust to say can save incos if can will make sure of that next night took to foot of hill when kaffir halted chief ordered two of men to make circuit climb hill conceal in bush before morning broke so that when kaffir moved on must at once follow without having to cross in daylight grassy slope of foot hill minute instruction be given to to follow close behind kaffir party order being that if of must pounce upon solitary native be to stun with knobkerry force when recovered to give information a to distance direction road to macomo kraal that be then to be assegaid at once feeling ronald might not altogether approve of last item for be aware that white men have what considered silly objection to unnecessary bloodshed kreta whilst telling ronald rest of instruction have given to spy did not think necessary to detail portion of where will stay till morning ronald inquired of country seems perfectly flat unbroken look out will see long way off yes incos lie down in little bush behind there send back to first wood tell man to bring night to bottom of hill if see from distance coming down hill with kaffir after to come to meet lie down till morning then when go on go on too little time afterwards a said follow a far a first wood look out think belong to big party then hide there till one of men come back told must be somewhere in wood be to make signal a walk along will push on a far a can so that come upon kraal will do very well indeed ronald said for inch that can get nearer to macomo kraal be so much gained removed pistol from holster fastened to belt putting so far back that be completely hidden by blanket wore over shoulder then went with party little distance back lay down till morning almost a soon a be daybreak fingo who be on watch announced that kaffir be moving little party at once followed kaffir have disappeared among wood high up on hill side when began to ascend grassy slope have doubt that be observed by kaffir watchman proceeded boldly feeling sure must be supposed that belonged to party ahead of path through forest be narrow one moved along in single file one of party went fifty yard ahead walking cautiously listening intently for suspicious sound rest proceeded noiselessly prepared to bound into forest directly man ahead gave signal that one be approaching for upwards of mile kept way ground rising continually then reached spot where deep valley fell away at foot divided into several branch wreath of smoke must be seen curling up through tree at number of point similar indication of kraal must be seen everywhere upon hill side kreta shook head said can go further heap of kaffir about must wait now even ronald anxious a be to go on felt that must be risking too much to proceed kraal be so numerous that a soon a got into valley must be sure to run into one moreover path must fork into many branch must be impossible for to say of party ahead have taken turned aside into wood for little distance lay down one being left on watch in bush close to path hour passed slowly while waited return of one of scout who have be ordered to follow close upon footstep of kaffir to macomo kraal be three o'clock before look out by path returned accompanied by one of said few word to chief although ronald must not understand saw by expression of kreta face that news be satisfactory girl got to macomo kraal chief said macomo not there gone to sandilli may come back to night most likely get drunk not come back till to morrow macomo drink very much better ronald said thank god have got few hour before man gave narration of proceeding to kreta who translated to ronald directly kaffir have passed point where comrade be hidden came out of bush followed closely behind sometimes dropping behind little so a to be quite out of sight if of must look round then going on faster until must get glimpse of so a to be sure that be going in right direction have passed through several kraal before came to of men have waited little have then gone on at run a if anxious to catch up main body have thus avoided questioning three hour walking took to macomo kraal have hung about there until found out that macomo be away having gone off early to pay visit to sandilli kreta did not translate follower description of manner in information have be obtained ronald supposing have gathered from listening to kaffir asked question a soon a have learned what wanted to know one of have remained in hiding near village other have returned with news have be nearly twice a long coming back a be going a time have be obliged to make circuit so a to pas round of kraal so to avoid being questioned did see young lady ronald asked how be looking yes have seen a passed ambush first thing in morning looked very white tired be walking be not bound in way be must tell how soon can go on chief ronald asked impatiently see be three hour marching even if go straight through can go now chief said now know where macomo kraal be can go straight through bush went back to path fingo pointed to exact position among hill where macomo kraal be there be two intermediate ridge to be crossed ronald did not doubt fingo power to follow nearly direct line to spot now chief said follow close behind keep eye always on ground look at tree rock anything tread in footstep remember if tread on twig make least sound perhaps one notice may be noticed anyhow fellow upon watch may see moving through tree overhead must risk that only make noise ronald promised to obey chief instruction party again leaving path took way through tree straight down into valley at time came to such precipitous place that be forced to make detour to get down one of men now went ahead rest following at distance that must just keep in sight through tree from time to time changed course a heard noise sound of voice told be approaching kraal at time came across patch of open ground when be impossible to avoid made attempt to cross rapidly a knew that sharp eye of sentry on hill top must look down upon therefore walked at quiet pace talking gesticulating to other a went so that might be taken for party going from one kraal to be eight o'clock in evening sun have set time when approached kraal of macomo be good sized village differed little from ordinary kaffir kraal except two three of hut be large beehive shaped there be good deal of noise going on in village great fire be burning round number of kaffir be dancing representing by action conflict in

told story of men took up weapon searched village surrounding bush greater portion altogether disbelieved story whoever heard of spirit talking in unknown tongue to lot of woman if have wanted to say anything to must have spoken so that must understand must have be man who have drunk too much who bellowed in at door to startle so gradually din subsided men returned to dance woman to hut have mary armstrong be in spirit to enjoy must have be amused at various proposition started by woman to account for voice have heard not one of approached truth for did not occur to a even possible that white man must have penetrated amatolas to macomo kraal chapter xiii rescue ronald with kreta two of men now crept down to very edge of bush at spot where must command view of entrance to hut for long time

companion with other advanced towards village when within forty yard of hut touched ronald whispered to to remain there then companion lay down on ground without slightest sound that ronald must detect disappeared in darkness while ronald stood with revolver in hand ready at moment to spring forward throw upon kaffir mary armstrong lay awake with faculty upon stretch where succour be to come from how must not imagine be evident at least that white man be here be working for listened intently to sound with eye wide open staring at two woman who be cooking mealie in fire keeping up low murmured talk have not even hope that must sleep knew that native constantly sit up talking feasting until daylight be close at hand a have extra motif for vigilance be sure that must keep awake suddenly so suddenly that scarcely knew what have happened two woman disappeared from sight hand have grasped tightly by throat hand seized hair with sharp jerk pulled head on one side breaking neck in moment common mode among kaffir of putting one to death whole thing did not occupy moment a woman disappeared from sight two native rose to foot looked round convinced that be succour promised sat up one of native put finger upon lip to indicate necessity of silence beckoned for to rise come to when did so wrapped in dark blanket led to door pushed aside hanging went out mary followed close behind now put blanket over head lifted in arm momentary dread seized lest might be emissary of other chief who have sent to carry off macomo new captive thought of english word reassured at rate even if be so position must not possibly be worse than on return of macomo next morning be carried short distance then heard bearer say in english come along take bit further too close to kaffir still be carried on for distance then there be stop be placed on foot blanket be removed from head moment later dark figure seized hand thank god have got out miss armstrong revulsion of feeling at hearing own

lead telling mary armstrong to take hold of blanket follow close behind while ronald followed on other fingoes keeping in rear darkness beneath tree be dense be time before ronald must make out even outline of figure before before approaching kraal halt be always made one of fingoes went on ahead to see if fire be out native inside hut several time although human being be asleep scout returned saying that must not pas through kraal for dog have scented growled fiercely must set up such barking when party passed a to bring village out to see what be matter then long detour must have be difficult through thick bush in daylight at night be almost impossible have to be made time that have to be done kreta lifted mary armstrong carried have now become so exhausted that be unable even to protest ronald must have carried felt that must be worse than useless to attempt to do so though unencumbered have greatest difficulty in making way through bush scratched tore flesh terribly chief seemed to be possessed of eye of bat glided through scarcely moving twig a passed after going on for upwards of three hour chief stopped will be getting light soon must hide now can not get further until to morrow night although ronald mervyn struggling along in darkness have not noticed party have for last hour turned off from line have before be following stopped by little stream running down valley here native refilled gourd mary armstrong felt better after drink of water think ronald said to that if be to bathe face hand must refresh there be rock here just at edge of stream be sure foot

fresh charcoal mixed with grease brought with rubbed in afresh hair be weak point ronald of course european must make hair like native still a be cut so close must not be noticed little way off two three of fingoes have by time returned in few minute have gathered at spot kreta listened to report of of men held short consultation then came up to ronald one of men have found place will do well said be time be going one of fingoes now took lead others followed quarter of hour walk up hill grew steeper steeper step brought to spot where mass of rock have fallen from above be half covered with thick growth of brushwood native pushed one of bush aside showed sort of cave formed by great slab of rock have fallen over others kreta uttered expression of approval two of native crept in with assagai in hand in two three minute one of returned with body of two puff adder have killed be dropped in among rock can go in now kreta said there be more of ronald crawled in first helped mary armstrong in after native followed kreta came in last carefully examining bush before did so to see that twig be broken disarranged managed a entered to place two three rock over entrance good place said looking round a joined others be indeed of ample size to contain party be four foot in height light came in in several place between rock on upper slab rested must not be better kreta even if have be made on purpose be lucky indeed fellow found found two three others chief said best be lucky men came in first found snake mary armstrong said for have not got here stuff always use in colony a antidote bite be almost always fatal unless can be used in time ronald be aware of have indeed during night march have snake constantly in mind for knew that abounded in hill one of fingoes have taken station at entrance having moved one of stone chief have placed there so that must sit with head out of opening hour after have entered cave turned round spoke to chief kaffir be hunting kreta said listening at opening must hear distant shout be answered from many point of comparatively close news be being passed from kraal to kraal ronald said will be up like swarm of bee now search a will be not likely to find here do think will trace at chief will find where stopped close to kraal kreta said dead leaf be stirred by foot after not find too many people gone along path ground very hard may find sometime mark of white woman shoe leave path many time after carry find at mountain very big much bush never find here chief now told follower to replace stone join others ordered to be silent sitting with ear at one of opening listened to sound in wood once twice whispered that kaffir be passing close searching among bush one party came so near that word must be plainly heard in cave be discussing manner in fugitive have escaped be unanimous in belief that have be carried off by follower of other chief for enemy must have penetrated into heart of amatolas did not strike a possible argument be only a to of other chief must have ventured to rob macomo opinion inclined to fact that must have be sandilli who must doubtless have heard from messenger sent over on previous afternoon to inform macomo of return of band with pretty young white woman a captive macomo have of course be drunk sandilli might have determined to have prize carried off for mary armstrong shuddered a listened to talk when have gone on kreta said good thing kaffir have thought not search so much here search in sandilli country perhaps make great quarrel between macomo sandilli good thing a day went on spirit of fingoes rose in low tone expressed delight at having outwitted kaffir footstep have be heard in neighbourhood for time felt sure that search have be abandoned in quarter towards sunset ate hearty meal a soon a became dark stone at entrance be removed party crept out mary armstrong have slept greater part of day ronald fingoes have also passed portion of time in sleep started therefore refreshed strong took many hour of patient work before arrived at edge of forest on last swell of amatolas have be obliged to make many detour to avoid kraal to surmount precipice often barred way have started about eight in evening be a knew from star fully three o'clock in morning when emerged from forest mary armstrong have kept on well with rest foot be extremely painful be now strong hopeful word of complaint escaped ronald chief kept by side helping up down difficult place assisting to pas through thorny bush caught dress must have rendered almost impossible for to get through unaided once out of bush party hurried down grassy slope then kept on mile further chief now gave loud call be answered faintly from distance in five minute sound of horse hoof be heard in short time fingo who have be left in charge of galloped up with ronald horse mary armstrong be sitting on ground for be now so utterly exhausted must no longer keep foot have since left bush be supported half carried by ronald kreta made effort to rise a horse came up please wait moment will not be above two minute ronald said really can not ride into williamstown like unstrapped valise took jack boot be hanging from saddle moved away in darkness in two three minute returned in uniform feel civilised being again said laughing handful of sand at first stream come to will get most of black off face have left blanket a legacy to kaffir who may light upon now will shift saddle few inch further back think have better ride before for be completely worn out can hold there better than must hold if be to sit behind strapped on valise shifted saddle lifted mary up sprang up behind be comfortable asked quite comfortable said little shyly then started light be just beginning to break in east a rode out from clump of tree be not out of danger yet for party of kaffir might be met with at time until arrived within musket shot of king williamstown fingoes ran at pace kept horse at sharp trot be very pleasant to ronald mervyn to feel mary armstrong in arm to know a did how safe confident felt there did not press more closely than be necessary to enable to retain seat permit to speak in softer tenderer tone than usual if must come across of scoundrel mary said presently do take rein do think can sit steady without holding firmly yes girl said if put one foot on yours must certainly hold on must twist one of hand in horse mane can use pistol of course can replied be a good shot a father be right then will give one of pistol then can hold with right arm for horse may plunge if spear strike will use pistol in left hand will see that one catch bridle on side do attend to right hope wo come to still there be never saying will have one two nasty place to pas through on way down have advantage must there be kaffir there will not be keeping watch way may hope to get pretty well through before see will promise one thing ronald asked will shoot if find that can not get past ronald nodded be not at afraid of death said death must be nothing to must rather die thousand time than fall into hand of kaffir again promise mary last shot one will be for last for if be struck off horse by bullet assegai must trust to own pistol will do ronald have be perfectly happy since took out of hut have not seemed to feel fear of being recaptured for felt that if overtook must always escape so on way there if must have got hold of assegai must have stabbed thank god did said ronald earnestly though must not have blamed paused at entrance to kloof through have to pas fingoes went cautiously ahead searching through bush be not until heard call on other side that ronald galloped after begin to hope that will get through now ronald said after emerging from one of kloofs have only one more bad place to pas of course danger be greatest there a from that kaffir will probably be watching against advance of troop from town fingoes be evidently of same opinion for a approached kreta stopped to speak to ronald kaffir sure to be here said men can creep through must not call to incos kaffir must hear be on watch safest plan for to go through first not go along path through bush then for to gallop straight through even if close to path get past before time to stop think that best way think so too kreta if hear horse hoof coming from behind will suppose be mounted messenger from hill anyhow think that dash for be best chance think so incos think get through safe if go fast how long will be getting through kreta quarter of hour chief said must go slow ride four five minute kreta stood thoughtfully for minute two like incos tell what do keep over to left then when get just through bush fire gun then kaffir very much surprised run way ride straight through might overtake kreta overtake chief said confidently run fast get good start williamstown only one hour walk run le than hour catch when fingoes have be gone about ten minute ronald assured that kaffir must be gathered at far side of kloof went forward at walk presently heard six shot fired in rapid succession be followed by outburst of yell cry in front set spur to horse dashed forward at gallop be nearly through kloof when body of kaffir who be running through wood from right burst suddenly from bush into path so astonished be at seeing white man within few yard of that for moment did not think of using weapon ronald dashed through scattering to right left others sprang from bush ronald shot down two men who sprang at horse bridle heard mary armstrong pistol on other side have drawn sword before setting off at gallop hold tight mary said a relaxed hold of cut down native who be springing upon from bush fell from bullet from pistol then be through stoop down mary said pressing forward on horse neck bending down over felt horse give sudden spring knew that be hit with assegai while almost at same instant felt sensation a of hot iron running from belt to shoulder a spear ripped up cloth flesh then glanced along over moment later be out of kloof riding at full speed across open looking over shoulder saw that kaffir gave up pursuit after following for hundred yard over on left heard dropping shot presently caught glimpse in direction of fingoes running in close body pursued at distance of hundred yard so by large number of kaffir others have heard sound of firing for in minute two saw body of horseman riding at full speed from williamstown in direction of firing at once checked speed of horse be safe now mary be troop of corp be hit be not touched be hurt ronald thought felt start have got bit of scratch on back be nothing serious will get off in moment mary horse have assegai in quarter must get out take down too please feel giddy now be over

from reconnaissance that have be making with portion of troop called at once to see ronald be told that be sound asleep so left word that must come again in morning news of sergeant blunt desperate attempt to rescue three white woman who have be carried off by kaffir have when reported by lieutenant nolan be subject of much talk in camp one admitted that be breach of discipline thus to leave party of be in command when upon special service one seriously blamed for admiration for daring action regret for loss of so brave soldier for none thought that there be slightest chance of ever seeing again overpowered other feeling mr nolan stated that sergeant have told that one of three woman be daughter of wounded man have brought in with that have known father before be generally agreed that there must have be something more than mere acquaintance in case to induce sergeant to undertake such desperate enterprise great interest be therefore excited when upon return of lieutenant daniel party became known that have fallen in with sergeant blunt young lady that sergeant be severely wounded sort of question be asked lieutenant ten to one be pretty daniel young subaltern said be pretty mellor broke in caught glimpse of be a pretty girl a have seen in colony though of course be looking utterly worn out be gentleman officer who have just come up said have be talking to nolan tell that sergeant blunt spoke of a lady said that father have served in army fought a young ensign at waterloo mr armstrong be gentleman lieutenant daniel said have farm on kabousie river be where blunt got to know have reputation of being wealthy man blunt be in command of party who came up saved when be attacked by kaffir on christmas day so be second time have rescued young lady hope mr armstrong be going to be stern father spoil whole romance of business young mellor laughed one of trooper daniel however brave fellow can hardly be considered a good match for heiress blunt be a much gentleman a be lieutenant daniel said quietly know nothing whatever of history what real name be for expect blunt be only nom de guerre do know that be gentleman be sure have served a officer more than want to know unless chooses to tell suppose got into scrape other at home must mind making heavy bet that whatever be be nothing dishonourable how did get away from kaffir seems almost impossibility asked head man of fingoes who be with said have already got three part drunk so did not get much out of a far a must make out carried off from macomo kraal in heart of amatolas oh come now that seems altogether absurd two three of officer standing round laughed mellor said orpheus going down to fetch eurydice back from hades must have have easy task of in comparison be glad to see that have not forgotten classical learning mellor one of older officer said certainly of two must rather undertake task of orpheus who be pretty decently treated after than go to macomo kraal to fetch back lady love well suppose will hear about to morrow can hardly believe story to be true native be such liar there be believing what say next morning after breakfast captain twentyman lieutenant daniel walked across to hospital first saw surgeon well doctor how be sergeant on high way to recovery surgeon said cheerfully of course wound will be fortnight perhaps three week before be healed up sufficiently for to return to duty otherwise there be nothing matter with long night rest have pulled round completely be little weak from loss of blood there be harm in there be think fear whatever of fever other complication be simply question of wound healing up colonist armstrong name be think whose daughter be carried away how be going on much better daughter presence at once calmed delirium morning when woke after good night sleep be conscious will now think do well be very weak doe not matter be perfectly content lying there holding daughter hand have asked question a to how got back

too busy morning when went round to have conversation with except a to wound inquiry be partly personal partly official captain twentyman said colonel somerset asked morning to see blunt gather information a to kaffir position might be useful went yesterday evening to question fingo head man who went with men be a drunk a pig hear that when first arrived said have carried girl off from macomo kraal of course there must be mistake never must have ventured into heart of amatolas come out alive three officer proceeded together to ward in ronald be lying well sergeant how do feel captain twentyman asked oh be right sir ronald answered cheerfully back smart bit of course be nothing hope will be in saddle again before long at rate before advance be made hope so blunt now if feel up to telling want to hear about adventure colonel somerset asked to inquire a will throw light on number position of kaffir besides whole camp be wanting to know how succeeded in getting miss armstrong out of hand of kaffir can assure that there be nothing else talked about there be nothing much to talk about a far a be concerned sir ronald said be fingoes doing altogether must have managed a well indeed better without except that must not have done unless have be with perhaps not ronald admitted be lucky enough down at port elizabeth to fish out son of kreta head man of party who have be washed off foot in surf be out of gratitude for that followed yes heard about business from mr nolan although speak lightly of be tell very gallant affair indeed now a to other matter in first place captain twentyman admit that going off a did be great breach of duty can only say that will be willing cheerfully to submit to penalty colonel may think fit to inflict have right to leave detachment on what be really private business even if have be certain must have be shot a deserter on return to regiment must not have hesitated in acting a did understand feeling blunt captain twentyman said kindly have need to make uneasy on score to punish man for acting a have done must be a bad a sea story of captain who flogged seaman who jumped overboard to save comrade for leaving ship without order now for story have heard be that fingo say carried off young lady from macomo kraal of course be not believed be quite true nevertheless ronald said well be how be sir gave full

altogether to account for doings at hour at be murdered how glove have borne evidence against be that ronald not quite dear saw in english paper only few day ago that matter have come up again be watch jewel be found in garden just hidden in ground evidently not by thief who intended to come again fetch simply concealed by one who have taken did not want if thing have be found before trial mary must assuredly have be hung for disposed of only alternative seemed possible namely that have be murdered by midnight burglar for sake of valuable mary sat in silence for few minute then asked one two question with reference to story have idea ronald not even slightest suspicion against one not slightest said whole thing be to a profound mystery a ever of course from what tell ronald evidence against be stronger than against one else yet can not think how one who knew must have believed hope that who knew best did not believe mary few of neighbour many of brother officer have faith in innocence see in county who knew story of family be naturally set against have mad blood of carnes in vein carnes have committed two murder in frenzy did not seem to so strange must do same may tell dear that trial through have passed have not be altogether without good family history have weighed on mind from time be child at time used to wonder whether have madness in blood fear grew upon embittered life since trial have gone for ever know that if have have slightest touch of insanity in vein must have gone mad in awful time much a have suffered from cloud rested on be sure have be far brighter happier man since pressure of hand be holding in expressed sympathy that did not speak what time do march to morrow ronald at eight dear must come round first must mary must rather say

be greatly taken by harry blunt have encouraged coming to house that be gentleman be sure thought knew enough of character to be convinced that scrape have driven to enlist a trooper be not disgraceful one if mary fancy young fellow will have have said to have money enough for what good be to except to see settled happily in life after attack upon house when be rescued by party led by ronald thought still more of matter for subtle change in daughter manner convinced that heart have be touched have fretted over fact that after ronald duty have kept from seeing when at last started on journey down to coast made up mind that if when reached england must ascertain for certain mary wish on subject must write cautious letter to putting that after service have rendered in saving life that of daughter did not like thought of remaining a trooper at cape that if liked to come home must start in sort of business liked adding perhaps that have special reason for wishing to return after ronald rescue of daughter mr armstrong regarded a certainty that wish must be realised be little surprised that young sergeant have not spoken out be with view to give opportunity that have suggested that mary must go out for stroll on last evening have felt assured that must come in hand in hand have anticipated with lively pleasure prospect of paying debt of gratitude to young man be with surprise disappointment regret that listened to mary story be monstrous thing said when have finished most monstrous cry dear will come right presently thing always work round in time how be to come right father say that have not slightest suspicion who did whether have not make difference mr armstrong said decidedly be quite certain by what say poor lady did not kill in case who did must make business to find out who be suppose be going to have life spoiled in such fashion a talk about remaining single life wo have thing must be set straight be very easy to say beust father mary said almost smiling at earnestness how be to be set straight why by finding out about of course mary directly get well enough to move doctor said morning that in fortnight can be taken down to coast will follow out original plan of going back to england then will go down to place speak of carnesworth whatever be take place there near there there be always place to be have make difference to where go for suppose will find many people alive knew in england will take little place get to know people talk to tell about not finding out of course will be able to find out if have be done by one down there a say that burglar tramp theory be quite disproved by finding of trinket must be somebody in neighbourhood know what dunderheaded police be not one in ten of can put two two together fellow at once jumped to conclusion that mervyn be guilty never inquired further say have detective down father for week before trial one have be remaining there until quite lately think much of detective mr armstrong said of course mary if throw cold water on scheme fancy there be end of father know mean that only be frightened because seemed to think so certain must succeed there be nothing must like better will matter nothing to if be year about so that can clear at last have notion of spending year dear before now have proved pretty good hand at tracking spoor of kaffir be hard if ca pick up trail somehow will do between father mary said catching confidence enthusiasm kissing a sat propped up with pillow oh have made so happy everything seemed so dark hopeless before now will be working for for too miss mary pretend have personal interest in matter so just a clock struck twelve mary armstrong lay down on bed in little ante room next to father feeling infinitely happier more hopeful than must have thought possible when parted from ronald mervyn three hour before ronald be surprised at brightness with met when at six o'clock alighted from horse at hospital come in ronald said be talking father for hour last night have quite decided what be going to do so have come to say good bye mervyn for of course be mervyn to mr armstrong said a entered room well lad be bad business that

be fond of how must help have be fancying a soon a war be over for of course must not leave now must be coming home must be having with in snug little place there however lad that be over for present not for always hope have not changed opinion of affair fact that have suffered horribly unjustly be nothing against personally indeed will make mary better husband for having gone through trial than must have done have not come upon be sure must ronald said quietly think must make happy fear will never have chance have told what said last night have be awake night thinking over be sure have decided rightly disgrace be hard enough to bear alone will never share with think be right mervyn at least for present if say in five year hence be of same mind towards other a doubt will be added in reply to look of perfect confidence passed between daughter ronald will talk matter over again five year be long time old story fade out of people remembrance in five year then one may discus again mean mary to wait five year if can help have inclination to wait five year either have child mary shook head so will tell what have resolved upon for have made up mind about in first place somebody murdered cousin of yours be quite clear be be quite clear ronald replied be absolutely certain that be not suicide in next place from what say be quite clear also that be not done by ordinary burglar circumstance of death discovery that watch jewel be hastily thrust into ground left there to spoil pretty well show that think so ronald said be convinced that whoever did murder be deliberate one not work of thief then be evident that be work of one in neighbourhood of one who have personal hatred of cousin who wished to injure to injure ronald repeated in surprise never thought of in way why to injure say to injure because seems to that there be deliberate attempt to fix guilt upon one must have put glove where be found for appears from what told mary that certainly must not have dropped there might seem so ronald said thoughtfully yet can not believe in fact have so far a know quarrel with one in neighbourhood have be away on service for year so have nothing to do with working of estate indeed never have angry word with man upon never discharged groom one of sort well did discharge groom after got back ronald replied coachman too for found upon looking into account that have be swindling mother right left that can surely have nothing to do with glove alone must have be nothing have not be for previous quarrel with cousin one outside house can have known of that unfortunate ride of mine well may may not be mr armstrong said anyhow have that murder must have be committed by one in neighbourhood who have grudge against cousin against now detective have have down there daughter tell have altogether failed in finding clue after show that be fool rather than there be clue to be found now what mary have settled upon be directly get back will take pretty little cottage if can get one down at village what at carnesford yes carnesford will be two simple colonist who have made enough money to live upon have fixed upon place accidentally then will set to work to get to bottom of affair know be to be done if can get hold of right way mary flatter ourselves between will do now be plan be use saying yes because be what have fixed upon be very good of sir began be not good at mr armstrong interrupted mary want to get married want to get married so have nothing to do to set about right way of bringing about now boy know must not keep god bless bring safely through war tell will be more troublesome one than people think will write often mary will let know regularly how be getting on held out hand to mervyn who grasped silently held mary to in close embrace for minute then galloped away to take place in rank of corp troop to ronald belonged be not found intended to start at once to front be to serve a escort to colonel somerset who have now be appointed a brigadier general in command of column be to start from grahamstown at eight o'clock started arrived late in afternoon at place where found th highlander who have just marched up from

waggon one officer of native levy have be killed two others wounded further march of five mile be made before morning then troop halted in order to advance under cover of night against position of enemy twelve mile distant at past one in morning infantry advanced cavalry following two hour later road be most difficult one full of deep hole innumerable ant hill after passing through narrow defile thickly strewn with loose stone large rock over in darkness men stumbled fell continually cavalry overtook infantry at ford of kareiga river went on ahead in darkness several company of infantry lost way daylight be breaking before force be collected in readiness for assault hut occupied by enemy stood on one side of grassy plain three quarter of mile in diameter surrounded by deep belt of forest fingo levy be sent round through bush to rear of hut cavalry infantry then advanced to attack enemy skirmished on plain cavalry dashed down upon drove into wooded ravine from kept up fire for time until silenced by two three volley from infantry main body of rebel be drawn up in front of hut a soon a troop approached cavalry charged took to flight volley from fingoes in bush killed several of rest however succeeded in gaining forest village be then burnt cattle horse goat stolen from neighbouring settler be recovered column then marched back to bivouac of night before following day returned to grahamstown there be halt here for next morning marched to join column from king williamstown road led through ecca pas where constant attack have be made by native upon waggon convoy going down road without opposition crossed koonap river at end of two day march encamped on ridge where amatola range must be seen finally joined column composed of st regiment rest of cape mounted rifle encamped near fort hare two day later whole force amounting to men advanced to base of amatolas encamped on plain at short distance from hill attack be made in two column th portion of native levy of mounted rifle be to attack formidable position in front while st be to march round driving enemy before to effect junction at end of day with others cavalry must take part in attack of strong position held by kaffir be line of perpendicular cliff only approach to be up smooth grassy incline touched summit of cliff at one point only th moved directly to attack native levy skirmishing on flank enemy who must be seen in large number on height waited until highlander be well within range before opened fire cavalry below watched progress of troop with anxiety replied with steady volley to incessant firing of enemy advancing steadily up slope occasionally leaving wounded man behind two company went ahead in skirmishing order climbing from rock to rock exchanged shot with enemy a went succeeded in winning foothold at top of cliff drove off defender who took refuge in thick forest few hundred yard in rear a soon a rest of regiment have got up advanced against wood from enemy kept up constant fire pouring in steady volley entered forest drove enemy before foot by foot until kaffir retreated into thick bush absolutely impenetrable to soldier on emerging from forest troop be joined by other column have driven enemy from position on victoria height have burned two of village while fighting be going on between first division enemy second division have be engaged in portion of hill have penetrated distance skirmishing went on during rest of day at troop returned to camp that have left in morning kaffir have suffered considerable loss during day two of leading chief being amongst slain sandilli narrowly escaped being taken prisoner cape mounted rifle attached to th have taken part in affair for ground have be altogether impracticable for cavalry troop when returned be utterly exhausted with fatigue that have undergone be well satisfied with event of day be well enough for beginning ronald said to sergeant menzies what be hill extend twenty thirty mile way at very least twice a far for anything know contain score of kraal suppose be far out when say hundred have burnt three four have marched mile two into wood have killed perhaps hundred kaffir at outside have lost in killed wounded about fifty of own men suppose altogether there be fifteen twenty thousand kaffir there have end of place where fellow ca possibly penetrate there be holding position when have taken column may toil on through wood skirmishing way only hold ground stand on why sergeant will take dozen expedition made with force three four time larger than have now before can produce much effect on amatolas be afraid will blunt sergeant said before break down rebellion there be one thing say that kaffir have got twenty thirty thousand cattle among hill if can drive off will do more good than by killing chief care little how much follower be shot down do care mightily for loss of wealth cattle be one valuable possession of kaffir shooting men have very little effect on who be not shot a for driving out of one part of country make difference to one way can put up kraal anywhere one point on can hit be cattle chief consequence depends on number of bullock owns young kaffir can not marry unless have cattle to buy wife with putting aside arm trumpery necklace bracelet cattle be sole valuable of kaffir will see if can capture cattle will put end to war amount of marching fighting will make great impression upon prognostication of two soldier proved correct be only after six invasion of amatolas by very much larger force after hard fighting in troop did not always have best of after very heavy loss after capturing cattle that conquest of amatolas be finally achieved so far ronald have heard nothing more a to discovery of identity by one of men of troop thought that man must not have mentioned to one else for felt sure that have become generally known must have heard of must have noticed change in manner of men must certainly have come to ear of menzies one of other non commissioned officer who must of course come to to inquire whether there be truth in report besides man must have known from time joined troop must have mentioned before if have wanted to do so ronald supposed then that have kept silence either because thought that by originating report to disadvantage of popular man in corp might though proved to be true be regarded with general hostility that man might intend to keep secret thinking that day other might make useful to doubt never must have said what did have not be excited by liquor ronald hardly knew whether to be glad sorry that secret be still kept must felt sure come out sooner later in respect must rather have end of suspense face at once position be strong one officer be markedly kind to expedition into amatolas have rendered most popular man in corp among comrade fact too a told by colonel somerset to officer a picked up by men from talk that have refused commission added to popularity men be glad to think that comrade preferred being one of to becoming officer that brave deed be proud of have not be done to win promotion simply to save woman in distress there have be sly laughter among men when comrade told how pretty be girl ronald have brought back there have be keen wagering in regiment that there must be wedding before marched at rate that must hear there must be one on return from war one contingency have not occurred other seemed be not to take place for in answer to question a to how wounded colonist be going on ronald have said carelessly that be mending fast must be well enough to be taken down to coast in fortnight that doctor thought by time reached england must be completely set up again so bet be paid men wondered that sergeant have not made better use of opportunity for agreed that girl must hardly refuse man who have done so much for even if father be wealthy colonist only trooper in mounted rifle chapter xvi searching for clue landlord

transformation have be made in cottage verandah be run round front two side rustic woodwork appeared round window interior of house be transformed with fresh paper paint nothing must be done in way of rose creeper a must not be moved at time of year for be now just midsummer day after workman went out waggon load of furniture simple substantial arrived on following day coach brought down new tenant girl have already be engaged in village to act a servant miss armstrong be quietly plainly dressed might by attire be taken for daughter of small farmer opinion in village a newcomer walked through on way to cottage be distinctly favourable in very short time mr armstrong became quite popular character in carnesford soon be on speaking term with most of people won mother heart by patting head of little girl praising look have habit of carrying sweet in pocket distributing freely among child must lounge for hour at smith door listening to gossip went on for in carnesford a elsewhere forge be recognised meeting place of who have nothing to do be considered wonderful acquisition by frequenter of snuggery at carne arm story of life at cape gave added interest to meeting hearing from hiram powlett that have wife daughter asked to get a matter of kindness to visit daughter within fortnight of arrival mary went to tea to mill several time conversation in snuggery turned upon murder at hold in case did new comer lead up to cropped up a subject people of carnesford be never weary of discussing ventured opinion asked question upon first few occasion when subject be being discussed smoked pipe in silence listening to conversation seems strange to said at last that in village must never have have suspicion of one except captain mervyn understand that mr claphurst mr carey have never thought of one else mr powlett always say be sure be if be mr powlett who do think be ah be more than can tell hiram replied have thought have thought till head went round ca see who can have be miss carne seems to have have enemy no not one not a ever heard of be wonderful popular in village be a for squire except about poaching never quarrelled with one have trouble with poacher then well not often last year before affair there be bad lot about be from dareport be two mile away down at mouth of river with one two chap from village so be said about fortnight may be three week before miss carne be killed there be fight up in wood between gamekeeper one of keeper got stabbed did die until time afterwards jury brought in wilful murder same did matter much what verdict brought in 'cause man a evidence went against have left country at least have be seen hereabouts good job too hiram good job too jacob carey put in yes hiram said admit be good job a be gone good job for must never have done good here anyway best job a ever did for a know of be when took off there be general chorus of assent be man name mr armstrong asked carelessly name be george forester jacob carey said a be going out from snuggery that evening landlord made sign to mr armstrong that wanted to speak to accordingly lingered until other men have left oh thought must just tell mr armstrong seeing that daughter have be to mill be just a well not to talk about poaching george forester before ruth powlett see be rather sore subject with be engaged to george forester lot of trouble gave father mother well expect must have seen now that have lucky escape still girl like man a have liked being spoken against so thought must say word to thank be very friendly of yes may be sure wo introduce subject be very glad told might have blundered upon hurt girl feeling doe look very strong have nervous look about think used to be very different have great shock be first know to go into miss carne room find dead be maid before be ill for week after came on top of illness too fell down on hill coming home from church found lying insensible there be very bad have doctor there day then came other affair dare say business of george forester helped too anyhow be very bad doctor thought at one time that must get over mr armstrong walked home thoughtfully well father what be news mary armstrong said a entered can see have heard something more than usual well dear know that be anything at same time certainly be new give something to follow up seems that there be fellow named george forester living somewhere about here be engaged to friend ruth powlett father mother disapproved of highly say be bad lot got mixed up with gang of poacher little time before murder about three week before have fight with mr carne keeper one of keeper be mortally wounded be said by george forester man lived for time at last died of wound jury brought in verdict of wilful murder against george forester who have be missing from time of fight yes father that seems great clue perhaps not mary show at least that there be one fellow about here who may be considered to have have quarrel with carnes who be thoroughly bad character who be of importance be engaged with without parent consent to miss carne own maid mary gave little gasp of excitement now seems further father went on that time between poaching affray murder must not inquire closely into date ruth powlett be found insensible on road going up hill be very ill for day said have have fall of course may have have although be not often young woman fall down so heavily a to stun may of course have be something else what else father well be possible may have met lover of hers that may have have quarrel probably knew have be engaged in poaching affair may have told that must have nothing more to do with may have knocked down of course be mere supposition be only by supposition that can grope way along seems be well enough anyhow to go up to place again at hold for be first to discover murder shock be so great that be ill for week in fact in great danger say have be greatly changed ever since know whether anything can be made of dear know see what mary said after thinking for time unless be fancying since that be man who did of course anyhow must be fearful shock for girl to find mistress lying murdered perhaps may be nothing more than doubt may be nothing more than mary be other side of case have to look at let piece thing together here have four five fact of may tell here be bad character in village be one point man have poaching affray with mr carne keeper killed at rate coroner jury found that killed one of keeper be engaged to miss carne own maid maid be just after poaching business found insensible in wood tell rather improbable story a to how came about be first to enter mistress room then have serious illness of course girl must be shocked frightened upset be not so often that serious illness must be result lastly have be changed ever since have a remarked to other day absent preoccupied sort of way about taken altogether thing certainly do amount to something think so too father think so too mary armstrong said walking up down little room in excitement do think there may be something in see father after poaching business man wanted to get away may have be in want of money so have thought of taking miss carne watch jewel to raise money to take abroad so might dear be certainly feasible explanation unfortunately instead of taking away see buried yes father only just pushed into ground report said because on reading through old file of newspaper other day particularly noticed that well father see perhaps just a be leaving house dog may have barked something may have given scare may just have hidden in ground intending to come for next day then what with excitement police here search be being made must get opportunity of getting up again being afraid of being arrested for share in poaching affray dared not hang about here longer probably went down to plymouth got on board ship there of course be nothing more than supposition still really doe not seem improbable father there be only one difficulty can see why must have killed miss carne because doctor say that be certainly asleep can not tell dear may have moved little may have thought that must wake that have better make sure be desperate man there be saying what desperate man will do anyhow mary be clue distinct one must follow up may lead wrong in end will not be losing time by following for will keep ear open may find other altogether different track how have better follow mary asked after having sat silent for minute forester be gone have idea where think only person likely to be able to help be ruth powlett exactly so dear must not be likely to speak if know anything must have said at trial have not wished to shield man whom may love in spite of wickedness quite so dear besides smiled young woman in love be not disposed to believe in lover guilt how can say so father mary said indignantly must not compare mary must not compare two men think will admit that even have evidence against ronald mervyn be ten time a conclusive a be must still have maintained innocence against world of course must father quite so dear be what be saying however if supposition be correct in case girl doe believe to be guilty wish to shield either because love still have loved be astonishing how woman will cling to men even when know to be villain think dear that best way of proceeding will be for to endeavour to find out from ruth powlett what know of course will be gradual matter can only do when have got to know like thoroughly father mary said hesitating will not be treacherous thing for to become friend with for purpose of gaining secret depends how gain mary certainly must be so be to get surreptitiously be not way must propose if girl have really proof anything like strong evidence that murder be committed by man forester be acting wrongly cruelly to to allow guilt to fall upon in time when get intimate with intimate enough to introduce subject course must be to impress upon so strongly a to induce to make open confession of course must point out to that must now in way injure man who be lover a have gone one know where will certainly never return to country a upon appearance must at once be arrested tried on charge of killing gamekeeper must be perfectly open above board then mary must if deemed expedient own own strong interest in matter there must be nothing treacherous in dear simply urge to do act of justice of course will be painful for to do so after concealing so long still must think from little have seen of that be conscientious girl be doubt not already sorely troubled in mind over matter yes father agree with there must be nothing treacherous in have simply to try to get to make confession of anything may know in matter quite agree with in have said about man see how ruth powlett can know anything for certain may suspect for if be a say dangerously ill for long time after murder can not very well have seen man who must be sure to have quitted country at once be afraid that be so mary still must hope for best if can not give absolute evidence what say may at least put in right track for obtaining even if legal evidence can be obtained might get enough clue with what have already to convince world whereas hitherto there seemed alternative open a to mervyn guilt there be in fact against whom there be at rate certain amount of proof whose character be a bad a of captain mervyn be good must in be great step mervyn have be acquitted a one else be shown to have be connected with in way people be compelled in spite of previous character in spite of acquittal in spite in fact even of probability to consider guilty once shown that there be at least reasonable ground for suspicion against opinion at rate of who know mervyn must at once veer round very well father now have done part of work by finding out clue will do mine by following up fortunately ruth powlett be very superior sort of girl to one in village can make friend with heartily without pretence must have found very hard if have be rough sort of girl express just a well a do seems very gentle nice one can see even sharp voiced stepmother of hers be very fond of be apple of miller eye must not be impatient father two girl ca become great friend at once think on whole miss armstrong father said be quite a likely to become impatient a be seeing that be business much more than mine well may be sure will not lose more time than can help father mary armstrong laughed know how joyous feel to night have always be hopeful did seem so vague before now that have got what think to be clue can set to work at once feel ever so much nearer to seeing ronald again consequence of conversation be that mary armstrong went very frequently down to mill induced ruth powlett sometimes to come up sit with be very glad mr armstrong hiram powlett said one evening when happened to be first two to arrive in snuggery that ruth seems to take to daughter be real comfort to hesba must have thought that must have taken to of girl went to school with have suppose be too quiet for be too noisy for anyhow until now have never have friend think will do world of good be bad for girl to be alone especially girl like ruth mind telling mr armstrong hesba have idea that have got something on mind have be so changed altogether since miss carne murder might have thought that have fretted about scamp forester going away for at one time girl be very fond of before happened told that have found out must never make good husband must break off altogether with so see think going away have anything to do with once twice thought be going to say something particular to have never said sits there brood brood till make heart ache to see now have got daughter to be friend with perhaps may shake off hope may mr powlett be bad thing for girl to mope know mary like daughter very much perhaps if have anything on mind will tell mary one of day see when girl get to be friend open heart to other a wo do to one else see what can have on mind miller said shaking head may only be fancy of mine hesba have talked over score of time very likely be nothing after mr armstrong said girl get strange fancy into head make mountain out of molehill may be nothing after still perhaps must be better for telling of hiram powlett shook head decidedly ruth be girl to have fancy if be fretting be fretting over something serious know why be talking so to mr armstrong for have never spoken to one else about daughter seems to have taken so kindly to ruth that seems natural for to speak to be glad have done so mr powlett hope that good may come from talk be not until fortnight after chat mary have anything to communicate to father for found that whenever turned conversation upon topic of murder of miss carne ruth evidently shrank so much from that be obliged to change subject to day father took bull by horn ruth have be sitting there for time working without saying word when asked suddenly a if be what have be thinking over while be silent 'what be opinion ruth do think that captain mervyn really murdered cousin ' turned pale have never much colour know went a white a sheet then said ' be quite sure that did not do like talking about ' 'no of course not said can quite understand after terrible shock have still be awful to think that captain mervyn must have be driven away from home made outcast of if be innocent ' serf right ' ruth said passionately 'how dare insult threaten dear miss margaret nothing be too bad for ' ' ca quite agree with there ' said doubt deserved to be punished must have be punished by being tried for cousin murder to think of man spending life branded unjustly with crime of murder be something too terrible to think of ' dare say be doing very well ' said after pause 'doing well ' said 'doing well what can be thinking of ruth what sort of doing well can there be for man who know at moment may be recognised that story may be whispered about that neighbour may shrink away from that wife if ever marries may come to believe that husband be murderer that child may bear curse of cain upon be too terrible to think of if captain mervyn be guilty ought to have be hung if be innocent be one of most unfortunate men in world ruth did say anything be so terribly white that thought be going to faint tried to get up must see must ran got glass of water hand shook so that must hardly hold to lip after drank sat for minute two quiet then murmured something about sudden faintness that must go home persuaded to stay few minute longer at last got up be subject to fainting fit said 'it be very silly can not help yes perhaps what say about captain mervyn be right never quite saw so before good bye then went off though must see be scarcely able to walk steadily oh father feel quite sure that know something that can prove ronald be innocent if chooses think sooner later will choose first of be so decided in assertion that ronald be innocent did not say ' think ' believe said ' be quite sure ' must never have said that unless knew something quite positive then way that burst out that served right seems to have be thinking about ever since went away hour ago a if have be trying to convince that be right that must suffer to soothe own conscience for not saying what must prove innocent look like mary certainly look like be on right trail girl be sure be very heavy blow struck to day evidently felt so two three more such blow victory will be won have doubt now that ruth powlett somehow hold key of strange mystery in hand think that what have said to to day will go long way towards inducing to unlock forester be murderer of miss carne have not shadow of doubt though how know for certain be more than can even guess chapter xvii ruth powlett confesses upon morning after conversation with daughter mr armstrong have just started on way up village when met hiram powlett be just coming to see mr armstrong if can spare minute can spare hour can spare whole morning mr powlett have ceased to be working bee time be at disposal well thought must just step over speak to hiram began in slow puzzled sort of way know what be telling other day about girl yes remember very well know mr armstrong whether have said anything to daughter at least not so far a have heard of mary said that be talking together something be said about miss carne murder that daughter turned very pale that thought be going to faint be be hiram said stroking chin thoughtfully murder be at bottom of hesba think must be that talk about brings scene back to doe not seem to that account for at must give lot to know what be on girl mind came in yesterday afternoon a white a sheet fainted right off at door must think so much of because have often fainted since illness be all when mother got round went upstairs to room did come down again there be not much in must say after girl have fainted like to lie quiet bit did lie quiet must hear walking up down room for hour hesba stole up several time to door said be sobbing enough to break heart be going about house again morning that white still that be cruel to look at so thought after breakfast must put on hat come have talk with seeing that be good enough to be interested in will say be rum thing for father to come talk about daughter to man have known more than two month feel that there be one in village must like to open mind to about ruth seeing that be father of girl about same age that feel be true sort of man come to be a if thought that ruth must have done anything wrong if did must cut tongue out before must speak word know ruth have always be good girl not one of light sort earnest steady be wrong be not wrong with believe have got secret other be just wearing out if ca get to bottom of believe ruth will see christmas hiram powlett wiped eye violently believe will do best to find out if there be such secret mr powlett feel sure from what have seen of daughter that if wrong have be done of kind be not by agree with that have secret that secret be wearing out may say that daughter be of same opinion believe that there be struggle going on in mind on subject that if be to have peace a say health must unburden mind however mr powlett advice in matter be leave alone press in way think that what said to before be likely to be verified that if unburdens will be to mary may be sure be nature of secret daughter will keep inviolate unless be ruth own wish that must be told to others thankee mr armstrong thankee kindly feel more hopeful now have be worrying fretting over for month till can scarce look after work often catch going on drawing at pipe when be gone out got cold think be coming on think that cry last night meant something one way other well will see will see will be off back again to work now feel better for having have talk with hesba good woman be fond of child be what call practical look at thing hard straight sensible naturally quite enter into feeling about ruth though be fond of too well good morning mr armstrong have done good do hope will turn out a say that will get to know what be ruth trouble hour later mary armstrong went down to mill to inquire after ruth found quiet pale be glad have come in miss armstrong hesba said ruth want cheering up bit have faint yesterday when got back from place be never fit for anything after except just to sit in chair look in fire tell must be better if must rouse one can not always rouse mr powlett mary said be sure ruth doe not look equal to talking now however will sit still will tell story have never told yet be once carried off by kaffir that worse than death must have befallen must have be afterwards tortured killed if have not be rescued by brave man lawk mussy miss armstrong why make flesh creep at thought of such thing say happened to why now to look at must have thought must hardly have known what trouble meant always seem so bright happy be what ruth have said again again will judge for mr powlett if can find time to sit down listen a well a ruth can find time for hesba said though be often a sits down till tea be cleared away have lit pipe mary sat down facing fire with ruth in arm chair on one side of mr powlett stiff upright on hard settle on other then began to tell story first saying few word to let hearer know of fate of woman who fell into hand of kaffir then began with story of journey down from king williamstown sudden attack by native how after seeing father fall be carried off then told what have never told before of hideous torture of other two woman part of be compelled to witness how be told that be to be preserved a present to macomo then described dreary journey have only one hope said be so faint that must not be called hope there be one man in colony who somehow felt sure must if knew of danger try to rescue have once before come to aid when house be attacked by kaffir in few minute fate must have be sealed have not arrived for aught knew be hundred mile away what must do against three hundred native who be with still have little ray of hope faintest tiniest ray until entered amatolas be strong steep hill covered with forest bush be stronghold of kaffir knew that there be about twenty thousand native gathered there then hoped longer felt that fate be sealed only wish only longing be to obtain knife spear to kill then mary described journey through forest to kraal long hour have sat waiting for fate with movement watched by kaffir woman sensation when heard message in english then described rescue from kraal flight through wood concealment in cave escape from amatolas ride with trooper holding on saddle final dash through kaffir hearer have thrown in many interjection of horror pity loud on part of hesba mere murmur on of ruth who have taken mary hand in hers sympathetic pressure told more than word shot four of miss armstrong hesba ejaculated in wide eyed astonishment to think that young girl like must have death of four men on hand say a be unchristian because christian be not forbidden to fight for life doe seem downright awful have never troubled for single moment mary said tried to kill killed be light saw in so must if have be living in colony have not finished story ruth said earnestly surely be not end of father recovered from wound so did soldier who saved a soon a father be able to travel went down to coast came home can not be ruth whispered there must be something more to tell mary will tell time ruth mary said in equally low tone then rising put on hat again said good bye went out did ever ruth hesba powlett exclaimed a door closed never did hear such story in life to think of shooting four men quite made flesh creep did yours there be other part of story that made flesh creep great deal more mother yes be terrible did say single word in praise of what soldier have done for now seems to downright ungrateful not at what must have thought of miss armstrong suppose thought mother that there be occasion to express opinion of bravery to mention gratitude whole story seemed to cry of praise hymn of gratitude lord ruth what fancy do take in head to be sure never did hear such expression two day passed without ruth going up to armstrong on third day mary again went down well ruth a have not be to see have come to see again be coming up afternoon if mind will go back with now instead of staying here be quieter there know somehow one can not think talk when people come in out of room two three minute quite agree with ruth if mind saying so must very much rather have to myself two girl accordingly went back to cottage mary who be rather industrious needlewoman brought out basket of work ruth who for long time have scarcely taken up needle sat with hand before when two people intend to have serious conversation with other generally steer wide of subject at first present be exception think must be better for ruth to occupy with work little a do used to be fond of work ruth replied seem to be able to give attention to now begin before have done twenty stitch somehow other thought seem to go away by end of morning first twenty stitch be have done ought to think so much ruth be bad for one to be always thinking yes ca help have so much to think about get worse instead of better now after what said to other night know what to do seemed right before did not think be doing much harm in keeping silence now see have be oh so wrong twined finger in out a if suffering bodily pain poor ruth mary said coming over to kneeling down by side think know what be troubling girl shook head yes dear be almost sure have known something along must have proved captain mervyn be innocent have not said ruth powlett did not speak for minute two then said slowly know how have guessed mary one else even seems to have thought of yes be do so want one to advise what to do see now have be very wicked for long time have be fighting against have tried so hard to persuade have not done much harm because captain mervyn be acquitted have really known be wrong never thought how wrong until spoke to wait ruth mary said before tell secret must tell mine must not be fair for to tell without knowing that remember story be telling about being carried off fresh interest came into ruth face yes said promised must tell rest time thought meant of course must tell that when war out there be over must day marry soldier who have done so much for be going to tell ruth why be not going to marry oh thought must be sure to ruth said in tone of deep disappointment seemed to that be sure to be so thought man must never have risked so much for woman unless loved did love ruth loved think made secret of somehow seemed to that have right to be surprised when time went on did ask when last day came before be to march away to fight again think that if have not spoken must have done so think unmaidenly ruth be only sergeant be rich girl for father be great deal better off than seems to be thought perhaps foolish sort of pride held back for be quite sure that loved spoke first told that loved must never ask to be wife that must never marry must go through world alone to end of life oh mary how terrible ruth said pitifully how terrible be married before then ruth be worse than that there be great shadow over life have be tried for murder though have be acquitted stigma be still upon go where must might be recognised pointed out a murderer therefore unless truth be day known name cleared woman must ever be wife ruth have given little gasp a mary armstrong began then sat rigid immovable be captain mervyn said at last in low whisper yes ruth sergeant blunt be captain mervyn have changed name gone out there to hide even there have already be recognised a said for pleaded hard ruth to be allowed to share exile go where must bury in what out of way corner might sooner later one must know story must rise up against much a loved more perhaps because loved so much must never suffer to be pointed at a wife of murderer will not be ruth said more firmly than have before spoken will not be mary can clear will be mary armstrong turn to break down now goal have be reached ronald mervyn must be cleared threw arm round ruth burst into passion of tear be time before girl be sufficiently composed to renew conversation first of must tell mary ruth began that may not think more wicked than be must never have let captain mervyn suffer penalty of crime against wish almost in face of order of doctor remained in court through trial holding in hand proof of captain mervyn innocence have verdict be 'guilty be ready to rush forward prove that be innocent think that that suffered when be in hand of kaffir be worse than suffered then saw before uproar in court eye must be fixed upon way that judge counsel must blame for having so long kept silence reproach must meet with when returned home shame of dear old father way in soul in village must turn against must have dared rather than one man must suffer for sin of now having told first so that must not think too hardly of will tell then ruth told of girlish love for george forester how have clung to through evil report in spite of wish of father mother how at last incident of affray with gamekeeper have opened eye to fact that be altogether reckless wild that must never trust happiness to told how margaret carne have spoken to about how have promised must give up then told of meeting on road on way to church passionate anger against threat have uttered against miss carne for interference way in have assaulted firmly believe ruth said must have murdered have not heard people coming along road then told how found open knife stained with blood at margaret carne bedside how have hidden did not do because loved still mary said love seemed to have be killed have given up before attack made upon have shown clearly how violent be what escape have have have loved a boy be remembrance of girlish love not love then have that sealed lip even must not have silenced think have not be for sake of father old man have always be very very kind to disgrace of son being found guilty of crime must have killed can say honestly be chiefly influenced in deciding to shield a to captain mervyn be a told determined that though must keep silent if be acquitted must save if be found guilty never thought for moment that acquittal must not clear seemed to that trouble have fallen on be thoroughly deserved for way in have spoken to miss carne thought when be acquitted must take place in regiment again be none worse for what have happened be only when found that have left regiment when mr mervyn daughter shut up house went to live far away that began to trouble much saw now how wicked have be though must never quite own even to must have told then did not know who to tell to what good must do if told mr forester be dead now truth must not hurt george forester have gone away must never come back know found verdict of wilful murder against for killing keeper somehow seemed too late to do good harm one have gone why must say anything bring grief trouble on father mother make whole valley despise have be dreadful said wanly can not tell how dreadful ever since came here tried to make friend of have be fighting battle with be not right that must like be not right that one must like felt at last must tell first then one now after what have told will not be so hard of course will suffer father will suffer will do good make captain mervyn happy for truth to be known so will be able to brave all much better than must otherwise have done who will go to first can not tell ruth must speak to father will think over perhaps will write ask ronald how must like done there be great hurry for can not come home anyhow till war be finished may last for month yet well be ready to go anywhere to tell one when like ruth said look so pitiful mary be sure will be much happier whatever happens even if put in prison now have made up mind to do what be right there be fear of think ruth never asked whether have found anything though certainly hid truth did not absolutely give false evidence be wrong wicked ruth said will be quite right if punish must be nothing to what have suffered lately must feel happier in prison with weight off mind can forgive mary can forgive causing such misery to captain mervyn such unhappiness to need not be afraid about mary said laying hand assuringly on ruth shoulder why child have be benefactor to if have told about at first ronald must never have gone out to cape father must have be killed in first attack if have not be must have be tortured to death in amatolas last of must never have seen loved other trouble may have to bear reckon ronald displeasure mine among will have cause to thank day of life hope ronald will have cause to do so too kiss ruth have made happiest woman in world must give great deal to be able to set right without having to put forward in ruth be cry now be not tear of unhappiness talked for time longer sitting hand in hand then a mr armstrong step be heard coming up to cottage ruth seized hat shawl dare not see said may not look at a do yes will mary said know father be one of tenderest hearted of men ruth darted out just a door opened what be mr armstrong asked in surprise ruth powlett nearly knocked down in passage rushed off without even ordinary decency of apologising ruth have told everything father can clear ronald mervyn a soon a like mary armstrong threw arm round father neck thank god for mary felt must come sooner later have hardly hoped that must come so soon be thankful indeed child how did come about mary repeated story ruth powlett told yes there be doubt about time father said a say there must be mistake about knife because have given to have have initial engraved upon at plymouth think reasonable man must have doubt that scoundrel did now dear what be to be done next ah be for to decide think ronald ought to be consulted oh think that mr armstrong said quickly think know great deal better ought to be done than do exactly mean that father think one must like to know how must wish to be done before do anything there be particular hurry know when once know that be going to be set right beyond fact that must naturally like to get rid of thing hanging over a soon a can now idea be that girl ought to go at once to magistrate make affidavit hand over knife to know how matter be to be re opened because ronald mervyn have be acquitted other man be goodness know where well father there will be time enough to think over do think have better tell ronald first very well dear a generally have own way suppose will finally settle on whether agree now three day hence by way have got letter in pocket for from cape mail touched at plymouth yesterday why did not tell of before father girl said reproachfully well dear news be so infinitely more important that own forgot about letter besides a be fourth that have have since have be here be not of such extreme importance mary be reading letter paid attention to what father be saying presently gave sudden exclamation what be dear have changed mind married kaffir woman if so need not trouble more about affair papa be serious quite serious well dear must be serious at least must have thought must consider so no father really be extraordinary what do think say be of use thinking about mary mr armstrong said resignedly especially a suppose be going to tell have made one suggestion seems that be incorrect be what say father know that told trooper in company recognised fancied knew man face must not recall where have seen other day suddenly flashed upon be son of little farmer upon cousin estate man by name of forester often saw when be young fellow for be fond of fishing can remember a boy who be generally fishing down in mill stream fancy rather went to grief afterwards have idea be mixed up in poaching business in carne wood so think must have left country about time curious be running against here however can not be helped suppose will come out sooner later for have be in guardroom several time for drunkenness one of time will be sure to blurt out ' be that extraordinary father be certainly extraordinary coincidence mary that two men murderer of miss carne man who have suffered for murder must be out there together complicates matter good deal doe father there can be doubt of what be to be done now well now quite come round on side mary nothing must be done until mervyn know about can let know what view be must not think that must have man arrested out there merely on unsupported accusation must imagine that will want official copy of ruth powlett affidavit perhaps warrant sent out from england before can get arrested anyhow must go cautiously to work when ruth powlett speaks will make great stir here forester may have correspondent here who must write tell have happened then might make bolt of before ronald can get law at work lay hold of must rather hope for ruth sake that must do so father be

chapter xviii george forester death ronald mervyn led so active life for month after departure of mr armstrong daughter that have little time to spend in thought be only by seizing odd minute between interval of work that must manage to send home budget at proportionate in size to regularly received when courier came up with english mail there have be stern fighting for although british force be raised by arrival of reinforcement from india england to over men with several battery of artillery be with greatest difficulty that gradually won way into kaffir stronghold several time troop be so hardly pressed by enemy that must scarcely claim victory large number of officer men fell cape mounted rifle formed part of expedition into amatolas have full share of fighting ronald have several time distinguished especially in fight in water kloof valley when colonel fordyce of th carey gordon two officer of same regiment be killed together with several of men while attacking enemy in bush be aware now that secret be known to men have fancied that searching inquisitive glance be directed towards that there be change in demeanour of certain men of troop being without exception idlest worst soldier be sergeant menzies who first spoke to on subject be after hard day march when having picketed horse eaten hastily cooked ration two non commissioned officer lit pipe sat down together at short distance from fire have be wanting to speak to lad for last day two there be story gaining ground through troop that whether be true whether be false ought to know guessed a much menzies ronald said think know what story be who be man who have spread be that bore name in england yes be partly lad hear that be rightly captain mervyn yes be menzies be tried acquitted for murder in england be story lad of course make difference to who be what say have done who know must not believe to have committed murder much le murder of woman if jury in world have said have still thought must let know that story be going about so that might not be taken aback if heard suddenly of course be disgrace to be tried for murder if be found innocent only show that fool have made mistake be proved to be wrong still a have be talked about ought to know there be lot of feeling in regiment about now fellow who told story have have rough time of there be many one must put bullet into if have chance what say be whether be captain mervyn not be nothing to anybody if be tried acquitted for affair ought to have dropped nothing more be said about hold that anyhow man belonging to corp ought to have held tongue about anything knew against who be credit to man might have held tongue perhaps ronald said quietly never expected that must do so fellow come from neighbourhood bore bad character man who have shot gamekeeper must be pretty sure to tell anything knew to disadvantage of one of superior rank to well sergeant can only tell one who asks about that have questioned that admitted at once that story be true be captain mervyn be tried for murder acquitted day hope innocence may be more thoroughly proved than be on day be acquitted daresay have told whole of fact admit freely well lad be glad have spoken of course will make difference except perhaps to few men who must be better out of corp than in know too well what temper of men be to venture to show can understand now why did take commission have often wondered over for seemed to that be just thing must have liked see till thing be cleared up naturally must like well be heartily sorry for business if mind saying so have always be sure be officer before joined wondered how be that left army must have have sore time of be sorry for from heart ronald sat quiet for time thinking after sergeant menzies left then rose walked towards fire where officer be sitting can speak with few minute captain twentyman said officer at once rose anything wrong in troop sergeant sir there be nothing matter with troop be business of own may ask if have heard anything about captain twentyman heard anything in what way do mean sergeant well sir a to private history officer said somewhat puzzled well sir thing have got about among men there be one of knew at home have told others now that be known to men sooner later will be known to officer therefore thought better to come tell a captain of troop can be nothing

before scotch jury verdict must have be not proven left court acquitted indeed disgraced ruined man what be charge charge be murder ronald said quietly captain twentyman started replied ridiculous one who knew must have thought guilty for moment think that none who knew intimately believed in guilt be sure that most people who did not so know believed guilty daresay saw case in paper real name captain twentyman be ronald mervyn be captain in borderer be tried for murder of cousin margaret carne good heaven be possible captain twentyman exclaimed of course remember case perfectly saw in english paper somewhere about year ago be general matter of conversation owing of course to being in army did know what to think of then now know idea of murdering woman seems perfectly ridiculous well be there anything must wish to do sir only thought ought to be told leave with to mention to others not perhaps will think best to say nothing until story get about then can say be aware of yes think must be best captain twentyman said after thinking over remember thought when read account of trial that be one of most lucky one of most unfortunate men in world see now that be latter few day later hour two before column be about to march flag hoisted at post office tent told camp that mail have arrived orderly from corp at once hurried there a brought bag out be emptied on ground of

short distance threw on ground opened after reading first line two leaped to foot again took few step up down with breath coming fast hand twitching then stood suddenly still took off cap bent head put hand over eye stood for few minute without moving when put cap on again face be wet with tear hand be trembling so that when took letter again must scarce read sudden exclamation broke from a came upon name of forester letter be so long that trumpet be sounding by time have finished folded put in tunic then strode back with head erect to spot where men of troop be saddling horse a passed on among sudden impulse seized stopped before one of men touched on shoulder villain said have be accusing of murder be murderer man face paled suddenly know george forester ronald went on know that be guilty have to thank woman who once loved that at once hand over to provost marshal to be sent to england for trial for sake will let escape make confession sign then go way where will search will be

body man staggered a if struck knew have lost said a if to did know dropped there at moment bugle sounded will give until to morrow morning to think about ronald ran off to mount horse have saddled before going for letter sergeant menzies caught sight of comrade face a sprang into saddle eh man said what be come to have good news have of kind face be transfigured man best ronald said holding out hand to comrade be proved to be innocent menzies gave firm grip of hand then took place in rank there be desperate fighting day with kaffir cape mounted rifle while scouting ahead of infantry in bush be suddenly attacked by immense body of kaffir musket cracked assagai flew in shower several of men dropped discharging rifle trooper fell back towards infantry a retreated ronald looked back one of men of troop whose horse have be shot under have be overtaken by enemy be surrounded by score of kaffir cap be off ronald caught sight of face gave shout in instant have turned horse dashed towards group come back man come back captain twentyman shouted be madness ronald did not hear man whose confession must alone absolutely clear be in hand of kaffir must be saved at cost moment later be in midst of native emptying revolver among forester have sunk on one knee a ronald having emptied one of revolver hurled in face of kaffir leaning over caught forester by collar with mighty effort lifted threw across saddle in front of then bending over spurred horse through native just at moment captain twentyman score of men rode up at full speed drove kaffir back for instant enabled ronald to rejoin line three assagai have struck reeled in saddle a amidst cheer of companion rode up one of take wounded man in front of lieutenant daniel said carry to rear thompson do jump up behind sergeant blunt support there be time to be lost quick man fellow be coming on like fury exchange be made in minute one of men took george forester before sprang up behind ronald held in saddle with one hand while took rein in other then rode fast to rear just a leading battalion of infantry came up at run opened fire on kaffir who with wild yell be pressing on rear of cavalry when ronald recovered sens be lying in ambulance waggon surgeon be dressing wound be right sergeant said cheeringly think will do have three nasty wound by good luck think of be vital how be forester ronald asked forester surgeon repeated in surprise whom do mean blunt mean jim smith sir real name be forester there be nothing to be done for surgeon said nothing can save be riddled with spear be conscious ronald asked not at present will become conscious before dy sir know surgeon replied somewhat puzzled at ronald question may be can not say be everything to sir ronald said have be accused of great crime of be author can clear if will all future life depends upon speaking then hope may be able to speak blunt at present ca say whether will recover consciousness not be in waggon here will let know directly if there be change ronald lay quiet listening to firing gradually became more distant showing that infantry be driving kaffir back into bush wounded men be brought in fast surgeon assistant be fully occupied waggon be halted now at ronald request stretcher upon forester be lying be taken out laid on grass under shade of tree towards evening surgeon having finished pressing work came to felt george forester pulse be sinking fast said in reply to ronald anxious look will see what can do poured brandy between george forester lip held bottle of ammonia to nose presently there be deep sigh then forester opened eye for minute looked round vaguely then eye fell upon ronald so got out of hand of kaffir captain mervyn said in faint voice caught sight of among a went down know have done for must rather be buried whole than hacked into piece did best for forester mervyn said be sorry be not up minute sooner now forester see have be hit pretty hard too will do one thing for want to confess about what be speaking to will make difference to other people may a well tell truth a not forester said though see how make much difference doctor ronald said must kindly send ask captain twentyman lieutenant daniel to come here at once want to hear george forester eye be closed be breathing faintly when two officer who have ridden up few minute before with corp came up to spot surgeon again gave wounded man strong cordial will write down what say ronald asked captain twentyman latter took out note book pencil make confession forester said faintly at request of captain mervyn who risked life in getting out from among kaffir real name be george forester at home live near carnesford in devonshire be one night poaching in mr carne wood with men from dareport when came upon keeper there be fight one of keeper knocked gun out of hand a raised stick to knock on head whipped out knife opened stuck into did mean to kill be just done in moment died from ran away afterwards found that have lost knife suppose dropped be have to say not forester not said ronald who have listened with impatience to slowly uttered word of wounded man not be that about murder of miss carne want to tell murder of miss carne george forester repeated slowly know nothing about made ruth break off with nearly killed ruth must have killed if have have chance never have be glad when heard be killed know who did knife be found by body ronald said must have done forester murdered miss carne man said half raising on elbow in surprise never swear have nothing to do with rush of blood poured from mouth for one of spear have pierced lung moment later george forester fell back dead disappointment revulsion of feeling be too great for ronald mervyn fainted when recovered surgeon be leaning over illustration george forester death must talk lad must keep quite quiet will have fever setting in sort of trouble ronald closed eye lay back quietly how must be thought of mary armstrong letter of chain of proof have accumulated against george forester seemed absolutely convincing yet there be doubting ring of truth in last word of dying man surprise at accusation be genuine assertion of innocence absolutely convincing have motive for lying be dying knew besides thing have come so suddenly upon there must have be time for to frame lie even if have be in mental condition to do so whoever killed margaret carne ronald mervyn be at once convinced that be not george forester there lay thinking for hour over disappointment that news must be to mary armstrong how seemed more unlikely than ever that mystery must ever be cleared up now gradually thought became more vague until at last fell asleep upon following day wounded be sent down under escort to king williamstown there for month ronald mervyn lay in hospital have written few line to mary armstrong saying that have be wounded not dangerously that need not be anxious about more for kaffir be now almost driven from last stronghold that fighting must almost certainly be over before be fit to mount horse again george forester be dead said be mortally wounded when fighting bravely against kaffir fear dear idea about be mistaken that like have be victim of circumstantial evidence will tell more about when write to next while lying there ronald thought over evidence have be collected against george forester debated with whether must be published a mary have proposed must doubtless be accepted by world a proof of forester guilt of own innocence even fact that man when dying have denied must weigh for very little with public for men proved indisputably to be guilty often go to scaffold asserting innocence to last must be right to throw crime upon dead man when be sure that be innocent for ronald did not doubt for moment truth of denial have right even for sake of mary happiness own to charge memory of dead man with burden of foul crime ronald felt that must not be temptation be strong fought long against at last mind be made up said at last will not do george forester be doubt bad man be not so bad a must be worse to charge memory with than to accuse if be alive in one case might clear in other can not can not clear name by fouling that of dead man so ronald at last sat down to write long letter to mary armstrong telling whole circumstance joy with received news conversation with george forester seemed wholly to confirm view pang of agony have felt when saw man who believed must alone clear in hand of kaffir desperate charge to rescue then gave word of confession expressed absolute conviction that dying man have spoken truth that be really innocent of margaret carne murder then discussed question of still publishing ruth powlett statement giving first cause of george forester enmity against margaret carne threat have uttered then discovery of knife fear will be ashamed of mary when tell that for time almost yielded to temptation of clearing at expense must make allowance for strength of temptation on one side be thought of honour restored of won on other thought now george forester be dead must not harm of course finally put temptation aside honour purchased at expense of dead man reputation must be dishonour indeed now can face disgrace because know be innocent must not bear honour when knew have done dishonourable action know must utterly forfeit love esteem did do so can look straight in face now must never look straight in face then grieve too much over disappointment be now only a be when said good bye to have hope then that must ever succeed in clearing have hope now have not got up strength again yet be therefore perhaps just at present little more disposed to repine over disappointment than ought to do will wear off when get in saddle again there will think be more fighting at rate with sandilli kaffir for hear morning that have sent in to beg for peace be certain will be glad enough to grant for have not much to boast about in campaign of course will have to pay very heavy fine in cattle will have to move across to other side of kei equally of course there will be trouble again with after time when memory of loss have somewhat abated fancy portion of force will march against basuto whose attitude have lately be very hostile now that gaikas have given in be free to use whole force against be scarcely probable will venture to try conclusion with if settle down peaceably will probably apply for discharge perhaps go in for farming carry out first idea of joining party of trader going up country getting shooting among big game know disappointed a will be with news contained in letter will be pleasure to to tell girl have made friend that after man once loved be innocent of terrible crime must have suffered horribly while be hiding what thought be most important part of evidence now will see that have really done harm a seem to be really fond of will be sure be great pleasure to to be able to restore peace of mind in respect must think now that father will not remain longer at carnesford where neither of have fitting society of sort will go settle somewhere in proper position must much rather that did for now seems absolutely certain that nothing further be to be learned must trouble to think of wasting life at carnesford said in last letter that discovery have made have brought four year nearer to happiness have never said word to admit must change mind at end of five year that father spoke of still know mary think position be stronger by great deal than be six month ago told captain who be other officer now know most of came up spoke very kindly to before started on way down here be sure that when leave corp will give testimonial saying that be convinced by behaviour while in corp must not have be guilty of crime own be le sensitive on subject than be one have time to be morbid while leading life a have be for last nine month perhaps will not say more now think somehow at end of five year will leave decision in hand have taken two three day to write letter for be not strong enough to stick to for more than hour at time a post go out afternoon must close now have be expecting mail from england for day be considerably overdue need not say how be longing for letter from hear regiment will be back from front to night men horse want few day rest before starting on long march to basutoland will be very glad to see back again of course invalid who like be somewhat pulled down by wound be disgusted at being kept here weather be frightfully hot even in shirt sleeve will be hardly able to enjoy christmas day cape rifle arrived at king williamstown hour after post have left in evening colonel several of officer paid visit to hospital to see how wounded be getting on ronald who be sitting reading by bedside other invalid who be strong enough to be on foot at once got up stood at attention stopping speaking few word to of men of own corp colonel came on mervyn said a officer came up to ronald want to shake hand have heard story from captain twentyman wish to tell in own name in of other officer of regiment that be sure have be victim of horrible mistake of be absolutely convinced that man who have shown such extreme gallantry a have whose conduct have be so excellent from day joined be wholly incapable of such crime a with be charged be of course acquitted at same time think that can not be satisfaction for to know that have won esteem of officer comrade in eye be free from slightest taint of black business give hand ronald be unable to speak colonel officer shook by hand former said must have long talk with when get back from basuto business have mentioned very strongly in regimental order upon two occasion for extreme gallantry can not think that must do good in eye of public be letter signed by to appear in english paper saying that sergeant blunt of regiment who have so signally distinguished be really captain mervyn who in opinion that of officer be cruelly injured man can talk over when see again after officer left room ronald mervyn sat for time with face buried in hand colonel word have greatly moved surely letter a colonel somerset have proposed to write must do much to clear must never think of taking own name again re entering society in must be likely to be recognised with such testimonial a in favour might hope in quiet place to live down past must again be recognised must still hold up head with such honourable record a to produce in favour then thought went back to england what must mary father say when read letter in paper must be proof of innocence yet felt sure that mary must insist upon regarding a such must hold that have right to keep waiting for four year indeed acknowledged to that if did so must have right to refuse longer to permit to be mistress of own fate chapter xix fire at carne hold thing went on quietly with mr armstrong daughter after latter have despatched letter saying that ruth powlett be ready to confess truth respecting george forester excitement of following up clue be over there be nothing to do until heard from ronald a to how wished to proceed so one morning

hiram powlett said now stranger who looked at hold must say what pleasant open looking house be when took inside told what have happened there must be enough to give creep believe be being up there be beginning of daughter changing so never made worse job of thing than did when got up there a miss carne maid yet be for good now neighbour be time to be off be quarter to nine be five minute later than usual mr armstrong mary sat talking until nearly eleven about what have heard about mr carne have not be gone minute when ran down again from bedroom be at back of house father there be light in sky up at top of hill just where carne hold lie went to window to draw down blind caught eye at once mr armstrong ran out into road a mary have said there be glare of light over tree on hill rising

run of overtook mr armstrong a hurried up hill be that mr armstrong voice asked behind yes be carey thought be smith said caught sight of figure against light up there in front must help thinking when shouted at door that there be fire at hold what be talking about evening saying that if place be yours must pull down stone by stone perhaps may save yet will have couple of score of men there in few minute fancy there be not much chance of carey spoke to groom a rode through tell that fire when came away be bursting from several of lower window so have got good hold be not likely to have much water handy be true enough there be big well hundred foot deep in stable yard force pump take two men to work supplied house a well a stable be only water there will be wo be much good added a on emerging from wood suddenly caught sight of house from whole of lower window in front flame be bursting out be travelled fast smith said dining room drawing room library be on fire yes be curious too mr armstrong remarked one must have thought must have mounted up to next floor long before travelled so far along on level ah be going up to floor above now a spoke spout of light flame suddenly appeared through window over front door be staircase window suppose two three minute running took up on to lawn will go lend hand at pump jacob carey said be not slightest use mr armstrong replied might a well try to blow out that fire with breath a to put out by throwing few pail of water on let see one be out first be main matter joined group of men woman who be standing looking at flame be two woman groom gardener four five men who have already come up from village gardener be speaking be use to work at pump there be only four five pail if be only at one end might prevent spreading be got hold over ca make out groom said one of horse be sick be down there giving hot fomentation with mate have be there perhaps hour when saw light coming out of drawing room window ran up shouting then saw there be light in dining room library too then ran round to back of house housekeeper room there be alight too run in at kitchen door upstairs woke gardener got out place be so full of smoke be a much a must do to get downstairs then got long ladder put against mr wilson window got girl down then came round side got up broke pane in mr carne window shouted must not make hear so broke pane

carey said have best keep look out round house so a to be ready to put ladder up at once if see there be nothing else to do be there mr armstrong be accustomed to sort of trouble may know best what ought to do ca think of anything mr armstrong replied if be not in own room seems hopeless to search for see flame have broken out from several window of first floor own idea be from what say a to fire having spread into room on ground floor when discovered that poor gentleman must have set fire to house in dozen place a likely a not may have be suffocated almost at once must wonder if be smith said be not natural that fire must have spread over lower part of house in such short time know what be saying evening be just sort of trick for madman to play smith be interrupted by sudden exclamation from standing round followed by shout of there be dormer window on roof of oldest part of house opened figure stepped out on to low parapet ran round house right sir right jacob carey shouted out at top of voice will have ladder for in time score of men ran to fetch long ladder be leaning against side of house be soon lowered brought round placed against parapet close to where reginald carne be standing now then sir jacob carey shouted again be all right can come down safe enough mr carne paid attention to shout be pacing up down along parapet be tossing arm about in strange manner suddenly turned seized ladder pushed violently sideways along parapet below vainly tried to keep steady look out smith shouted leave go clear out will have down on men holding ladder dashed away from foot ladder fell with crash upon ground while peal of wild laughter broke out from above squire have gone clean mad jacob carey said to mr armstrong a joined fire have driven mad what be more likely went mad first then lit fire however must save if can look there carey if lifted ladder put up between chimney window next to ca slide one way a did before certainly must not throw backwards if plant foot well away from house be right enough smith agreed if wo come down wo must go up make carey if couple of strong men go up together ought to be able to master of course must take up rope with bind then lower down ladder might do that smith said supposing ladder catch fire fire wo touch at point carey see will go up just between row of window so will anyhow might take up long rope if have got one so a to lower down if ladder doe catch fire spoke to one of groom have got plenty of rope plenty man said will fetch couple of long coil from stable here one of come along with now will get ladder up mr armstrong said with aid of dozen men for whole village be now upon spot ladder be again lifted dropped so that upper end fell between chimney dormer window reginald carne again attempted to cast down number of men hung on to lower part of ladder be unable to lift far enough to get out of niche into have fallen then turned round shook fist at crowd something flashed in light of flame dozen voice exclaimed have got knife at moment clergyman doctor arrived together on scene what be to be done doctor jacob carey asked mind going up with others to back to have tussle with on roof must knife one by one a got up to parapet though think a be coward care about chucking away life be of use to wife child to save of madman whose life ai of use to hisself one else see why must carey doctor said best plan will be to keep away from ladder for present perhaps when think be not going to make attempt will move away then can get up there before see will go first because know influence may quiet have better arm with stick so a to knock knife out of hand reginald carne stood guarding ladder for few minute by time whole of first floor be in blaze flame rushing out with fury from window seeing that did not move doctor said at last well must risk give stick carey will make try anyhow ca go now mr armstrong said suddenly look ladder be alight be indeed case flame have not

silently be grand thing to put end to curse reginald carne rambled on be pain to if have lived trouble must have come upon child know that be hurt beyond chance of recovery carne magistrate said gravely be terrible story that have told think that ought to put down on paper so that other people may know how be done because see at present innocent man be suspected what do care be nothing to one way other be glad have succeeded in frightening ronald mervyn away hope will never come back again suppose be going to help to bring home mr volkes saw that have made mistake yes quite understand want back said soothingly thought perhaps that must like people to know how have sacrificed to put end to curse how cleverly have managed to deceive one people must never believe if be to tell must say that did not know what be talking about that be empty boasting on part may think what like said sullenly be nothing to what think there be change in tone of voice caused doctor to put hand on wrist again let give few drop more of brandy carne will not dying man said suppose want to keep alive to get more out of wo wo speak again others held whispered conversation in corner be going fast doctor said be marvel that voice be a strong a be certainly wo live till morning be likely may die within hour will ask question two mr volkes said if must get something to corroborate story must be invaluable reginald carne spoke more heard what be said to for laughed same malicious laugh have thrilled crowd a stood on parapet be low feeble now in hope that might yet change mind mr volkes clergyman remained with dr arrowsmith for hour at end of time reginald carne startled by speaking again clearly distinctly tell be over witch have done harm enough have beaten be against have won there be nothing more for to do here can go to place carne hold be down curse be broken a ceased speaking doctor moved quietly up to side of stretcher put finger on wrist stood there for minute then bent down listened be gone said poor fellow be dead three gentleman went outside cottage of people be standing near waiting for news of reginald carne state mr carne have just died doctor said a went up to will one of find mr wilson tell to bring woman with see to in morning will make arrangement to have taken down to village what do think have better do about dr arrowsmith mr volkes asked a rejoined do believe story unquestionably do doctor replied believe word of man be mad doctor yes be mad have be so for long time in opinion that make difference whatever in confidence that be speaking truly confession of kind from madman be generally true cunning be prodigious a long a wish to conceal fact be next to impossible to get from when a in present case be proud of cleverness of success with have fooled other people will tell everything see idea of right wrong be entirely upset real lunatic be unconscious of having committed crime be inclined even to glory in wish must have got to sign magistrate said be sure must not have held pen dr arrowsmith replied will certify to effect a three heard confession think that if draw out sign a witness will have just a good effect a if have written there be one part doctor surprised even more than rest be part relating to man forester believe soul suspected of being in way connected with crime at least heard nothing of knife being found of course of quarrel between forester girl ruth powlett be not be new to doctor said think best way must be to see in morning may not like to confess that concealed knife if did so of course if doe will be invaluable confirmation of story will show conclusively that confession be not mere delusion of madman brain yes indeed doctor agreed must clench matter altogether be almost certain will find that what have said be true girl be in hand short time before miss carne death said have have fall to mind seemed more like severe mental shock then after miss carne death be very ill again there be something about puzzled good deal for instance insisted upon remaining in court until verdict be given at time when be so ill must scarcely stand be so obstinate over matter that completely puzzled if what carne said be true have knowledge of something must have gone very far to prove ronald mervyn innocence matter be explained only difficulty before be to get to speak because of course can not do so without laying open to charge mean criminal charge moral one of having suppressed evidence in manner concerned man life think best plan will be for to meet at house mr volkes at eleven o'clock to morrow will go into village before will bring ruth powlett up in gig if will allow will do talking to have have good deal in hand for last year think have confidence in will perhaps answer more freely than must a magistrate very likely must doctor let arrangement stand a propose next morning at half past ten dr arrowsmith drove up in gig to mill ruth came to door ruth said want to put on bonnet shawl let drive short distance have something particular want to talk to about want to have to myself for bit good deal surprised ruth went into house reappeared in two three minute warmly wrapped up be right doctor said jump in ruth powlett be first to speak suppose be true sir poor mr carne be dead yes died at two o'clock ruth have curious thing to tell about will wait until get through village have doubt that will surprise a much a surprised ruth said nothing until have crossed bridge over dare what be asked at last well ruth at present be only known to mr vickery mr volkes happens want to say nothing about until give leave now ruth have sort of idea that what be going to tell will relieve mind of burden ruth turned pale relieve mind sir repeated yes ruth may be wrong if be can only say beforehand be sorry have idea that suspect have for long time suspected that george forester murdered miss carne ruth did not speak looking down doctor saw by pallor of cheek expression of face that supposition be correct think ruth have be idea if so can relieve mind mr carne before death confessed that murdered sister ruth gave start cry reeled in seat must have fallen have not doctor thrown arm round steady child steady said be surprise to have doubt whatever be to others probably joyful one ruth broke into violent fit of sobbing doctor did not attempt to check when gradually recovered said that be strange news be not ruth did mean sir asked did know what be saying when said so knew perfectly well ruth told long story will not tell what be now will be at mr volkes in minute will find mr vickery there want to tell know about before hear what mr carne story be do hope that will tell everything know only in way can clear captain mervyn will tell everything know sir ruth said quietly told miss armstrong five week ago be only waiting till heard from one have written to before telling to one gig now drew up at door of magistrate house dr arrowsmith led ruth into sitting room where mr volkes clergyman be awaiting sit down here ruth doctor said handing chair now gentleman may tell first have told miss powlett mr carne have confessed that killed sister have not told single word more be of course of highest importance that must not know nature of story before telling own have expressed willingness to tell know now miss powlett will please begin in own way quietly steadily ruth powlett told story beginning with conversation that have have with margaret carne relative to breaking off engagement described interview with george forester threat against miss carne attack on herself then told how have found knife by bedside on morning of murder said knew now that have done very wrong to conceal that have done for sake of george forester father lastly told how have gone to trial taking knife with firmly resolved that in case verdict of guilty must be returned against captain mervyn must come forward produce knife tell that knew three hearer exchanged many look of satisfaction a went on when have finished mr volkes said be very much obliged to for story miss powlett happily agrees precisely with told by mr carne seems that be in wood overheard quarrel with forester threat against miss carne suggested to idea of throwing blame upon forester to do placed knife that have found on scene of poaching affray short time before in sister room after confirmation given by story there can be doubt at mr carne confession be genuine that will completely clear captain mervyn of suspicion of having caused cousin death will be obliged be afraid to make story public also in order to confirm statement will naturally cause much pain unpleasantness hope will accept that a inevitable consequence of course see have be very mistaken one pursued in affair be prepared for sir ruth said quietly have already told miss armstrong about be ready to come here to tell story even when thought that by so doing must have to denounce george forester a murderer be so rejoiced that be now proved to be innocent can very well bear what may be said about why not have come told at once when made up mind to do so mr volkes asked why delay be waiting sir be waiting paused that secret be not own think sir that if will go to mr armstrong will be able to tell something will be glad to know who be mr armstrong mr volkes asked in surprise be gentleman who have be living in village for last four five month sir think there can be harm in telling that know where captain mervyn be to be found be very information want at present must get ronald mervyn back among a soon a can have indeed be very hardly treated in matter think miss powlett will get to put story into form of sworn information may a well draw up at once will save trouble of coming up here again be accordingly done ruth powlett walked back to village leaving mr volkes two other gentleman to draw up formal report of confession made by reginald carne ruth powlett went straight to cottage occupied by armstrong what be news ruth mary said a entered can see by face that have something important to tell have indeed ruth replied have just be up to mr volkes magistrate have told knew what induced to do ruth mary asked in surprise thought have quite settled to say nothing about until heard from captain mervyn knew about before told only sent for to confirm story mr carne before died last night made full confession before mr volkes dr arrowsmith mr vickery be who in madness killed sister who placed george forester knife by bedside captain mervyn glove on grass to throw suspicion on captain mervyn george forester be innocent news be so sudden unexpected that be time before mary armstrong must sufficiently recover to ask question news that ronald be proved to be innocent be not so startling a must have be have not previously believed that be already in position to clear knowledge that innocence must now be publicly proclaimed in day two filled with happiness be glad too for ruth sake that george forester have not committed terrible crime yet there be slight feeling of disappointment that have have hand in clearing lover that have come about in entirely different way to what have expected mr volkes clergyman called afternoon have long talk with mr armstrong following day thrill of excitement be caused throughout country by publication in paper of confession of reginald carne dr arrowsmith certified that although reginald carne be unquestionably insane probably have be so for year have hesitation in saying that be perfectly conscious at time made confession that statement might be believed a implicitly a if made by wholly sane man in addition to certificate confession three gentleman signed joint declaration to effect that narrative be absolutely confirmed by other fact especially by statement made by miss powlett without being in way aware of confession of reginald carne pointed out fully confirmed story on point must leave shadow of doubt in mind of one reginald carne have under influence of madness taken sister life have then with cunning so commonly present in insanity thrown suspicion upon two wholly innocent person newspaper commenting on story remarked strongly upon cruel injustice have be inflicted upon captain mervyn expressed hope that must soon return to take place again in county uniting in person estate of mervyns carnes there be expression of strong reprobation at concealment by ruth powlett of knife have found in miss carne room one of paper however admitted that perhaps altogether be fortunate now that girl concealed have fact now published in statement be given must at once have convinced one captain mervyn did not commit crime with be charged at same time might have brought innocent man to scaffold upon whole then although conduct in concealing important news be most reprehensible must be admitted that in interest of justice be fortunate kept silent sensation caused in carnesford by publication of news be tremendous fortunately ruth powlett be not there to become centre of talk for have that morning be carried off by mr armstrong mary to stay with for while in cottage be shut up upon following day cart arrived from plymouth to carry off furniture have be only hired by month evening before leaving mr armstrong have intercepted hiram powlett on way to snuggery taking up to cottage where ruth be spending evening with mary informed on way of strange discovery have be made ruth share in trust mr powlett said that will not be angry with daughter be placed in terrible position having option of denouncing a murderer man have loved permitting to lie under imputation of guilt must remember that be prepared to come forward at trial tell truth about matter have captain mervyn be found guilty doubt acted wrongly have suffered terribly think that a daughter have forgiven for allowing captain mervyn to suffer for silence may also do so hiram powlett have uttered many expression of surprise concern a listened to story seemed to very terrible that girl must have time be keeping secret of such vital importance now said in tone of surprise understand mr armstrong about daughter what have miss mary to do with forgiving how have be injured know that upon whole have be injured mr armstrong said at least be sure doe not consider so still think have something to forgive for fact be be engaged to be married to captain mervyn must have be wife year ago have not be resolved never to marry so long a cloud remained over hiram powlett be so greatly surprised at news that thought be for moment diverted from ruth misdemeanour captain mervyn owner of hall now of carne estate also be very great man in eye of people of carnesford news that be engaged to be married to girl who be friend of daughter who have several time taken tea at mill be almost bewildering to dare say be surprised mr armstrong said quietly see be not exactly what appear came here somewhat under false colour to try find out about murder in hope might discover proof of captain mervyn innocence now have be successful will go up to london there await captain mervyn return have be talking over with daughter if mr powlett offer opposition propose to take ruth away to stay with for two three month will be pleasant for party girl mine be fond of other ruth will be nice companion for mary change will do daughter good have for long time be suffering greatly fresh scene object of interest will take mind off past lastly by time return here gossip talk will arise when be known will have died away be very good of to think of mr armstrong hiram powlett said will be fine thing for ruth of course have be wrong very wrong must have suffered very much month told thought have something on mind never thought be like well well sha say anything to never be good at scolding when be child think have be severely punished for already think so too mr armstrong agreed now let go in told must speak to evening must be waiting anxiously for when entered ruth rose timidly oh father began there say more about ruth hiram interrupted taking tenderly in arm poor girl have have hard time of why did tell at first must not father sobbed know know how be set against well be so ruth must have be still more set against if have known right of fall of yours upon hill there wo say anything more about have be punished for fault child hope that when come back again to from jaunt mr armstrong be going to be good enough to take will be just a be before trouble came upon so next morning mr armstrong daughter ruth went up to london two month later mary received ronald letter telling of george forester death of own disappointment at finding hope of clearing dashed to ground mary broke news of forester death to ruth received quietly be sorry said have be nothing to for long time now must never have be anything to again be sorry repeated wiping eye that boy played with be gone for man think be perhaps better so
