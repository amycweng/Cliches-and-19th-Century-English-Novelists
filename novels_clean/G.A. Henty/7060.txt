burgundy party began at once to make preparation for war now for own view of quarrel king henry sent for year since asked for whom must hold castle if orleans burgundy came to blow adding that burgundy must be viewed by with most favour father grandfather ever fought faithfully in service of england ' said 'but for year past now line betwixt majesty possession of france have be drawn in estate castle of villeroy now lie beyond line be therefore vassal of france a well a of majesty being known to men even before became lord of summerley on marriage with majesty ward mistress margaret like father held to be liege man of king of england be therefore viewed with much hostility by neighbour right gladly must seize upon excuse to lay complaint against before king in order might be deprived of fief castle 'this must fain hold always for majesty seeing how be situated few mile across frontier be must humbly submit to of importance to majesty that must be held by one faithful to since possession in hand of enemy must greatly hinder english army marching out from calais to invasion of france be place of strength now be in french hand might be made very much stronger must cost much time loss of men to besiege at present majesty be in alliance with burgundy none can say how war will go what change will take place must orleanist gain upper hand will be quick to take advantage of having fought for burgundy must confiscate estate hand over to one who might be hostile to england pledged to make castle stronghold must greatly hinder bar advance of english army upon paris therefore sire must not for own sake for sake of majesty self successor pray to let for while remain quietly at summerley until course of event in france be determined ' king be pleased to see force of what urged a far a have inclination in case be towards cause not of burgundy whose murder of orleans be alike treacherous indefensible of cause seeing that flanders be wholly under authority that in artois be well nigh paramount at present on other hand amiens ponthieu lie short distance to south of be strongly orleanist have therefore motive for standing aloof so far fortune of war have be so changeable that one can not say that chance incline towards one faction more than other even church have failed to bring about end of trouble orleanist have be formally placed under interdict cursed by book bell candle king command have be laid upon to put aside quarrel ban of church king command have be ineffectual be a anxious a ever to abstain from taking part in trouble more so a alliance between king burgundy have cooled somewhat have received such urgent prayer from vassal at villeroy to come among since be now being plundered by party feel be time for to take up abode there when king stayed at winchester month since laid matter before be pleased to say that what have urged year ago have turned out to be a foretold that must give leave to go over establish at villeroy to hold aloof from party until matter must further ripen what will come of can not say english king seemed to to be ailing fear that may not be long before young henry come to throne be wild young prince have already shown in northern war to be full of spirit courage methinks that when come to throne will not long observe peaceful policy of father that will see royal standard once again spread to wind of france sir eustace guy said when have concluded how do matter affect thought that by treaty west part of artois be english ay lad be so settled at time strength of france have be broken at poitier black prince army be so feared that term be willingly accepted in order to secure peace much have happened since then war have be constantly going on sometimes hotly sometimes sluggishly france have have own trouble a english king have be more pacific england have become weary of bearing heavy expense of war treaty have become dead letter gascony in province armagnac be greatest lord be altogether lost to england a be greater part of guienne great proportion of people there be always bitterly opposed to change a know even in time of black prince there be great rebellion trouble since then town after town castle after castle have declared for france real effort have ever be made by english to win back again who in england be english baron so long a thing go on a at present french noble while in france be in perilous position between two suzerain be english army to land must join for still hold to be vassal of king of england a have be for three generation a to french dispute fear that sooner later will have to declare in favour of one party other for will be difficult to stand altogether aloof from conflict because men at least men of condition be well nigh forced to take one side other plea be baron of england will be of avail for side must turn against be glad of excuse for pillaging confiscating estate at present then must regard solely a french noble for villeroy have passed into hand of france just a for while passed into hand of england if war go on will have to take side to side do thought incline sir eustace if may ask love not side guy must fain if must be so that sword must remain in sheath fear that will have to go with burgundy for be powerful in artois have be altogether free to choose must have sided with orleans in first place be certain that last duke be foully murdered by burgundy who thereby laid foundation for present trouble there be jealousy before a there have always be between great noble act forced almost to take side duke of berri brittany who have be of party of late duke of burgundy be driven by foul act of son to range with orleans armagnac be very powerful in south berri dukedom be in north that of orleans to north

province countships neighbour ay family become split up into faction a interest family tie desire to increase estate by annexing next to may influence mind of men so long a be war between great duke prince of france smaller men may hope to hold aloof a go on evil deed be done on side men passion become heated spirit spread until man hand be against neighbour who join not against one other find ready to oppress rob must not have cared to bring out english following with have be forced to march distance through france a villeroy be few mile from frontier of distance well nigh half be through own estate can reach castle almost unnoticed once there fact have strengthened garrison will keep from attack for party must be chary in attacking one who can defend stoutly be minded to leave lady

trouble in france a soon a be heard that lord lady have returned vassal of villeroy came in to pay respect present of fowl game provision of kind poured in table in banqueting hall be bountifully spread cask of wine broached who came received entertainment a french be still spoken good deal at english court among noble baron be considered part of necessary education of person of gentle blood guy who have always used in conversation with father have difficulty in performing duty of seeing that want of who came be well attended to in few day guest of higher degree came in knight baron of part of province few of expressed surprise at height of sturdy men at arm archer loitering about court yard sir eustace always answered remark made on subject by saying yes dame margaret thought that instead of keeping retainer doing nothing in castle in england where there be at present use whatever for service might a well bring couple of score of over here have wish to take part in of trouble seem likely to disturb france there be never saying what may happen at rate cost more to feed men here than in english archer men at arm be well satisfied with quarter food be soon on good term with french associate garrison before arrival have consisted of fifty men at arm although have mean of communicating verbally with new arrival be not long in striking up such acquaintance a must be gained by friendly gesture clinking of wine cup quarter be beside of english whole of men at arm daily performed exercise in court yard together under command of castellan while archer marched out across drawbridge practised shooting at butt pitched there to french men at arm performance appeared astounding french have never taken to archery cross bow be in use among half of french men at arm have be trained in use of weapon be considered more valuable in case of siege than of warfare in field while be able to send bolt a far a bowman must shoot arrow there be comparison whatever in point of accuracy archer must discharge score of arrow while cross bowman be winding up weapon pardieu master page jean bouvard said one day a stood with guy watching shooting of archer no longer wonder at way in english defeated at cressy poitier have heard from father who fought at poitier how terrible be rain of arrow be poured upon knight when charged up hill against english have never thought that men must shoot with such skill strength be yesterday that set men at arm to try bend one of english bow not one of must draw arrow anywhere near head with effort while men seem to do so with greatest ease speed with can shoot off arrow after arrow well nigh pass belief that tall fellow who be chief now sent twenty arrow into space no greater than hand breadth at hundred twenty yard so quickly that scarce seemed to take time to aim at others be well nigh a skilful yesterday put up breastplate such a be worn by men at arm asked to shoot at at eighty yard fired volley together at be riddled like colander not one of five twenty arrow have failed to pierce ay at distance captain english archer of fair skill must not miss need milan armour that of best to keep out arrow by lady captain remarked

difficulty lift from ground hurl twenty yard away whirl heavy ax round head a if be reed be picked men guy said with laugh must not take that englishman be of equal strength though doubt sir eustace must have gathered five hundred a strong have wished if be so captain said can well believe that if france england meet again on field of battle france will be beaten a be before however there be one comfort will not be among defeated for lord father grandfather before have ever be with england sir eustace having english wife mother being vassal of english crown for estate in england will assuredly take part in case of quarrel of course at present hold to be neutral though lord leaning towards england give umbrage to neighbour enmity find expression since for year now there have be righting to speak of between two nation how will be if orleans burgundy come to blow know not if do so methinks lord will have to declare for one other may have upon man with broad estate on many cast covetous eye can scarce stand altogether aloof however if villeroy be attacked methinks with following sir eustace have brought with across sea even burgundy will find that must cost so dearly to capture castle that be best left alone how about vassal will fight for lord jean bouvard answered confidently see father grandfather fought under black prince be natural that leaning must be on side then know that there be better lord in artois than sir eustace dame have made much beloved among there be fear that will disobey lord order whatever be will fight a bid for orleans burgundy england

ever be carried into castle tell there be not man for over fifty mile round who doe not envy vassal of villeroy must be happy land indeed be lord like ours be to hoist flag on keep fire gun man on estate must muster here before sunset must march against king of france did sir eustace order to do so in case what force must put on wall captain two hundred men besides garrison have provision stored away in keep sufficient for woman child for three month siege sir eustace gave order yesterday to procure wood of kind used for arrow to lay in great store of also to set smith to work to make arrow head asked how many said 'let go on at until further order must like store sufficient at least for hundred round for of english archer if have double that must be better can make own arrow if have suitable wood seemed to that two hundred round be beyond necessity now when see that men can shoot nigh twenty round minute can well understand that great supply for be needful time passed very pleasantly at villeroy sometimes guy rode with lord lady when went out hawking paid visit to neighbouring castle regularly day practised for two hour in arm although well instructed before guy gained much additional skill from teaching of jean bouvard who be famous swordsman latter be surprised at finding that page be able to draw english bow a well a archer that although inferior to long tom three four of best shot be quite a good marksman a majority moreover though of gentle blood must join with men in bout of quarter staff took more heed of broken head than did illustration guy have head bound up after bout at quarter staff pardieu master page said one day when guy came in from court yard to have head be streaming with blood bound up french page must marvel indeed if saw practise in arm a do save with shooting must consider must demean sorely to join in such rough sport with inferior to run risk of getting beauty spoiled by rough blow wonder knight strike so mightily in battle when be accustomed to strike so heavily in sport saw one of men at arm yesterday bury axe to very head in block of oak wagered stoup of wine that two of men at arm must get axe out won fairly for indeed took four of knave at handle to tug out then indeed needed strength armour ever forged must have withstood blow must have cracked casque skull inside like egg shell seemed to that thousand such men with a many archer must march through france from end to end if kept well together be well supplied with meat drink by way must need that for be a good trencherman a be fighter indeed man amongst eats a much a three of fellow yes want to be well fed guy laughed be rarely pleased with provision that make for surely not one of ever fed so well before food doe not cost much captain said have herd

be terrible blow to latter be cause of scarce concealed gratification among former two month have be spent at castle have to english be somewhat monotonous time prospect of active service of giving taking of blow made blood course more rapidly through vein be prospect of fighting rather than of pay have attracted to service of sir eustace then a for century previous until quite modern day frenchman be regarded a natural foe of england however large force english king wished to collect for service in france have never difficulty whatever in obtaining number asked for be ready cheerfully to give battle whatever odds against english archer confidence in skill be indeed supreme before shaft of forefather flower of french chivalry have gone down like rush before scythe from being mere accessory to battle english archer have become backbone of force skill in fact have revolutionized warfare have broken power of cavalry have added to dignity value of infantry who have become a have ever since continued to be prime factor in warfare consequently english archer men at arm went about work of preparation with zest cheerfulness showed satisfaction in why tom guy said to tall leader of archer look a pleased a if be feast rather than fray for be preparing so feel master guy for what have be practising with bow since be eight year old might when time came send arrow straight through bar of french vizor in faith began to think must never have opportunity of exercising skill on anything more worthy than target peeled wand since king have given up leading army across sea there be way to take service with lord when heard that wanted small company of archer for defence of castle over here since have come have seemed to that be taking pay food under false pretence that

of english maid to watch prowess here master guy here will fight for own satisfaction prove to ourselves that be a good men a father be know naught of quarrel have sir eustace taken into field to fight for one other of faction concerning know nothing must doubtless have done duty fought manfully be glad here be doing what came for be going to defend castle against frenchman of sort other who must do ill to lord lady will fight right heartily joyfully must still do so be mad king of france who marched against besides master must be le than men if did not feel for frightened woman child who having done wrong caring naught for faction be forced to flee from home for life so will strike in just a must strike in be to come upon band of robber ill treating woman at home think that will come master added eagerly that can not say surely tom sir eustace have news that burgundians have already seized several town placed garrison there that armed band be traversing country burning pillaging whether will feel strong enough to make attack on castle know not belike will do so for sir eustace belonging a doe a father have done before to english party neither of others will feel good will towards of neighbour may well be glad to take advantage of troubled time to endeavour to despoil of castle possession will want to have good teeth to crack nut master guy good teeth strong methinks that who come to pluck feather may well go back without own have rare store of shaft ready will find that cross bowman be of little use against picked english archer even though there be twenty five of in know very well long tom that must have come over here whether there be chance of drawing bow on frenchman not be true enough master guy lady wanted bowman who have be born bred on estate be of course bound to go with then see master guy have taught to use bow quarter staff carried on shoulder many score of time when be little lad be big boy must not have be natural for to have gone out with chance of getting into fight without being there to draw shaft when needed why ruth gregory whose sworn bachelor know be must have cried shame on if have lingered behind told that if stayed must be for sake must have seen how flouted saying that must have tall lout hiding behind petticoat that if stayed must not be a man now must be off to supper will find that there be not morsel left for gate of castle be closed that night be not considered necessary to lower drawbridge two sentry be posted at work beyond moat one above gate besides watcher at top of keep next day thing be got into better order more barricade be erected for separation of cattle portion be set aside for horse provision brought in from farm be stored away in magazine woman child began to settle down more comfortably in shed best of horse cattle be removed into inner court yard boy be set drawing water filling trough while of farm men be told off to carry fodder to animal most of however be for time turned out to graze near castle many of men who have come in have returned to work on farm during day waggon continued to arrive with store of grain forage boy girl drove in flock of goose turkey large number of duck hen until yard in shed be be crowded with by preparation be complete even jean bouvard must find nothing further to suggest if be coming said to sir eustace sooner come better lord have done that can do have best get over without more ado still hope that one will come bouvard agree with that if be to come sooner better there be saying may be to morrow may be month before be disturbed still in war like be likely that will try get a much a can a quickly a possible for at moment may suit burgundy orleans to patch up quarrel again burgundy be astute cunning if see that orleans prince with armagnac duke of bourbon be likely to get best of will use king queen to intervene stop fighting seeing that may be so rogue who have eye on neighbour good possession will may be sure lose time in stretching out hand for week later came news that sir clugnet de brabant who styled admiral of france have gathered two thousand men from orleanist garrison with scaling ladder other warlike machine have attacked town of rethel inhabitant have however notice of coming resisted so stoutly that orleanist have be forced to retreat have then divided into two party of whom have scoured country making prisoner whom met firing village driving off cattle then returned to town of ham to various garrison from have be drawn of tenant have returned to farm when news spread again took refuge in castle be probable that artois where almost town be held by burgundian party must be next object of attack orleanist remained quiet for eight day only then news came that have moved out again from ham eight thousand strong be marching west two day later several fugitive from country round arrived at castle with news that orleanist be advancing against bapaume next morning heard that have after fierce fight won way to gate of town burgundian garrison have then sallied out at first met with success have be obliged to retreat within wall again orleanist however considering place too strong to be captured without long siege might be interrupted by burgundian force from flanders have drawn off from place be still marching north burning plundering be likely enough that will come way sir eustace said a jean bouvard talked matter over assuredly arras will be too strong for to attempt straight line must take to st pol castle there be very strong one also may sack burn avesne auvigni then avoiding st pol arras march between to pernes be large enough to give much plunder have force must resist a pernes be four mile away next call may be here why must attack sir eustace for here too might reckon upon more hard blow than plunder will depend upon whom have with sir eustace replied say that neighbour hugh de fruges went south ten day ago to join duke of bourbon castle be small place a most of artois be burgundian might be afraid might be captured have never borne good will might well persuade duke be castle estate in possession might do good service to cause that moreover standing a do within twelve mile of english frontier possession might be very valuable to must orleanist ever have occasion to call in aid of england to oppose advance must burgundians take that step surely of faction will do sir eustace why not bouvard time that english army have passed into france have done at invitation of french noble who have embroiled with king burgundy orleans bourbon brittany fight for own hand care little for france a whole may be vassal of valois regard a being nearly if not equal be always ready to league with other if need be with english against throne at nine o'clock on following evening sir eustace family be startled by report of gun on keep running out saw signal fire beginning to blaze up above there sir eustace shouted where be alarm fire have just blazed up on road to st pol warder replied blow horn then loudly urgently news that orleanist be marching north from bapaume have caused greater portion of farmer to come in on previous day in short time who be nearest to castle who have consequently delayed a long a possible began to arrive garrison be already under arm have taken place assigned to on wall tenant have brought arm in with be now drawn up in court yard where large bonfire have be for day in readiness be now blazing new comer after turning horse into inclosure with already there joined have be acquainted with share be to bear must place be besieged be to be divided into two party one of be to be on duty on wall with garrison other to be held in reserve be six hour when matter be quiet to relieve party on wall when attack took place to be under arm ready to hasten to spot where aid be required men be now inspected by sir eustace additional arm be served out from armoury to whose equipment be insufficient be then dismissed to join wife family until called to wall illustration two men who lit alarm fire rode into castle chapter iii siege two men who have lit alarm fire have already ridden in reported that have just a became dark seen flame rising from village three mile from that man in advance have ridden forward until near enough to see that great body of men be issuing from village in direction of castle ten of english men at arm a many french be now posted in outwork at head of drawbridge under command of jean bouvard sir eustace placed with squire on wall above gate four men be stationed at chain of drawbridge in readiness to hoist must order be given english archer be on wall beside sir eustace a arrow commanded ground beyond outwork hour after first alarm be given tale of tenant be found to be complete guard on other two road have also ridden in guy to great satisfaction have be ordered by sir eustace to don armour to take place beside be upwards of hour before body of horseman must be heard approaching came at leisurely pace for bonfire on road that on keep have apprised that hope of taking castle by surprise have be frustrated by disobedience of of men who in defiance of strictest order to contrary have set fire to several house in village after having plundered sir eustace accompanied by esquire guy descended from wall crossed drawbridge to outwork a soon a horseman came within bow shot of castle lighted torch three knight preceded by trooper carrying white flag two others with torch came towards work when within fifty yard of postern halted be sieur eustace de villeroy present be here sir eustace replied at order two men with torch took place one on side of who be that approach castle in armed force be sir clugnet de brabant admiral of france be sir manessier guieret sir hugh de fruges come in name of duke of orleans to summon to admit garrison of highness troop be for orleans for burgundy sir eustace replied be simple knight holding castle estate a vassal of crown be ready to obey order of king of only when be in condition of mind to give such order until then will hold castle will admit garrison whether of orleans of burgundy hold to be false vassal of crown be told that at heart be enemy to france devoted to england be vassal of england for estate of wife in country sir eustace said a at present there be truce between two nation can serve here king of france a faithfully a if in england must serve king of england nevertheless sir eustace will have to receive garrison of orleans have at back eight thousand men if compel to storm hold of yours warn that within wall will be put to sword thanks for warning sir knight on part warn that eight thousand though be will resist to death that will not carry eight thousand away a for sir hugh de fruges give open defiance know be to that owe raid if be man enough challenge to meet in morning on fair ground outside postern with lance battle axe to fight to death if conquers castle will be surrendered to upon promise of good treatment safe conduct to depart where will for within if slay must give knightly oath that following will depart forthwith condition must be hardly fair sir eustace sir clugnet said though doubt not that sir hugh must gladly accept can not permit to do so have brought eight thousand men here to capture castle hold for duke of orleans see not why must march away with because may perchance prove better fighter than sir hugh be ready however to give safe conduct to within wall if will surrender will not do sir clugnet hold castle for burgundy orleans be ready to give pledge will not draw sword for of prince if will not content must even take castle if can give fair warning that will cost dear then adieu sir knight until to morrow morning when will talk in other fashion so be sir eustace replied will not find backward in returning courtesy may pay knight turned away with torch bearer keep close watch to night bouvard sir eustace said mark what knight said adieu till morning have to deal with loyal gentleman must have slept soundly with adventurer be different may be that truly doe not intend to attack till morning be more likely that used word in order to throw off guard will keep close ward sir eustace men at arm have cross bow though say not that can shoot like english archer can shoot straight enough to do good work must fellow attempt in force to cross small moat attack gate if come methinks will be to try if be wakeful 't be light thing to attack even outwork like with loop from moat surrounding without previous examination of ground reconnoitring of castle must not attempt to attack fortress sir eustace said if must seize outwork by surprise must mightily aid in attack on fortress at rate will send down five archer if of enemy crawl up to see how wide water be here how attempt have best be made warrant that will not return if archer can get sight of post half men on wall let others sleep change two hour want sleepy head in morning by time confused sound of large number of men marching must be made out quarter of hour later three four cottage five hundred yard away be fired angry murmur broke from men a flame shot up after sending down five archer sir eustace returned to post over main gate get cressets torch in readiness to light if attack postern sir eustace said must have light to see how thing go so that may hoist drawbridge a soon a men be upon must enemy get better of be sure that one be not left behind be better that dozen of enemy set foot on drawbridge than one of brave fellow must be sacrificed must think that there be fear of attacking until flame have burnt down must see against light john harpen said there be fear of attacking fire must be of advantage if men be crawling up to spy of course must not cross slope in line with fire must work along on side reckoning with reason that a men must have light in eye must be le likely to make out object crawling along in shade by side of moat plant dozen bowman at interval on wall tom tell to keep shrewd eye on ground near moat if see aught moving there to try with arrow there be shouting noise up by burning cottage where enemy be feasting on spoil have taken drinking from wine barrel have be brought with in cart from last village that have plundered wish be somewhat stronger somewhat weaker sir eustace said be so must make sally give knave sharp lesson with only two hundred men against eight thousand must be madness to try might slay good many might lose score before be back in castle must be heavy loss to be thinking that sir eustace esquire said be worst of being on defence one see such chance can not avail one self of in castle everything be quiet not on duty be already asleep along wall watcher stood at short interval peering into darkness main body there be also stretched on wall with arm by side until required to be up doing now that sir eustace be at gate esquire went round wall at short interval to be sure that men on watch be vigilant presently loud cry be heard from corner of moat away to right go see what be doing guy sir eustace said bring news guy ran along to angle of wall here one of archer be posted what be dickon man crept up to corner opposite master guy must not have sworn to be so pesky dark thought there be something moving there shot almost at venture for must scarce see end of arrow hit there thereabouts for heard shout moment later be on foot running must see more plainly then so shot again over went fancy that in morning will see arrow sticking up somewhere between shoulder blade though there be saying precisely for nicety of shooting be not to be looked for in dark have done very well dickon keep eye open may be sure there be more than one of fellow about guy hurried back with news be good said sir eustace be just a well that archer did not kill outright with first arrow cry will show of comrade who may be about have best keep distance from wall minute silence followed then long tom said there be have have lesson sir eustace heard bow twang across there a there be cry may be sure that shaft sped straight that man have time to utter one may have be missed altogether tom missed altogether indeed sir eustace there be fear of there be not one of men on wall who must miss man whose figure must make out at fifty yard distance must scarce see until be a close a lord must wager month pay that when morning dawn there be dead man lying somewhere in front of outwork now guy have best go up to room lie down until daylight sir eustace said there will be naught doing to night unless be mistaken will be busy from sunrise till sunset will lie down for couple of hour presently then send john harpen to rest till daylight long tom see that men take short sleep by turn will need eye to be open above others to morrow guy promptly obeyed order dame margaret be still up be everything quiet guy asked a entered so quiet lady that sir eustace have ordered to bed said that must come down for short sleep presently two spy who crawled up have be slain by archer sir eustace be sure that attack will be made before morning then went into little room threw onto pallet during first few minute lifted head several time fancying that heard noise then fell into sound sleep did not awake until day dawned in few minute guy be on wall night have passed quietly so far a be known fresh attempt at reconnoitring work have be made a moon have risen soon after have gone to bed there be reason to believe that fact that two spy have not returned be so strong proof of vigilance of garrison that enemy have be content to wait until morning just a sun rose three knight who have summoned castle on preceding evening appeared on brow of opposite slope accompanied by body of men at arm rode slowly round castle from time to time halted be evidently engaged in discussion a to point at must be best attacked will shoot lord long tom asked be two hundred fifty yard away from height methinks must reach must be useless sir eustace said must hit doubt not must not pierce armour at distance be a well that must not know how far bow will carry until be sure of doing execution when shoot besides must rather that began fight quarrel be not one of seeking will leave to to open ball be true that did so last night by sending spy here have balanced that account moreover if be to attack sooner better may have gained news from sir hugh of coming here of english archer men at arm if have not done so will have rare surprise in store for after knight have made circuit of castle retired presently dense mass of men appeared from behind brow on cottage have burned have stood have bundle of faggot sir eustace guy exclaimed so have guy eye be good one seemed to that outline be strange one doubtless be a say that man have faggot on shoulder be evident that intend in first place to assault postern have brought faggot to fill up ditch then turned to gunner at cannon lay piece so a to bear on when come way down hill said shoot when be fairly in line of fire take same order guy to men working ballista mangonel on wall tell not to loose machine until after gun be fired if fellow take to flight tell not to waste missile if advance let be sure that be well within range before shoot with loud shout enemy came down slope when be half way down two gun roared out shot ploughed two lane in crowded body there be movement of retreat three knight several others threw in front waving sword shouting orleanist rallied moved forward at much slower pace than before have gone short distance when arrow of archer in outwork bolt of cross bow worked by men at arm there began to fall among so true be aim of archer scarce shaft be wasted at distance at be shooting did not aim at knight whose vizor coat of mail must not have be pierced shot at commonalty whose face throat be for most part unprotected man after man fell cross bow bolt also told heavily upon crowd have come down short distance farther when long tom archer with on wall began to send arrow thick fast machine hurled heavy stone with tremendous force among moment later french broke fled up slope again leaving fifty of number stretched on ground knight followed more slowly when reached crest group of gathered around sir clugnet de brabant by faith latter said bitterly have reckoned without host sir knight came to shear in good sooth seem more likely to go back shorn truly knave shoot marvellously scarce arrow went astray a mentioned to sir clugnet sir hugh de fruges said sir eustace brought with from england five twenty bowman heard tell from men who have seen trying skill at target that be in wise inferior to with whom have before have to deal to cost truly ye did so sir hugh matter made impression upon mind except a proof that knight inclination be still with england that be well that castle be placed in better keeping in truth fellow shoot marvellously for strength trueness of aim marked a came back that of men passed lying there nigh who have be struck with arrow be hit in face throat yet distance must have be over hundred fifty yard can answer for force one of others said for shaft struck fairly on chest hurled to ground a if have be shock of lance be well mail be of best work of milan nevertheless arrow broke two of link if distance have be shorter doubt not that must have slain well what will do next gentleman for very shame can not with eight thousand men march away having accomplished nothing question be where will next attack be delivered methinks knight said delivered attack too rashly have known that there be english archer there must have advised waiting until think that must be best to do so now if take fellow up while there be light will suffer so much from sting of wasp that will soon lose heart knave shoot not only straight strong shoot so fast that though a say there may be twenty five of air seemed full of arrow have told that there be two hundred archer shooting must have thought estimate reasonable one stood for time discussing best method of attack a soon a have settled upon men be told to scatter be to go to farmhouse bring up hide might be stored there to fetch hurdle must lay hand upon portion be to go to wood cut timber for making mantlet cover while two thousand be to remain under arm in case garrison must make sortie within castle be in high spirit at easy repulse of first attack sir clugnet must have learned from sir hugh of having english archer men at arm here sir eustace said to lieutenant yet advanced a carelessly confidently a if have be attacking place defended only by fat flemish burgher however have have lesson a be said be good knight will doubtless profit by will hear more of till after sun have set run up to top of keep guy bring back news what be doing in few minute lad returned there be two three thousand of lord drawn up in body beyond crest rest of be scattering in various direction be a expected sir eustace remarked have gone to prepare material for regular attack may be delivered to night may be delayed for day two however will be ready for jean bouvard do go round wall tell save few a sentry to retire until watchman blow horn to warn if seem to be gathering for attack do long tom give same order to archer there be use wasting men strength till work begin in earnest if sir clugnet be wise will march away at once must need heavy machine cannon to make breach in wall even have abundance of must take time to do so if try again may be sure that will be work of sir hugh de fruges who have doubt lively interest in matter be clever fellow will doubt do best to work on feeling of other knight by representing that must be disgraceful for so large force to abandon enterprise merely because first hasty attack delivered without preparation have be repulsed fact that have made so careful examination of castle must seem in to show that intended to renew attempt in form if first onset failed moreover scattering of force afterwards while knight still remained with large body here point in same direction guy on descending from keep joined sir eustace wife in apartment lad have borne bravely sir eustace said approvingly to wife be standing beside when shot be bringing down dust round ear neither started flinched though in truth be far from pleasant especially a have nothing to do to look on may be next time will have sterner fighting doubt not that will bear well must not come up carry message father henry asked be not strong like guy must do that be too young for yet eustace dame margaret broke in nay wife knight said gently lad be not too young for such service there will be little danger in for head will not show over battlement be well that must learn to hear without fear whizz of arrow shock of great stone from ballista clash of arm shouting of men a say be not yet strong enough to bear arm will learn to brace nerve show bold front in danger be lesson can not be learned too young yes henry will be messenger if try assault to night will put on for first time steel cap breastpiece have made for in england there will be no danger of being hit by crossbow bolt arrow there may be splinter of stone flying when missile hit battlement take arm with only dagger must be useless to must hamper movement in getting past men on wall in running up down step leading to now have better lie down guy be going to do so at sunset if alarm come before will be called must not coddle boy margaret said a guy henry went off know that be not physically strong a yet sorry be that must be so might exert more than doe be apt to think too much of ailment be glad when volunteered to do something for be at least a well that must be able to stand fire even if can not learn use of arm moreover may be that after once bearing part in fray may incline more warmly to warlike exercise than have hitherto done may rouse in spirit have so far be wanting have often thought that must have be better if agnes have be boy girl have far more courage fire than have remember when savage bull chased how saw first over stile got tossed over after for pain dame margaret nodded be not likely to forget eustace seeing that arm be broken have to nurse for six week do know that be up on top of keep while fighting be going on of course be there begged so hard to be allowed to remain with have not heart to say nay be henry there too oh yes shouted with best of when enemy fled over hill even charlie be there a excited a of of course have to hold up sometimes for to be able to see what be going on looked rather pale at first when opened fire soon plucked up when saw that shot did damage near see be strong healthy boy while henry have always be weak although think that lack courage ought not wife come from fighting stock on side fear that unless change greatly be cut out rather for monk than man at arm now will lie down for may be sure that will not close eye to night did note banner of hugh de fruges with others yes felt more uncomfortable after seeing be crafty man eustace be not brave one knight said scornfully challenged to meet outside in fair field craven did not answer sir clugnet have to make speech for decline offer will need vigilance eustace trust man within wall be faithful to if there be traitor be sure that sir hugh will endeavour to plot with nay may already have done so must have chance of making communication with be there dozen of wife long tom comrade will take good care that none come near enough for speech day passed away in perfect quiet from time to time word came down from look out that scattered soldier be returning laden with great quantity of young tree wattle door dame margaret kept watch in room allowed messenger to enter husband apartment if there be need will wake said know well enough what french have gone for there be naught to do until advance to attack guy slept short time a frequently started up under impression that horn be sounding alarm in afternoon got up went down into courtyard for time wandered about in quarter occupied by tenant have now settled down child be playing about a unconcernedly a if have be on father farm woman be washing clothes preparing evening meal over little charcoal fire certain quantity of meat have be served out to family be therefore doing better than in own house for meat be luxury seldom touched by french peasantry almost who have entered castle have brought with supply of herb vegetable with handful two of coarsely ground meal boiled into constituted usual fare addition of portion of meat afforded great satisfaction of men be still asleep in preparation for long night work others be standing about talking in little group be on wall watching with gloomy face smoke wreath still rose from what have be home duck goose hen walked about unconcernedly looking for stray grain have passed unnoticed when have last be fed chorus of dissatisfied grunting arose from pig have large pen in yard next to hut be still smarting under sense of injury excited not only by removal from familiar haunt by fact that most of have be hastily marked by clipping of kind in ear in order to enable owner to distinguish from others boy be carrying bucket of water from well in court yard to trough for cattle horse men at arm be cleaning armour polishing steel cap well tom hope will get on a well to night a did morning guy said to leader of archer hope so master guy must rather fight by day than by night be random work when can neither see mark look straight along arrow if have moon must do well enough on dark night skill doe not go for much still doubt not that will give good account of ourselves for at rate will be able to make out before come to close work woman have be making great store of torch to day will help bit though must that must be planted fifty yard beyond moat instead of on wall for although will be of use to will be of even more to enemy what think that plan will be must say that be intending to march forward covered by mantlet of wattle hide will plant near edge of moat throw up earthwork to shelter machine doubt will use door have fetched from farmhouse for same purpose door will be more to point certainly bowman said a to hide wattle at fifty yard will warrant arrow go through a if be paper can not say a much about stout oaken door be target have never shot against fear that shock must shiver shaft mantlet too must serve to purpose for must not know exactly where be standing behind a for machine can not have many of have something like score of waggon with tom must carry beam for dozen big ballista besides have cannon make much account of cannon archer said take pretty nearly hour to load fire at rate however hard shot may hit must be time before wrought much damage on wall be sound more than danger make men afraid of thing for part must not take trouble of dragging about be very well on wall of castle though see not that even there be of great advantage over old machine be true that shoot further be of great use be when enemy come to attack that want to kill at fifty yard must kill more men with shaft in ten minute than cannon must do with week firing wonder trouble to carry about with save that folk be not accustomed to noise yet might open gate when see while must make stout defence if have only ballista mangonel to deal with suppose when have got shelter close to moat will bring up plank to throw across yes doubt will try that tom moat be over wide for plank think more likely that will have provided with sack filled with earth so a to make passage across with a to plank not being long enough master guy must get over easy enough must only have to send three four swimmer across moat then thrust long beam over for who have crossed to fix firmly then lay short plank across so must tom did not think of well at rate expect will manage to get across moat somehow plant ladder against wall will chuck down again tom said wo care much for a long a can not knock breach in wall warrant that can hold chapter iv fatal accident a soon a sun have set defender gathered on wall fire have already be lighted there cauldron of water pitch suspended over sack of quicklime placed in readiness to be emptied great pile of stone be placed at short interval a long a attack at only one two place sir eustace said to wife be quite confident that will repulse if attack at dozen may succeed a must only have couple of archer six seven men at arm at point besides score so of vassal have doubt that will fight stoutly for sight of burning home have roused man be longing to get blow at who have wrought so much damage still thirty men be small party to beat back assault by hundred however if carry outside wall will have second to deal with there will stand much thicker together can not attack from many point while if be driven into keep will be stronger still have seen that woman child be ready to retire into keep a soon a assault begin have be round given order dame margaret said have told that inner gate will be closed a soon a fighting begin that who come in before must remain outside else mount to wall cross bridge for on account will gate be opened again be well margaret be now about to station two men at arm on inner wall at end of of three bridge so that may be ready on instant to turn catch let bridge fall behind men a rush across tenant have already driven a many more of best horse cattle into inner court a can find standing room so loss may be a small a possible if outer wall be carried have great fear that second wall will be taken plunderer who form mass of sir clugnet force will have have enough more than enough of fighting by time that capture outer one happens show on wall to night see that child leave bed can do will see little in dark to morrow morning wife will leave free to go among soldier give encouragement a may be needed for to night pray stir not out will send henry from time to time to let know how matter go rapidly men gathered on wall have have post assigned to when sir eustace made tour of inspection be glad to see how confidently man bore how well prepared to give enemy warm reception a soon a became dark outwork on other side of moat be abandoned defender called into castle drawbridge raised for be evident to sir eustace that although might be maintained in daylight by aid of archer on wall must not resist attack by overwhelming number when deprived of assistance sir eustace after inspecting men arm ordered on wall with exception of few who be to remain on watch to sit down with back against battlement to maintain absolute silence be by sound rather than sight that will be able to judge of movement said sitting down may sleep if so plea till be roused sentry be ten in number be taken from among archer most of men have be accustomed to chase be skilled in woodcraft accustomed to listen to slightest noise might tell of movement of stag enable to judge position sir eustace for present posted in old position over gate jean bouvard guy be with while long tom moved round round wall to gather news from sentry sometimes guy accompanied be moving tom archer said a stood listening intently on wall at rear of castle be hour past sundown about time knave will be mustering if intend to make regular attack on if have be only escalade there must have be sound until nearly morning thought heard on other side be sure of now can hear singing up at camp guy said hear anything else be keeping that up to deceive expect besides singing there be sort of rustle think that be coming way at present must hear plainer seems to that be spreading round will go back tell sir eustace what think tom guy hurried back to other side of castle long tom think sir eustace that can hear stir round have noticed too at least round side tell not to call men to foot until enemy approach more closely believe that be march of large number of men that be probably moving to position assigned to may be hour two before close in in short time sound became more distinct from rustle rose to deep confused murmur then occasional clink a of arm striking armour became audible most of men on wall be now on foot gazing into darkness presently sound ceased first on one side then on fancy be at station now jean bouvard will soon hear more of let archer shoot tom until can make out very distinctly may be sure that will come up with mantlet must be waste of arrow to loose at until be close to moat of course if separate figure can be distinguished men will draw on in quarter of hour messenger came from various point on wall saying that there be something moving within sight to at post over gate dark confused mass like shadow seemed to be slowly coming down towards outwork touch off gun jean sir eustace said will get further chance of catching in body captain stooped lit two touchfires at lantern standing in readiness gave one to man at arm went with other to cannon gun have be filled to muzzle with bit of iron nail have be laid to bear on slope beyond outwork be fired almost simultaneously sound be followed by yell of pain dismay besieger seeing that there be nothing further to gain by concealment burst into shout ran round castle be answered by one of defiance from wall sound be succeeded by loud order from leader of various assaulting party object before dimly seen now approached wall rapidly jean bouvard hurried away to superintend defence at other part may a well go other way guy let know from time to time how thing be getting on henry run down to mother tell that enemy be moving up to moat that will be time before there be hard fighting then come back here again be easier to see from side wall than have be in front for in front there be glow in sky from number of fire burning beyond crest of slope guy be able to make out what seemed to wall extending fifteen yard near edge of moat archer crossbow men gathered opposite to have just begun to shoot behind wall there be other dark mass irregularly placed extending back a far a must see occasional cry told that arrow be doing execution upon unseen assailant behind mantlet soon blow of cross bow bolt against wall sharp tap of arrow told that enemy have also betaken to arm number of giant torch have be prepared consisting of sheaf of straw soaked with pitch one of be now lighted elevated on pole fifteen foot above battlement light be sufficient to enable scene beyond to be clearly made out row of mantlet eight foot high have be placed by moat others of same height seven eight foot long elevated at short interval behind be so placed a to afford shelter to men coming down to mantlet in front stood in two line be twenty foot apart in one line alternated with in other guy soon saw object of arrangement men be darting to fro across interval six foot wide between two line thus have ten foot to run from shelter on one side to on other exposed for instant to aim of archer of men carried great bundle of faggot others have sack on shoulder heed mantlet in front said dickon who be in command of six archer near guy pick off fellow a come down shoot in turn be use wasting two arrow on one man loose shaft until man be within three mantlet from end then if one miss next can take when run across next time be right hal broke off a arrow sped man with sack on shoulder rolled over now lad ought not to miss by light eleven men fell out of next twelve who attempted to carry burden down guy went back to sir eustace with news of manner in attack be being carried on of effect of archer defence have just heard same from other side there be one attack on side two behind jean bouvard have posted there be going round now think there will be attack made in front have sent archer here to rear where will be more useful fellow in outwork across there have enough to do to shelter guy must well understand for although gun must not be depressed sufficiently to fire down into tete du pont mangonel be hurling stone into men at arm shooting cross bow quarrel whenever man showed rear of outwork be open afforded shelter to who have taken possession of already greater portion have retired to other side of small moat surrounding where lay sheltered by outwork be not long before assailant at other point finding that plan have formed be defeated by skill of archer poured down in mass between two line of mantlet man carrying burden before thus sheltering to great extent against method of attack archer must do little now confined to shooting at men who having thrown down fascines sack by edge of moat stood for moment hesitated before running back to shelter of mantlet not one in three got off scot free guy on going round wall found same state of thing at of other three point of assault number of enemy be falling great pile of material be accumulating at edge of moat after time number of knight men at arm fully protected by armour came down began to hurl sack bag into moat operation being covered a much a possible by storm of missile shot through hole in mantlet in short time sir eustace ordered archer to desist shooting for be obliged in order to aim at so much below to expose considerable portion of body three be killed by enemy missile ca prevent from filling up moat said be throwing away life to try to do so archer be accordingly placed in projecting turret where without being exposed must shoot through loophole at point on face of wall be not long before moat be bridged at four point of attack ladder be then brought down assailant be able to accomplish without loss a instead of carrying be pushed backwards forward by men stationed behind mantlet be so zigzagged down to moat without defender being able to offer opposition then rush be made by party of knight ladder be placed fight began in earnest in great court yard leader of english men at arm be placed with twelve of men a reserve be to be summoned by one two three four blast of horn to point at service be most required assault be obstinate wall be a stoutly defended sometimes ladder be hurled back by pole with iron fork at end bucket of boiling water tar be poured over on to assailant a clambered up lime cast over on waiting to take turn to ascend while with spear axe mace men at arm tenant met assailant a endeavoured to get footing on wall guy have placed with party to have first gone taking pike from fallen man be fighting stoutly archer from turret kept up constant flight of arrow on crowd below only once be horn sounded for aid of reserve sir eustace have taken command at rear while jean bouvard headed defence on side opposite to at guy be fighting defender under sir eustace have hardest work to hold own being assaulted at two point be evidently main place of attack for here sir clugnet several of knight led assault at one time succeeded in gaining footing on wall at one point while sir eustace be at other then knight blew horn at same time called archer from turret nearest to while of other party on wall rushed to aid of own accord pressing through tenant opposed to knight men at arm who have obtained footing on wall strength power with wielded heavy ax so held assailant in check that must not gain space sufficient for others to join when reserve ran up so fierce attack be made upon knight that several be beaten down rest forced to spring over wall at risk of life limb sir clugnet be last to do be carried away insensible two three of companion be killed by fall rest leaping far enough out to alight beyond solid ground at foot of wall have fall broken by yielding mass of material by have crossed moat loud shout of triumph rose from defender be re echoed by shout from other wall a soon a news of repulse at rear reached other party sir clugnet be badly hurt while several of knight be killed assault ceased at once orleanist withdrew followed by derisive cry from defender thanks be to saint that be over sir eustace said a opened vizor be close thing here for time feared that outer wall be lost however think that there be end of now by morning will find that have moved off must have suffered very heavily certainly three four hundred must have fallen for must admit that fought stoutly have done well friend thank heartily now first thing be to fetch wounded down to hall prepared for gregory have in readiness for there guy go round find who have fallen see carried reverently down to court yard send list of name place two men at arm at point where assault took place tom do similarly dispose eight of archer so must send spy up to see if sleep message can be sent back in shape of cloth yard shaft bid tenant retainer leave wall horn will recall must there be need will myself visit shortly thank for stout defence will send round cup of spiced wine to man on wall a soon a can be prepared to that may slake thirst after effort sir eustace then made way down from wall to apartment where dame margaret be awaiting hurried to meet wait wife till have removed helmet even then must be careful how embrace for methinks there be more than one blood stain on armour though happily not of mine own have gone well love methinks that will hear more of fought more stoutly than have given credit for seeing that be mixed rabble with small proportion of real men at arm among suppose henry brought message to close inner gate a have gained footing on wall received message since one brought hour ago saying that be going well thought that be with where can be eustace asked anxiously know not indeed margaret will search at once while do so will go to hall that have prepared for wounded give what aid can there fear for boy turned ran off when spoke to a head reach not to top of battlement harm can have befallen though in truth can not think what can have delayed called to two three of men below to take torch to accompany at once sent others to shed to ask if have be seen there then went up to top of inner wall crossed bridge at back illustration sir eustace gave loud cry for lying at bottom of stair be form of son have of seen aught of son henry asked men there lord one said in reply marked by side just before french got footing at other end of wall saw not afterwards ran towards step at corner there sir eustace said with message from that inner door be to be closed come along men said to with torch going to corner of wall descended step be steep narrow took torch from one of men held over head a neared bottom gave low cry ran down last few step where lying at bottom be form of son be stretched at full length there be terrible gash on forehead knight knelt beside raised head from steel cap have fallen there be deep stain of blood on pavement beneath placed hand on boy heart ear to lip men with torch stood silently round be too evident what have happened in haste to carry message henry foot have slipped have fallen headforemost down steep step head coming in contact with edge of one of without word sir eustace raised boy gently in arm face be sufficient to tell men news young lord be dead sir eustace carried through inner gate up to boy own room laid down on bed then silently went out again crossed court to keep dame margaret be seeing to wounded being laid on straw in lower room did not notice until touched turned sharply round face be sufficient to tell truth gave low cry stepped back pace moved forward drew to love said tenderly god have taken be fitter for heaven than of be too gentle for rough world of ours will mourn for with be well dame margaret laid head on shoulder burst into passion of tear sir eustace let weep for time then whispered must be brave love there will be other mourner here for dear one who have died fighting for will need comfort villeroy must not die better than doing duty be not by man hand that fell god took foot slipped in running down stair from wall must assuredly have died without pang take priest with will see to wounded here father gregory went on raising voice dame margaret have more need of at present moment than have brave fellow grievous misfortune have befallen son be dead fell while doing duty do take to room give to charge for present have work to do will see that patient be well cared for there be murmur of surprise regret from wounded who have brought in poor lad have be general favourite in castle for gentle pleasant way with though many time rough soldier have said among 't be pity that be not girl lady agnes boy be more fit for priest than for baron in time like for assuredly will never grow into stout man at arm like father that soldier must have be killed in such fight be to be expected that gentle boy like must have fallen seemed strange unnatural sorrowed for a well a for lord lady men forgot for time smart of wound in regret at untimely death sir eustace went about work quietly earnestly bound up soldier wound saw a far a might be to comfort number be not large a be only in fight on wall aught save head have be exposed struck by cross bow bolt have for most part fallen a stood eight men brought in have without exception received wound from sword of french knight though of gash be broad deep none of be likely to prove fatal just a knight have finished guy entered have heard news have spread like wildfire through castle lad eye be red for have be greatly attached to henry whose constant companion have be whenever family have be at english home be strange fate lad sir eustace said laying hand upon guy shoulder who have exposed freely for marked in fight have come through scatheless while henry whom thought to keep out of danger have fallen what be news there have be seventeen killed lord besides jean bouvard who be struck in face by one of last crossbow bolt shot before drew off be bad news indeed wondered why came not to a soon a have beaten off thought not of be good trustworthy fellow will miss sorely seventeen say be too many yet there might have be more who be four of archer sir eustace one of english men at arm six of french men at arm be killed by cross bow bolt arrow two of tenant pierre leroix jules beaune four of men fell on wall when french gained footing there three be hear unmarried men other have left wife three child will be care knight said wife of leroix beaune will hold farm free of due until eldest son come of age doe seem quiet without be quiet lord a left wall now knight with white flag four torch bearer be coming down slope towards outwork will go there sir eustace said 't be likely do come to ask for leave to carry off dead wounded will gladly let do for will save much trouble to morrow be a knight have supposed at once gave permission asked for in short time great number of men with torch came down slope for next two hour be occupied in carrying off dead wounded comrade close watch be maintained night though there be small fear of renewal of attack at daybreak rear guard of enemy must be seen retiring party of men at arm under sir eustace on going out to reconnoitre found that none have remained behind mound marked place where dead have be buried in one great grave many of mantlet have be removed doubted not that have be used a litter for conveyance of wounded afterwards heard that four hundred fifty men have be killed that over hundred too sorely wounded to be able to walk have be carried away in afternoon henry be buried beneath chapel in castle while men at arm others be laid in inner court yard having learned that orleanist greatly disheartened at heavy repulse have marched away to south gate of castle be opened small number of garrison be retained in castle rest be sent out to aid tenant in felling tree getting up temporary shelter near former home until must be rebuilt a before for time wife family be to remain in castle fear of attack by orleanist speedily passed away artois be upon whole strongly burgundian army marching from flanders speedily brought whole province over to side nothing be done towards commencing work of rebuilding farmhouse for be evident that castle might at moment be again beleaguered two month passed quietly sir eustace busied in seeing that tenant be comfortably re established in temporary home burgundians have again obtained several advantage a sir clugnet be known to have marched away with following to assistance of orleanist who have of late fared badly there be fear of fresh attack being made upon castle one day messenger rode in from governor of calais who be personally known to sir eustace letter that carried be important one after usual greeting read for love bear sir eustace write to let know that there be change in affair seems that duke of burgundy have be playing with king henry that offer of marriage be made only in order to obtain assistance countenance of king being now a must seem powerful enough to hold own against enemy without such aid matter have fallen through have received royal order have also be sent to governor of other english town have be proclaimed everywhere by sound of trumpet that none of henry subject of rank must in way interfere between two faction in france go into france to serve of by arm otherwise under pain of death confiscation of fortune must tell for private ear have news that king be in correspondence with duke of berri orleans bourbon that be like that will shortly declare for party being grievously offended at treatment that have received at hand of duke of burgundy after having given loyal help assistance have in slight degree assisted in making good cause against enemy in short time indeed english from calais from other place held by in france began to make sortie to carry off much plunder from country round especially took by storm castle of banelinghen near ardres notwithstanding truce prevailed intention of king of england be made still more manifest by writing letter to flemish town saying that having heard that duke of burgundy be gathering army of fleming to march into aquitaine to wage war upon destroy subject particularly very dear well beloved cousin duke of berri orleans bourbon count of alencon armagnac lord d'albreth therefore begged to inform whether be willing to conform to truce concluded between england without in way assisting lord in wicked purpose flemish town replied that desired in way to infringe truce between two country that must serve assist king of france sovereign lord count duke of burgundy a heretofore to utmost of power in short time indeed became known that solemn treaty have be concluded between king of england orleanist noble engaging to aid to recover guienne part of aquitaine have lost while promised to put army in field to assist position of sir eustace be now very difficult be uncertain when english must move be likely enough that if army set sail must land in guienne that calais must be able to render assistance so that must be exposed to attack of burgundians be position improved when learned that on th of july two french faction urged by count of savoy grand master of rhodes many others have agreed to term of peace between that orleanist have formally renounced english alliance at meeting of leader of party duke of aquitaine king son presided for time difference be patched up news however came too late to arrest embarkation of english eight thousand men landed at la hogue under duke of clarence overran wide extent of country being reinforced by gascons who have according to agreement with orleanist be raised to join advanced towards paris declaring however that must retire if duke of berri party kept engagement with paid two hundred thousand crown have agreed to do duke have not however mean to pay amount english therefore continued to ravage country while large force from calais under earl of warwick captured town of saumer au bois castle of ruissault however be scarcely invasion sir eustace being doubtful whether henry meditated operation upon large scale now that have no longer ally in france took part in matter remained quietly in castle towards end of march royal herald appeared before gate be at once admitted be received with honour in great hall by sir eustace sir eustace de villeroy said come to in name of king of france lord suzerain bid to say that have heard with satisfaction that refused entry to castle to who demanded altogether without authority from that seeing importance of castle in case of trouble with england that be vassal of england for estate in country deems necessary that safety must be assured therefore call upon to send in proof of loyalty to affection for wife child to paris where will be cared for in honour a becomes condition to receive garrison of royal troop of such strength a to defend from fresh assault may be made upon on part of who before attacked of england charge on fealty to accept one other of condition to be deemed false vassal can not believe be knowing to be brave worthy knight here be document with king signature seal to effect have delivered to majesty demand come upon a surprise knight said gravely pray to abide with till to morrow by time will have have leisure to consider alternative be ready to give answer request be reasonable one sir eustace herald replied will await answer for twenty four hour herald be then conducted to guest chamber sir eustace went out into court yard for time busied with usual affair of estate talked to tenant a to plan then went up on to wall there paced moodily backwards forward thinking over summons that have received knew that margaret have be in gallery in hall have heard message herald have delivered wished to think well over before seeing position be felt perilous one last treaty of peace between france england have drawn frontier line more straitly in after cressy be fought few mile away villeroy have stood within english line a far a now stood without henry who although now old averse to war must yet ere long again renew war have so long languished have little doubt have hope of succour at present felt that though able to withstand sudden attack like that have recently repulsed must not hope to make successful defence against great force provided with battering machine message from king be indeed message from burgundy if burgundy be powerful just at present have same effect a if be king not who have sent summons must see way of temporizing save margaret child must go a hostage idea of be wholly repugnant to be to admit french garrison castle must be virtually lost to for once powerless must easily be set aside in favour of one of burgundy follower only alternative then seemed to be that must altogether forsake castle estate so long held by ancestor retire to england until maybe day henry might again place in possession of regretted now that have not told margaret that have best keep chamber for then must have known nothing of alternative that must go a hostage alternative foresaw that be likely to favour a by so doing necessity for making absolute decision choosing between france england must be postponed at length still undecided in mind descended from wall went up to wife apartment chapter v hostage margaret rose to meet husband when entered have looked pale in dress of deep mourning before thought that looked paler now too have evidently be thinking over summons that have received there be expression of firmness resolution in face seemed to say that have arrived at more definite conclusion than have done 't be knotty question wife sir eustace said in first place be clear can not hope to defend castle successfully against attack by burgundy last be of character of raid next must be serious siege by experienced soldier provided with proper mean appliance before be certain that sir clugnet must if tarried here be shortly attacked by burgundians whereas now there must be prospect of assistance there be hope of help from england for there be force in calais must contend with must probably be sent against therefore take that if attacked castle must in end fall in case probably defender must all be put to sword must most likely be killed estate forfeited child taken prisoner to paris now seems to that be not to be thought of remains to decide therefore whether will abandon castle journey to england whether will admit burgundian garrison will in fact may be sure be first step towards losing castle estate altogether seems to that first will be best plan see chance of at present in time henry may invade france a lie only seven eight mile from frontier must doubtless recapture villeroy must again become master have not mentioned other alternative eustace namely that child must go to paris a hostage seems to be best of three to follow if there be indeed chance of english invasion must not say so think not that there be such prospect be many year since england have done aught in earnest during time power in france have be waning must not that child must lose fair estate when can well be preserved by slight sacrifice on part be child to go to paris must put end to doubt a to loyalty must hold castle estate peace now patched up between party will not last a soon a be engaged with other have time to spare to think of attacking here will endeavour to escape with child rejoin will assuredly have cause for complaint will of course have honourable treatment apartment fitting to rank assigned to must be no great hardship even be so must be worth enduring in order that son charles must inherit father estate must not part from love nay eustace a have said can not be for long must remember that twice when child be infant remained in england with while be month here must be worse now must take guy with lad have sense courage child be fond of must if occasion arose take counsel with then must have two three stout men at arm who might ride in train in peaceful garb a retainer a to maid can if need one hire in paris surely husband must be far better so than that must lose castle land there must be little danger to one in paris at time still le to wife of vassal of crown least of to hostage will be staying at court if peril life limb eustace in defence of castle surely be not much that must put to slight inconvenience of stay in paris for while like not knight said moodily see well enough that what say be true that must be safe at charles court indeed safer than here citizen of paris be indeed turbulent whether shout for orleans burgundy what if henry of england must again lead army here why imagine what be not likely to happen long ere henry come may have joined again must be otherwise might perhaps escape at very worst of must keep in duress in chamber who ever heard of woman being ill treated for disobedience of lord that must do must be to make pay ransom for return must rather go a hostage nay husband must hardly be who must then take care of castle be not hard thing that king asks merely child will for time live at court a proof that vassal hold castle for even if worst come to worst can lose castle land a must lose now if go nay dear lord wrinkle brow can not strive against might of france at present must bow head wait until storm have passed hope for better time there may be english war ere long henry may again extend frontier might again become vassal of england for possession of yours even a father be see that reason be on side margaret yet can not bring to like plan do like husband yet feel that be thousand time better must be separated from for time than that must risk siege last have cost dear enough might take from well well dear suppose must have way indeed see that harm can possibly come to will at rate ensure peace for time enable to repair tenant loss will send over message at once to sir aylmer beg to choose send fifty archer with reinforcement must make head against attack save in greatest force for there be saying how thing may go five twenty did wonder with thrice force must feel confident that villeroy must withstand attack save by army with abundance of great machine well margaret since have decided for that be to go indeed plainly see that alternative be really best let talk over who have best take with quite approve of choice of guy be good lad will make brave knight day will now make one of esquire a such will always be in attendance on assuredly agnes charlie will a well a benefit by presence will be able to take out look after a talk french a well a english lad will be useful to in many way have preference a to four men at arm must spare tom leader of archer must like to have englishman with be very good tempered obliging be shrewd too with strength courage must feel must wholly rely upon in strait though indeed see not that there be probability of such occurring certainly can have margaret will be glad to know that be with dickon who be next under can act a captain of archer while be away have noticed that tom be picking up language fast be always ready to do little kindness to woman child have often heard talking with will soon get to speak language fairly a to others have choice think have better choose for eustace have better be french said must not do for to surround entirely by english although of course be natural enough that must have english squire servant think that must not do better than take jules varey albert bongarde be stout men at arm prudent fellow not given to wine cup a fourth must say jean picard son be stout fellow too know for father hope that will one day succeed a butler must have taken service regularly a man at arm fought stoutly when french gained wall marked exchanging blow with sir clugnet bearing a well a man there must choose better so be said think eustace that with four such defender to say nothing of young guy need not feel uneasy about think that will feel uneasy margaret know can ill spare have ever be at side since be married save when after birth of agnes charles be forced to stay in england when came over here felt dreary time then will feel so now doubt not that will go well with though will be very different life to to have be accustomed will do well enough margaret said cheerfully maybe will get so fond of court that will have to take to of henry when return to england now have best begin to make preparation will speak to guy others sir eustace went into court yard where guy be superintending issue of provision for woman can go on without said gervaise will see to must speak to be at meeting morning guy heard what herald of france said position be hard one can not hold castle against strength of france while if take burgundian garrison must cease to be master must doubtless soon pas into other hand again if go to england must equally be lost to therefore wife have resolved in order to gain time until disorder be over to go to paris with child a hostage for in case a seems to be dame margaret child likely to be in danger nevertheless be greatly loth for to go however seeing other way out of business have consented have arranged that will accompany will go a esquire will install a such afternoon will take long tom two of men at arm robert picard good men true at same time burden responsibility must rest upon shoulder be young yet for so grave charge yet feel that can confide to will have to be stay support of mistress will have to be companion friend of child will charge four men at arm to take order from a from tom will be valuable fellow in first place be know much attached to besides being shrewd very giant in strength other three be honest varlet can rely upon in pinch will do best lord guy said quietly be grateful to indeed for confidence that show in will hope prove worthy of of father news soon spread through castle dame margaret be going to paris maid wept at thought a did many of tenant wife for since siege began kindness pain that have taken to make comfortable have endeared greatly to on previous visit have seen comparatively little of have be to simply lord english wife now knew a friend nevertheless regret at leaving be softened by thought that going to be near king insured peace for that must now be able to venture out to house be fast rising on ruin of former home to take up life again a have left early next morning little cortege mustered in court yard in readiness for start sir eustace wife have said good bye to other in chamber looked calm tranquil a mounted horse for having be accustomed from child to ride with father hunting hawking must sit horse well scorned to ride a did so many lady on pillion guy rode by side with agnes on pillion behind long tom with charlie perched in front of followed three men at arm brought up rear charlie be in high spirit regarded trip a sort of holiday have be talking ever since got up of wonder that must see in paris agnes better understood situation nothing feeling that ought to emulate calmness of mother restrained from bursting into tear when father lifted on to seat herald led way followed by two pursuivants dame margaret checked horse in middle of court yard said in loud clear voice to tenant men at arm round adieu good friend trust that will not be long away from go to stay for time at court in paris leave with surety that will have peace rest until return be able to repair damage suffered from attack made upon by men who regard not law turned waved hand to sir eustace who be standing immovable on step then touching horse with heel moved on after herald fear to speak tom dame margaret said after have left castle behind journey be long one will go quicker for honest talk what think of expedition to paris must a lief go there a anywhere else lady indeed men say that be fine city a have never seen bigger town than southampton doubt not that will find plenty to interest at time when may not require service see that have brought bow with ay lady must not bring to part with sir eustace told that must not carry a length must be matter of remark point out at once a being englishman seeing that french archer carry bow of such length so have even a see wrapped round with straw fastened to saddle beneath leg have also put fourscore arrow among valise on pack horse there be chance of needing tom trust that be so archer replied indeed there be never saying archer without bow be poor creature though indeed trust can swing axe a well a much better than most tom still hope that axe bow will be required to say amen also for although fray may sometimes be to taste have desire to be mixed up in melee without of own stout comrade with will get to paris to night lady mother charlie asked indeed will be five day if not six for see by way that be travelling be bearing east will sleep at lille may be at tournay then doubtless will bear south may stop next night at cambrai make to noyon on following day thence to compiegne to senlis next day will take to paris depends how far how fast ride day matter will be arranged by herald be to go by shortest route must get there more quickly amiens be held by party to whom men who attacked castle belong by way be travelling will keep for time in artois so escape risk of trouble on road care for trouble charlie said stoutly have got long tom robert picard other two guy can fight also must be very well son mother said smiling if be only attacked by dozen vagrant brave a be must do naught if large body surprised be assured that there be fear of by way be travelling will meet with none friend must like to be attacked by vagrant mother last time made stay with when there be fighting going on except just at first here must see well want to see charlie be glad that be not likely to do so must remember that agnes must sorely hamper friend nevertheless whenever party of peasant be met upon road charlie looked out hopefully heaved sigh of disappointment when after doffing cap in respect passed on quietly several time encountered body of knight men at arm presence of royal herald saved from question at halting place dame margaret child maid be lodged in house of one of principal citizen while guy men at arm lay at inn troubled state of time be only manifest by number of men at arm in street strict watch kept at gate of town many of be kept shut be only opened once hour to let people pas in out however did not affect traveller for gate be opened moment emblazonings on surcoat of herald must be made out have assuredly nothing to complain of so far guy dame margaret said a set out on last day journey have be king special guest must not have be more honourably treated have doubt that although will be much le important personage at paris than a traveller under royal protection will yet be made comfortable enough will have naught to grieve over save separation from lord can not doubt that will be so lady guy replied that at rate there will be trouble unless armagnac lay siege to paris there be riot in city heard last night at inn from traveller who have just left that although majority of people there be in favour of burgundy yet that much discontent exists on account of harsh measure of officer have appointed especially of conduct of guild of butcher who a seems be high in favour with duke rule city a if belonged to matter little to guy though seems strange that noble of france respectable citizen of paris must allow to be ruled over by such scum a be same in flanders where von artevelde ally great man chief among be murdered by butcher who at time held sway in ghent who be conspicuous for many year in tumult in great town there hear madam that king be ill can see one yes have heard same from herald will be john of burgundy who will for time be master must desire better guy said bluntly will at rate know that fair word be not to be trusted for part however wonder that after agreement with duke of orleans with whom have sworn solemn peace man must hold converse with unfortunately guy men interest count for more than feeling great noble who have in power to grant favour dispense honour will find adherent though have waded through blood burgundy too a hear have winning manner soft tongue can when plea play part of frank honest man at least must be owned that title of 'fearless ' doe not misbecome for have be otherwise must have denied part in murder of orleans instead of openly avowing that be done by order have started at earlier hour than usual morning a herald have pointed out to dame margaret that be best to arrive in paris a early a possible in order that question of lodging might be settled at once accordingly have be up at daybreak arrived in paris at noon how long will be wonder dame margaret said a rode through gate before will pas through here again not very long hope lady guy said be sure that if at time wish to leave will be able to procure disguise for to make way out without difficulty nay guy forget that be only so long a be here that villeroy be safe from attack whatever happens nothing save news that english army have landed at calais be about to invade france must leave free to attempt escape if not released before must then at hazard try to escape for sir eustace knowing that be here must be placed in sore strait indeed by own inclination a vassal of england for must want to join english a soon a advanced yet must be hindered by knowledge be hostage here must be for to relieve of fear same feeling that induced to come hither must then take back to villeroy then madam fear that stay here will be long one for henry have never pushed on war with france vigorously though plenty of

indeed air outside be close heavy compared with at home have be speaking to master leroux while have be away tell that post go once week to lille that will send letter for to sir eustace under cover to worthy trader of town who will forward thence to villeroy by messenger therefore will write morning lord will be pleased indeed to learn that be so comfortably bestowed here that there be cause for

daughter agnes son charles service be by mean slight one young count said returning deep salute agnes charlie made to unless indeed consider that life be valueless one for assuredly without aid that of tall retainer father must have be childless morning be indeed in sore plight when arrived arm be tiring must not have defended very much longer against such odds a have exasperated by killing two of comrade must have received mercy at hand in surprise at being so suddenly attacked even forgot to raise shout for watch though be hardly likely that must have heard have done so lazy knave be never on spot when be wanted however gave ruffian lesson that of who escaped be not likely to forget readily for out of fourteen who attacked accounted for ten of whom retainer levelled le than six with staff of doubt whether of other four came off scatheless imagine that levelled by retainer got up made off be if recovered sens before watch came be sure that other four will never steal pouch cut throat in future 't be shame that rascal be suffered to interfere with honest men must be far better if city authority must turn attention to ridding street of pest instead of meddling with thing in way concern must doubt be much wiser dame margaret replied since better be ever quarrelling among can hardly wonder that citizen attend to own business doubt be right young count said with smile be highest who set bad example vassal can not follow though must far rather draw sword against enemy of france than against countryman methinks here laughed example of war england have so often waged with scotland might well cause to take lenient view of misdoings can not gainsay there sir count truly quarrel have caused more damage to england than dispute between burgundy orleans have so far inflicted on france see be sufferer in one case not in other even now be ignorant why have be brought here there be truce at present between england france assuredly there be more english in service of noble of burgundy than in of orleans at rate have seen reason why there can at present be doubt at of conduct of lord who have lately defended castle against follower of orleans so have heard madame know that there be of friend who think that duke john have behaved hardly in matter seldom act without reason though may not be always that one assigns for action then changing subject went on have come to take master guy for walk with to introduce to of friend father be absent at present on return will know hasten to express gratitude trust that can spare esquire to go out with certainly so that doe return in time to escort for walk through street afternoon will be sure to come back madam guy said have to say hour at will start indeed think that will probably be in to dinner at one can not see guy said when have sallied out with young count why must have called upon sir eustace to furnish hostage a duke of burgundy have english archer in pay france be at truce with england there seems le reason than at other time to demand surety of loyalty especially a have shown that be in way well disposed to armagnac between ourselves guy think that duke in way expected that hostage must be given that be by mean well pleased when messenger arrived from herald to say that be returning with lady child what be intention know not in time like be necessary sometimes to reward faithful follower to secure doubtful one may be that must have be glad to have have opportunity of finding so fair castle estate at disposal know fable of wolf lamb poor excuse be deemed sufficient at time in france when there be great noble on one side simple knight on other reckon that duke did not calculate upon willingness of sir eustace to permit wife child to come here upon dame willingness to do so in way expected matter to turn out a have done for there be now shadow of excuse for to meddle with villeroy indeed question whether condition about hostage be of devising may well be that king queen wished inserted thinking that there be chance of alternative being accepted yielded to wish mind be not spoken from own knowledge did hear that duke john be much put out when found that hostage be coming there be laughter among at duke being for once outwitted then love overmuch count be lord guy be bound to fight in cause vow of fealty include word love duke father be noble prince just honourable be loved a well a honoured duke john be different man altogether be brave a proved in hungary may be said that be wise wisdom be not of kind burgundian noble love might have be wise to remove orleans from path although doubt be dastardly murder same although be bound to support alienated not few then condescends to consort with sorry knave butcher others of low estate to take into counsel to thrust upon at may tell there be grievous discontent be rank treason to duke have doubt be true nevertheless here be at first stopping place be a be kept by burgundian master who have with two three of best swordsman in france here number of meet morning to learn trick of fence to keep ourselves in good exercise indeed one sorely need in city of paris where there be hawking hunting jousting other kind of knightly sport everyone being too busily in earnest to think of amusement several of best friend be sure to be here want to introduce to when entered salon found thirty young

tell how matter occurred charles in sooth will have to take ruffian of paris in hand so long a cut other throat great harm be done if take to cutting ours be time to give lesson matter be simple enough d'estournel said a know be late before broke up at de jouvaux last night for heard strike half past ten by bell of st germain a sallied out be making way home like peaceful citizen when two men came out from narrow lane stumbled roughly across deeming that be drunk struck one buffet on side of head stretched in gutter be not like peaceful citizen charles one of others broke in well hardly perhaps forgot character at moment however instant later there be shout dozen so armed men poured out from lane fell upon saw at once have be taken in trap luckily there be deep doorway close by so sprang into drawing sword put in posture of defence before be upon ran first through body seemed to teach others caution fortunately doorway be so deep that only two must assail at once held ground for time pretty fairly only receiving few scratch presently saw opening parrying thrust ran sword through fellow throat fell with loud outcry be fortunate for came to ear of friend here brought stout retainer prodigiously tall fellow with staff longer than to aid be just in time for ruffian furious at fall of of companion be pressing hotly slashing so furiously with sword that be a much a must do to parry have time to thrust back in reply friend here ran two of through tall companion levelled six to ground with staff while did what must to aid at last four remained still on leg ran off believe thought that man with staff be evil one who have got tired of aiding in villainous enterprise be narrow escape indeed charles count walter de vesoul said gravely be well for that there be doorway hard by brave friend must have found body when came along be evident gentleman that when indulge in drinking party must go home in couple of course charles must lay complaint before duke must let parisian know that if keep cut throat within bound will take to sallying out at night in party will cut down man find about street will lay complaint doubt if much good will come of duke will speak to provost of butcher nothing will be done then will take in hand other said angrily if parisian wo keep order in street will keep for such doings be intolerable will make up party to scour street at night men passing peaceably along will not of course molest party of armed men find about will cut down without hesitation will be heartily glad to join one of party whenever be disposed de vesoul d'estournel said perchance may light on one more of four fellow who got away last night now be ready to have bout with sword have have turn charles other said then must work with mace count said friend here see did not come off a scatheless last night a did else must have asked to have bout with held own so well against two of who fell on together that doubt not must find sturdy adversary fear not count guy said smiling can use sword be true in english fashion know little of feint trick with sword such a be told be taught in school little practice here will amend d'estournel said thing be well enough in salle d'armes be useful when one man be opposed to in duel in battle melee fancy that be of little use though indeed have never yet have chance of trying will introduce to master hope that will come here regularly will give real pleasure to salon be kept up by duke for benefit a be one of most pressingly invited guest be certainly free of went up in body to master maitre baudin count charles said have to introduce to gentleman who be mutual friend who last night saved life in street brawl be at present esquire of sir eustace de villeroy have travelled hither with knight dame who have come at invitation of duke father be english knight a friend of trust that will put upon list of pupil will be pleased to do so count charles more so since have done such service be afraid that will find very backward pupil guy said have be well taught in english fashion a know maitre be more famed for downright hard hitting than for subtlety skill in arm downright hard hitting be not to be despised master said in battle be chief thing of yet science be not to be regarded a useless since not only make sword play noble pastime in single combat enables one who be physically weak to hold own against far stronger antagonist that feel greatly maitre will be glad indeed of lesson in art a soon a shoulder be healed will take great pleasure in attending school regularly whenever lady have need of presence be now in position of weak antagonist speak of be therefore more anxious to acquire skill will enable to take part in conflict with full grown men showed last night that must do count charles said with smile nay men of sort count guy said be rough swordsman be only number rendered dangerous there be little credit in holding one own against ruffian of kind well will be lazy morning young count said do without practice will come round to room gentleman drink glass two of wine make better acquaintance of friend be bound to be back at lodging by one therefore need not be afraid that be leading into carouse guy passed hour in count lodging then returned to provost count accompanied saying that have not yet seen tall friend of night before must personally thank long tom be called down being one of two who have remained in for morning must thank again for service that rendered last night count said frankly holding out hand to archer hope that will accept ring in token of gratitude have have enlarged morning so that may fit one of strong finger may be useful day to turn into money must find in pinch thank sir tom said will wear round neck for in truth ring be not for use of men in condition a to gratitude feel that be rather other way for arm be beginning to get stiff for want of use only wish that fray have lasted bit longer for have scarce time to warm to hope that next time lordship get into trouble may have good luck to be near at hand again hope may friend assuredly must want better helper after count have taken leave guy went upstairs told lady margaret how have spent morning be very glad to hear what say about fencing school guy will be good for to have such training indeed 't be well that must have employment for time must hang wearily on hand be to remain long caged up here will be very glad for to go will make difference to whether take walk in morning in afternoon after dinner went out guy escorted dame margaret agnes charlie followed long tom jules varoy bringing up rear armed with sword carrying in addition heavy cudgel first of visited cathedral where dame margaret daughter knelt for time in prayer before one of shrine then crossing bridge again followed along broad pavement between foot of wall river served a market where huckster of sort plied trade then entering next gate on wall walked down street to place de la bastille have be finished few year 't be gloomy place strong one dame margaret said with shiver a looked at frowning tower poor wretch who be once entombed there can have little hope of escape surely there can not be so many state prisoner a to need for keeping building so large a still with so turbulent population a of paris doubtless need strong castle to hold seems to madame that though useful doubtless a prison castle be never really built for purpose a stronghold to overawe paris may be so guy at rate be glad that did not use a place of detention instead of house of maitre leroux see well enough madame that be more securely held than bolt bar must detain imagine that must like nothing better than for to get away back to villeroy since must give excuse for attack on castle doubtless be so guy came freely must stay freely until change take place will leave open to to fly in sooth seems to that nothing short of arrival of english army must do be armagnac to get better of burgundians position must be even worse than be now be true enough madame for burgundians have cause of hostility to sir eustace while have given armagnac good reason for ill will against still be to come here must be open to to fly for artois be burgundian though duke might not be able to hold position here artois flanders must long be able to sustain must therefore be safe at villeroy for must have other matter to attend to without meddling with who only ask to be let alone on way back from bastille saw crowd in street heard loud shout have best turn off by side street madame guy said doubtless be body of scoundrel butcher at work of slaying enemy under pretext of being orleanist do hear shout of 'paris burgundy ' turning down side street made circuit round scene of tumult then coming up into main street again resumed way after walking considerable distance came to large building what place be guy be louvre madame must be abode of king of france be only sometimes lodged there often stay at one of hotel of great lord palace be fortified building country castle be strong there be air of gloom about narrow street high house seem to crush one down will go back again guy think that will often go out in future can take boat on river madame row up down into country say be pretty once fairly away from paris there be hill wood village may be pleasant if must let go live in one of quiet spot must be a contented a be possible for to be away from husband nothing can be kinder than be maitre leroux wife one can not feel that one be burden upon hope be that when king come to sens may be able to obtain interview with even if can not have leave to return to villeroy may be allowed to take up abode outside wall at rate to obtain quiet lodging for ourselves for next three week time passed quietly guy went morning to salle d'armes for wound being on left shoulder be able to use sword arm a soon a began to heal underrated skill fencing master said when have given first lesson be true that know nicety of sword playing indeed be so quick of eye wrist that can afford to do without still doubtless after couple of month practice here will be so far improved that will need to be good swordsman who hold own with guy paid only one visit during time to lodging of italian have not heard from master aylmer latter said because indeed there have be nothing of importance to tell armagnac be hear collecting great army be likely ere long to march in direction butcher be becoming more more unpopular more more violent not day pass many citizen be killed by under pretence that be armagnac really because have expressed a hostile to doings of tyrant have cast horoscope find that conjunction of planet at birth be eminently favourable seems to that about time will pas through many perilous adventure be destined to escape danger threaten will gain honour renown come to fortune through marriage there be other thing in career be uncertain since can not tell at what date be likely to occur whether planet be favourable at birth may again be in ascendant for a much a have told have doubt thank for trouble that have taken count montepone for guy have now learned rank that italian held in own country can only trust that prediction will be verified must rather win fortune by own hand than by marriage though will not come amiss way may happen will be knighted astrologist said gravely after great battle by hand of sovereign though by whom battle will be fought who sovereign may be can not say methinks that will be english king can wish more than anything guy said warmly fortune be good to be knighted by royal hand must be honour greater than other must befall bear destiny in mind italian said earnestly remember that in many case prediction bring about own fulfilment truly be rejoiced have found that star point out so prosperous future for guy be not free from superstition of time although in english home have seldom heard astrology mentioned have found since have be in france that many even of highest rank have implicit belief in be convinced that at rate count believed in power of star be gratified therefore to be told that future must be prosperous indeed prediction be not so improbable a to excite doubt in be already esquire unless fell in combat otherwise be probable that must attain honour of knighthood before many year have passed fact however that be to be bestowed by royal hand added greatly to value of honour knighthood be common in day be bestowed almost a matter of course upon young men of good birth especially if took up profession of arm noble have while not few have many knight in service discharging what must now be duty of officer when levy be called out must bestow rank upon man possessing certain amount of land to be knighted by distinguished leader by sovereign be distinction greatly prized placed recipient in quite category to knight by service be testimony alike of valour of birth be proof that bearer be warrior of distinction prophecy that must better fortune by marriage weighed little with marriage be matter appeared to at present to be very remote contingency at same time be pleasant to to be told that wife must be heiress because must place above need of earning living by sword must enable to follow sovereign not a one of train of powerful noble a free knight chapter ix stout defence duke of burgundy

pause again crowd outside became more more furious be dreadful to hear shout to see waving of torch weapon seemed to be almost mad to get in crush round door be terrible be only when two three horseman rode in among shouting that press ceased little one horseman obtained silence for moment by holding up hand told that friend inside be attacking barricade must soon carry then there must be silver enough for that by pressing forward did hamper effort of comrade seemed long long time before saw burgundians coming along must not help throwing cap up shouting when charged into crowd waited until be over then ran back home have rare scolding for being out so late did not mind that much after knowing that be safe at moment voice from landing above said be going to keep master aylmer there

not be for carrying message to count d'estournel must have be burnt alive before morning be unfortunate that sent message so late master aylmer be busy when medical student who sometimes gather news for in butcher quarter came here left missive for have sent up message to that be urgent must have begged personage have with to wait moment while read letter a be lay downstairs till visitor departed when learned news sent off katarina at once have short time before come in be fortunately still in boy dress so there be time lost went out at ten o'clock to see what be going on must have be close to without of knowing looked on for short time seeing that nothing must be done feeling sure that house must be taken knowing nothing of chance of burgundians coming to rescue returned here be surprised to find that katarina have not returned did not think that must have reached shop warned before mob arrived therefore became greatly alarmed a time went by without appearing indeed only hope be that must have be looking on at fight must return when be all over a indeed turned out must have rated much more soundly than did have not told how have fetched burgundians that have arrived in time hear that there be great stir morning number of men have lost specially death of legoix of young caboche have infuriated butcher skinner have already sent off two of number to lay complaint before duke of burgundy of conduct of of knight in attacking when be assailing house of noted armagnac feel that for moment must remain quiet a royal order have emboldened maire supported by trader guild notably by carpenter who be very strong body to call out portion of city guard to issue order that making disturbance whomsoever may be under whatsoever pretext be acting will be summarily hung if captured when so engaged in spite of there will doubt be trouble will not venture again to attack house of silversmith at rate until order come from duke of burgundy to forbid knight from interfering in way with doings trust will not send guy said doubt if knight will obey if come be already much enraged at insolence of butcher royal proclamation morning will justify in aiding to put down disturbance whatsoever may be duke order now sir count have come hither morning on behalf of lady mistress to thank for sending news still more for service daughter rendered in summoning knight to assistance desire much to return thanks to daughter will either call here to see must gladly receive her at lodging must prefer must prefer master aylmer lady can scarce pas through street unnoticed for english appearance mark at once a know lodge at silversmith will be more particularly noticed after event of last night coming here will attract more attention to than care for therefore will myself bring katarina round will do honour of calling upon lady can wrap girl up in cloak so that will not attract observation for one know save old woman below have daughter here with so many calling at house among reckless young court gallant care not that must be known if for other reason than be so must be soon suspected that lad who go so often in be girl in disguise must then no longer trust in street alone will find lady in at hour come signor for have resolved not to go abroad again until order be restored in paris decision be wise one italian said though indeed think not that must be in danger save that good looking woman run in troubled time like when crime be unpunished in authority be far too occupied with own affair to trouble head about woman being carried off be different with comrade butcher know well enough that be work caused failure last night appearance at window be noticed be that tall archer of yours who played such havoc among therefore advise to be ever on guard to purchase mail shirt wear under doublet for however watchful may be assassin may steal up behind stab in back may be sure that caboche friend of legoix will spare pain to take vengeance upon guy presently rejoined archer in street henceforth tom said must always put on breast back piece when go out have be warned that life will almost surely be attempted have best put on mail shirt under doublet perhaps must be best master guy fear not three men if stand up face to face with to be stabbed in back be thing that strength skill can save one from a care not to be always going about in armour will expend of crown in buying shirt of mail also 't be better by far than armour for man coming up behind must stab one over line of back piece under arm while if have mail under coat will strike at fair between shoulder be only by striking high up on neck that have chance with good coat of mail be money well laid out will last lifetime even if cost silversmith crown will have right good one guy nodded be wondering in own mind how must be able to procure one father have given purse on starting money might be needed for emergency certainly must not ask mistress for sum for too might have need of money that have brought with be still turning over in mind when reached fencing school be greeted with acclamation a entered by young count friend here be defender of house former exclaimed truly guy have given lesson to butcher that sorely needed say that king who be in one of good mood to day have interested mightily in fray last night that have expressed wish to hear of from esquire who have be told commanded defence so be not unlikely that there will be royal message for to attend at palace fortunately have first say in matter morning father returned last night a be rather favourite of majesty got to go to king obtain audience a soon a arose to complain of conduct of butcher in attacking house of provost of silversmith where moreover dame villeroy who have arrived here in obedience to majesty own command be lodged king when heard be mightily offended said have not be told of coming that insult to touched honour sent at once for maire syndic upbraided bitterly for allowing such tumult to take place commanded to put stop to under pain of severe displeasure account see for maire proclamation morning king desired father to thank other knight gentleman for having put down riot said that must at once send off message to duke of burgundy commanding to pay attention to report butcher might send to to give stern answer that king be greatly displeased with conduct that if fresh complaint about be made must straightway have leader hung be one thing to threaten to do guy at rate so long a duke be away will see that have best keep quiet for when king be in right sens be not swayed by others be not to be trifled with can imagine what excitement there be last night when boy sent arrived ring be sent up first when gave order that must be admitted came in well nigh breathless there be six eight of be on point of leaving thinking that might be something private have taken up hat cloak boy a came in said 'which of be count charles d'estournel ' '

on thorn a may well imagine have little hope when started that must find of alive delighted indeed be when on getting near enough must see crowd be stationary guessed at once that be still holding out though how must have kept so large number at bay be beyond struck heartily heavily may be sure chased wolf back to den with will hear that what with slew in house street cut down be reckoned that couple of hundred be killed though a to none can speak with certainty seeing that so many body be carried away before morning trust that none of received wound count charles none of though several of men at arm have gash from rascal weapon naught think will matter at moment one of attendant of salon came in usher from palace be here lord gentleman have be to lodging of master guy aylmer have learned that will most likely be here if so have king command to conduct to palace a majesty desire to have speech with told so guy father story have excited king curiosity must fain hear about make most of for majesty love to be entertained amused have better ask usher to allow to go back to lodging to put on gayer suit than guy asked certainly not king love not to be kept waiting fortunately time have be wasted so far a be on road from silversmith to palace louvre at time bore resemblance to present building be fortress surrounded by strong embattled wall having lofty tower at corner others flanking gate on water face tower rose from edge of river so that there be passage along quay building be in castellated form though with larger window than be common in such edifice eight turret shaped building rose far above surmounted with very high steeple like roof while in centre rose large almost perpendicular roof terminating in square open gallery building be further protected by four embattled tower on side so that if outer wall be carried must still defend in court yard between outer wall palace be row of low barrack where troop be lodged two regiment of best soldier of burgundy be quartered here a duke feared that sudden rising of armagnac party might put in possession of king person in case orleanist must easily persuade to issue proclamation a hostile to burgundy a be now published in name against orleanist louvre indeed differed slightly from palace of several of great noble within wall of paris a of be to extent fortified stood a separate fortress capable of offering stout resistance to attack by populace must rather face villain of last night for hour than go before king guy said a prepared to follow attendant trust good may come of interview that can interest king in case of mistress joining usher who be waiting at entrance who saluted courteously for manner in message have be communicated to usher showed that young squire be in disgrace with king

little sleep night before day have be full of event guy last thought be that be sorry for king who seemed to wish to do what be right who be mere puppet in hand of burgundy queen isobel to be used a lay figure when required by whichever have temporary ascendency for next fortnight guy worked hard in salle d'armes being one of first to arrive last to depart after taking lesson from one other of master spent rest of morning in practising with anyone who desired adversary well trained a be in english method of fighting mastered with quickness surprised teacher various thrust parry be new to at end of time be able to hold own with young count d'estournel who be regarded a excellent swordsman attendance of burgundian noble have now fallen off good deal armagnac army have approached paris st denis have opened gate to there be frequent skirmish near wall of paris between party of knight burgundians paris be just at present more quiet burgundy be still absent future seemed so uncertain that faction in city held hand for time news that reconciliation between orleans burgundy have be fully effected that great lord must soon enter paris together be received with joy be modified by recollection of past burgundy orleans have once before sworn solemn friendship yet week two later orleans lay dead in street of paris murdered by order of burgundy be likely that present patching up of quarrel must have much longer duration on former occasion quarrel be personal one between two great house now france be divided vast amount of blood have be shed there have be cruel massacre execution wrong men of one faction have come to hate of other although party have dared to put in wrong by refusing to listen to mediator be certain that reconciliation be farce that be short truce rather than peace have be concluded nevertheless paris rejoiced outwardly hailed with enthusiasm entry of queen duke of aquitaine burgundy berri bourbon duke of aquitaine be now acting a regent though without title for king be again insane have married burgundy daughter be rumoured that be by mean disposed to submit blindly to advice of father only effect of truce between party be to add to power of burgundian faction in paris few of armagnac party cared to trust in city have shown so hostile most of retired to estate great procession entered town have be for most part composed of adherent of burgundy three day after arrival in town guy on leaving salle d'armes found katarina in boy attire waiting for at corner of street father must speak with master guy said shyly for in past two month have always be in girl dress when have met pray go at once said will not accompany for have other matter to attend to thing be not going well count said when guy entered room orleanist be discouraged butcher triumphant at meeting last night determined that body of must wait upon duke of aquitaine burgundy to complain of conduct of knight who fell upon when attacking silversmith demand in name of paris execution must never dare do guy exclaimed indignantly will assuredly do see not how can be refused duke have force must oppose parisian might defend louvre one two of strongly fortified house butcher must surround with twenty thousand men burgundy vassal might come to assistance gate of paris must be closed must need nothing short of army long siege before must enter paris when have done so might punish leader burgundy must thereby lose for ever support of city be important to therefore if must save friend must warn that will be necessary for to make way out of paris a quickly a quietly a may be in next place principally will assuredly be murdered there be talk of meeting demanding execution that of four men be decided that there be need to do a must all be killed without trouble that possibly duke of aquitaine might refuse on ground that a lady have come here under safe conduct a royal hostage be entitled to protection must be contrary to honour to give up there be others who have displeased parisian whose life will also demand there be several woman among therefore be clear that even sex of lady will not save child from fury longing for revenge felt by family of legoix by caboche skinner only question be where can be bestowed in safety know what must say that be monstrous that be incredible that parisian will dare to take such step can assure that be a say peril be most imminent probably to night if not to morrow gate of paris will be closed there will be escape for whom people have doomed to death in first place have to warn burgundian friend that done must see to safety of four men three frenchman may if disguise perchance be able to hide in paris tall archer must leave city without delay height appearance must betray in disguise be clad now a to lady child remain where be can not doubtless be to appeal to duke of burgundy for protection must place in louvre in one of other castle be if must persuade of intention of parisian indeed must be difficult for to do even must do so must not be safe for if be forced to surrender of own knight lady of court to miscreant must not refuse to hand over lady margaret might be true possibly escape from paris in disguise know that there be already watch set at gate only resource can see be that must with child come hither for time be poor place for think that if anywhere might be safe with one know have have dealing with one connects in way with politics must vendor of nostrum have to do with such affair thus then might remain here without presence being in slightest degree suspected at rate have a good mean a for learning what be being done at council must receive earliest information be decided that search must be made here must be done think be most unlikely will have time to remove to other place of concealment lastly a to take that nothing must induce to fly with burgundian friend while lady be in hiding in paris assuredly not guy said lord appointed to take charge of watch over a long a have life will do so will not be able to aid presence may even add to danger still will not say that resolution be not honourable right at least must not stay here for detection must almost certainly lead to hers however can be disguised can darken skin hair in soiled garb may hope to pas without recognition where to bestow will talk over with daughter a soon a becomes dusk evening will present at house door of maitre leroux will bring with disguise for lady child have many of here a soon a be quite dark will guide here dame margaret with daughter son have best not sally out with can follow minute two later join a soon a turn down side street a to men must arrange with what have best do advice be that must afternoon saunter out a if merely going for walk ought to go separately can decide what have best do when outside chapter xii in hiding news of terrible danger be so wholly unexpected that guy for moment felt almost paralyzed seems almost incredible that such wickedness must take place exclaimed information be certain count replied say that think burgundian friend be in so much danger a of of king party a burgundy influence with parisian go for something still might not be able to save if waited till demand be made although might warn if learned that be to be among demanded doe duke then know what be intended count smiled know what followed last reconciliation said can guess pretty shrewdly at what will happen now then duke murdered orleans now may take measure against supporter of present duke be certain that struggle must begin again a soon a kiss of peace have be exchanged last time boldly avowed share in murder time most conveniently for parisian be ready eager to do work for dismiss from mind doubt can rely upon everything have told a being true whether can convince young knight be matter concern not remember that if fail to convince mistress life of child be forfeited so far a can see only hope of safety be in taking refuge here thank with heart guy said will now set about carrying out advice first will return to lady consult with see what have best do with men a to count charles d'estournel friend will see a soon a have arranged other matter case be not so pressing for at least when once beyond gate will be safe will see that lady child will be ready to accompany daughter when come for look well up down street before sally out count said see that there be few people about be matter of life death that one who know will see leave house guy followed advice waited until there be one within fifty yard of door then went out crossed street took first turning came to then made way back to silversmith a fast a must what ail guy dame margaret said a entered room look sorely disturbed a pale a if have received injury must that be lady have have news from count of montepone of so strange grave nature must not tell be not that be so much in earnest so well convinced of truth that can not doubt then related what count have told repeated offer of shelter have made be indeed beyond bound said what be credible that duke of burgundy king son duke of aquitaine can hand over to murderous mob of paris noble gentleman lady a to burgundy madame seems to from what count said that be at bottom of affair though may not know that parisian demand life of of own knight a well a of opponent a did not of old hesitate to murder orleans king own brother need credit with scruple a to how must rid of others considers to stand in way a to aquitaine be young man powerless there be orleanist noble in town to whom might look for aid if king brother be slain why not king son seems to that be powerless may be can not consent to what count proposes what disguise hide from base mob of paris must be unworthy action be one knew must shrink from madame pardon for saying that be not own life only of child be at stake when royal prince duke be unable to oppose scoundrel parisian woman child may well bend before storm dame margaret sat for time with knitted brow at last said if must be guy must go sorely against grain for sake of child will demean will take advice now have best summon four men at arm talk over case with guy went upstairs fetched four men down have sure news friend dame margaret said calmly to night many others will be seized by mob slain exclamation of rage broke from four men there will be many others slain before come about long tom said that doubt not tom end must be same offer of refuge have be made to child for sake unwilling a be to hide from base mob have brought to accept brave esquire will stay in paris in disguise do what may be to protect have now called to talk about yourselves gate will speedily be guarded none allowed to sally out therefore what be to be done must be done quickly will stay share fate madame must not think that must leave robert picard said others murmured agreement must add to danger without being able to benefit said anxiety must be greater must obey command be that forthwith quit paris beyond must leave to judge own course a french men at arm none must question when be once beyond gate may find difficult to travel in disturbed time be shrewd enough to make up story will account for movement so may work way back to villeroy difficulty be greater in case of english comrade height light hair of ruddy face must mark anywhere if go with must add to danger especially a tongue must betray a being english first time spoke however beyond ordering to quit paris must leave matter in hand will doubtless take counsel with esquire see if disguise can be contrived to suit will see again presently have best go with guy talk matter over thing can not be done master guy archer said doggedly when reached apartment be not in reason what must say when got home told at summerley saved own skin left dear lady child to be murdered without striking blow on behalf thing be beyond reason will maintain to be so can understand what say tom for feel exactly a do question be how be matter to be arranged then broke into french archer by time understood well enough though must speak poorly tom be saying that will not go men said doubt not that feel a doe at same time lady order must be carried out in first place must leave paris say not that need travel to distance on contrary must say that if can be arranged must return here in few day having

be really difficulty might dye that hair of darken face a be going to do there be tall men in france even inch must not matter so much danger lie in speech must never open mouth master guy if need be must sooner cut out tongue with dagger might bleed to death in doing of tom must think of something better than might perhaps pas a fleming if can not devise other disguise leave to master guy will

silence with tear running down cheek tom be last said a rose be obeying order lady margaret never before have felt a feel now that be doing mean cowardly action must rather stay by side though knew must be cut in piece very night than leave thus doubt not tom know well how inclination lie yet feel that be necessary that must go if great noble can not withstand cruel mob of paris arm of single man can avail nothing presence must bring danger rather than safety to feel that lady did not do so must not go even at command be liege lady have right to give life for must do be not that see that a say staying here must bring danger upon a soon a have gone dame margaret said now guy will detain no longer hasten warn friend guy hurried away found that count charles be on point of mounting to go for ride with of friend stay moment beg of count guy said a hurried up have matter of most serious import to tell wait friend young count said to sir pierre estelle count walter de vesoul sieur john de perron who be already mounted will not detain many minute well what be friend guy asked a entered room have come to warn of great danger count evening mob of parisian know not how numerous at least of great strength will demand from burgundy duke of aquitaine surrender to of others who took part in defeating other night besides other gentleman a hear lady pardieu if be so duke will give impudent knave answer ten thousand armed men be not apt to take answer count know that many time already duke of burgundy have be overborne by leader of parisian forced to do thing must have displeased a displeased therefore implore to ride off while may even now be possible that gale may be closed if so be not likely to be strongly guarded be evident that going must at rate save duke from grave embarrassment be sure that news be true count asked absolutely certain if must save friend pray to call upon at once to mount ride in body to one of gate may bid of retainer mount follow at short distance if find gate closed fellow will not let out call up fight way out can stay for to night at sevres if find in morning have not spoken truly can return upbraid a will if however find that strange event have happened here then have best ride away to burgundy stay there until find that villainous knave here have be reduced to order methinks will need army to undertake count went to window opened called friend below to come up d'estelle said laughing if once come up will stay there if can not come now join at lion d'or at sevres where will find eating dinner that have sent on to order matter be urgent d'estournel said be not joking with pray to come up at once seeing that matter be serious three knight dismounted went up be at first absolutely incredulous when heard from count charles what guy have told that knave owe good will know well enough count walter said for have over over again laid complaint against before duke be hard to believe that must dare to demand what burgundy must never grant guy repeated argument that have used with d'estournel there be limit said to arrogance of knave in truth can not be denied that be master here that even duke can not altogether withstand know moreover how essential be goodwill to even must ever so obstinately refuse demand might well take way without leave what can with handful of knight few hundred armed men do against mob of paris earnestly pray gentleman to treat matter a serious warn eight friend without delay bid retainer mount ride to gate if be open better be party of pleasure bound for sevres if learn to morrow morning that be quiet here can return if seems better to may save much argument merely ask friend to mount ride with to dine there if refuse say have motive that will learn when get there almost compel to go with pledge honour that will have reason to regret having taken advice well what do say gentleman count walter asked a master aylmer say will at worst be carouse hope will share with must right gladly do guy replied have safety of lady child to look after for too a well a four men at arm have incurred enmity of butcher have sent men out of town place of safety have be prepared for child will see safely bestowed there at nightfall since have thought such preparation necessary will at rate act on information that have given will promise not to blame unduly must turn out that affair speak of doe not come off let lose time gentleman let go to two of friend take denial from to invitation to dine with at sevres let say nothing to about bringing men at arm groom with can ourselves muster thirty fighting men must be enough with own sword to bring knave to reason if keep gate shut against a arrangement be made guy said have hour to spare will walk down towards gate see what come of four gentleman at once mounted rode off after giving direction to groom to order men at arm to mount at once to wait for at spot quarter of mile from gate guy strolled off in same direction in hour have satisfaction of seeing men at arm ride up halt a ordered walking little further on saw that something unusual have happened group of people be standing about talking man who came up from gate be questioned joining one of group soon learned that excitement be caused by unusual closing of gate one being allowed to enter pas out none must account for proceeding be certain that have not be done by order of duke of aquitaine burgundy for there be royal guard men at arm with duke cognizance by men of city who a agreed must be acting under order of butcher be bold deed one said for will have to account be usurpation of authority one duke of aquitaine who be now king in name will surely resent hotly how strong be party one of bystander asked putting question that guy have on lip forty fifty stout fellow with steel cap breast piece well armed guy turned walked back to spot where burgundian men at arm be drawn up in ten minute d'estournel party rode up guy be glad to see that have with whole of companion at once went up to gate be closed count held by forty fifty of townsman in arm so see that information be correct have not better tell friend of truth now for otherwise might hesitate to take so grave step a to attack d'estournel nodded riding to others said in low voice gentleman have not intended to let into little mystery until have left paris find necessary to do so now have learned surely that rabble of paris have resolved upon massacring to night for share took in little affair at provost of silversmith to end have shut gate hold with fifty armed men be a well that of have brought men at arm here can hardly fancy that rascal will try to prevent from passing out seeing that have warrant own for closing gate against if do there be nothing for to open let ride forward at once gentleman for fellow may receive reinforcement at time so saying put spur to horse calling upon men at arm to follow three companion who be already in secret joined at once others after pause of astonishment almost incredulity followed in way loath at chance of fight with follower of butcher a approached gate townsman hastily drew up in front of mean count walter de vesoul said haughtily a reined up horse few pace from line by what authority do dare close gate thus stand armed before by authority of city of paris leader of party said insolently recognize such authority while king duke of aquitaine who hold full power be resident here clear way man open gate will ride over butcher answered with derisive laugh will cost life if attempt said gentleman draw sword give rough fellow lesson need setting example rode at butcher cut down idea that burgundian knight must venture to force passage in teeth of prohibition of master of butcher have apparently not so much a entered mind of guard a soon a knight follower fell upon greater portion of flung down arm fled few only fighting stoutly until overpowered a soon a skirmish be over key be brought out from guard room gate unlocked massive bar taken down in meantime of men at arm have run up on to wall hoisted portcullis lowered drawbridge across fosse a soon a returned mounted party

with what parisian have done handed over to duke of bar other prisoner confined in louvre for whose security have solemnly pledged parisian then obliged king to appoint twelve knight nominated by six examiner to try prisoner punish found guilty while duke be obliged to draw up statement send to university for seal of approval of what have be done university however to honour stood firm while king

displeased at what have taken place university be power building be strong student be numerous at time ready to take part in brawl against parisian even butcher violent a be be afraid to take step against foresaw however that position taken up by university might lead day to inquiry into conduct therefore obtained from king edict declaring that have be done be done by approval for security of

country to take up arm to aid paris against various noble who be traitorously advancing against during time guy remained quietly in lodging with four retainer seldom stirring abroad men be now regarded by neighbour a honest carpenter shared indignation of great body of craft at usurpation by market men of government of france at murder of knight lady be daily taking place at present however opponent of butcher dared not resort to arm so great have be fear that excited that most men however much at heart opposed to have be constrained to appear to side with agree with a there be mean of knowing who must be counted upon to join carpenter be to take up arm latter must not venture alone to enter list against armed host of other party one evening guy who have not be near italian for over fortnight received message from dame margaret to say that wished to speak to for have determined if way of escape must be decided on to quit paris to endeavour to make way to villeroy be greatly pleased at news have ventured to urge step on day after duke of bar companion be seized pointing out that be evident that duke of burgundy have power inclination to thwart parisian that although party be now nominally hostile to english neither be likely at so critical time to give so much a thought to villeroy dame margaret have agreed to considered difficulty of getting out of paris traversing intervening country be so great that preferred to wait until change took place in situation of paris be now too evident that change be entirely for worse that if discovered butcher must undoubtedly add child to long list of victim companion be equally glad when guy told news sooner better master guy long tom said own must like to have tussle with rascal before go doings be so wicked that honest man must want to get one fair blow at still see chance of for although good fellow round here grumble under breath there doe not seem chance of doing anything there be not hour pass that heart be not in mouth if step on stair thinking that may have found out where lady be hidden guy have just turned into street where astrologer dwelt when heard loud voice from little group in front of four armed men whose white hood showed that be one of butcher patrol be standing round slight figure be well stopped comrade voice said that guy recognized at once a being that of simon bouclier know young fellow have be to many time on part of knave who professed to be agent of burgundy making inquiry of a to doings in quarter have found out since that duke employed such agent matter must be inquired into will take with to market will soon find mean of learning about employer guy felt at once that if katarina be carried to butcher not only must consequence to be terrible that must be forced to make such disclosure a must lead to arrest of count to discovery of dame margaret determined at hazard to get out of men hand girl made sudden attempt to free slipped from grasp that one of men have of shoulder dived between two others must have be off have not simon seized by arm guy sprung forward threw on butcher with such force simon rolled over in gutter run run shouted at same moment to katarina who darted down lane to left while ran forward turned down first lane to right with three men in hot pursuit of young active unencumbered by armour gained on rapidly when neared end of lane saw five six white hood whose attention have be called by shout of pursuer running to meet turned ran back till close to who have be following then suddenly sprung into doorway when be three four pace from be unable to check speed a passed brought sword down on neck of one nearest a fell to ground guy leapt out ran up street again have gone ten pace when met simon who rushed at furiously with uplifted axe springing aside a blow descended delivered slashing cut on butcher cheek dashed past kept on way took first turning then leading like in have be intercepted towards river pursuer be fifty yard behind feared that at moment shout must attract attention of patrol more than once indeed have to alter direction a heard sound of shout in front of at last after ten minute running came down on to main thoroughfare at point where street leading to bridge across to island issued from illustration guy delivered slashing blow on butcher cheek dashed past pursuer be still short distance away for fresh party who have joined have taken up chase guy be no longer running at speed at have started great fear be that must be stopped at gate at end of bridge a there be fear of attack have be left open so a not to interfere with traffic between quarter of city on island on opposite bank guy be now again running hardest in order to get across far enough ahead of pursuer to enable to hide when strong patrol of twenty white hood issued from gate at other side of bridge without moment hesitation climbed parapet threw over must knew be a bad for mistress be captured a if katarina have fallen into hand for if caught felt sure that torture must be applied to discover who be where mistress be hidden have made up mind that if be overtaken must fight until killed rather than be captured when came to surface of water guy turned on back suffered to float down until recovered breath when did so raised head treading water listened attentively be now nearly quarter of mile below bridge there be sound of shouting behind felt sure that pursuit be in way abandoned already torch be flashing on quay between wall river in short time others appeared on left on side there be dark space where wall of great chateau of noble extended down to water side obliged pursuing along quay to make detour round to come down again to bank must hardly succeed in reaching one of building without being seen for light of torch on opposite shore must be almost certain to betray movement a soon a began to swim even if did reach shore unseen might at once be handed over to white hood by in hotel therefore remained floating on back in twenty minute be beyond line of city wall must now swim without fear of being discovered made for southern shore be now middle of june water be fairly warm be glad to be out of so far a guy have heard have not be caught sight of from moment that have sprung from bridge might well be supposed that have be drowned climbing up bank gained after walking quarter of mile forest that surrounded paris on side going distance into threw down after first taking off doublet hanging on bush to dry have escaped first pressing danger that of being taken tortured into confession rest be now comparatively easy have to obtain disguise of sort to re enter paris must then be in greater danger than before for in sudden attack on simon in subsequent flight through ill lighted street be certain that beyond fact that be young active that be evidently not noble one must have noted detail of dress certainly one must have have a much a glance at face started at daybreak walked through wood up to meudon thence to versailles be then little more than village by time that reached clothes have thoroughly dried on being of dark colour looked little worse save that tight pantaloon have shrunk considerably stall be just opening when arrived there presently came upon one where garment of sort be hanging proprietor wife cheery looking woman be standing at door have need of garment madame said look a if did said with smile glancing at ankle see that be apprentice for sort of gear will have to go to paris deal in country garment will suit well enough madame fact be that a see be apprentice having be badly treated having in truth stomach for fray alarm in paris where first man one meet will strike one down if slays matter not if shout loud enough that have killed orleanist have left master have intention of returning a apprentice might be stopped questioned at place pas through on way home did travel in 'prentice dress must therefore fain buy attire of young peasant woman glanced up down street come in said know that be against law to give shelter to runaway apprentice there be such wild doings in paris that for part can see harm in assisting anyone to escape whether be noble apprentice methinks from speech that be a like to be former a latter went on seeing that guy be about to speak tell naught about husband who ought to be here be snoring upstairs can sell what will therefore look round take choice of garment go into parlour behind shop don quickly before anyone come in a to own will pay what be worth for although pantaloon be too tight for strong limb of yours may do for slighter figure guy be soon suited in few minute left shop in peasant dress made way along village until beyond house then left road made long detour returned to sevres here first purchased basket took outside place hid in bush then went down into market bargained for vegetable making three journey backwards forward buying time of different woman until basket be piled up then got piece of old rope for two three sou slung basket on shoulder crossed ferry made for paris felt strange without sword have dropped into water on landing for although in paris one now went armed sword must have be out of character with dress in country still more so in disguise in have determined to re enter town passed without question through gate made way to lodging a entered long tom leapt up with cry of joy thank god that be safe master guy have be grievously disturbed for safety for count came here early morning in disguise to ask if have heard aught of said that daughter have returned last night saying that have rescued from hand of white hood beyond fact that have followed in hot pursuit have news of that countess be greatly alarmed a to safety other three men at arm started at once to find out if aught must be learned of must fain have gone also count said that must bide here in case must come that there be trouble enough at present without running risk of being discovered hour since robert picard returned have be listening to talk of white hood have learned that one of number have be killed sorely wounded by man who have rescued prisoner from hand of patrol have be chased by number of finally threw off bridge into seine to avoid falling into hand general idea be that be one of noble in disguise of whom be in search that capture must have be very important one agreed that must never have come up alive for there be band of men with torch along bank sign of have be perceived however be searching river down hope to come upon body floating cast ashore robert went out again to try gather more news leaving well nigh distraught here story be true a far a go tom did catch one of back handed blow just under helmet a ran past doubt not that finished a to other laid cheek open be hot pursuit must have got away have not be that strong patrol came out through gate at other end of bridge just a be in middle there be course to jump for thrust sword into sheath went over added somewhat to weight in water sunk body below surface with aid of hand paddling floated so that only nose mouth be above water so that be little wonder that must not make out landed on other bank quarter of mile beyond wall slept in forest started morning from versailles where got rid of other clothes bought purchased basket vegetable at sevres then walked boldly in one must have seen face in darkness therefore be safe from detection perhaps safer than be before well done master guy must have killed assuredly if have caught be not that be afraid of be of being taken prisoner see if have captured carried before butcher in order to inquire who be before cutting throat might have put to torture forced to say who be where mistress be in hiding hope if have must have stood out none can say what will do when have red hot pincer taking bit out of flesh nail perhaps being torn out at root so even if must not have swam stroke must have jumped off bridge did well master guy archer said admiringly for indeed say that strongest man can not hold out against devilish torture at moment step be heard on stair jules varoy entered saint be praised exclaimed a recognized guy thought that be drowned like rat master guy though tom here told that must swim well never thought to see again guy told in few word how have escaped begged to carry news to mistress be about to give address for up till now have refrained from doing so telling that be from doubt of fidelity that if by chance one of fell into hand of white hood might endeavour to wring from secret be therefore best that must not be burdened with man stopped count told that must be at booth at fair at eleven o'clock that if of obtained news be to take to there said that there be several party of white hood in street that a went past heard say that boy of whom be in search be messenger of person of importance at court doubtless man who have rescued be also in

comfort of knight retainer horse castle rang with sound of merriment laughter to have be stranger for month after cup of welcome have be handed round sir eustace showed knight over castle heard detail of siege sir eustace from esquire be of interest to to inspect defence sir clugnet de brabant failed to capture for foe though be to burgundy must be owned that be very valiant knight have captured many town strong place yes be assuredly strong castle with sufficient garrison might well have defeated attempt to storm by foe who did not posse mean of battering wall force have be quite insufficient when enemy be strong enough to attack at many point at same time be surprised that must have made good defence against so large force a assailed be doubtless in slight degree due to english archer saw in paris what even one of men must do be anxiety to know what took place there sir eustace said will pray after supper to give account of what occurred will tell a far a know of matter sir eustace in truth took little share in there be just one charge on part mob be in flight can tell that did with thorough good will for in truth be heartily sick of arrogance of butcher who lorded over paris even lord of burgundy be constrained to put up with insolence since aid be essential to to who take very great heed of politics leave matter to great lord thing be well nigh intolerable can tell that be with hearty good will seized opportunity of giving knave lesson a soon a visitor have arrived mounted men have ridden off to tenant speedily returned with store of duck

apartment of sir eustace leaving men to sing carouse unchecked by presence when be comfortably seated flagon of wine have be placed on board knight requested count charles to give account of adventure with cut throat part have subsequently played in event of have spoken d'estournel gave lively recital telling not only of fray with white hood of what saw when after defeat of mob entered house have passage stair be breach of city attacked by assault must not have be more thickly strewn with dead body count said indeed for part must rather have struggled up breach however strongly defended than have tried to carry barricade at top of stair held a be believe that even have not arrived master aylmer must have held ground until morning except against fire wonder did not fire house sir eustace remarked doubtless leader must have done so a soon a saw task have before see plunder be with majority main object of attack while of leader be assuredly to get rid of provost of silversmith who have powerfully withstood cry be raised of 'down with english spy be pretext however a plate case with silverware be in barricade there must have be plunder to gather have set fire to house be for reason that continued attack so long doubtless in end when be convinced that must not carry barricade must have resorted to fire then went on to recount how guy have warned friend of danger threatened how difficult have be to persuade that only by flight must safety be secured how at last two knight with have returned to paris to escort dame margaret truly count narrative be stirring one sir eustace said know not a yet how guy managed to gain information that house be going to be attacked so sent to for aid how afterwards learned that name be included with of duke of bar others whom butcher compelled duke of aquitaine to hand over to dame margaret esquire can best tell that count said be strange story indeed long one dame margaret added be to tell fully must last till midnight will tell how matter befell to morrow will inform of detail more at length then related briefly incident have occurred from day of interview with duke of burgundy to of escape telling of various disguise have be used manner in guy have overheard council of butcher before surrounded hotel of duke of aquitaine dragged away large number of knight lady to prison how four men at arm have re entered paris after escape remained there in readiness to aid if required guy be not present at narration a have after staying for short time in room gone down into banqueting hall to see that men want be well attended to to talk with english men at arm archer seems to sir eustace said when wife have finished story that young esquire have comported with singular prudence a well a bravery have be everything to dame margaret said warmly have be adviser friend have learned to confide in implicitly be who secured for in first place friendship of count charles then that of friend be instrumental in securing for assistance of italian who warned afterwards sheltered one of adventure have not yet told because did not think must do so without saying more than person must like known guy rendered service that in opinion far more than repaid for kindness to messenger employed be near relation of then related how guy have rescued relation from hand of butcher how have be chased have killed one wounded of assailant how at last escaped from falling into hand by leaping from bridge into seine will understand said that not only host must have be sacrificed have not messenger be rescued must have be compelled by threat if failed by torture to reveal who employer be where lived in case search must have be made must have be discovered life a well a of host must have paid penalty be impossible to speak too highly of young esquire sir john poupart said warmly for short time saw good deal of at fencing school to d'estournel introduced made great progress wonderfully improved swordsmanship even during short time be there best of found match in be quiet modest even apart from service have rendered to d'estournel came to like greatly be fine character trust ere long may have opportunity of winning spur for courage have shown in defence of charge must assuredly have gained for have be displayed in battle knight be persuaded to stay few day at castle then rode away with retainer with mutual expression of hope that must meet again in quieter time guy have opened little packet that katarina have given at starting contained ring with diamond of great beauty value with word with grateful regard showed to sir eustace who said be worth knight ransom lad more must say take not with to war leave at home under safe guardianship for must ever be bad luck to be made prisoner will warrant must sell for sufficient sum to pay ransom be noble suit of armour that silversmith gave altogether guy have reason to regret that accompanied lady to paris have gained familiarity with danger will assuredly stand in good stead day have learned trick of fence have gained friendship of score of noble knight have earned lasting gratitude of dame have come back with suit of armour such a noble might wear in tournament ring worth know not how much money be fair opening of life guy good father will rejoice when tell how well have borne may be that will not be long before may have opportunity of showing mettle in wider field english have already made several descent on coast have carried off much spoil many prisoner may not be long before hear that henry be gathering powerful army be crossing sea to maintain right recover land have during past year be wrested from crown propose shortly to return to england dame have borne up bravely under trouble agnes need rest quiet be time too that charlie applied to study for time learnt to read write well for methinks knight must at least know much will take john harpen back with such of men at arm archer a may wish to return home must wait here until send others to take place for propose to leave here during absence a castellan be post of honour guy feel that castle will be in good hand there be moreover advantage in thus leaving a must message be sent by burgundian orleanist will be able to reply that having be placed here by to hold castle in absence can surrender to one can admit one to garrison until have sent to received order on subject thus considerable delay may be obtained must receive message from will pas across at once to calais with such force a can gather trust such summons will arrive for be clear that truce now made between two french faction will be very short one that ere long trouble will recommence a think time burgundy will be worsted orleanist be now master of paris of king person while assuredly have support of duke of aquitaine who must long to revenge indignity be put upon by burgundy mob of paris must therefore be much stronger party can moreover issue what proclamation choose in king name a burgundy have hitherto be doing in own interest duke will therefore be too busy to think of meddling with upon other hand if orleanist gain mastery be le likely to interfere with a hear that negotiation have just be set on foot again for marriage of king henry with katherine of france english raid will therefore be stopped french will be loath to risk breaking off of negotiation might be caused by assault without reason upon castle of one who be english a well a french vassal who might therefore obtain aid from garrison of calais by nation might be again embroiled if think well lord to leave here in command will assuredly do best in power to prove worthy of confidence be heavy trust for one so young have thought that over guy have fear that will fail in way be garrison wholly french one might hesitate defender of castle be englishman in tom captain of archer have one of whose support at time will be confident while french garrison will have learned from three men who went with that must a readily follow a must knight of experience moreover good fighter a english be be far more independent inclined to insubordination than french who have never be brought up in same freedom of thought therefore although have doubt that will respect authority doubt whether be to put frenchman in command must prove so docile while with french there will be difficulty might of course appoint john harpen who be ten year senior to command john though good esquire be bluff rough in way a obstinate a mule be to leave in command must be sure soon set garrison by ear a esquire be wholly trustworthy be altogether unfitted for command therefore feel that choice have made of be altogether for best will go away confident that castle be in good hand that if attacked will be a staunchly defended a if be here to direct operation two day later sir eustace with family started under guard of ten english ten french men at arm for calais before starting formally appointed guy a castellan in absence charged garrison to obey order in thing a if have be given by also called in principal tenant delivered similar charge to english men at arm be well pleased to be commanded by one whom have known from childhood whose father have be accustomed to regard a master during absence of sir eustace dame margaret archer have not like men at arm be drawn from summerley estate devotion of leader to guy tale have told of what have taken place in paris rendered equally satisfied at choice a leader a for french men at arm bred up in absolute obedience to will of lord accepted order in a must have done on other point sir eustace left guy instruction that might make further addition to defence that thought fit pointing out to several that have intended to carry out must have set about at once have said be only now that vassal have completed work of rebuilding house must not call upon for service until be completed have told now that such work must be taken in hand that a saw upon occasion of last siege safety depends upon power of castle to defend will expect service to be readily loyally rendered especially a have be remitted for over six month must be well also to employ garrison on work in first place because have long be idle idleness be bad for in second place because vassal will work more readily seeing that garrison be also employed while so engaged extra measure

who consulted that disaster must happen when french army met english that much read in star though when henry marched north from harfleur with so small following seemed to that victory must scarce attend against host of france went over calculation many time must not find that have made error be owing greatly to prediction that duke readily gave way when great lord persuaded not to risk life in battle others whom have warned went to death in case because disbelieved in others because preferred death to dishonour of drawing back one of latter on eve of battle confided to hot headed knight in
