subsidy to former to send army to cooperate with latter then began second period of long terrible struggle france now taking place sweden have hitherto occupied bearing brunt of conflict emerged triumphant with territory largely increased while austria be crushed humiliated spain be dethroned from position a dominating power of europe success of france be greatly due to fact that army be led

by insolence party of be having mimic battle be acting a regiment of turenne at storming of la motte be in command so acting a turenne when gentleman who by appearance age by fact that two trooper

than from what have heard be loved by men more than other general will do anything for regiment here though be nineteen when obtained command be admitted to be one of best drilled best disciplined of in service saw to everything spent whole time in drilling a if have be only lieutenant with nothing sword for fortune instead of great noble when be with de la valette weimar army have to fall back be

feel a stranger here besides be not french princess wife of king charles say that england france have altogether forgotten long war between be very old story now a long a spain threatens to extend power over europe so long be likely to remain good friend if power of spain be once broken old quarrel may break out again trust that will not be in time for assuredly regiment although willing to

four suit be ordered for hector one for court for general use when in paris other large town third for travelling when in attendance with general fourth for actual service in field almost a expensive a suit be shirt with deep lace collar ruffle while for service in field dozen plain shirt be purchased headdress on ordinary occasion be broad beaver hat with plume in field close fitting helmet with

with letter general looked at critically make very good figure said better can tell than did at age for be weakly while be well grown strong among other exercise have not neglected use of sword must tell that a soon a eye fell upon general have practised for two three hour day since be ten year old think almost soldier in regiment have be instructor in turn maitre d'armes of regiment gave lesson twice week have managed business for viscount said saw cardinal yesterday asked for commission for simply asked for what regiment said that at present intended to keep about own person a thought must make good officer must day do credit be busy at time so simply signed appointment a lieutenant gave to to fill in name asked if must bring to levee tomorrow said 'there be occasion viscount have plenty on hand can waste time on young lieutenant can present to when return from war know cardinal by sight suppose yes general have seen many time be great man turenne said thoughtfully rather a if speaking to than to hector greatest france have ever known be soul of france be well indeed that have at present king who recognizes how great man be be wise enough to know although be somewhat overshadowed france be made greater stronger own reign more glorious by genius then broke off with smile be talking to rather than to will ride to st denis at two o'clock today be here at time will order horse have purchased for to be brought round here hector be about to express gratitude general at once stopped need thanks said perceived in ardour with have studied military matter that must make good officer remind of own boyhood always like to help forward officer who see ready not only to do actual business to go beyond in order to acquire knowledge doubt not that will find in must remember lad that be now no longer civilian soldier that must be not only obedient respectful to above in rank discretion a well a courage be necessary for success that must be thoughtful for comfort of soldier ready to expose life in battle to encourage also to set example of endurance cheerfulness good spirit in time of hardship distress remember that to soldier there be such thing a party fight for france for france only must hold aloof from even smallest expression of opinion on political matter then at two o'clock hector bowed deeply left room when returned to hotel at two o'clock six groom be standing with horse before entrance waited outside until viscount followed by four officer came out oh here be lieutenant said a eye fell on hector be afraid that punctuality be not among virtue gentleman be lieutenant hector campbell son of brave officer of scottish regiment who fell at la rochelle be for present attached to household will ride with for italy day after tomorrow campbell gentleman be colonel d'estampes who be head of staff major mutton who will have control of matter connected with artillery be monsieur de lisle emile de chavigny who be aide de camp now gentleman let mount a scottish regiment be mounted one hector have have ample opportunity to learn to ride well now fell in with two aide de camp who be young men of eighteen nineteen year of age member of good family together followed viscount turenne who rode on ahead with two staff officer while be making way through narrow street of paris rode slowly a soon a passed through gate went on at brisk pace be fortunate de lisle said in having obtained commission so young although say that there be not many of similar age in army be fortunate indeed hector replied fortunate beyond anything must have believed possible thanks to goodness of viscount turenne must not enter army under better patronage de chavigny said have served under for two year on rhine have be brother must not have be more kind work ma foi be tremendous soldier may well say that general be sleepless happily doe not expect to go altogether without rest frequently be away night by in saddle sometimes take one other of with at rate get night sleep by turn much a have to worry what with ignorance of carelessness of others have never seen out of temper then reproof however mildly spoken by be more dreaded than volley of abuse from other general be telling before came out that be already well up in drill in use of arm yes have be brought up may say in scottish regiment after father death officer men be very kind to learnt drill a soldier officer to fence use pistol ride officer lent book on military history tactic viscount said be wonderfully well read in such matter de lisle said own beyond campaign have taken part in have very vague idea of such thing time before joined be taken up with learning use of arm equitation certain dry study under abbe wish now that instead of latin have learned something of military history seems to that when one be intended for army be good deal more important than latin theology fancy de lisle companion said laughing that from what know of objection be not so much to course of study a to study altogether know that be case well perhaps so still might a well have be whipped into learning something useful instead of something so far a can see will never be of value be born over here lieutenant be born in scotland father who be younger son saw chance of making way by sword at home be certain that james must never go to war a there be regular army there seemed opening for penniless cadet in england scotland so came over here obtained commission a soon a did so sent for mother died two year later kept with when went on service be left in charge of huguenot family be well that be so for otherwise might have grown up unable to read write last time saw be before rode to la rochelle after death be adopted by regiment for good people be with left paris to join friend in south have be otherwise must have stayed with good man must probably have brought up to be like minister be afraid must have made very poor one two young men laughed just at present de lisle said two religion get on quietly together cardinal churchman a be know that if france be to be great religious enmity must cease that war of last reign cost ten of thousand of life drove great number of men to take refuge in holland england to benefit of country loss still successor whoever may be may think more of party le of france in case might have found vocation of huguenot minister a full of danger a of soldier must have be much worse hector said for must not have be question of fighting of being massacred know nothing of religious dispute of politics in regiment thing be never talked about among men officer be for king at same time a seemed to that be cardinal who have stopped persecution of huguenot who have now gone to war with austrian to prevent protestant prince of germany being altogether subjugated by imperialist felt grateful to for of course scotchman be on side of prince nigh army of gustavus adolphus be composed of countryman suppose chavigny laughed that cardinal must have cared very much for destruction of protestant prince of germany have not be that ruin must make austria more formidable than ever a long a gustavus lived swede be able to hold own against imperialist france troubled in way in matter when swede be finally routed at nordlingen seemed that imperialist must triumph everywhere for most of protestant prince be leaving confederacy trying to make best term must for richelieu stepped in now see france for past hundred year have be trying to stamp out protestantism uniting with protestant holland sweden to uphold protestant prince of germany under direction of cardinal of church of rome here be riding behind huguenot general who perhaps more than other posse cardinal confidence seems strange de lisle said be assuredly good policy while fighting austria be fighting spain for austria spain be two branch of one empire spain be eternal enemy true be not a formidable a be henry of navarre triumph over guise half emancipated from influence english destroyed naval power holland well nigh exhausted treasury brought such discredit on arm a have never before suffered still austria combined dominate europe be on account that have taken place of swede continued war have raged for so many year chapter ii choosing lackey policy of great cardinal have for object aggrandizement of france a well a weakening of power of austria so long a struggle between protestant prince swede against imperialist have be maintained with equal success on side have be well content to see germany watering soil with blood of people nearly third of population have be swept away during terrible war many hundred of town village have already disappeared while large tract of country lay uncultivated whichever party won victory france gained by interest however lay with protestant confederation so long a germany be cut up into number of small principality divided by religion political animosity must count for little against foreign enemy france have for century suffered from same cause family of lorraine bouillon enghien burgundy guise longueville count of armagnac other powerful vassal of france paid nominal allegiance to crown be really independent prince louis xi have done much to break power richelieu continued work under france for first time became consolidated into whole have lived work must doubtless have be completed death that of king postponed work for year long regency controlled by minister possessing none of courage firmness of richelieu personally obnoxious alike to noble to population of paris again threw power into hand of great noble plunged france into civil strife war of fronde like of rose in england so weakened noble that crown under louis xiv became absolutely dominant have austria succeeded in crushing protestant prince that empire with germany under control must have become power greatly superior in strength population to france be principally to prevent result that richelieu after battle of nordlingen threw into struggle aim be also to carry frontier of france up to rhine here territory of duke of lorraine bouillon prince of sedan not only cut france off from rhine moselle opened door by must at time be invaded from germany duke of lorraine have always borne a independent prince giving indeed nominal allegiance to france a often allying with german prince a with duc de bouillon on north of lorraine duke of savoy farther to south also regarded a independent former a huguenot have strong leaning towards protestant hollander be ready to furnish asylum to french noble who have incurred wrath of king minister duc de bouillon father of turenne have fought bravely on side of henry of navarre through war of league died when viscount be ten year of age elder brother being six year older mother became regent of little state after having greatly weakened strength of huguenot noble by siege capture of la rochelle have long be stronghold bulwark of religion richelieu obtained from duchess treaty by engaged to remain always attached to interest of france while king undertook to protect house of bouillon duke of savoy be next compelled to hand over to france town province of pignerol richelieu then turned attention to lorraine reigning duke have entered into alliance with austria invasion of territory be therefore first step by france entered into terrible struggle known a thirty year war duke have given richelieu excuse for hostility have married cousin nearest heir to dukedom treated so badly that fled to france begged protection of louis xiii gave french army be at once set in motion against lorraine be in struggle turenne have first fought under french flag have always evinced strongest predilection for life of soldier when reached age of fourteen richelieu being at time engaged in breaking power of huguenot in siege of la rochelle boy mother sent to uncle maurice of nassau who at death of father have become leader of dutch people be treated by uncle in exactly same way a other gentleman volunteer carried musket performed duty of private soldier six month later prince maurice died brother henry frederick succeeded in government of united province at once promoted nephew latter speedily rose to rank of captain of infantry here be indefatigable in duty unlike most young men of good family who left internal economy discipline of company to subordinate officer turenne saw to everything drilled instructed soldier insisted not only upon strict military discipline on good manner conduct in particular won respect affection by personal kindness denied almost necessity of life in order to be able to add to comfort in war in netherlands there be few pitched battle operation consisted almost entirely of siege of fortified town of measure for relief in turenne took much more than full share paying attention not only to own duty to be being done spending whole time in battery trench in learning be possible of war carried on under such condition in winter operation be always suspended turenne spent time in paris where manner conduct won for favour of with who came in contact have be severely brought up under calvinist tutor habit be simple taste quiet almost ascetic cared little for amusement of brilliant corrupt court when war with lorraine broke out turenne at once sought for employment with french army recognized that there be comparatively little to be done in war of siege in holland longed to enter wider field request be gladly granted for presence of duc de bouillon brother in french army be in guarantee of duke fidelity to engagement with france turenne be at once appointed to colonelcy of regiment devoted a assiduously to work a have done in holland be not long before regiment gained reputation of being best disciplined in king service took part in short expedition in there be on occasion fighting first saw real service under marshal de la force in after siege of la motte success of be due to storming of breach by turenne regiment for exploit be promoted to rank of marechal de camp rank equivalent to of major general took part in several siege until lorraine be completely conquered duke driven to abdicate retire to austria battle of nordlingen showed richelieu that if france did not resolutely enter into conflict austrian must become absolute master of germany at once signed treaty with swede agreeing to grant large subsidy to carry on war by similar treaty promised subsidy province of alsace to duke of saxe weimar entered into arrangement with dutch who be to aid france to conquer flanders be to be divided between two power while duke of savoy parma mantua agreed to undertake in alliance with france invasion of milan to receive in return portion of territory won from spain at same time france declared war against spain be to army commanded by cardinal de la valette be to act with of saxe weimar against imperialist that turenne be attached campaign began unfavourably impetuosity of saxe weimar who hoped to recover own principality induced valette to cross rhine be forced to retire in haste army suffered terribly in retreat turenne be in command of advanced guard courage activity alone saved army from complete destruction seizing upon defile overthrowing enemy who barred passage enabling army to recross rhine with number diminished only by sickness fatigue hunger at siege of saverne turenne led french troop to attack after three repulse succeeded in gaining footing in town received very severe wound in arm with musket ball during following year several town be captured decisive operation took place in duke of saxe weimar gained great success defeated imperialist with heavy loss at rheinfelden besieged breisach key of southern germany imperialist army marched to relieve place reinforcement be sent from france under command of turenne longueville three battle be fought austrian driven off after assault by turenne breisach capitulated alsace have now fallen into hand of saxe weimar having be promised alsace refused a richelieu desired to hand over breisach to france on death of duke in following year richelieu bought over lieutenant french flag waved over town of alsace upper rhine became french frontier turenne returned to court where be received with enthusiasm be short time afterwards ordered to italy to assist de la valette who have be faring badly there matter have not gone there a richelieu have calculated duke of savoy remained true to engagement with france died in october spaniard have captured vercelli emperor have bestowed regency of duchy on cardinal of savoy on prince thomas brother in law of duchess supported by duke of modena governor of milan marquess of leganez declared that be determined to protect people against french to deliver young duke from french domination duchess implored help from france la valette advanced to aid while in paris turenne have obtained from cardinal permission to raise regiment of dragoon also that company of dragoon must be attached to regiment of cavalry troop be not intended to fight on horseback be in fact mounted infantry arm after being in disuse for many year have lately be recognized a very valuable one possessing a doe mobility of cavalry with fighting power of infantry be at head of regiment that general started for italy position of affair in savoy be dark indeed for whole of piedmont have risen against duchess many considerable town have be captured by spanish others including city of turin have opened gate to with exception of susa carignano chivasso casale citadel of turin whole country be lost to french force be however too weak to take offensive ill health of la valette deprived of former energy rendered unwilling to undertake offensive movement nevertheless turenne counsel infused new spirit into army indeed news that young general whose name be already known throughout europe have arrived belief that coming must be followed by of large reinforcement from france at once reanimated remaining supporter of duchess dispirited piedmontese who began to fear that have be too hasty in siding with spain if for time turenne be not in position to act in field began at once to take step to prepare to meet coming storm early in october la valette died general opinion be that turenne must have succeeded to command brother duc de bouillon have broken with richelieu joined party opposed to when in paris duke have be on term of intimate friendship with count of soissons have invited to stay with at sedan invitation have be declined count having be implicated in plot against richelieu have be obliged to fly have taken refuge at sedan where have be most warmly received by duke richelieu have at first invited then in name of king commanded bouillon to expel guest duke absolutely refused to do becoming deeply offended at manner in be pressed joined party opposed to richelieu be for reason that cardinal decided not to appoint turenne to command knowing warm affection existed between brother fearing turenne might be influenced by bouillon might beloved a be by soldier lead many of troop away from allegiance be to join party opposed to therefore appointed count d'harcourt to command have proved brilliant officer on many occasion turenne did not feel in way aggrieved at being placed over made rapid journey to paris to arrange with cardinal d'harcourt general plan of campaign be now setting out again to make preparation for hector campbell enjoyed journey greatly duty be nominal party always halted at town where troop be billeted upon inhabitant viscount suite entertained by authority after crossing alp however by pas of mount cenis arriving at work began in earnest turenne be almost entirely occupied in consultation with duchess three aide de camp however be kept hard at work carrying message to governor of town still adhered to duchess with order for strengthening of defence for collection of store provision in case of siege be provided with three horse almost lived in saddle seem to be tireless campbell de lisle said when one day happened that three be together

have have nothing to do for week have advantage of riding so much lighter than do hector said weight tell on horse rider when horse be tired pace soon add to weariness of rider if have have to do work when first left paris have doubt must have felt journey here have be fine preparation thing be that morning take dip in first mountain stream come to that doe one almost a much good a night sleep de lisle shivered may do good campbell must not jump into one of icy stream for anything make one shudder to think of always have swim in seine morning when be not closed by ice hector said be told that there be nothing braced one up made one so hardy a certainly found that even in coldest weather never felt need of cloak well deny that may be good custom if scotchman do may account for hardiness like comfort when can get be not comfort to be always in saddle to feel so sleepy that fancy at moment may fall off even if dip in snow water be to unaccustomed to somewhat sharp be better than having to struggle against sleep for hour well possibly may try experiment day when feel must either lie down by roadside sleep take dip until feel like breaking down altogether will postpone experiment turenne several time spoke approvingly to hector on one occasion when lad presented on being told that aide de camp be required to carry message turenne said to be not turn campbell de lisle chavigny returned hour ago while be not hour since came in be asleep general campbell said have be thirty six hour in saddle have be more than campbell feel sir said be perfectly fresh ready to go on be little

to repent think that will can quite believe that be mischievous young varlet show in face be sure that be shrewd believe that will be faithful at rate think that took to other that have made up mind to try for once to stay in place really seemed in earnest about if keep to promise think that will be just sort of lad to suit well will see officer said if turn out badly please remember warned against if turn out well hector said with laugh will not fail also to remind of prognostication that evening when hector returned to room after have finished meal found paolo waiting outside door appearance have so changed that must not have known hair have be cut short in front left long behind a be custom of day hanging down on to collar be neat tidy wore dark blue doublet reaching to hip with buff leather belt in be stuck dagger legging fitting tightly down to ankle be of dark maroon cloth wore short boot of tanned plain white collar four inch deep be worn turned down over neck of doublet yellow cloth cap with dark cock feather be stuck on one side of head in hand held bundle containing leather jerkin breech of same material pair of buff leather riding boot must reach to knee brother have laid out money well paolo hector said a opened door led way into room think must have known be quite sure must not have known master if have looked into horse trough seen reflection will be long time before will be able to persuade that clothes be own really be officer lackey now master must teach duty of know nought when in house like though know well enough what be when be in field be few enough at present paolo monsieur de turenne stableman look after horse of staff when dine with two friend m de lisle m de chavigny dine sup together at inn there be room to keep tidy bed to make armour arm to be polished clothes to be brushed hitherto orderly have done thing will now be duty a eat in room be clear that there be food for when be in town will give money to pay for meal at cabaret hope master that will soon find something more useful for to do for in truth fear that with so much time on hand will find sorely difficult to comport a be due to lackey fear have little doubt that will soon find work enough to spare indeed will often ride with few day later other two aide de camp being away viscount requested hector to accompany on tour of inspection might last two three day be accompanied by orderly three other trooper behind who rode two of own lackey with basket of provision with rode paolo hector having asked general if must take with may a well do so campbell will accustom to work what made choose so young servant asked a rode off be year older than be though perhaps not so tall be brother of man in employment of monsieur de vevey have be through last two campaign find very intelligent obeys order promptly a be heart soul in cause of duchess feel sure of fidelity especially a have have hard time of up to now be think grateful to for taking speaks french very well might certainly be of great use to in enterprise that lordship might be good enough to entrust with being about same age think that might perhaps go together unquestioned where man must be unable to pas viscount rode on for minute without speaking there be something in what say campbell after journey be over may be able to employ in way when be necessary to obtain information can get in other manner have ridden with before yes sir have ridden behind time have be away since engaged when say behind start behind when out of town call up beside talk rather try to talk in italian rather must say in piedmontese for tell that district of italy have own dialect that native of one can scarce understand other have bought book printed here dictionary of evening when have duty to perform come into room translates sentence by sentence a read to learn by heart hope that ere long will be able to make understood in do well very well viscount said if young officer be to do same instead of spending evening night in drinking gambling thing must go on much more smoothly there must not be so many blunder in carrying out order will greatly add to usefulness by acquiring knowledge of language must certainly enable to carry out with far le danger such commission a be just speaking of for might be asked question if be replied to by lackey suspicion must be at once aroused have ridden along road before several time sir have noted feature of country mean from military point of view have nothing else to do a ride along sir a go notice where ambuscade might be laid either by enemy where might expect to be opposed on march forward where rear guard might check enemy be retiring before good fate of battle depends in nine case out of ten upon knowledge of ground in quickness in utilizing that knowledge journey today be only taken for purpose want to see for country across will at first operate to inspect various route by might advance through if find enemy in too great force to be encountered must be obliged to retire a go will point out to observation that have made will be able to judge whether spot be well chosen for purpose chapter iii first battle during three day be spent in reconnoitering country hector campbell learnt more than must have done in a many year under ordinary circumstance turenne took greatest pain to point out to how nature of ground must be taken advantage of how flank must be protected against attack by comparatively small body occupying position from must be with difficulty expelled how important be action of gun especially when so placed a to be able to sweep ground across enemy must advance in endeavour to turn position of army turenne on part took pleasure in instructing pupil who be at once so eager to learn who showed so apt in profiting by teaching see said be concerned rather in defensive position at present than in seeing how must best turn enemy barring advance although greater portion of dominion of duchess have fallen into hand of enemy be fortunate in few place remain be that at once enable to make defence with comparatively small force at same time be possible for to receive aid from france if absolutely necessary for to fall back across alp susa headquarters lying at mouth of valley up road over mount cenis find way at once guard pas keep open communication with france be a be handle of fan can be approached by three main road only to turin carignano chivasso unfortunately turin be in enemy hand a duchess troop still hold citadel advance must not very well be made until have fallen chivasso carignano be safe from sudden attack there be other minor road so long a town be in hand held by strong garrison enemy advancing by of road towards susa must be liable to have communication cut convoy captured by party from fortress have long be fixed idea in military operation that army can not advance a long a town near line of route be held by enemy that idea be erroneous one several time upon rhine have gained success by neglecting rule disregarding town contenting with leaving force sufficient to keep garrison in check spaniard however be slow to change tactic good soldier a be consequence be that although greatly superior in force last year made offensive movement against have have several regiment join since arrived here although believe enemy force to be twice a strong a own have doubt that count d'harcourt will a soon a arrives decide upon taking offensive see position here guarded a be on flank by line of mountain be a favourable for offence a defence for can advance through carignano on right chivasso on left however enemy may dispose be vulnerable on one side other anticipation be justified d'harcourt arrived three day later council of war be held be decided that advance must at once be made against enemy main body of spanish troop be posted in fortified camp at villanova halfway between asti turin leaving only small body of troop to guard lower valley of susa from attack by spaniard at turin army advanced to carignano thence towards villanova spaniard however although nearly twice a strong a french be so much surprised at boldness of proceeding that instead of marching out to give battle contented with strengthening still further defence of camp in order to force to come out d'harcourt advanced to chieri called by french quiers town situated between villanova turin about two league distant from turenne be in command of cavalry took post between chieri villanova spaniard however made effort to relieve town capitulated after resistance of only two three day while siege be proceeding large convoy of provision succeeded unmolested in making way to casale thus placed garrison there in position to hold out for several week to come very small store of provision be found in chieri army be forced to fall back towards carignano to obtain food from store collected there marquis of leganez whose headquarters be at asti knowing that french have sent store have brought with to casale have foreseen that must be case advancing rapidly with troop from villanova seized poirino on line by french must retire while at same time prince thomas who commanded at turin advanced with greater portion of troop marched towards little river santina intending to cross there thus french army must not retire on carignano without exposing flank to attack of enemy during short campaign hector have ridden behind turenne shared in general disappointment of army when enemy refused to accept offer of battle still more so when after capture of chieri became necessary to retreat two fellow aide de camp loudly bewailed bad fortune that thus obliged to retire without having effected anything beyond capture of insignificant town however have advantage of opening way for into heart of country then held by enemy seem to take rather philosophically campbell de lisle said to hector a remained silent while be bemoaning fate see that be of use taking otherwise at least have have satisfaction of bearding spaniard who indeed seem to to behave wisely in remaining in intrenchment waiting until can unite force against however have shown that be not afraid of that even in middle of november be so eager to meet that have hastened to take field to strike blow before winter set in in earnest think possible that may have fight yet before get back leganez have reputation of being good general may yet combine troop at asti with of villanova turin try to cut off from carignano at moment turenne suddenly entered room to horse gentleman news have come that prince thomas be marching at head of three thousand foot fifteen hundred horse to cut off that leganez be moving with speed towards poirino with same object carry order for thousand cavalry a many infantry to be ready to march at once must be beforehand with prince thomas in ten minute cavalry infantry selected be in movement turenne placing at head of former rode on at gallop keeping on at full speed with cavalry occupied bridge before prince thomas came up on arrival latter having with three thousand foot fifteen hundred horse prepared to attack before did so turenne infantry arrived spaniard attacked with fury turenne troop stood firm repulsed a soon a fell back charged in turn broke enemy drove in headlong rout towards turin prince thomas be twice unhorsed thrown into ditch be now almost dark rank be unrecognized succeeded in making escape rejoining scattered troop while fight be going on d'harcourt have attacked marquis of leganez gained considerable advantage not knowing how fight be going on at santina did not venture to advance towards po a soon however a messenger from turenne brought news that prince thomas have be defeated continued march towards carignano be speedily joined by turenne horse took up duty of rear guard checked spaniard who be pressing on in hope of attacking french a crossed river held at bay until d'harcourt have got gun baggage wagon across river then following broke down bridge joined at carignano here army went into winter quarter d'harcourt whose health be bad retired to pas winter at pinerolo leaving command in hand of turenne who again established at susa began to make preparation for throwing convoy of provision into citadel of turin during fight at santina hector remained behind turenne while two young frenchman carried away by ardour joined in hot pursuit of enemy prince who have led charge have halted be alone here monsieur campbell yes sir where be de lisle chavigny rode on with cavalry sir turenne frowned have done well to remain aide de camp place be to carry order not to fight now sir ride at once to count hear battle be still going on tell have defeated scattered troop of prince that a soon a can gather men will march to join hector bowed turned horse galloped off while general rode on sending officer overtook in search of cavalry with order that be to abandon pursuit return instantly that evening after have entered carignano called de lisle chavigny into room gentleman said will have to choose whether remain with join one of cavalry regiment if remain with must bear in mind in future that be aide de camp that sole duty here be to carry order not to fight like trooper in battle be through hotheadedness of sort that battle be lost general without officer to carry order can hing towards controlling movement of troop in battle of following up victory covering defeat two young officer hung head murmured excuse enough gentleman turenne said be perfectly aware that be ardour that carried away ardour be bad leader over over again ardour of cavalry to pursue troop have defeated have brought about loss of battle courage be virtue most soldier posse steadiness coolness be rarer more useful on part of officer on general staff be absolutely indispensable doubt not that will remember in future will not have reason to complain of again next morning be hector turn to be in attendance on general behaved a expected must do turenne said when entered room on hearing bell sound fought close to a long a there be fighting to be done observed that used sword well moment drew rein did same took up post behind showing that although be first battle retained coolness will therefore tell in confidence that count d'harcourt have enjoined to throw provision if possible into citadel at turin will take time to make arrangement only fear be that garrison on hearing that have retired across po of may be sure spaniard will take care to inform may believe that will do more winter a know that provision must be well nigh exhausted will abandon citadel march thither be now well nigh eighteen month since be first cut off be certain that investment be very close one that most vigilant watch be used to prevent news of kind from reaching from outside have made several effort to communicate with without success of messenger sent never returned be doubtless detected killed others came back reported failure saying that avenue to citadel be so closely watched that be impossible to get through have objection general to mentioning matter to boy be absolutely convinced that be thoroughly faithful trustworthy may do so if like campbell though be hardly likely that will be able to suggest method of communication with garrison have not already be tried thank sir general shortly afterwards went out to wait upon duchess in two hour returned a soon a did so hector entered room what be turenne asked have be thinking about what said about garrison of turin have be talking over with paolo have come to offer to do best to deliver letter from to garrison if will do great honour to entrust mission to think that two boy must be much more likely to succeed than men one must regard with suspicion must creep crawl more easily say that must succeed think that must have chance of doing so at rate be willing to try must be very dangerous expedition turenne said gravely not more dangerous than going into battle viscount not quarter a dangerous a storming breach turenne smiled idea have passed through mind said must not have proposed have not first spoken be sort of mission in thought must be made useful be rough adventure to begin with must not minimize danger be duty of soldier to run risk of being killed in battle lie beyond duty to go into enemy camp to obtain news may volunteer for with knowledge that if detected must assuredly be hanged think general that risk of detection must be great risk of failure must be so if when get there can see possible mean of passing through line of sentry there must be nothing to do to come back own that in talking over thought might be obliged to return to tell have failed occupied much larger portion of thought than risk of being detected will not expect to succeed campbell chance be hundred to one against must be glad however to have experiment tried once again so that if garrison capitulates before arrive to succour will not be able to blame for not having made one more effort to induce to hold out for few week have thought of plan only so far sir that will dress up a two country boy cross po enter city from other side after must be guided by circumstance trust to good luck may ask general if have plan of city fortress yes at least duchess have one have placed at disposal can send officer to palace to request to let have doubt must be great advantage to to study position beforehand well sir will see about getting disguise at once will give order on paymaster for hundred crown for special service turenne said be a well to be amply provided with money a may be necessary to buy fresh disguise to bribe someone to conceal drew order on treasury handed to hector will find plan of town in room when return paolo be waiting for be settled paolo be to go be adventure after own heart boy said with delight will be great fun to outwit spaniard yes must mind that outwit paolo be quite a likely now let talk of disguise again think have better go buy must rather get old one than new suppose that anyone be likely to take notice of in street must be well at rate that must not have new clothes better that neither of did so can manage sir there be shop here where one can buy old clothes a well a new one noticed one other day in narrow street by wall wondered then who must buy of garment hung up be so old so often mended that be difficult to say what be original colour people be very poor up in mountain since war began doubtless have grown poorer be glad to buy anything will cover well here be ten crown wo cost half that master will take mind get something warm paolo be like enough that will have to sleep more than once in open air wind be bitterly cold in hour officer came with plan hector at once set to to study citadel stood on ground little if at higher than upon town be situated be pentagonal in form be built in be earliest fortification in europe in style be considered masterpiece be separated from town by glacis deep fosse ran along foot of wall town be walled extended to foot of citadel be capable of offering sturdy resistance even after citadel have fallen just a citadel must protect after capture of town by enemy hector examined carefully portion of town facing citadel took note of street ran through to wall specially noting extended farthest from wall before being broken by cross lane be evident from width of street that be poorest quarter of town for wealthy must not care to build house in position where if town citadel be hostile to other must be exposed to fire of latter gun in half hour paolo returned with large bundle contained two coarse cotton shirt two warm garment resembling waistcoat fastened by string closing up to neck two red sash of coarse flannel two loose doublet reaching down to hip be worn patched have be newly lined with breech reached down to knee be of coarse brown cloth to cover leg below knee be band of gray flannel be wrapped round round leg foot while over be worn wooden shoe hat be of conical shape with wide brim like clothes bore sign of long wear must not have be better paolo hector said a examined have seen score of boy so dressed will certainly attract attention by garb be warm too sha' come to harm from sleeping out in cost more than expected master owing to doublet being freshly lined thought must be worth quite right sheepskin will be most useful there be one thing more will want thin rope will bear weight well twenty yard long have better go to smith get to make strong iron hook by can fix rope on to edge of wall must be needed have better have made good nine inch across hook shank fifteen inch long after again studying map took to general have disguise sir will be ready to start tomorrow morning have lost time general said approvingly will of course ride to chivasso will give order to governor there to take charge of horse clothes telling that be about to proceed on mission in disguise requesting to send officer to pas through outpost beyond bridge across po be if other side be not guarded by spanish troop must advise to make straight south so a to strike road from casale two mile west of turin like letting go lad yet feel be of such importance that garrison must know aid will be at hand before long that feel ought not to prevent from carrying out enterprise when do think of starting at eight in morning sir if do so will easily reach chivasso before dark may be near turin by morning will have note for commandant ready by time horse be at door will make a small a possible have better before start sew up in lining of coat so that if be searched own think to be likely unless in other way excite suspicion of spaniard may not be found upon think sir must rather make into little pellet can swallow fancy that if be suspicious enough to search must rip lining open must be better way certainly campbell see that have thought matter over thoroughly of course will take arm with nothing long knife peasant carry one may be possible that will be compelled to silence sentinel if must not mind sir must like to have six copy of letter to commandant must manage to swallow six a well a one a be not likely that will be able to enter citadel must be a well to give better chance of finding letter if have to try to shoot throw in will be done will use thinnest paper so that if have to swallow can do so without difficulty if find can not by possibility get message in through town sir will try to cross river so make way in on side must be even more dangerous than other turenne said on side even stricter watch be likely to be kept than on facing town for spaniard know that garrison be not strong enough to attempt enterprise against city while might at moment attempt to break out march away on other side own see how can possibly succeed in case assuredly there must be more chance on side of town have be thinking over will order troop of cavalry to ride with to chivasso for spanish horse from time to time make foray from turin carry off prisoner burn village until be in position to make general advance be impossible to check attack without keeping whole of cavalry massed near turin wearing out horse men by necessity for perpetual vigilance now goodbye may fortune attend be too rash letter will be sent in hour time a issued out from susa found troop of cavalry awaiting officer in command be well known to hector said so be that be to escort to chivasso monsieur campbell yes be sorry to give occasion for so much trouble trouble at have not be in saddle for past week ride to chivasso will make pleasant change besides have brother in garrison there so that altogether will be debtor see be not allowed to ride beyond st ambrogio rivoli at farthest for once beyond that must be liable to be caught by enemy scouting party of course have strong force at rivoli except to drive off small party of enemy who may venture to come up too close be forbidden to engage in affair be annoying one can understand that general be anxious to avoid encounter in enemy be sure to be superior in force until reinforcement come up be able to take field in earnest think will be otherwise than inferior in force even when last regiment come up hector said what with holland rhine frontier of spain be clear that cardinal must have a much a can do to enable commander to make head against enemy be secret that beyond one more regiment of cavalry will arrive with count d'harcourt other reinforcement be likely to reach for time to come then see have turenne a well a d'harcourt of ought to count for two three thousand men well must rather fight against long odds officer said than be kept here month after month doing nothing here be winter coming on suppose will put stop to everything must hardly think so hector replied be sure that viscount be a eager for action a be winter here be not same thing a in holland on rhine from what hear there be very little snow in plain a country be generally flat army must march almost a easily a in summer in respect must be better off how do mean mean that in summer barn must be empty of food until filled again by harvest whereas in winter must be well stocked with forage for cattle horse be right monsieur campbell certainly there must be nothing to prevent operating through winter will look forward even more eagerly than did before for d'harcourt return will come back with tomorrow from chivasso will depend upon circumstance think be more probable that will not return to susa for few day order be to report to governor body of enemy cavalry be met with on way at four o'clock in afternoon rode into chivasso alighted at commandant on stating that be bearer of despatch from general hector be at once shown in a have more than once ridden there with despatch from turenne be known to officer heard of victory three day since latter said a hector handed despatch fired salvo of gun in honour of italian deserter from other side brought news two general be unwounded hope yes colonel loss be altogether slight commandant opened despatch looked little surprised at content so be going to endeavour to pas message into citadel be difficult undertaking enemy watch be very vigilant one once twice during siege men have succeeded in swimming po evading enemy guard of late have be doubled for be thought that garrison may attempt to break out on town side firing have ceased know that store of provision be almost exhausted regard a waste of powder shot to continue cannonade only result in citadel answering that with very much more effect than spanish gun produce may ask if have plan of getting in sir must decide upon when see how matter stand who be colonel asked servant who be very sharp intelligent lad whom can thoroughly trust alone must hing for have only picked up few phrase in italian yet must be detected at once so anything have to be said must be said by may ask sir if enemy be in force on other side of bridge if so must cross by swimming above below there be regiment there until three day ago marched away doubt formed portion of prince thomas force know well enough that although garrison can hold wall be not strong enough to undertake enterprise then sir have only to ask for escort for mile so beyond other side of bridge in case company must have be left to watch road beyond will dismount proceed on foot will if please put on disguise here with exception of hat perhaps will lend couple of long cloak so that appearance may not be noticed although will not start until after dark be a well to be upon safe side maybe enemy have spy in town be noticed that two young peasant rode out under escort of troop of cavalry news might be sent to turin in case might be arrested a soon a entered city must be obliged if must give order to officer in command that one of trooper must bring horse cloak hat back here with governor rang bell on orderly entering said tell captain sion to have troop in readiness to start in hour time in order to form escort for one of viscount turenne officer tell that when have troop ready to start be to come to for detailed order have said hour monsieur campbell went on after orderly have left room because in first place be not yet dark in second will take twenty minute to prepare meal will have long night work before dare say have have nothing since halted for breakfast thank colonel have not thought of must certainly have remembered before tomorrow morning halted for breakfast at eleven if have not be for kind offer must have have chance of getting anything till entered turin even there le go into cabaret better be true have sent message to cook twenty minute be utmost can give for preparation of meal chapter iv success although governor apologized to hector for poorness of repast haste with have be prepared be really excellent consisting of soup fish fresh from river cutlet omelette with bottle of good wine of asti paolo want have be attended to in kitchen be six o'clock when started officer in command have already received instruction governor accompanied hector to door where two horse be standing saddled be not own said be two of mine thought yours have made sufficiently long journey today thanking for kindness hector mounted took place by side of captain simon while paolo fell in with orderly riding close behind presume monsieur that be going to obtain information for viscount turenne want to ask question a to nature of mission a have order to bring back with horse cloak hat presume that in first place be going on foot in second be going in disguise judgment be correct captain viscount wish to obtain certain information be going to fetch for if can hope that will be successful sir be good night for travelling star be bright moon down so that will have light enough to keep road time enough to step aside must meet party who might be inclined to question passersby do know road well about here hector asked be stationed in turin before enemy came with too great force to be resisted want to strike across country to come into road from turin to casale at distance of three four mile from city mile so away road branch off from keep by river be mere country road except in two three small village that will pas through be not likely to meet with anyone upon be about eight mile to main road from point where turn off will then be five mile from turin be just possible that may meet patrol must think very unlikely now that army have gone into winter quarter at carignano be not likely to be very vigilant a rode along hector related of incident of late battle sign of enemy be met with officer presently said be sorry to say that be point where leave monsieur wish have be little farther so must hear more of fight hector paolo dismounted two trooper be called up took charge of horse while cloak hat be given to officer orderly then two lad put on savoyard hat have carried under cloak officer took two packet from holster colonel bade give to at starting said thought that after long walk on foot must want slight refreshment before inn be open in morning will please give hearty thanks for thoughtfulness hector said accept same for courtesy in escorting now be fairly on way paolo went on a turned down lane for be little more package be bottle of wine one have handed to contains eatable be good master will find pretty cold before morning there be nothing like good meal to warm one up again did get bow arrow at chivasso yes sir went out bought a soon a got there wanted told man for boy of ten year old have be good deal too long be glad of for child bow must hardly have be

that matter not at be stronger will send arrow good distance have got six arrow a ordered be regular arrow made man shorten so a to suit bow then repoint have got inside doublet tied together made hole in lining under arm put in have not forgotten cord hope paolo not master must have deserved having ear cut off if have done so be in hurry walked only fast enough to keep warm in two hour half

driving pig goat either of must do hector said know where market be must never do to seem ignorant of that snow have stopped suddenly minute before sun be now shining be lucky hector said a walked down towards road may hope that there will be no more snow that sun will soon melt what have fallen must be fatal to if ground be white for most careless sentry must not help seeing upon reached road just a peasant came along be old man be dragging behind pile of faggot be placed upon two rough pole be walking between holding two end in hand while others trailed along on ground behind bargain with paolo be heavy load father latter said ay be heavy how much do expect to get for faggot in town will get crown man said must not take under ought to be worth more than now snow have begun to fall be going into town paolo said be younger than between must drag along easily have got crown in pocket to buy thing with mind giving to for load if can sell faggot for few soldi over will be able to buy something for ourselves be bargain lad old man said be getting old rheumatism be in bone will be very glad to be spared journey so give money take pole hope will be successful sell little higher have better ask crown half woman be sure to beat down will make ten twelve soldi for yourselves paolo handed crown to old man how have better take paolo hector asked a old man chuckling with satisfaction at having escaped toilsome journey turned to retrace step there be room for between shaft paolo said one behind other must be much easier to walk holding pole than for to take one a in way weight will be balanced on side of there be indeed just room between end of pole pile of brushwood for to walk close behind other a greater portion of weight rested on other end of pole did not find burden heavy one how be going to sell paolo will have difficulty in selling master frost will set housewife on lookout for wood will find that sha' have to go far before be accosted be two mile from spot where have bought faggot to gate of turin sha' be sorry to get rid of load hector said be not weight roughness of pole hand be quite chafed by loose hold for bit master hand have be accustomed to rough work many load of faggot have drawn in time will hold on paolo be not more than quarter of mile farther hand have done plenty of work too have be done with handled weapon be well that must become accustomed to harder work passed without question through gate following example of other vendor of wood of whom saw several paolo began to shout large faggot for sale be not long before door opened woman beckoned how much do want for whole crown half paolo said have be offered a many for crown woman replied then signora did wrong to refuse took two day work to cut have dragged here for mile two crown must not pay for labour not one scudo must take under price have named why if town be besieged faggot must be worth twenty crown before winter be over well will give money woman said be extortionate generally can buy at price say to paolo laughed with two army wanting firewood cutting down copse without even taking trouble to ask leave of owner think that will see firewood very scarce in city before long well carry in pile in yard be soon done pole be thrown on to top of heap boy went off along street again have made crown for ourselves paolo laughed now must decide how will spend must be good plan to spend money anyhow hector said what kind of thing must be likely to buy for family in country well must say cooking pan to begin with few yard of warm stuff for making mother skirt well buy cooking pan first sling across shoulder then a wander about can look in shop will seem a if be on search for article that have be told to purchase must be better than sauntering about without apparent object first let walk briskly towards side of town facing citadel strada vecchia be one want to examine first knowledge that have gained from plan of city enabled hector to find street without having to ask question now buy cooking pan at next smith shop come to then can go slowly along making observation soon found that street have entered be for most part deserted by inhabitant shop be closed road be strewn with fallen chimney balcony here there be yawning hole showing how severely street have suffered when artillery duel be going on between gun on wall of citadel short distance down street chain be stretched across here musketeer be pacing up down on guard two others must be seen at farther end of street where there be gateway in wall now closed up with sandbag piled thickly against will see if other street be similarly guarded be found to be so sentry being placed in street running down to wall in quarter so far so good paolo think that matter must have be better for next thing be to buy tool with can wrench open door shutter of window door will be best because must not work at shutter without running risk of being seen by sentinel while in doorway must be screened from observation house in strada vecchia be old door ought not to give much trouble of old lock be very strong master must think that must be easier to cut out one of panel than to force door open possibly must be not easy thing to get saw to work must have to bore hole large enough for saw to go through before must use however will buy saw crowbar a be thing be useful to woodcutter buying will not appear suspicious will purchase of auger have better get at different shop leaving that part of town re entered street where business be being carried on a usual wo buy thing until late in afternoon paolo there must be advantage in dragging about day sauntered about street for hour then paolo went into small baker bought two loaf of coarse bread at shop purchased cheese with sat down on stone bench in principal square leisurely ate food looked on at crowd consisted principally of soldier spanish veteran stiff in carriage haughty in manner together with others horse foot belonging to contingent of duke of milan ally of spanish among be townspeople younger one chatting with other with lady of acquaintance middle aged older men talking gravely together a walked up down among there be air of gloom depression state of panic in troop of prince thomas who have marched out confident that be about to annihilate french have returned knowledge that marquis of leganez have also failed have created feeling of deepest disquiet among portion of population who have taken leading part in throwing off authority of duchess in acknowledging that of prince thomas have regarded her cause a lost vigorous step that france be taking to assist have caused uneasiness if while a yet comparatively small force have arrived have shown so bold front have captured chieri in face of powerful army have revictualled casale have defeated prince thomas forced way past array of leganez might well be that in spring when reinforcement reached might even defeat spaniard lay siege to turin boy remained where be until began to grow dusk when after buying at three shop saw crowbar auger went sat down on doorway in quiet street until eight o'clock then took way to strada vecchia be entirely deserted light showed in one two of window except that must hear tread of nearest sentry be silent taking off wooden shoe moved cautiously along keeping close to house fourth came to have unusually deep doorway decided at once that must suit purpose first tried with crowbar lock held firmly will try way paolo if door yield will go with crash sentry might come down to see what have caused noise have better take out lower panel will want four hole bored touching other to make one large enough for saw to enter wood be of oak took paolo fully five minute to make hole now give auger hector said when be found that hole be large enough for saw to pas through will begin at bottom of panel while saw away at top paolo have done share by time hole along bottom be ready for saw now take auger again hector said have not done half work yet hole must be made on side there be turning saw took hour half of hard work before last cut be completed panel fell forward go in first paolo will follow will wedge panel into place again with of chip that auger have cut out one have passed since began if anyone did come along before morning must not be likely to notice that panel be gone still be a well to avoid risk a soon a panel be replaced mounted stair before beginning have seen that there be light in of window feeling sure that house be deserted groped way upstairs without hesitation until reached attic in sloping roof entered one of facing street opened casement in oiled paper took place of glass stepped down on to parapet course be now easy division between house be marked by wall six foot high extending from edge of parapet over roof be able to climb however without having to use cord one helping other up then being assisted by have left cooking pan tool with exception of crowbar behind have fastened wooden shoe round neck sun during day have melted snow have fallen in morning light flake be again beginning to come down fast care how hard snow a long a keep on hector said in low voice in answer to exclamation from paolo when first flake fell upon face harder better for in case sentry must see dozen pace away there be advantage wind be from north have only to keep driving snow on right cheek to make way straight to fortress whereas with overcast sky on dark night a must very soon lose idea of direction that be going in being obliged to use great caution to avoid noise while getting over wall took hour to reach end of street have while waiting before commencing operation twisted one of sash then wound round hook so thickly that must fall almost noiselessly upon ground snow prevented from seeing six foot below felt sure that there must be narrow lane between house wall have during day bought length equal to of rope of strong string have got a ordered master paolo said a came out of shop must never bear weight think might do in case of necessity hector said in fact be sure must doe not require great thickness of new cord to hold man weight want for paolo walked silently along for time then said if be not wanted to carry weight master can not think what be wanted for be wanted to get hook down with see when get down into street there must be little chance of getting hook off hold will most likely want again certainly will want rope have be puzzling over think have found way at last idea be to fasten thin rope to point of hook then on pulling upon point will rise until get level with top of wall on be fixed can then shake down without difficulty know whether will act think that ought to do so upward pull at point must must think lift a far a edge must think that must paolo agreed must never have thought of will try on last division wall have doubt about because even if did not pull quite to top thing must be so canted over think must fall from own weight now attached string to point fixed hook to top of wall then pulled upon string hook at once fell to foot be capital hector said now can go to work need carry crowbar farther in first place will cross roof other roof a far a can go sentry at corner be probably standing up for shelter in doorway may a well get a far a can from at same time not go far enough to get near one at next corner after one two attempt hook became fixed on ridge of roof at once climbed up unfastened hook slid down on now snow covered tile two more roof be crossed in same way then prepared to descend have when put on disguise tied knot in rope at distance of foot apart now adjusted hook on parapet will go first master will will go first though in fact matter little of doe first must warm finger think must trust to at present gathered handful of snow made into ball held in hand until cold pained then dropped snow thrust hand up sleeve of doublet paolo looked on in astonishment having great faith in master imitated example be curious way of warming hand said daresay have made snowball in time paolo if have will remember that although made hand bitterly cold at first after have done soon became almost a hot a fire do remember that master must never have thought of a way of warming hand for minute two there be sharp pain a blood began to rush into finger when passed off hand be in glow hector took rope lowered over parapet then began to descend when halfway down darkness became more intense than before knew that be now below level of outer wall when reached ground shook rope a signal then stretching arm before crossed lane be step for house stood five foot back from wall waited until paolo joined then drew on thin rope to satisfaction felt yield stand aside said be heavy enough to give one nasty thump paolo withdrew few pace then hector gave pull rope gave way at once flattened against house hook fell with dull thud foot two away coil up rope paolo then feel along wall to right go too far will go to left there may be step up to rampart proved to be case together made way up quietly even have have shoe on snow be already sufficiently deep to deaden footstep on reaching top stood silent for minute two presently heard sound of heavy stamping of foot turned at once to descend if necessary step have mounted then hector put hand upon other shoulder whispered be sentry trying to warm foot doubt be standing up somewhere to shelter from snow let go on at once crossed rampart fastened hook on top of wall descended be again successful in bringing rope down after go carefully paolo doubt there be moat somewhere here there be however necessity for caution for white surface of snow be soon broken by black line will be awfully cold paolo said with teeth chattered at prospect of course can swim paolo not very well master then will go first fasten rope under arm will haul across be sure make noise in getting into water first of take off doublet will carry mine across on head can not be many yard across wind will soon dry rest of thing once work be done can warm by running must say strip altogether may have to do swim for a agreed there be chance of being able to return by way came fastening two doublet on head hector lowered into water be three foot below level on stood have fastened rope across shoulder a expected found water out of depth at once struck out to opposite side be about forty foot across found on reaching other side that wall be there nearly five foot above water undid rope threw up hook at second attempt caught climbed side then in low voice told paolo to start presently heard slight splash followed by gasp hauled away rapidly on rope in couple of minute paolo stood beside shivering gasping put doublet on now let go forward a fast a can climbed steep slope to top of glacis then ran down until be brought to standstill by moat be one marked in plan a dividing fortification of town from of citadel now have swim before be wider than last be really distance give doublet again mind so much paolo said can not be colder than be try to swim paolo lie on back with mouth just out of water will have over in time be fully fifty yard across accustomed to bathe in almost icy cold water swim be nothing to hector who be soon across who then towed paolo over a before mounted glacis presently reached edge of third moat need go farther know that moat be fifteen yard from foot of fortification now get arrow out cut off foot two of thin cord unravel must warm finger again first can not use at mine be pretty cold too lad warmed a before paolo then set to work to string bow required strength to accomplish while be doing so hector drew from pouch six little pellet taking arrow straightened out pellet wrapped round arrow secured firmly with small strand from string when have done took bow from paolo fitted arrow to string drew with full strength then pointing arrow high loosed six arrow be sent off just a last be discharged there be shout of who be there speak fire be sentry on wall who have caught sound of twang of bow be friend messenger from french general hector replied have just shot six arrow into fortress message be attached to for governor report to officer have search made for in morning be piece of good luck went on a turned away thought of shouting might have got shot in reply made sure that one other of arrow must be picked up still make certain of think must rather stop out here until morning paolo said then will take in be afraid will never get across river nonsense water be low be not likely to have to swim farther than did in crossing last moat getting through part of town between river be more serious matter however be not very far across be not likely to be very vigilant turned to right kept along at edge of moat until hector considered that have made fourth of circuit of wall be now facing river have decided before must be easiest side on to leave town sentinel must not expect that anyone attempting to enter leave citadel must try to do so here a in addition to passing wall facing fortress that bordering river must be obliged to swim river snow be falling a quickly a ever wind blowing fiercely there be fear of seeing unless happen to run into very arm of sentry hector said encouragingly will only have moat to swim a according to plan be nothing like so wide a passed before will have trouble with ah here be paolo groaned nonsense hector said one cold bath more le make difference now there give coat again will take over moat be indeed twelve yard across in two three minute paolo stood shivering on other side edge be not far from wall not much more than breadth of moat give cord few step reached wall after two attempt hook caught hector climbed up be looking back to watch paolo when be suddenly seized from behind deep voice in italian said if move will kill who be with sudden effort hector twisted round seized disengaged wrist of opponent doubted not held dagger man loosened hold of doublet tried to grasp neck hector in moment leapt forward threw arm round man waist wrestled backwards forward soldier be powerful man hector found that must not long retain grasp of wrist suddenly felt antagonist collapse dagger dropped from hand other arm relaxed hold fell lifeless mass thank paolo be just in time fellow be too strong for now let slip down inside of wall a quickly a possible minute later stood at foot of wall hook be shaken off proceeded along wall until came to street be not more than two three hundred yard to outer wall hector whispered whether there be sentinel not in street knew not if so have withdrawn into deep doorway to avoid blinding snow wind drowned slight sound made by foot on soft snow in short time reached outer wall crept along until found step leading up crossed in safety fixed hook rapidly descended run of fifty yard brought to edge of river bank will try to find boat hector said there be sure to be along here walked across dry bed of river till reached water edge then followed in few minute to delight came upon boat bow be hauled few foot out of water rope doubtless attached to heavy stone anchor stretched from bow cut put shoulder to gunwale soon have afloat then scrambled in put oar out cautiously began to row have have practice at exercise be not long before boat grounded on opposite shore pull up bit hector said doubt belongs to poor fisherman to whom loss must be serious now must keep along bank for distance until quite sure that be well beyond patrol enemy may have on road let get into run paolo see if ca get blood in motion again for own feel frozen set off at brisk trot kept up for hour then struck off from river soon found road following after hour walking came upon little shed by roadside in one corner found pile of old sack be in luck again hector exclaimed joyfully tired a be think that must have slept in wet clothes if one can call wet at present be frozen stiff sack be very thing can strip now wring out clothes thoroughly there be enough sack here to lay under cover too after wringing out shirt will put in under sack next to heat of body will dry to extent will be warm to put on in morning other thing can pile over there be chance of getting dry be so pleased with success that be not disposed to grumble at trifle chapter v relief of citadel a soon a first gleam of daylight showed hector companion be on foot again operation of dressing be by mean comfortable one for frost have set in in earnest during night clothes with exception of shirt be a stiff a board snow have ceased sky be clear be going to be fine day master paolo said a left hut be better than battling with snowstorm such a of yesterday evening come on paolo let trot for bit snow be four inch deep will soon get warm running through in quarter of hour broke into walk again panting from exertion be a warm a toast now paolo there be village mile ahead expect that lie on road sun will be up before get there doubt will be able to get hot spiced wine bread at wineshop turned out to be case have settled what story to tell when landlord asked what brought there so early paolo said that have be on road couple of hour a be going to see aunt who be ill at chivasso father wanted back again that night explanation satisfied host asked further question in ten minute be on way again greatly warmed comforted by meal after walking for hour half arrived at bridge of chivasso there be strong guard at bridge head for at moment garrison of turin aided by force from leganez army might endeavour to carry town by sudden assault lad passed bridge unquestioned entered gate of town made way to commandant house what do want sentry at door asked a came up regiment be french hector answered at once want to see governor have important news for soldier be greatly surprised for have not expected question to be understood by peasant boy sergeant called out here be two peasant boy who speak french want to see governor say that have news of importance to give sergeant came out sergeant hector went on quietly will please tell governor that two person sent out under escort evening before last wish to see by tone of assurance in lad spoke rather than by word sergeant saw that there be something more than appeared on surface at once took up message returned almost immediately please to follow said led way up to governor room welcome back again monsieur campbell have returned sooner than expected found of course that difficulty be insuperable on contrary sir have be successful have communicated with garrison of citadel have governor exclaimed in astonishment how on earth did manage heard that watch be so strict that be absolutely impossible for message to be sent through be not very difficult after be greatly favoured by snowstorm then gave account of how have managed pardieu exclaimed that be admirably done be keeping talking while be sitting in wet clothes think be quite dry now sir have walked so fast that be thoroughly warm still own will not be sorry to change for own governor rose opened door clothes be hanging up in closet will have hot water sent up at once will be breakfasting in hour so will have time to change comfortably hector be even more glad of thorough wash than of change of clothes went down to join governor at breakfast feeling greatly refreshed will wait on master be not necessary paolo have better go into kitchen at once have doubt governor have ordered to attend to want a did before four other officer have just arrived on invitation of governor to breakfast one of be captain who have commanded escort gentleman commandant said let introduce to monsieur campbell lieutenant on staff of viscount turenne have just returned after having successfully carried out most dangerous difficult mission namely that of communicating with garrison of turin officer gave exclamation of surprise while captain simon stepped forward shook hand warmly with hector did not tell exactly what be going to do said thought that be to see of duchess adherent in turin never dreamt that be going to attempt to communicate with citadel have known that certainly must not have expected to see again for from what have heard be next to impossible to get through enemy line will not trouble monsieur campbell until have finished breakfast commandant said have already told briefly how managed will be a glad a will to have detail accordingly after breakfast hector related at much greater length story that have told governor of manner in mission have be carried out ma foi colonel said must rather have faced battery than swum moat in such weather well gentleman think that will agree with that monsieur de turenne be fortunate in having so brave enterprising officer on staff officer cordially assented wonder that did not enter citadel stay there till convoy arrived in first place colonel have received no order to do so general might require for other service in second place have not returned must not have known whether message have reached garrison so might have hurried on preparation more hastily than otherwise must have done might in fear that garrison must surrender have made attempt before have collected sufficient food to last until be in position to raise siege reason be good one certainly with shelter warmth close at hand for sentry must speedily have passed word along a soon a be ascertained that be indeed french officer alone gate must have be opened for must have required small effort to turn away to face danger of passing sentry scaling wall of possibly having to swim po of certainly having chance of getting change of clothes until arrived here for must not have calculated upon finding shed much le sack with snow falling heavily be piece of good fortune indeed if have not found must have gone on walking until got here still have have little sleep night before be heartily glad that have farther to go now sir with permission will start for susa at once escort returned yesterday will send troop of cavalry with thank sir think that there be necessity for be very well mounted must see party of enemy cavalry think that ought to be able to outdistance will be glad colonel if officer will say nothing about manner in communicated with garrison a doubtless enemy have spy here if story come out reach ear of authority at turin must have chance whatever of making way in in same manner must general entrust with mission to communicate with citadel quarter of hour later hector paolo mounted rode out of town kept vigilant lookout traveled by byroad saw none of enemy party reached susa late afternoon on sending in name to turenne hector be at once shown into room did not expect back for three four day campbell general said be heartily glad to see again safe sound blamed for letting go of course a expected found task altogether impossible one have be otherwise must not have be back so soon on contrary general for must have tried many plan before gave up a be have only to report have carried out instruction that despatch be in hand of garrison of citadel say so turenne said rising from table at have be sitting writing when hector entered shaking warmly by hand congratulate on having performed mission seemed well nigh hopeless by what miracle did succeed in passing through enemy line who have tried before have died in attempt have returned to tell that be absolutely impossible one must have be very difficult general have not weather favoured snowstorm drove sentry into shelter even have remained at post must not have seen five yard away can understand once beyond wall might in such storm make way unnoticed up to fortress understood that not only be there guard on wall down near great moat that there be also sentry in street leading to wall that none be allowed to pas along leading to wall facing citadel tell how managed story be long one sir never mind how long be give detail be not particularly busy at present must fain know exactly how feat have be accomplished hector told story at length beyond asking question now then turenne remained silent until have brought to conclusion have never heard story interested more said know to admire more ingenuity in planning affair hardihood courage with carried out even have there be enemy to get through adventure of letting down by rope from housetop then from battlement swimming three moat crossing river in such terrible weather finally making way to chivasso in frozen clothes be slight feat of endurance service that have rendered be great one manner in have carried out be worthy of highest praise will at once make out commission a captain be still year behind added with smile if go on in way bid fair to obtain regiment a soon a did have nearly four year to do in tomorrow will dictate story in full to secretary will be sending messenger with despatch on following day will mention have promoted to rank of captain that story of action that have performed will inclose will fully explain reason for so speedily advancing require thanks have to thank only may consider that have not only done state service servant deserves reward also here be twenty pistoles tell not to throw away to lay by where day will be useful to paolo be astonished indeed when hector handed general present must at first hardly believe that be meant for why master said must buy farm up in hill not very large one paolo daresay that will add to still be good beginning more opportunity may come in way what will do with master can not say certainly can not carry about with do know anyone to whom must entrust paolo shook head there be never knowing who be honest man who be not said will bury master somebody might find fear of sir will go bit up valley bury under big rock well above river so that will not be reached in highest flood might lie there hundred year without anyone finding even if soul in susa knew that be hidden somewhere went out to search for very well be sure take notice of exact position of stone may not be able to find again one big stone be good deal like choose stone with tree growing near make cross with knife on bark will serve a guide to must recognize stone by even if must not find in other way thank master will go out tomorrow morning choose stone then when begin to get dark will go out bury money there must not do to hide in daytime for even be there one on road someone upon hill might catch sight of come down afterwards to see what be disposing of well think that be best thing that can do paolo there be certainly danger in leaving in anyone hand for when return to claim perhaps year hence might find that be dead place might be captured burned down yes think that hiding be safest way will be pleased to hear that general have given commission a captain be good news indeed boy said be just going to ask master what have done for because though went with be who planned business only did a told have something to do with planning too paolo however think that may feel well content with reward that have obtained for two day work a hector went out met de lisle chavigny well met former exclaimed have just left general have told what have done that have made captain in consequence be just coming to look for to carry off to supper in honour of promotion deserve if anyone ever did there be doubt of chavigny said heartily be quite proud of comrade seems absurd must be captain not absurd at chavigny said turenne be captain when be year younger than be there be many noble who have be made colonel before ever drew sword in battle hector be much pleased at evidently genuine congratulation of companion have indeed rather feared that must take promotion ill being nearly five year senior having served in two previous campaign might well feel hurt at being promoted while still remained only lieutenant young noble indeed felt shade of jealousy be of late that there have be regular army for noble still brought tenant retainer to field supported at own expense to de lisle chavigny grade of military rank be of account whatever rank of colonel must add in way to position a member of noble family fought for honour against enemy of france be always addressed by family name must have resented being called lieutenant be proud of being turenne aide de camp have thought of remaining in army after war be over a must then resume place at court have taken strong liking to young comrade whose manner of thought differed so widely from own appreciated merit of action of general have spoken in such warm term fact that in point of military rank be now above concerned in way be merry supper at best hotel in susa see now de lisle chavigny said advantage of taking morning dip in snow water must have swum across moat remained night long in wet clothes for thousand crown for five thousand other laughed pas wine make shiver to think of fancy may a well admit at once that if mission have be entrusted to must have made mess of must have be shot by guard in first street entered a to climbing along roof of house till have passed first line of sentinel idea must never have entered head of course might have disguised ourselves might have got into town by harnessing to load of faggot once there must have have more chance of getting into fortress than if have at once proclaimed french officer have requested pas into citadel for next ten day effort be made to obtain cart pack horse from village round susa number of wagon filled with provision be brought from carignano where principal supply for army have be collected on fourteenth day be ready late in afternoon convoy with fifteen hundred men from susa four piece of artillery marched out at same hour force at carignano six thousand strong leaving only small body to garrison city started for turin along farther bank of po just a day broke heavy cannonade be opened by against one of city gate astonished alarmed troop in city flew to arm hurried to repulse attack quarter of hour later dim light of morning showed astonished sentry at end of town surrounding citadel considerable force advancing to attack of gate there opposite at distance of two hundred yard four cannon be placed scarcely have made out enemy when opened fire few round gate be in splinter infantry rushed forward sentry on wall took to flight assailant pushed forward to inner gate access be obtained from side to citadel then under direction of officer assailant occupied side street at once procession of cart be allowed to pas along of garrison ran down lowered drawbridge across moat amid exultant shout store sufficient for many month be conveyed into citadel cart a quickly a be unloaded returned through gate passed out into country beyond by time fierce fight have begun a soon a firing be heard opposite citadel prince thomas military adviser guessed at once that attack have be feint made with object of effecting relief of citadel calling several regiment to follow hastened in direction on way met fugitive hurried on with speed a approached street through wagon be passing out be checked by heavy fire four gun have be placed in pair at end of street house near filled with troop who kept up murderous fire from window on head of column held completely in check until last wagon have be taken out then cannon be removed when too be fairly outside city bugle call summoned defender of house infuriated italian spaniard when rushed down into street between gate found that last of foe have escaped artilleryman ran up to wall only to find that gun have be spiked be powerless to inflict serious damage upon retiring force prince thomas ordered sally at moment regiment of cavalry from chivasso be seen dashing across plain being without artillery cavalry order be countermanded indeed prolonged roll of artillery at other end of city seemed to show that french be converting feigned attack into real one turenne have accompanied column from carignano for knew that sound of firing might bring up leganez from asti that might find retreat to carignano intercepted moment however that sound of four gun at equal interval showed that other column have achieved object at once fell back fire ceasing few minute before prince thomas horse arrived at wall have not be accompanied by hector who be with force from susa carried message to garrison said be right that must have honour of leading party to relief on arriving near city hector have dismounted giving horse in charge of paolo have placed at head of company be first to enter town captain being transferred to company now men said a stood waiting for dawn to break moment enter gate company will mount wall to right other half to left will push along to next angle of wall lieutenant one of will go with wing of company will oppose to last force may march along rampart to attack want one soldier to keep by a day began to break man grasped firelock awaited signal with impatience cheer broke from a four cannon roared out at same moment at so short distance shot told on gate salvo half of gate be splintered aim at centre where lock be officer shouted get ready men hector said round gate will fall a cannon rung out there be shout of triumph one of gate fell to ground hector dashed forward followed closely by company not single shot be fired from wall men burst through gate cheering leading wing of company turned to right led by hector ran up step close to gateway on to rampart take on to bastion at angle of wall lieutenant think that be likely to be attacked at present enemy must have be drawn off to other end of city now man open bag in be couple of dozen large nail hammer drive one of right down vent of gun be right one more blow will do wo get nail out soon went along wall spiking gun until reached half company drawn up in bastion enemy in sight lieutenant none sir at least not on wall heard running away in street below remember lieutenant force may come along must withstand will not be for long will be at once supported if hear firing then retraced step along rampart passed over gateway saw to spiking of gun a far a next angle of wall here repeated instruction to lieutenant there think said that there be much chance of being attacked enemy must have to make detour right round citadel to come here certainly will return by shortest way a soon a discover that other attack be feint then returned to first party get two gun said out of embrasure wheel here be likely enough that may be hotly attacked presently waited hour by time wagon be beginning to pour out of town have done business lieutenant citadel be revictualled ah here come enemy just too late strong body of troop be seen marching rapidly towards almost at same moment heavy fire broke out in street gun have be loaded from small magazine in bastion have be trained to fire along rampart when within hundred yard enemy opened fire hector ordered men to lie down not to reply until gave order lay in two line first be to fire second to reserve fire until ordered took post at one gun lieutenant at other messenger have be sent along wall to bring up twenty five men of other wing when enemy be within fifty yard asked quietly doe gun bear well on centre of column yes captain then fire ball cut way through dense column load again four men told off to duty leapt to foot there be halt for moment then spaniard came on again when be within twenty pace hector fired at same time shouted first line give fire twenty five musket flashed out ball taking effect on head of column spaniard recoiled leading rank being swept away many of behind wounded for three ball have be rammed down mouth of cannon fired by hector musketry volley have done terrible execution at moment twenty five men sent for ran up second line give fire hector shouted discharge added to confusion in column many ran down step into lane by side of wall have loaded again lieutenant yes sir with three ball then form up men deliver fire hector said to newcomer now lieutenant touch off a discharge rang out mingled with roar of gun hector shouted fix bayonet charge wooden shaft of bayonet be thrust down barrel of firelock with cheer seventy five men rushed upon shattered head of column charge be irresistible enemy at once fled at full speed along rampart leapt from wall into lane below well done men well done hector shouted pursue reload cannon though think there be much fear of returning few minute later soldier who have carried spike who have be left on wall ran up to say that last cart have passed out go tell other party to fall back to gate hector said first give two spike hammer might run cannon into place of disabled so saying spiked two gun have done such good service then retired to gate where be joined by remainder of company a bugle rung out after last wagon have passed saw troop issuing from house at corner of cross street marched company across drawbridge out into country followed gun when reached spot where paolo be holding horse resigned command of company mounted men said have played part well be proud to have commanded soldier so steady courageous at moment general who be in command of force who have be last to leave town rode up men coming along at run have better hurry men on said to colonel with whom hector have acted enemy will be on rampart in minute may be sure that wo let off without trouble from gun beg pardon general hector said saluting gun along side of wall be useless have spiked have sir be well done indeed who gave order how did come by spike have order general be appointed to command first company entered be told that be to turn right left along rampart struck that a when have left enemy must be sure to turn gun upon must be a well to silence so brought nail hammer with for purpose must be well sir if have good many officer a thoughtful a be have saved from heavy loss for a country be perfectly level for mile round must have swept rank a marched off be attacked sir yes general by force of about four hundred men turned two of gun against men fought well repulsed with loss of fully hundred men bravo sir bravo will not fail to mention service that have rendered in report of affair have lost men sir lay down until enemy be within twenty pace of volley two cannon created confusion among spaniard when went at with bayonet fled at once have not single man killed only two three slightly wounded have only lost twenty general said most of be killed while serving gun be small price indeed to pay for magnificent success chapter vi change of scene hector gained great credit from report of manner in force have be enabled to draw off without loss from enemy gun owing to forethought in bringing with mean of spiking also for success in checking advance of enemy along rampart see monsieur turenne said to member of staff who with exception of hector be together on day after return to susa how important be for officer before setting out on expedition to think seriously over contingency may happen now vast proportion of officer consider that thinking have to be done by general that only have to obey order doubt be essential there may be numerous little matter in officer may render great service young captain of ours did not content with leading company to appointed through gateway before leaving susa must have thought over incident likely to occur a leading company must know that must be business to clear rampart to check party of enemy coming along way must be only natural for to determine to use enemy cannon to keep at bay must probably have occurred to most officer placed a be did not stop there must have thought over event must probably follow entry knew of course that feint at other end of town must draw off greater portion of garrison must be sure also that a soon a attack began became evident that real object be to revictual citadel must come pouring back again must have said to 'we will be able to keep at bay until work be done then will have to fall back what then enemy will mount rampart while main force pours out in pursuit gun on wall will play havoc with to prevent must silence before company retires be very simple when look at after be done yet probably did not occur to single officer of force except to captain campbell admit that did not occur to have done so must have ordered that of artilleryman must carry spike hammer upon entering town must immediately take step by rendering gun harmless to enable force to draw off without heavy loss in same way showed cool calculating brain when carried out that most dangerous service of bearing news that must speedily bring aid to citadel be difficult to imagine better laid plan thought of everything of disguise of manner in must alone be possible to approach closely to wall think that few of must have thought of making way up through house hundred yard away working along roof descending into lane by wall asked how got rope down be necessary for to use four five time afterwards showed plan by contrived to free hook be most ingenious did not seem to that must have acted a told asked to have one made so that might understand how be worked for such contrivance must be extremely useful in escalade when troop after descending into deep fosse need rope for climbing wall bastion there be gentleman a see by pulling thin cord hook be lifted from hold slightest shake will bring down contrivance be excellent one line took be well chosen accomplished most dangerous part first made way out by side where watch be most likely to be careless a anyone leaving entering town there must have to swim river feat show that have not only abundance of courage of very highest order that have head to plan leaf nothing to chance will see gentleman that if young officer life be likely to gain highest rank position already have reason to congratulate upon having almost a be by chance taken under protection winter passed quietly a soon a spring set in road be sufficiently good for passage of wagon d'harcourt prepared to attempt to raise siege of casale before leganez with twenty thousand men have intrenched road be still however far too heavy for cannon a garrison be becoming hardly pressed left gun behind started at end of april with seven thousand foot three thousand horse position occupied by spaniard be strong one general did not for moment think that french with force strength of own must venture to attack d'harcourt however resolved upon doing so divided force into three part two of be composed of french soldier third comprised force of duchess of savoy attack be successful on side although d'harcourt for time must make way turenne be repulsed three time before entered intrenchment spaniard be completely defeated lost gun ammunition baggage three thousand killed two thousand prisoner great number be drowned in endeavouring to cross river council of war be held be advice that turin must be besieged be after much debate accepted although seemed desperate enterprise for army of ten thousand men to besiege town garrisoned by twelve thousand while spaniard after recovering from defeat drawing men from various garrison must march to relieve town with eighteen thousand men time be lost in carrying turenne advice into effect army marched upon turin seized position round town threw up line facing city to prevent sortie being made by enemy surrounded by similar line to enable to resist attack by spaniard who be not long in approaching thus there be now four body of combatant garrison of citadel be surrounded besieged by of town town be besieged by turenne be surrounded by spaniard relied rather upon starving others out than upon storming position leganez managed to send messenger into turin telling prince thomas that intended to attack french calling upon to fall upon with troop at same time in pursuance of design retired distance up po proceeded to cross river at moncalieri d'harcourt despatched turenne to oppose passage before must arrive there five thousand men have crossed bridge without hesitating moment although force be much smaller one than of spaniard turenne attacked at once carried intrenchment have begun to throw up killed large number drove rest into river where hundred be drowned then set fire to bridge be of wood intrenched on bank of river occupied ford higher up completely checked advance of spaniard in direction be however wounded in shoulder be obliged to leave army to be carried to pinerolo while be away leganez attacked french line from without prince thomas from within former succeeded in passing twelve hundred horse one thousand foot into town french be now closely beleaguered began to suffer severely from famine in meantime fresh troop have arrived from france although not yet recovered from wound turenne took command escorted great convoy of provision into camp in spite of enemy effort to prevent townspeople be suffering even more severely sortie be made in great force be always repulsed a be attack made by leganez on th of september garrison surrendered being allowed to march out with arm count d'harcourt returned to france turenne again assumed command of army for winter hector conducted to satisfaction of general throughout campaign be severely wounded in last sortie made by besieged having be thrown down in charge of prince thomas cavalry trampled upon by horse being taken up for dead when enemy fell back directly heard news turenne sent surgeon to examine reported that still breathed that several of rib left arm be broken mended slowly turenne month after surrender of town came in one day to see said surgeon tell that will be month before be fit for service again that will need period of perfect rest to recover health there be convoy of invalid returning to france tomorrow think be best that must accompany there be rest to be obtained here know that will be fretting at being unable to ride at forced inactivity will give order that be conveyed in horse litter to sedan where brother duc de bouillon will gladly entertain for sake must remain there until entirely restored to strength think that there will be much doing on side of alp in next campaign unhappily france have trouble of own will find difficult to spare more troop in direction without reinforcement can act on defensive though may capture few town there be small chance of great operation indeed methinks that be by mean unlikely that prince thomas seeing that effort to rule savoy in place of sister in law duchess be likely to end in discredit loss to will before long open negotiation with therefore will be losing nothing by going be to duchess that will commend rather than to brother who be unfortunately occupied by public matter be at present almost at war with richelieu be man of noble impulse generous in extreme soul of honour know not how to conceal feeling in day man even most powerful can venture to rail in public against one who have offended when man happens to be cardinal love brother dearly have mixed up in way with affair be officer of king a such stand aloof from party in state cardinal be minister doubtless have fault be greatest man in france wisest life work for country may be true that be ambitious for glory of france be chief care be for purpose that have entered upon war for see that if germany becomes united under emperor who be by blood spaniard france must eventually be crushed spain become absolutely predominant in europe if be opposed richelieu strike hard because deems who oppose a not only own enemy a enemy of france a prince of church must have be bitter for to have to ally with protestant prince of germany with protestant holland protestant england have done so be true that have captured la rochelle broken power of huguenot lord of south new alliance show that be ready to sacrifice own prejudice for good of france when france be endangered that be on account of danger of civil broil to country rather than from hatred of huguenot that warred against here be whom deigns to honour with patronage huguenot brother bouillon be also huguenot strangely enough quarrel between cardinal did not break out until brother have changed religion be more rigorously brought up than be be taught to look upon catholic with abhorrence married not from policy from love catholic lady who be in respect worthy of for be a high spirited a generous a be at same time be gentle loving patient though deeply pious be free from bigotry be because brother came to see that tale have be taught of bigotry superstition of catholic be untrue at least in many instance that revolted against intolerance of doctrine in have be brought up renounced became adherent of wife religion nigh four year ago duke of soissons prince of blood incurred enmity of richelieu by refusing with scorn proposal that must marry countess of cobalet richelieu niece refusal still more language in refused excited deep enmity of cardinal soissons have joined party against a usual richelieu have king ear soissons be ordered to leave court went to sedan where be heartily received by brother who have warm affection for bouillon wrote to king hoping that must not be displeased at offering retreat to prince of blood king wrote permitting count to stay at sedan after time richelieu again endeavoured to bring about marriage upon have set heart be again refused being greatly exasperated insisted on bouillon obliging count to leave sedan brother naturally replied that king having at first approved of receiving soissons must not violate law of hospitality to prince of blood richelieu then persuaded king to refuse further payment to garrison at sedan although latter have confirmed agreement entered into by father whereupon brother openly declared against richelieu still further excited cardinal anger by furnishing asylum to archbishop of rheims second son of charles of lorraine who have also quarrelled with richelieu so matter stand at present what will come of know not doubt not that cardinal hostility to bouillon doe not arise solely from soissons affair serf a pretext see object for past four year have be to strengthen france by extending frontier to east by conquest of lorraine have already carried to upper rhine by obtaining from duke of savoy pinerolo dependency have brought up to foot of alp brother dukedom stand in way of grand project for be gate through enemy from beyond rhine might invade france moreover close family relationship between prince of holland must add to danger must holland at present ally fall out with france thus possession of bouillon dukedom at rate military occupation for time be consideration of vital importance to kingdom such see be situation be not officer in french army doubtless feeling must be on side of brother a be be faithful servant of king minister must deem height of dishonour be to use influence against what perceive be cause of france tell in order that may understand various matter might surprise at sedan go there a patient to be nursed by duchess sister in law having influence at present not even strength to use sword there be little fear that will seek to involve in party turmoil will write to brother that be soldier of france that have done good service that be protege of mine being of scottish blood belong to party save party that entreat that will not allow anyone to set against cardinal to try attach to party for want back again with a soon a be thoroughly cured hector must much rather have remained to be cured in italy did not think of raising slightest objection to turenne plan for next day started for sedan taking of course paolo with convoy traveled by easy stage over pass into france then escorted by sergeant eight trooper hector be carried north to sedan though still very weak be able to alight at entrance of duke residence sent in turenne letter to duchess three minute later duke came down captain campbell said heartily brother have done well in sending here to be taken care of nursed in letter to have spoken of more than once especially with reference to manner in carried message for to citadel of turin will be glad to do anything can for so brave young officer fear that for present will have to be under charge of duchess rather than mine duke be tall handsome man with frank open face merry laugh ready jest be extremely popular not only in own dominion among parisian fault be that be led too easily soul of honour believed others to be equally honourable so suffered to become mixed up in plot conspiracy to be drawn on into enterprise wholly foreign to nature will take at once to duchess see that be quite unfit to walk sit down beg until get chair for three four minute later four lackey came with carrying chair hector be taken upstairs to duchess apartment be gentleman of whom turenne have written to doubtless a see by letter upon table to also have be good deal damaged having be ridden over by squadron of prince thomas horseman need quiet rest turenne have told about duchess said welcome very heartily monsieur brother say that have great affection for belief will day become master in art of war say have rendered most valuable service be strange indeed seeing that be a yet very young be sixteen other day madam only sixteen already captain exclaimed be made captain nine month ago said for little service performed to satisfaction turenne must not have promoted unless have be important service be sure said with smile doe great thing expects great thing from others be affair of carrying message to garrison of citadel of turin urging to hold out a must come to relief soon duke said do not remember that wrote account of remember perfectly turenne said young officer did not imagine that must have be lad however captain campbell will not detain here talking will begin by considering to be very bad nurse directly received letter ordered chamber to be prepared for by time will be in readiness lackey ready to disrobe assist to bed need began held up finger please to remember sir that be head nurse here will go to bed at once will take light repast glass of generous wine after surgeon will examine remove bandage have be doubt not somewhat disarranged on journey then will say whether will be advisable that must keep bed for time will think be far best for for will be much more comfortable so than on couch however good to be sat upon by in health affords poor comfort to invalid have brought servant with yes madam be very faithful lad accompanied on enterprise that have be speaking of be merry fellow have proved good careful nurse sat up with for many night when be first hurt have ever since slept on floor in room will give in charge of majordomo who will see that be well taken care of can have pallet laid for at night on floor of room led way to very comfortable apartment where fire be burning on hearth lackey be already in waiting after few kind word left have fallen into good hand indeed hector said to what must sergeant macintosh say if knew be lodged in ducal palace that duke duchess have spoken to seen after comfort a if have be relation of own in spite of care attention that received hector recovery be slow even when spring came surgeon said that be unfit for severe work however letter that received from time to time from de lisle chavigny consoled for not only have winter passed without incident save capture of three four town by turenne be not at likely that event of great importance must take place account represented spaniard a being engaged in adding to strength of three four town in duchy of milan so evidently intended to stand upon defensive palace of sedan be centre of formidable conspiracy against richelieu messenger came went bouillon soissons archbishop of rheims be constantly closeted together have various ally at court believed that must be able to overthrow minister who have so long ruled over france in name of king a hector be now able to move about be acquainted with member of duke household learned much of what be going on from conversation that accidentally overheard must see that position be extremely serious one a treaty have be signed with ferdinand son of king of spain archduke leopold william son of emperor of austria by agreed to assist duke friend with large sum of money for raising soldier with seven thousand men in order to justify head of movement issued manifesto in styled prince of peace in rehearsed cardinal various act of tyranny cruelty towards rival arbitrary manner in carried on government declared that be leagued solely to overthrow power overshadowed that of king plunged france into war scourged people with heavy taxation a soon a manifesto be published in sedan hector went to duke lord duke said can not sufficiently thank for hospitality kindness with duchess have treated nevertheless must ask to allow to leave at once why sudden determination captain campbell if sir be private person must have hesitation after kindness that have shown in requesting to give employment in force that be raising be officer of king what be of far greater importance at present moment aide de camp of viscount turenne brother be reported be with army even indeed be here cardinal must at once conclude be representing viscount be perhaps intermediary through whom communication between brother be being carried on therefore must not only compromise be of importance might excite suspicion in richelieu mind against brother might result in recall from position in have so distinguished grievously injure prospect viscount warned against mixing with party saying that soldier must hold free from entanglement bent only on serving to utmost of power king france be right duke said heartily turenne have grievance against king cardinal have acted wisely in holding aloof from party badly a be affected towards richelieu will own that have never allowed brother relationship towards to prevent employing in post of honour have never sought to influence in slightest be far too proud of credit honour have gained to do aught must in way cause breach between cardinal what have said be very right true doubtless richelieu have spy in town a have elsewhere may have learned that young officer on brother staff be brought here last autumn grievously wounded be certainly well that now a time for action be at hand must retire be not thinking hope of returning at once for be day two ago that surgeon assured that must need three four month of quiet before must be fit to resume duty feel that lord moreover think that must be a well that must not join viscount at present for might well be supposed be bearer of important news from to therefore propose to go to geneva remain there until have completely recruited strength in swiss republic must pas unnoticed even by cardinal agent fact that although being comparatively short distance from piedmont abstained from joining general must if inquired show must not have be entrusted with private communication from to must not be better duke said when leave here must no longer wear that military scarf of course when enter switzerland there be reason why must disguise fact that be french officer having be severely wounded have come there to repair health doubtless many others have done so dressed a private person must excite attention swiss who strive to hold neutral to avoid giving offence might raise objection to french officer wearing military attire staying among that evening hector bade adieu to duchess to friend have made during stay next morning attended by paolo started for geneva be glad indeed that be off master latter said in truth have stayed here much longer must have become useless from fat idleness for have have nothing whatever to do to eat sleep be glad to be off too paolo be convinced in spite of what surgeon say that actual exercise will do more for than doctor potion rich food be stiff still be from doing nothing be not that coming from here presence might be inconvenient for turenne must journey straight to camp saw prince manifesto paolo nodded did master not being able to read write must make nothing of burgher coming along read aloud made shake in shoe with fright made way a quickly a must from so dangerous spot for seemed nothing short of treason to have heard such word read against cardinal fear that duke have made terrible mistake paolo hitherto who have ventured to measure strength with cardinal have be worsted many have lost everything be now fugitive from france have lost life a well a honour estate bouillon be independent prince so be lorraine although latter must put ten men in field to one duke must muster have be driven from principality soissons must not help except with name can archbishop of rheims not few of great noble must join duke did think that have prospect of success none have so far done so though possibly have given secret pledge will count for nothing unless seems that be likely to triumph be rumoured a know that have made alliance with spain austria will use a arm against france will throw over leave to fate whenever suit moreover alliance must assuredly deter who might otherwise range with from taking up arm huguenot must fight by side of spaniard although guise catholic noble allied with spain against henri of navarre be in matter in deemed religion in danger while be quarrel between bouillon cardinal with spain fighting against france in netherlands must not risk land title bouillon have better have stood alone than have called in spaniard austrian know whose doing be archbishop of rheims who be guise methinks from what have seen of crafty one be sure that duke soissons must unless won over by archbishop have ever consented to such plan for be honourable gentleman soissons at least be frenchman can hardly be said of bouillon whose ancestor have be independent prince here for century however fear that will rue day championed cause of soissons be affair of be carrying hospitality too far to endanger life kingdom rather than tell two guest that must seek refuge elsewhere europe be open to a guise archbishop must have be welcome wherever spain have power with spain italy austria open to why must thus bring danger misfortune upon petty dukedom of sedan same may be said of soissons however reluctant bouillon might be to part with so dear friend soissons must have insisted upon going taking up abode elsewhere must still have brought large force into field have thus risked a much a bouillon case must be different estate be confiscated at rate have no longer power to summon vassal to field therefore risk nothing in case of defeat while bouillon be risking everything daresay that be true master though in faith know nothing about matter for seems to that when one be noble have everything that man can want must be fool to mix up in trouble know that if king of france be to give big estate anyone came to asked to take part in plot must if have power of life death have hung up over gate of castle must be short way doubt paolo might not keep out of trouble hector said smiling if person who came to be also noble family friend must rise in arm to avenge death instead of avoiding trouble must bring at once upon head suppose must be so master paolo said thoughtfully so think that must be best for that king must not take into head to give that estate so be going to geneva master yes plea not other one said for have heard of a terribly serious place where man dare not so much a smile where have to listen to sermon exhortation lasting day father be huguenot suppose be too though never inquired very closely into matter a for exhortation of four hour in length methinks must rather swim moat again master to go day without smiling must be worse penance than strictest father confessor must lay upon own be somewhat of opinion paolo father brought up protestant like when be quite young have very dreary time of while be away living a did in house of huguenot pastor after attended protestant service in barrack for officer almost men be protestant of course be allowed to have own service minister who be scotchman knew better than to make discourse too lengthy for if did there be shuffling of jackboot on stone floor clanking of sabre warned that patience of soldier be exhausted in own glen father have told that minister be a long winded a of geneva a said soldier be restless people be one thing for men who regard sunday gathering a chief event in week to listen to lengthy discourse quite for soldier in field city like paris to do so however if find geneva to taste there be reason why must tarry there a zurich lie on other end of lake zurich be catholic at rate largely so calvinist doctrine have never flourished there on other hand sympathy of geneva have generally be with france while of zurich be with austria therefore think that if like not geneva will go to lyon where a officer of viscount turenne be sure to be well received why not go there at once master because think that fresh air of lake will brace up maybe if find people too sober minded for will go up into mountain lodge there in quiet village think must suit of must suit assuredly paolo said joyfully love mountain such be indeed course eventually taken strict calvinism of geneva suited of after fortnight stay there went up among hill in clear brisk air hector found blood begin to run more rapidly through vein strength energy fast returning sometimes rode soon found more pleasure in climbing hill around on foot for mountain path be so rough that be seldom indeed that horse must break into trot chapter vii duc d'enghien from time to time news came up of what be passing in world spaniard have afforded assistance in men to duke for richelieu have sent powerful army into heart of flanders so kept fully occupied austrian force however joined that of duke battle be fought with royal army under marshal chatillon lay encamped league from sedan austrian general commanded main body duc de bouillon cavalry while count de soissons be with reserve at first chatillon army have advantage bouillon charged with such vehemence that drove cavalry of royalist down upon infantry fell into confusion most of french officer being killed made prisoner rest put to rout duke after victory rode to congratulate soissons whose force have not be engaged found count dead having accidentally shot while pushing up visor of helmet with muzzle of pistol bouillon soon learned hollowness of promise of ally spaniard sent money men while austrian received order to march away from sedan to join spaniard who be marching to relief of duke deserted by ally prepared to defend sedan till last fortunately for however position of french at arras be critical place be strong two army be marching to relief must therefore have be rash to have attempted at same time siege of sedan king have joined army advancing against bouillon while cardinal remained in paris many of round person of king foremost among whom be marquis of cinq mar master of horse spoke very strongly in favour of duke represented that have be driven to take up arm by persecution of cardinal king be moved by representation gave complete pardon to bouillon who be restored to full possession of estate in france while on part released prisoner baggage standard taken in late battle be welcome news to hector who at once prepared to cross into italy when reached chambery heard that turenne have be ordered to join army be collected near spanish frontier in order to conquer roussillon lay between languedoc catalonia latter province have be for three year in state of insurrection against spain have besought aid from france however must not easily be afforded so long a fortress of perpignan guarded way with other stronghold prevented communication between south of france catalonia a be uncertain whether turenne must follow coast route cross pass hector companion rode forward at once arrived at turin before left be glad to see back again general said a hector entered room trust that be now strong again letter giving reason for leaving sedan be forwarded to by messenger with others from brother wife speaks in high term of regretted leaving reason gave for so doing in letter to more than justified course took showed that be thoughtful in other than military matter served better by leaving sedan than must have done in other way in unhappy dispute with brother cardinal have never permitted relationship to bouillon to shake confidence in after being engaged for many year in combating plot against can not be suspicious of that officer of staff must be staying at sedan when dispute be going to end in open warfare might well have excited doubt of while have traveled direct here at moment might a said have be considered that be bearer of important communication between brother now hope that be completely restored to health be looking well have grown good deal consequence doubt of being so long in bed have heard that be ordered to roussillon of be glad for war languishes here king hear will take up headquarters at narbonne richelieu be coming down to look after matter a did at rochelle so expect that thing will move quickly there say king be not in good health that cardinal be failing must die will be grievous loss for france for there be one who must in way fill place have be evident for time that king have be in weak health dauphin be child regency with queen a nominal head richelieu a staff ruler must be possible without richelieu prospect must be very dark one can not think of without apprehension however must continue to do a have be doing ever since bouillon fell out with court must think only that be soldier prepared to strike where ordered whether against foreign foe rebellious subject happily family trouble be over hear that there be probability now bouillon have be restored to favour will obtain command of army in italy will just suit active spirit three day later turenne with staff crossed alp journeying across south of france reached perpignan marquis of mielleraye be in supreme command turenne be to act a lieutenant latter at once took charge of operation of siege of perpignan have already be beleaguered for month by french fortress be very strong one a effort of spanish to reinforce garrison by landing effected on coast failed altogether a operation of mielleraye in field be successful there be chance of relief being afforded to besieged town by spanish army advancing through catalonia be certain that fortress must in time surrender by hunger a must not be captured by assault unless with very heavy loss indeed turenne contented with keeping up so vigilant watch round that communication be altogether cut off garrison knew nothing whatever of what be passing around duc de bouillon have received command of army in italy turenne hoped that henceforth mind must be free from family trouble have for past four year caused great pain anxiety unfortunately however cinq mar king master of horse personal favourite have become embroiled with cardinal rash impetuous haughty young favourite at once began to intrigue duke of orleans king only brother one of most treacherous unstable of men joined heart soul bouillon be induced to ally with not from political feeling because cinq mar have be mainly instrumental in obtaining term for before appealed to sense of gratitude to aid now insisted however that time there must be negotiating with spain austria that movement must be entirely french one unknown to however others entered into alliance with spain who engaged to find money army conspirator have gained ear of king cinq mar representing to that hostility be directed solely against cardinal latter be in great disfavour until obtained copy of treaty with disclosure opened king eye duke of orleans cinq mar monsieur de thou intimate friend de bouillon be at once arrested orleans immediately turned traitor to fellow conspirator revealed incident of plot be sentenced to exile cinq mar de thou be tried executed de bouillon saved life by relinquishing principality to france hesitation there may have be in sparing on term being removed by receipt of message from duchess that if husband be put to death must at once deliver sedan into hand of spaniard de bouillon be therefore pardoned in exchange for surrender of principality estate in france be to be enlarged considerable pension granted to be terrible trial to turenne who be deeply attached to brother who mourned not only danger have incurred that must have broken engagement while commanding royal army must have plotted against royal authority at end of november cardinal illness from have long suffered took unfavourable turn king who have returned to paris went to see richelieu advised to place confidence in two secretary of state chavigny de noyers recommended cardinal mazarin strongly a first minister of crown handed king document have prepared barring duke of orleans from share in regency in case of king death preamble calling to mind that king have five time pardoned brother who have yet recently engaged in fresh plot against on nd of december richelieu died king on following day carried out last advice appointed mazarin to place in council year have passed quietly with hector campbell duty have be slight during siege a during stay at sedan in switzerland have continued to work hard at italian at former place under teacher who instructed in more courtly dialect than acquired from paolo so during six month before perpignan have after taking advice of turenne set to acquire knowledge of german working at for eight hour day under tuition of german gentleman who have be compelled to leave country when native town be captured by imperialist be soon able to converse a fluently in a in italian be in germany that next great campaign be likely to take place turenne said to knowledge of german will be of infinite utility to fortunately for sedan standing on border between two country acquired german a well a french without labour while in holland spoke rather than french knowledge of language be of great importance to one who must rise high in army at court be very glad that have acquired german a may be of great use to if be called upon to invade country again be if new council of king be a kindly disposed towards a richelieu always showed to be fear that ere long there may be change king health be very poor may not live long then have regency before regency of france have always be time of grievous trouble even have richelieu lived might not have be able to avert such disaster queen have never be friend must not have have support from that have have from king who although doubt fretted at time under richelieu dictation yet recognized splendid genius knew that worked heart soul for good of france however death be sore misfortune regency need strong head where be to come from duke of orleans be schemer without principle weak easily led ambitious unscrupulous prince of conde be equally ambitious even more grasping much more talented there be one else save men like chavigny father of friend here de noyers others of good family honest capable business men who must speedily become mere cipher cardinal mazarin who have just be appointed to council do know sir hector asked have seen more than once be said to be very clever be secret that be nominated to council on richelieu recommendation speaks volume in favour for richelieu be judge of men must have believed when recommending that mazarin must render good service to france however clever be can not replace great cardinal on be stamped by nature making of ruler of men be tall handsome accomplished cavalier seeing dressed a noble among nobleman one must have picked out a born to be greatest of doubt noble appearance aided by haughty manner by ruthlessness in punishing who conspired against have not little to do with mastery over men mazarin be man of very different appearance be dark in complexion handsome in way supple must say crafty italian rather than frenchman man will meet with difficulty far greater than assailed richelieu latter personally fearless went straight to end crushing enemy if stood in way possessed of indomitable will unflinching determination mazarin if mistake not will try to gain end by other mean by intrigue by setting who oppose against other by yielding rather than by striking be said to stand high in queen favour will be great aid to for who might rebel against authority of cardinal will hesitate to do so when have at back protection authority of queen however must hope for best be probable that richelieu acquainted with plan project urged to carry into effect sincerely trust that will do so in case if come to head of affair must assuredly serve a willingly faithfully a served richelieu knowing that will be for good of france be indeed short time after loss of great adviser that king followed to tomb have for long suffered from bad health now that statesman who have borne whole burden of public affair have left felt weight overpowering have always be devoted to religious exercise saw end approaching without regret died calmly peacefully on may by will left queen regent have never be on good term with now endeavoured to prevent from having real power duke of orleans be appointed lieutenant general a king

prohibited change being made in council proviso be not observed queen speedily made term with minister when little king be conducted in great state to parliament of paris duke of orleans addressed queen saying that desired to take other part in affair than might please to give prince of conde said same that evening to astonishment queen having become by resignation sole head of administration announced that must retain cardinal mazarin a minister shortly afterwards nominated turenne to command of army in italy prince thomas have now broken altogether with spaniard finding that protection be not available for king of spain have be obliged to recall considerable proportion of troop from italy to suppress insurrection in catalonia hector did not accompany turenne to italy for early in april turenne have said to there seems chance of employment here at present campbell while there be likely to be heavy fighting on rhine frontier death of richelieu have given fresh courage to enemy of france hear that de malo governor of low country have gathered large army be about to invade france army there be commanded by young duc d'enghien prince of conde son be twenty two of course owes appointment to father influence king have however sent with marshal de l'hopital who will be lieutenant director know enghien well esteem talent highly be brave impetuous fiery at same time if mistake not cautious prudent will give letter to will tell that have greatly distinguished while on staff being anxious above thing to acquire military knowledge to serve with honour have sent to begging to give same post on staff a have have on mine asking a personal favour to myself have doubt will grant have affected company good deal when have be in paris have evinced greatest desire to learn a much a can of military matter from be grateful indeed for kindness sir of will most gladly avail will indeed be pleased at opportunity of seeing great battle wish to show approbation of manner in have since left in italy endeavoured to do in power to acquire useful knowledge instead of wasting time in idleness gambling to so many young officer in army give up next day hector paolo joined army of enghien a be on march to eperney former be now within few month of seventeen of middle height strongly built hard exercise training having broadened greatly have pleasant good tempered face hair be brown with tinge of gold clustered closely round head for have not adopted french mode of wearing in long ringlet fashion unsuited for work of campaign de lisle chavigny have in vain urged to adopt be handsomely dressed for knew that conde must be surrounded by many of young noble of france wore broad hat with feather helmet armour being carried together with valise on sumpter mule led by paolo putting up at hotel made way to house occupied by enghien marshal be crowded by young officer many of whom be waiting in anteroom on one of duke chamberlain approaching hector gave name requested to deliver viscount turenne letter to prince in few minute name be called to surprise of who have be waiting for time for interview enghien be seated at table from rose a hector entered be glad to see captain campbell for own sake for of turenne whom greatly love admire a be with mielleraye during campaign in south while be with turenne did not meet there for though once rode over stayed for few day did not accompany have told of adventure at turin have spoken of diligent study desire to learn be known of art of war will be glad indeed to have riding with for too be diligent student in art though until last year have opportunity whatever of gaining practical knowledge envy turenne good fortune in having be sent to begin to learn duty when be fourteen tell that be year older when rode to italy with humiliates to think that while be sent to command army simply because father be prince of blood turenne gained step by merit be general in spite of fact that brother be enemy of cardinal defied alike power that of king however hope to show be not altogether unworthy of position at least like turenne can lead troop into battle fight in front even if can not always come out victorious where have put up horse with best will in world can not put room stable at disposal today for believe that cupboard in house be occupied at halting place tomorrow will be under canvas tent will be assigned to thank sir have fortunately be able to find quarter at inn at rate hope that will sup with will then introduce to of friend enghien be at age of twenty two of striking rather than handsome figure forehead be wide eye sunken piercing nose very prominent hooked giving to face something of expression of eagle resembled turenne in eagerness with in childhood have devoted to study especially to military exercise except possessed remarkable genius for war be extremely courageous there be slight resemblance between character while turenne be prudent patient thoughtful weighing duly step taken bestowing greatest pain upon comfort well being of troop careful a to detail must bring about success in operation conde be passionate impetuous acting upon impulse rather than reflection personally ambitious impatient of opposition bitter in enmity action policy be influenced chiefly by own ambition own susceptibility rather than by thought of what effect action might have on destiny of france be born general yet poor leader of men one of greatest military genius that world have ever seen yet so full of fault foible weakness except from military point of view term great conde posterity have given be little merited have much brain little heart forced by father into marriage with niece of richelieu treated badly cruelly although be devoted to be in respect estimable woman true wife that in court where virtue be rare indeed at supper that evening enghien introduced hector first to marshal de l'hopital then to young noble of company monsieur campbell said be youngest of party yet be a viscount of turenne writes to one in whom have greatest confidence who have so carefully studied art of war so much profited by opportunity that must not hesitate to commit to command requiring at once courage discretion military knowledge one gentleman must wish for higher eulogium from greater authority turenne have lent to for campaign indeed feel grateful to for so doing when say gentleman that be who saved citadel of turin to arm by undertaking carrying out perilous work of passing through city spanish line to carry word to half starved garrison that succour must arrive in fortnight time so prevented surrendering will admit turenne have not spoken too highly of courage ability have heard full detail of affair from turenne own lip when paid short visit to paris after campaign closed must feel proud indeed have accomplished enterprise captain campbell be member of old scottish family father died fighting for france at siege of la rochelle captain in scottish regiment now gentleman to supper be joyous meal of character quite new to hector grave be entertainment be marked by certain earnestness seriousness set indeed guest at ease by courtesy interest took in yet felt that in presence loud laughter must be out of place loose jesting impossible enghien on other hand being wild reckless young noble one who chose not word be wont to give vent in term of unbridled hatred to contempt for whom deemed enemy imposed such restraint upon guest talked laughed jested a chose checked only by presence of gallant old marshal who be nominally enghien guide adviser next to hector be seated general gassion one of finest soldier of time like hector have family influence have gained position solely by own merit be enterprising energetic eager to still further distinguish hector be not long in perceiving that enghien have cordial support in combating prudent cautious counsel of marshal spoke very cordially to young captain saw in one who like be likely to make way by merit force of character asked many question a to past history various service in have be engaged hope day to win marshal baton methinks that if have a good fortune a have have escape being cut off by bullet sabre too may look forward to gaining such distinction see young men around have joined rather in spirit of knight errants than of soldier hope to distinguish not for sake of advancing military career simply that may stand well in eye of court beauty campaign once over will return to paris think more of military service until campaign led by prince of blood like enghien take place when will again take up arm fight in company such campaign a under turenne in italy must be distasteful in extreme to must doubtless bear hardship a unflinchingly a professional soldier a soon a must with honour retire may be sure must do so be well for that must be otherwise chance of advancement must be rare indeed while a be there be plenty of opening for men of determination perseverance who will carry out precisely order given to who be always whether in field in winter quarter under eye of commander like turenne who remains with army instead of rushing off like d'harcourt to spend winter in gaiety of court to receive smile praise a reward for success suppose general there be doubt that will give battle to spaniard doubt whatever depends upon enghien though doubt marshal will throw obstacle in way in first place there can be denying that spanish infantry be superb fuentes who command be fine old soldier while infantry be largely composed of new levy thus though army be not unequal in strength l'hopital may well consider chance of victory to be against in second place in battle enghien will be in command though of recognize that posse extraordinary ability impetuosity might well lead to disaster then marshal must feel that while glory of victory must fall to enghien discredit of defeat must be given to while if aught happened to enghien wrath of conde faction must bring about disgrace doubt not that have received instruction not to hazard battle except under extraordinary circumstance while enghien must if possible bring one about under circumstance lastly king be desperately ill ill unto death say none can foretell what must take place be to suffer heavy defeat while france be without great head to rally nation again show face to spaniard at same time may tell at once in matter be heart soul with enghien consider did shrink from battle now must so encourage spain austria that must put force in field a must scarcely hope to oppose while victory must alter whole position show enemy that french soldier be equal to of spain at present one belief lastly if win enghien when father dy will be foremost man in france leading spirit of prince of blood having behind vast possession wealth accumulated by conde will be power even greatest minister might dread need hardly say that marshal baton must be very appreciably nearer than be at present then may take hector said with smile that chance be in favour of pitched battle be certainly so l'hopital instruction be to force spaniard who have advanced against rocroi to raise siege to do so if possible by manoeuvering to avoid anything like pitched battle fancy that be likely to find circumstance too strong for that one of morning will stand face to face with enemy spaniard be doubtless grand soldier army will meet be largely composed of veteran troop must remember that for year year dutchman by nature peaceable for most part without training in arm although terribly deficient in cavalry have boldly withstood power of spain seldom have met in open field hector said doubtfully not very often grant though when allied with countryman fairly beat on sand near ostend that over over again fought in breach on even term burgher though be beat back alva choicest troop next morning army marched forward hector rode with group of young noble who followed enghien rocroi be town of considerable strength lying in forest of ardennes be key to province of champagne capture must open road to spaniard siege be being pressed forward by de malo who have with army of twenty seven thousand veteran troop being five thousand more than force under enghien gassion who a enghien lieutenant have control of movement so arranged march while steadily approaching rocroi marshal believed that intended to force spaniard to fall back rather by menacing line of communication than by advancing directly against after first day gassion invited hector to ride with invitation gladly accepted for conversation of younger companion turned chiefly upon court intrigue love affair in paris on people of whose very name be wholly ignorant riding with gassion across from one road to along army be advancing be able to see much of movement of body of troop through country wholly different from that with be familiar saw how careful general be to maintain communication between head of different column especially a approached enemy de malo ought said to have utilized country a for checking advance in wood might have so placed men a to annihilate one column before must come to assistance can only suppose that relies so absolutely upon number valour discipline of soldier that prefers to fight pitched battle where complete success must open road to paris thus lay france at foot bring war to conclusion at one stroke chapter viii rocroi gassion conducted movement of army so adroitly that have brought to within almost striking distance of spanish division before marshal l'hopital perceived fact that be so placed that battle be almost inevitable besought enghien to fall back while there be yet time pointing out order have be given that battle be not to be hazarded terrible misfortune must fall upon france in case of defeat enghien however be deaf to advice refused to acknowledge authority turenne under similar circumstance must have drawn off forced enemy to raise siege by threatening line of communication turenne thought nothing of personal glory fought only for france enghien on other hand throughout career be animated by personal motif cared nothing for general welfare of france turenne be wholly unselfish enghien be ready to sacrifice anything everything for own glory interest at present surrounded a be by young noble a eager to fight a be backed by gassion one of most able enterprising soldier of day declared that have come to fight must do so even have l'hopital known news have be received by enghien must have be powerless to check control courier have indeed day before brought young duke despatch containing news of king death peremptory order not to fight enghien simply put letter in pocket content be known only to gassion few of most intimate friend de malo be a anxious to bring on general engagement a be fiery opponent be kept well informed of what be going on in paris knew that king death be imminent position on plain surrounded on side by wood marsh with one approach that through narrow defile be practically impregnable by occupying defile must have kept french at bay without slightest difficulty until rocroi surrendered knew too that general beck with considerable force be hastening to join feared that prudent counsel might at last moment prevail in french camp that news of king death might reach therefore left defile open allowed french army to gain plain form up in order of battle facing without offering slightest opposition firing single gun be late in afternoon by time french be in position a commander be anxious that battle must be decisive one took step to bring on fight contented with preparing for encounter next morning night be cold somewhat thick position of two army be marked by line of fire march have be long fatiguing one silence soon fell upon scene enghien wrapped in cloak lying down by watch fire be speedily asleep wholly unoppressed by tremendous responsibility that have assumed fact that have risked destiny of france for sake of personal ambition that in case slaughter must ensue in morning must be terrible gassion however with few of older officer sat for hour discussing probability of battle hector remembering manner in turenne exercised most ceaseless vigilance nightly inspected outpost endeavouring to ascertain plan position of enemy have a night closed in requested gassion permission to go round certainly if so plea captain campbell watchword tonight be 'conde ' will in addition give pas enjoining officer to allow to go where please being on staff of prince will go round later on for de malo may intend night attack by must certainly gain advantage troop be fresh while ours be weary have have opportunity of studying ground while be new to still hardly think that will move till morning enterprise be not strong point of spaniard love to fight in solid body hitherto infantry have never be broken by cavalry at night must lose advantage of steadiness of formation be clear by willingness to allow to pas defile take up position that de malo be absolutely certain of victory will wait for daylight must permit to make expected victory complete one while at night great number of army must be able to make escape through wood hector returned to spot where horse be picketed with of enghien staff found paolo lying down under tree where have be ordered to take up post so hector must find if required be asleep paolo master have be thinking about battle tomorrow where have best bestow a to that paolo must say that have better keep with prince servant here will of course have horse saddled be ready to ride on instant if be victorious there will be occasion for to move if see that be beaten order be that be not to think of waiting for must keep with others doubtless cavalry must cover retreat must be serious inconvenience for to have to come here to look after therefore a soon a see that day have gone against mount ride can wait at halting place of last night until see prince party come along if be alive will be with if not advice to be to ride south to report to turenne will doubt not either take into own service give such strong recommendation that will have difficulty in obtaining post with officer of distinction must wish to continue with army now be going along line of outpost intend to reconnoitre ground between enemy be what turenne must be doing be in command here will go with master when come to reconnoitering methinks be a good a can run like hare though bullet must go faster be quite sure that none of heavily armed spaniard must have chance of catching intended to take with paolo will need a much care caution here a did in getting into citadel of turin think master that must be well for to leave armour behind will be of small avail if fall into midst of band of spanish spearmen while must be sore hindrance in passing through wood lighter be accoutred better be so will take advice will give into charge of horse guard will of course take sword pistol may a well take yours like knife better than sword master will take think must be a well for to lay aside helmet also for light from one of watchfires might glint upon catch eye of spaniard be right paolo have got hat yes sir be here with valise be certainly more comfortable hector said a put on now have better carry thing across to fire where prince staff be sitting there be fear of anyone interfering with there a soon a have be done started picking way carefully through number of sleeping men stopping once twice to exchange word with group still gathered round fire first passed along whole line of outpost answering challenge by word officer of prince staff on duty found sentry fairly vigilant for with so powerful enemy within striking distance soldier felt that occasion be one for unusual watchfulness at post hector questioned sentinel closely a to whether have heard sound indicating movement of troop in interval between two army in only one case be there affirmative answer heard sound such a might be made by clash of armour against tree by armed man falling have listened attentively since have heard nothing more from direction did noise seem to come from across there sir seemed to to come from copse in hollow be just what thought might be likely paolo hector said a walked on hollow ground between army with wood low brushwood be just place where ambush might be posted with advantage turenne must have taken possession of a soon a darkness closed in for must not only prevent possibility of army being taken by surprise during night might be invaluable during fight tomorrow for force ambushed there might take advancing enemy in rear will go farther on till get to point where brushwood extends nearly up to line will enter there make way along until see whether de malo have taken advantage of failure to utilize wood a soon a reached point indicated moved forward crouching low until reached bush then crawled along keeping outside close to in way must be invisible to sentry posted near edge of wood must also avoid risk of drawing enemy attention by accidentally breaking dried branch even snapping twig in ten minute entered wood extended along greater portion of hollow keep on hand knee hector whispered feel ground a go to make sure that there be broken branch must crack if placed knee upon may come upon spaniard at moment keep close to touch if hear slightest sound will do same to touch will mean stop move sword along belt till handle be round at back in way there will be risk of striking tree catching in projecting root will do master will keep knife between teeth may be that will come upon spanish sentinel who may need silencing paolo only in last extremity to save life must resort to arm be sentry found killed in morning must know that position in wood have be discovered be most important that must believe that ambush be unsuspected progress be very slow when be nearly opposite centre of position paolo be suddenly touched by master listened intently must hear at great distance ahead low sound at regular interval men snoring paolo whispered in ear moved forward again even more cautiously than before presently stopped for at edge of wood facing camp heard slight movement low clash of arm a if sentinel on lookout have changed position feeling sure that guard must all be placed along edge of wood moved forward again stopping few yard to listen there be doubt now that be close to large body of sleeper occasional snore broken murmur sound a one turned from side to side rose from in front of go round on one side will go round on other paolo will meet again when have passed beyond be important that must form estimate a to number in hour met again crawled along for distance side by side in silence how many must say paolo be lying four deep a far a must make out master kept very close to outside line must not count accurately because of tree must say that there be about two hundred fifty in line be very close to what reckoned at at rate be regiment about thousand strong be musketeer for several time went close enough to feel arm in case be musket not pike that hand fell on now will go on till be opposite last watchfire then crawl up hill be challenged a approached line friend hector replied officer of prince staff give countersign soldier said conde be right wait until officer good make noise be important sentinel went to watchfire officer sitting there at once rose came forward advance officer of staff said in low tone be right monsieur went on a hector advanced close enough to be seen by light of fire have special pas signed by general gassion said officer took looked at by light of fire be in order said a returned sentry have strictest order one coming from side of enemy be to be allowed to enter line even if gave countersign correctly until have be examined by officer did duty sir one can not be too careful on eve of battle straggler might stray away be captured be forced under pain of death to give up countersign once in line much information might be obtained a to position however hardly think that such attempt will be made spaniard saw march in take up position must have marked where cavalry artillery be posted good night greater part of night have already gone for in may day be already lengthening out after troop have fallen out from rank wood have to be collected ration cooked be past ten o'clock before of lay down hour later before hector left on expedition examination of outpost have taken more than hour be now three o'clock in morning order be that troop must be under arm before daybreak hector returned to spot where have left general gassion be quiet there now lay down until somewhat before five bugle sounded signal be repeated all along line almost at same moment spanish trumpet told that enemy too be making preparation for day work general gassion be one of first to spring to foot hector at once went up to have come to report general said that have reconnoitred along whole line of wood in hollow in front have found that regiment of musketeer about thousand strong have be placed in ambush there then by heaven have done good service indeed captain campbell might have done ill turn have advanced knowing nothing of presence there nothing shake troop more than sudden attack in rear please come across with repeat news that have given to prince there be bustle all along line troop be falling into rank stamping foot to set blood in motion swinging arm growling at sharp morning air at headquarters bivouac young noble be laughing jesting a prepared to mount where be prince gassion asked there lie under cloak general be still fast asleep be evident that thought of coming battle doe not weigh heavily upon acknowledge have not closed eye think that of have done so so sound indeed be prince sleep that gassion have to shake almost roughly to rouse a soon however a eye opened leapt to foot have have wonderful night laughed never have slept more soundly on down bed than on hard ground however a find make bone ache wonderfully well be fine day for battle what be news gassion be important monseigneur captain campbell have spent night in reconnoitering on own account have discovered that thousand spanish musketeer be lying in ambush in copse in hollow be that so duke said shortly well captain campbell have rendered vital service indeed one will not forget however now be forewarned will know how to deal with if must fall gassion must survive see captain campbell service be duly represented now to horse gentleman morning sun rose on th of may on brilliant scene two army be disposed along slightly elevated ridge between lay hollow with brushwood copse enghien commanded cavalry on right wing with gassion a second in command in place of helmet prince wore hat with large white plume remembering perhaps how henri of navarre white plume have served a rallying point marshal l'hopital commanded cavalry on french left baron d'espenan commanded infantry in centre baron sirot reserve right of spanish army be composed of german horse led by de malo walloon on left be under duke of albuquerque while in centre be veteran spanish infantry under command of general fuentes who have often led to victory be too old infirm to mount horse lay in litter in midst of hitherto unconquerable infantry being ready on side trumpet sounded simultaneously cavalry of army moved forward enghien moved farther to right then dashing down slope led cavalry along bottom fell suddenly upon musketeer in ambush cut to piece then galloping forward fell upon spanish left in front flank impetuous charge be irresistible walloon broke fled before be speedily scattered over plain pursued by victorious french upon other wing de malo charge have proved equally irresistible l'hopital horse be broken scattered wheeling cavalry round de malo fell upon flank rear of d'espenan infantry shattered at once captured whole of french artillery then fell upon reserve baron officer of great courage ability held together for time repelled attack of german cavalry inspirited by previous success continued attack with such fury that reserve began to waver fall back enghien be still in pursuit of walloon when officer rode up with news of disaster have befallen rest of army enghien grasped situation instantly military genius pointed out how battle might yet be retrieved trumpet instantly recalled scattered squadron galloping round spanish centre fell like thunderbolt upon rear of de malo cavalry already exulting in what appeared certain victory astounded at unlooked for attack in vain bore up tried to resist weight impetus of french assault bore before clove way through confused mass of cavalry without pause then wheeling right left charged into disorganized crowd of german horseman who unable to withstand terrible onslaught broke fled de malo galloping off field with disorganized trooper never be more sudden change in fate of great battle french cause have appeared absolutely lost one wing centre be routed reserve have suffered heavily be on point of giving way humanly speaking battle seemed hopelessly lost yet in ten minute victory have be converted into defeat right left wing of spanish army have ceased to exist a collected body there remained spanish infantry enghien recklessly courageous a be hesitated to attack solid formation have hitherto proved invincible while still doubting whether having defeated rest of army might not be best to allow formidable body to march away unmolested news reached that general beck with reinforcement must be on ground in hour decided ordered whole of gun have be rescued from late captor to be turned on spanish square then collecting cavalry into mass dashed at spaniard remained motionless till french line be within twenty yard of then men stepped aside number of gun poured content into cavalry while tremendous volley swept away front line so terrible be effect so great confusion caused by carnage have walloon cavalry be rallied returned to field tide of battle might again have be changed be mile away enghien rallied men without moment delay while french artillery again opened fire upon spanish square again french cavalry charged strove to make way into gap made by artillery before reached face of square be closed up gun musketry carried havoc among french squadron again recoiled in confusion once more enghien rallied when french artillery have done work led forward again with bravery a impetuous unshaken a with have ridden in front of in first charge nevertheless for third time fell back shattered by storm of iron lead enghien now brought up artillery to close quarter baron de sirot led up infantry of reserve attack be renewed aged spanish general though streaming with blood from several wound still from litter encouraged soldier who stern unmoved filled up gap have be made undauntedly faced foe struggle must not be long continued square be gradually wasting away occupied ground have stood upon when battle began fuentes seeing that further resistance must only lead to annihilation of little band felt that more must be done there be sign of beck coming to assistance indeed troop of general have be met by cavalry in flight communicated own panic to such be alarm that division abandoned baggage gun fled from field where arrival might still have turned tide of battle fuentes at last ordered officer to signal surrender enghien rode forward spanish soldier believing that a before be leading cavalry against poured in terrible volley escaped by almost miracle soldier maddened by what believed to be act of treachery hurled upon enemy square be broken terrible slaughter ensued before exertion of officer put stop to then remaining spaniard surrendered battle of rocroi be to land force of spain blow a terrible fatal a destruction of armada have be to naval supremacy be indeed death blow to power that spain have so long exercised over europe showed world that infantry be no longer irresistible while lowered prestige infinitely increased that of france be now regarded a first military power in europe loss in battle be extremely heavy german walloon cavalry suffered very severely while of spanish infantry not one man left battlefield save a prisoner fully two third of number lay dead on ground upon french side loss be numerically much smaller german cavalry after routing of l'hopital instead of following up pursuit hurled upon infantry who broke almost without resistance also escaped with comparatively little loss de malo leading cavalry at once against french reserve among cavalry commanded by enghien loss be very heavy included many gentleman of best blood of france there be pursuit french cavalry be far away from field rest have lost well nigh number be exhausted by fury of fight indeed fugitive cavalry be mile away before conflict ended gallant old general fuentes expired from wound soon after termination of battle hector be with body of young noble who followed close behind enghien in three first desperate charge in third horse be shot under just a cavalry recoiled from deadly fire of square partly extracted foot from stirrup a fell not sufficiently to free be pinned to ground by weight of horse be well for that be so for have be free must assuredly have be shot down a followed retreating cavalry thought occurred to mind after first involuntary effort to extricate leg lay there stiff immovable a if dead be trying time ball from french cannon whistled over head musket shot flew thickly round knew that ere long attack must be renewed fortunately fourth advance of french did not come directly over commander purposely leading troop so a to avoid passing over ground where so many of young noble have fallen not until last musket have be discharged cessation of din told that be over did endeavour to rise then sat up called to two dismounted soldier who be passing near to aid at once came up soon lifted horse so far that be able to withdraw leg thick jackboot have protected from injury although have be partly cause of misfortune for sole have caught against side of horse so prevented from withdrawing nevertheless leg be so numbed that be time before must limp away retraced step towards spot where have mounted at starting have not gone far when saw paolo galloping towards young fellow gave shout of joy a recognized minute later drew rein by side leapt off horse thank god see alive again master be wounded horse be killed fell upon foot have doubt bruised bit otherwise be unhurt have be terrible master climbed up into tree beneath halted yesterday watched battle shouted with joy when saw enghien clear out ambuscade again when drove walloon horse away then everything seemed to go wrong saw marshal cavalry on left driven off field like chaff before wind then centre broke up directly be charged a enemy fell upon reserve seemed to that be lost then saw enghien horseman coming along like whirlwind bursting way through enemy horse in turn driving off field hoped then that battle be over that spanish infantry must be allowed to march away heart fell again when time after time cavalry dashed up against time fell back again leaving slope behind covered with dead men horse shouted aloud when saw artillery move up reserve advancing a soon a saw that square be broken terrible melee be going on knew that be over must restrain impatience no longer so mounted horse with may say small hope of finding alive seeing that rode behind enghien whose white plume must see ever in front of line have be marvellous victory paolo there can be doubt that enghien have covered with glory be quick eye saw what there be to be done brain instantly directed blow where alone must be effectual extraordinary bravery roused enthusiasm of around to point at man thought of life for be lost battle well master be glad that have won battle be a nothing to in comparison that have come out of safely think master that have right to say that helped in degree to bring about victory by discovering that ambuscade down in hollow have not occurred to paolo hector laughed doubt be fortunate discovery for have musketeer lain hidden there until be beaten back after first charge then poured fire into must doubtless have thrown into confusion might even have caused panic for while now master if will mount horse will be off catch there be score of running about riderless of belonging to marshal men many more to german few galloped off riderless time enghien fell back take one of paolo might be claimed by master lackey get one of best german horse that can find might a well get two if can for want second horse while be here with prince chapter ix honour in hour paolo returned leading two horse by trapping appearance have evidently belonged to officer take off trapping hector said then put saddle on one for shift own saddle on to other picket own with spare horse of staff then will ride over get saddle bridle holster trapping horse have carried well ever since left paris be grieved indeed to lose so be master be good beast think that of be a good though will be long before get to like a did scotty will want housing for second horse master yes there will be difficulty about there be score of dead horse on field choose one without embroidery insignia may a well take pair of holster with pistol riding across to spot where enghien officer be forming up prisoner talking courteously to spanish officer seeing to wounded hector leaving paolo to find fallen horse shift trapping to one rode cantered up to spot where enghien white plume must be seen in midst of group of officer among whom be general gassion saluted a came up be glad indeed to see captain campbell enghien said warmly holding out hand feared that be killed of friend told that be struck down in third charge that have not seen since feared that be slain horse be killed prince in falling pinned to ground being within thirty yard of spanish square lay without movement until came back again broke then soldier so far lifted horse must get foot from under servant found caught riderless german horse here be unharmed well sir at time that came up general gassion be just telling gentleman have not be for thing might have gone very differently have not discovered that ambush fire must have be fatal to for fell back a know farther than copse volley from thousand musket must have played havoc among after so terrible repulse might well have decided day against for great service rendered by voluntarily without order a commander in chief of army with full warm approval of general gassion appoint to rank of colonel rank be sure will be confirmed by queen minister when report to reason for promotion general gassion report that man who accompanied on reconnaissance be same who followed in expedition to turin a be not soldier can not promote will order chamberlain to hand purse of hundred pistoles when return to turenne tell owe best thanks for having sent to that thanks to aid of teaching have be mean of preventing great disaster to force thank indeed monsieur for kindness for promoting so far beyond merit hope in future will be able to still further prove gratitude be proved already gassion said for although man today have fought like hero be only one in camp suspected that spanish might be lying in ambush who not only thought took mean to find out whether be so next morning enghien informed hector that be elected a one of three officer who be to have honour of carrying despatch to paris that be to start in hour paolo who be in highest state of delight at purse have be presented to evening before be greatly pleased with prospect heaven be praised master that be not going into battle be well nigh miracle that escaped last time such good luck doe not befall man twice have never seen paris greatly do long to do so how will shout when hear news bring will not be altogether news to paolo la moussaie enghien intimate friend who acted a aide de camp during battle be sent off ten minute after fight ended with paper on prince have pencilled that have utterly defeated enemy will change horse at post will be in paris by evening bear official despatch giving full account of battle of total destruction of spanish infantry with doubt list of noble gentleman who have fallen well must think now paolo that when have seen enough of paris have journeyed down to perpignan again will leave service buy farm can afford substantial one now what master leave service where gold come in in shower where one serf master whom one love sir be not such fool a say that when war be over may not settle down in snug home among mountain of savoy not until then besides be eighteen nice hand must make at managing farm well get horse ready at once valise packed can put on spare horse mule will scarce keep up with for will certainly travel fast so have best hand over to someone who think will treat kindly twenty minute later hector two officer who have

despatch at time may take that ourselves will need bath change of garment service of barber before must show in court have be bearer of original despatch might have gone in splashed from head to foot a be seems to that if present with paper at seven in morning will have done be necessary what do say agree with de penthiere must be sore pity to injure good horse by galloping at top of speed to say nothing of knocking up have be sent off from field of battle must have said spare horse ourselves indeed seems to that tomorrow morning will be quite early enough for to present ourselves despatch to tell truth have never ridden hundred thirty mile so at pace of courier must say let go at reasonable pace get into paris soon after midnight will give time for little sleep afterwards to make ourselves presentable what say colonel campbell have opinion monsieur know nothing of manner of court if think that tomorrow morning will be quite soon enough for to deliver despatch be quite willing to fall in with view be certainly long ride a marched found that road be very bad certainly where army have passed be so cut up by artillery wagon that be sure to be quite unfit for going at racing speed therefore think that if present at palace early in morning will have done can be expected of be indeed two o'clock in morning when arrived at gate of paris accustomed though be to horse exercise journey have be very fatiguing one until night fell have ridden briskly talking a went on probable state of affair in france of military operation be likely to be undertaken a result of victory progress became slow after darkness set in road be in many place detestably bad in passing through forest be not possible to travel much beyond walk a be necessary not only to avoid overhanging arm of tree to keep track for road in many place be nothing more once twice lost altogether be only when hit upon house of peasant little village obtained guide that be able to recover road consequently be thoroughly exhausted when reached paris gate be opened to when be understood that bore despatch from army made way to hotel conde be illuminated for prince have given great banquet in honour of victory won by son although most of guest have left long before party of closest friend connection of prince be holding informal council when word came to that three officer have arrived with despatch from duc d'enghien prince came down hector have dismounted without assistance other two officer have to be lifted from saddle be bearer of special news de penthiere prince asked for two young noble be well known to monseigneur save that despatch give full detail of battle what be loss be very heavy de penthiere said fully hundred men of good blood have fallen loss principally fell upon cavalry commanded by duke who three time charged spanish infantry only succeeded at fourth attempt in breaking square spanish infantry man be either killed taken glorious prince said well will not detain now for see that can scarce stand must be cruel to keep up much a desire to hear particular think monseigneur that gentleman colonel campbell be more in condition to talk to than de caussac will be happy to answer question hector said bowing to prince have be campaigning for last four year under monsieur de turenne be accustomed to long journey sleepless night thank colonel will not keep up long lackey be ordered to assist two young noble to couch then conde companion left courtyard entered small saloon where have supped two hour before fresh bottle of wine cold viand be at once placed upon table hector drank off goblet of wine now monsieur le prince will tell know about fight gave conde companion brief sketch of various movement change of battle be hard fought field indeed conde said result be glorious one for france now will keep no longer from couch may ask sir at what time ought to present with despatch at palace will not be necessary for to present yourselves before ten o'clock for be late last night before majesty retired paris be wild at news of victory reception at palace be crowded still must say that at ten must be well that companion must attend there though may have to wait for hour more for audience at ten o'clock hector companion presented at palace seven hour sleep warm bath service of barber who curled hair of two young noble sprinkled with perfume did much to restore though be somewhat stiff bone seemed to ache be kept waiting for hour at end of time door of antechamber be opened name be called queen who be still beautiful woman be standing talking to gentleman in whose attire there be few symbol must betray to stranger that be ecclesiastic of high rank be bearer of despatch from army monsieur have honour majesty de penthiere who be senior of party said arrived from paris at two o'clock morning did not venture to disturb majesty at hour did rightly queen said graciously already knew that great victory have be gained must afford to wait for particular do bear despatch do majesty de penthiere said producing that bore majesty be general report of duc d'enghien of event of battle colonel campbell be intrusted with more detailed description of general gassion monsieur de caussac despatch contains duke view a to carrying on of campaign submits to judgment of majesty council cardinal mazarin stepped forward took three document will peruse consider at leisure queen said will hope see at levee evening in meantime thank for service in having brought despatch so speedily here be well aware that fact that have be chosen a messenger of commander in chief be in proof that share in battle be in highest degree honourable graciously held out hand de penthiere companion dropping upon one knee raised to lip one after other be aware of content of despatch cardinal queen said when be alone of general scope madam prince of conde did honour to call upon at eight morning have gathered general account of battle from lip of young scottish colonel who be only one of party who be capable of relating others being almost speechless with fatigue for road from rocroi hither be long rough may well say young scottish colonel cardinal be youth be strange indeed that must already have attained that rank have served for four year under viscount turenne mazarin said must therefore have have good opportunity of distinguishing still be seldom indeed that save one of royal blood of very highest family obtains rank so quickly turenne however be colonel after le than four year service yes cardinal have advantage of belonging to family of almost independent sovereign conde said that have asked young man how be that have won replied that be solely due to kindness of duc d'enghien who have be pleased to consider small service have rendered a worthy of recognition be like enough majesty that will see name mentioned in one of document be certain that must not have be chosen to carry despatch duty be regarded a reward of most distinguished service unless have done something of marked importance two french officer on leaving palace at once went off to pay respect in first place to head of family afterwards to visit various circle coterie with be connected where must be sure of flattering welcome attentive listener hector for part rode direct to quarter of colonel of scottish regiment soldier came out took bridle of horse a saluted while sergeant asked what name must announce then remember sergeant macfarlane soldier looked at earnestly why exclaimed suddenly be hector campbell right enough sergeant have changed mightily sir be laddie when went away nigh four year ago news came to regiment that have be made captain proud be colonel will be right glad to see led way into house then regiment have not be on service just lately have two year on rhine came back here last autumn red cardinal be not fond of knew that must trust be more than must have done of regiment so have back again be not sorry for be dull work there siege nought else be just going to open door of inner room when hector said can announce a colonel campbell gude lord sergeant ejaculated ye dinna say that ye be colonel then reassuming with great effort military stiffness opened door announced in loud tone colonel hector campbell there be exclamation of astonishment from colonel two three officer who be sitting with why campbell former said coming forward warmly shaking hand be changed indeed have come back to almost living image of father when first joined officer shook hand with warmly colonel went on macfarlane announced a colonel hector surely can not have gained that rank only obtained two day ago see be good thing to be prince aide de camp turenne wishing to give opportunity of seeing service sent to enghien with message asking to employ on staff be at rocroi colonel exclaimed what be real news of battle be given out officially last night that have won victory there be sort of rumour morning in town say that three officer arrived last night with full detail be one of three colonel have just now come from palace after handing despatch to queen then be enghien who made colonel yes well then must have done something marked must never have got rank why have young noble of france in train have not made colonel suppose suppose not started early next morning therefore can not say what promotion be made still made yours campbell when did do just after fight be over umph what for well luckily discovered that spaniard have set ambush come come let hear about tell whole story of fight hector gave detail well certainly seems to have be extraordinary battle everyone appears to have be beaten in turn not enghien command sir well when cavalry be repulsed three time with loss a say of nearly number be pretty well equivalent to beating if enghien have not be able to bring up artillery reserve take that third charge must have be last ambush that discovered be suppose that of thousand musketeer enghien charged at beginning of fight hector nodded assent well be a well be found out surprised before other part of business began there be saying how battle must have ended heard have got company turenne be good enough when came here to confer with richelieu summer to call at barrack to give account of service have rendered agreed that rank be well earned have doubt that new step have be just a honourably gained how do think matter be going know nothing about sir beyond fact that be not secret that enghien gassion be in favour of advancing at once into flanders capturing spanish strong place before must gather army together doubt must be best way must doubt very much if enghien will be allowed to carry out plan see king will appointing council to act in concert with conde orleans queen have be set at nought queen be absolute regent mazarin be minister just a richelieu be minister of louis of course victory will put everyone in best of temper make way easy for mazarin just at first defeat must set clique at work against be quite true that defeat must not be fault for mysterious reason other french always hold minister for time being responsible for military disaster so long a mazarin check enghien prevents running risk of disaster thing be likely to go on smoothly here may be sure that will give prince chance of suffering defeat achieving victory see prince father together might be great deal too powerful for cardinal everyone know that conde have never cared much for anything own interest enghien have character of being most impetuous violent young noble of day fact that forced fight when a be generally known l'hopital have strictest order not to risk battle make clear that enghien have little regard for authority will see mazarin will not give further opportunity of becoming idol of france until have assured that can count upon friendship mazarin be not richelieu red cardinal won way to leadership of france by proving able to defeat intrigue against crush enemy even of most exalted position mazarin have such antecedent be not even frenchman doe not even look like noble that be clever may be sure richelieu must not have recommended a successor fancy that be cleverness of adventurer however adroit adventurer especially foreign adventurer will not hold power in france very long without exciting hatred of community hostility of noble however suppose be remaining here for time know must rather return at once to camp suppose must wait for intimation may do so see be altogether out of element in paris must feel particularly uncomfortable at court who must rather go to enghien turenne just at present there be more doing with enghien than turenne more to learn otherwise must far rather be with turenne enghien camp be too full of young noble must say that must take little trouble in keeping order repressing license turenne be by mean unduly strict enforces order set example of earnestness attention to work that have right to expect same to degree of everyone under where be staying at hotel conde prince be good enough morning to ask to establish there while remained in paris must not very well decline invitation must think not one of other officer laughed in day powerful friend be of greatest use without one have not much chance of advancement not that want advancement must rather remain a be captain in scottish regiment surrounded by good loyal friend comrade than be made general still one like to have grumble sometimes at rate well home colonel said hector campbell be proof even in france merit will make way that turenne must have taken fancy to in first place be fortunate turenne must surely not have promoted to be captain within three four month of joining except for marked bravery diligence that told displayed at turin have doubt that when hear particular will find that promotion now have be equally well deserved for certainly enghien be not likely to have gone out of way to promote one altogether stranger to when have so many young noble round personal friend of own belonging to family whom must wish to oblige of course will a one of bearer of despatch attend at court evening campbell yes queen said that must expect to see of course will be envied by young courtier there at present moment paris be half wild over victory of rocroi a three will be representative of army specially selected for share have in battle may be sure that will be regarded with eye of favour by lady of court well must think must be great nuisance hector said gruffly hitherto have have nothing to do with lady there be very few with duchess of savoy whenever there be reception state ceremony of kind be always ready to exchange with de lisle chavigny fellow aide de camp so that during whole time be there never once twice accompanied general on such occasion ah be younger then home laughed have passed eighteen now a must know be by mean bad looking with certain air of freshness simplicity be so rare here in paris that will be regarded a refreshing delightful after flippancy of court gallant hector laughed uncomfortably must not take up flippancy be afraid what say be true home if have to remain at court suppose must have to set to work at once to cultivate affectation other to counteract simplicity of speak however thank goodness suppose that will stay here long at rate be lucky that purchased new court suit before started to join duke of enghien coming from viscount turenne thought be bound to make good figure among crowd of young noble round enghien made large hole in saving do mean to say that have saving one of other officer exclaimed who ever heard of such thing never have pistole left in pocket week after get month pay be very different thing living in susa to living in paris hector laughed can assure that never spent more than half pay living be dearer down in roussillon thing have be in such disturbed state there for year that country be well nigh desert though two comrade messed together living cost twice a much a did at susa will see of evening at palace will be there colonel said so will home lesley be always expected that three officer from of regiment stationed in paris five from one happens to be on guard for evening must attend royal reception will be specially brilliant affair tonight for queen have held few reception of late be only announced yesterday afternoon after news of battle arrived have not be for that salon must not have be opened for month be very glad that there will be somebody there will know flatter that be going to consort with colonel laughed will have to be presented to at least score of court dame however fortunately will not expect usual amount of compliment will be really wanting to hear of battle most of will be interested in special friend with army will want to inquire about will not be so bad then hector said if only have to talk of military matter will not mind will be painful indeed if have to give news of death of anyone dear to lady be speaking to think that need fear very much about enghien be pretty sure to have sent list containing name of court gallant have fallen relative will at once have be notified of will not be present at court a to others who have merely lost lover will not break heart over be fashion to change so rapidly that probably not few of lady will have consoled for absence already however to begin with daresay will be able to act a mentor guide point out to who be who so that can avoid falling into serious error see there be dozen party at court already there be friend who by way be not numerous there be duke of beaufort clique there be conde party madame chevreuse party consists largely of herself be power at present one can say with whom will ally herself hitherto have be simply anti richelieu be most troublesome bitter enemy must say that not improbably will at once begin to conspire against mazarin a did against have be queen greatest ally then queen be always bitter enemy of richelieu whereas at present be supposed that be strongly in favour of mazarin in few month situation will clear party will become defined doubt enghien victory will add to power importance of conde who be already dangerously strong then matter will become interesting at present situation be somewhat chaotic politics will not be openly generally discussed simply because one know what anyone else opinion may be well then till evening will say goodbye colonel be going to have chat with sergeant macintosh will then return to conde hotel suppose will be expected to take midday meal there must be a well to do so certainly even though be like enough that will not be there be prince of schemer doubtless at present thought be concentrated on manner in enghien can best gain advantage from victory chapter x estate title on entering scottish soldier hector found that a hoped cabaret be deserted for be hour at regiment be assembled for drill must have be little embarrassing for a colonel to come upon number of private soldier at cabaret separately might have chatted with general greeting when number of be there together must have be embarrassing old sergeant a entered ran up to well done lad well done 't be delight to indeed to know that have so grandly made way already won rank of colonel why how did know macintosh guard at colonel be changed just after went into quarter may be sure that lost time in spreading news that have returned returned colonel in ten minute place be a full a must hold there be such crowd outside door that sergeant de ville came in to inquire what be matter thinking perhaps that regiment be in mutiny be right glad when trumpet sound assembly few minute ago have to rush off in hurry for felt that must be awkward for be to come in when be so excited yes be glad when found that be gone regard soldier in regiment a friend must shake hand with now a heartily a did when went away near four year back felt that must be somewhat embarrassing be greeted by wine cup in hand here be twenty pistoles say that left here for to drink health on promotion that will be so busy during day two remain in paris that will not be able to pay visit here now let have quiet talk together give news of regiment perhaps colonel oh need not call colonel macintosh when be together alone be what be hector campbell lad to whom showed so much kindness for father sake yes will tell one two of adventure will come round to tomorrow morning at seven o'clock at hotel conde will stroll out together sit down in garden of palais cardinal will then tell about regiment who have gone what change there be will be best sergeant said did hear something of how be made captain turenne be good enough to tell colonel so of came down to of course be very little men must like to hear about about battle at rocroi at of course must have in way distinguished to be appointed colonel at age hector gave full account of battle special thing for be promoted said at finish be that night before struck that there might be ambush set in copse in hollow between two army so far a must see effort have be made to occupy wood to find out if enemy have done so so went with servant who be capital fellow made way into discovered regiment of musketeer hidden there of course reported fact to general gassion told prince so before attacking enemy line prince charged right along wood destroyed musketeer there if have not done so must have taken in rear when be hotly engaged with spaniard might have changed fate of battle certainly might sergeant said volley from thousand musket from rear must well shake even best cavalry be happy thought of yours indeed merit there be in be due to turenne who have carefully instructed in everything must be of importance when two hostile army faced other a must never have dreamt of retiring to rest before having place where enemy must conceal carefully searched seemed to matter of course that must be done however general gassion prince be good enough to consider that service be vital one a soon a battle be over prince gave promotion be well earned lad well earned now about affair at turin must not have be better done hector old soldier said in high delight when story be told used to think that spent more time than be necessary in reading over account of battle siege see that time be well spent may be sure will be with at seven tomorrow morning added a hector rose to leave though expect will have heavy night of here for there will scarcely be man in regiment who wo come round stay to hear news warrant by evening there will not be sou remaining out of money have left for hector arrived at hotel just in time for midday meal be pleased to find conde be not present two companion be placed at different point at great table so that a many a possible must hear story of battle after meal be over hector be glad to leave salon in company with gentleman of household who have volunteered to be guide spent afternoon in visiting principal sight of paris of have seen little when boy in barrack hotel of noble fortress rather than private building interested greatly a also street in principal trader lived be unfavourably impressed with appearance of population in other part must well understand what guide told that be dangerous in extreme for gentleman unattended to pas through quarter at six o'clock sat down to evening meal at conde after having attired in new suit repaired with de penthiere de caussac to louvre be eight o'clock when entered reception room be already full brilliancy of attire of courtier lady seen by light of great chandelier be impressive in extreme to one who have never seen gathering of kind before there be little pause in buzz of conversation a three officer entered hector two companion be at once surrounded by friend while be joined by colonel maclvor other two officer be hero of evening campbell former said with laugh dozen lady have already asked to present to well please do so just now colonel let look round first be fair campbell first though will tell piece of news have just heard queen sent off messenger two day ago to turenne be believed that be to have command of army on rhine be good news indeed hector exclaimed be high time that must be given command instead of being always put under men le capable than still be unexpected at present moment know that queen always have greatest liking for turenne colonel said of course until now have have power moreover fancy that appointment be to extent dictated by policy conde be already dangerously powerful enghien victory will of course largely add to influence doubt large estate will be given to latter service can not be ungenerously rewarded will be thought unadvisable to give at present further opportunity conde be old son who be certainly ambitious hotheaded now will be even more powerful than father have be be to win more victory to become popular idol power might well overshadow that of throne therefore be likely enough that news be true turenne have proved that military duty be with supreme for held aloof from trouble in brother duke have involved may act a counterpoise to enghien fancy that latter plan a have told must lead to conquest of flanders will not be adopted must not have be so in richelieu time red cardinal must not have lost moment in ordering to march into flanders thinking only of good of france disregarding fact that continued success might lead to own power being shaken think that mazarin will act in same way think not of course at present not much be known about affect greatest humility be almost obsequious to great noble even professes to be anxious to return to italy a soon a service here can be dispensed with expect that will in time occupy a great position a of richelieu that will hold by craft rather than strength be from look of man likely enough for must say that be infinitely better for france that ecclesiastic like richelieu mazarin must be at head of affair than that great noble must struggle intrigue for power ready a have shown over over again to plunge france into civil war for attainment of aim ah here come queen door at end of salon opened anne entered by side walked young king little behind be orleans conde beaufort bouillon while following with air be almost humble came mazarin queen young king be dressed in violet mourning colour of court lady present wore shade of colour relieved by white present formed into two line through queen walked acknowledged deep reverence little king bowed repeatedly anne of austria be one of most beautiful woman of time although charm of youth have disappeared stateliness of bearing made up for loss hector thought that have never seen so lovely woman a soon a have passed into inner apartment known a audience chamber line broke up buzz of conversation light laughter followed silence have reigned a procession passed court indeed felt general feeling of relief at death of louis although well meaning desirous of doing good life of monarch have not be happy one health have never be good although have wisdom to see that in supporting richelieu in way adding to authority be acting for good of france knowledge that be little more than cipher galled irritated disposition be jealous one a great minister knew that anne of austria be ever opponent politically worked upon feeling embittered life of king queen latter be constant victim of king jealousy caprice thing combined with ascetic temperament of king have rendered court of france dismal one royal salon formed strong contrast to brilliancy of of richelieu now king be gone there be general feeling of relief among noble lady of court might be that stormy time be ahead indeed be secret that conde beaufort many other noble be already united against mazarin called importants term well suited to own idea of power of position aspired to a natural leader of france madame de chevreuse wish to be presented to colonel maclvor said to hector everyone know reputation be cleverest woman in france one of most intriguing be queen greatest friend have be mainstay in struggle with richelieu of one thing may be sure that will not tamely see mazarin step into place have be whispered already thrown into arm of 'the importants if anyone can persuade queen to throw over cardinal be with slight shrug of shoulder hector followed colonel to group of three four lady seated upon fauteuil colonel stopped before one of bowing deeply said duchess have honour to present to compatriot colonel campbell who arrived here morning with despatch from duc d'enghien madame chevreuse like queen be still beautiful woman be petite possessed face whose fascination few must withstand be most restless of intriguer be never so happy a when engaged in conspiracy might cost estate liberty why monsieur campbell said with smile have looked to see fierce warrior lo behold find one who by appearance will be far more in element at court than in field then appearance must greatly belie madame hector said for while may say that be at home in military camp feel sorely ill at ease here feel must rather face enemy battery than so many beautiful face be not bad for beginner lady said with smile methinks will soon get over fear for there be nothing very dangerous in of duchesse de longueville motioned to lady next to be a desirous a that must be presented to that must hear from lip somewhat more of doings of brother than have yet learned hector again bowed deeply sister of enghien be a ambitious for brother sake a be for own self be potent ally in trouble of time enghien be wounded said monsieur la moussaie left field directly battle be won must tell little about brother injury received three wound duchess happily none of be severe be on horseback on following morning seemed miraculous to that must so escape for rode ever ahead of in charge against spanish square be acting a one of aide de camp remember having seen face before madame have be for past four year on staff of viscount de turenne have not left army during time general have goodness seeing that there be little doing in south to send to learn what must from operation of duke against spanish sent letter of recommendation to brother who kindly appointed to same position under have occupied under turenne did find lady of italy very lovely madame de chevreuse asked suddenly in truth madame have small opportunity of judging seeing that unless when sent with message from general to duchess of savoy think that exchanged single word with woman during whole of stay there madame de chevreuse duchesse de longueville lady sitting round smiled then have very much to learn colonel campbell madame de chevreuse said will find plenty of lady in court here who will not object to give lesson trust madame hector said bluntly that there will be little opportunity for to take lesson a to manner of court for hope that stay here will be short indeed be most ungallant speech younger duchess said laughing show indeed truth of what have said a to ignorance of woman do not know sir that be unwritten law at court gentleman here must be at foot of one fair lady suppose have be brought up at court hector said must not be more insensible than others when one pass three quarter of one time on horseback under commander like turenne who set example in matter of endurance watchfulness one have small leisure indeed for aught else indeed be glad enough to seek one bed a soon a day work be done if be turenne madame de chevreuse laughed give up be most insensible of men head contains one idea be duty a to poor creature be a insensible a be st anthony at moment door separated salon from of queen opened name of monsieur de penthiere monsieur de caussac be called two officer at once passed into inner room be left out in cold monsieur le colonel will have honour of separate audience madame de chevreuse said a have be rewarded far above merit for service have rendered hector said quietly be probable that queen have nothing to say to be pleased to receive very graciously morning gave hand to kiss assuredly have right to expect further favour in few minute two officer came out looking radiant queen having graciously presented with title to two estate minute later hector name be called went off with deep bow to lady murmured apology for leaving loyal spirit surely madame de chevreuse said bizarre of course at present simple a child moreover must say that atmosphere of court will not infect a have others be refreshing to meet with one who although must have distinguished vastly be still modest simple without shadow of conceit of self consciousness spoke a frankly to a if be two waiting maid at cabaret however men of stamp may always be made useful must rather have devotion of young officer like who be must say likely to rise to high rank than of dozen men ready to lay heart at foot of first comer who be a ready to change mistress a side by time door have closed behind hector queen be sitting on sofa with little king by side mazarin stood pace behind conde orleans have short time before gone out have mingled with crowd in antechamber courtier present who be member of council stood distance in rear have have time colonel campbell to read despatch can now estimate service that rendered duc d'enghien army general gassion must say marshal gassion for have today be raised to rank speaks of value of service in term of highest eulogy indeed say frankly have not be for voluntary expedition discovery by of spanish ambuscade be probable that must have suffered defeat instead of victory duke speaks le strongly in favour can remember that when viscount turenne be here three year ago told how young scottish officer on staff have saved turin to by most daring enterprise by informed garrison of citadel help must soon reach mentioned that for service have appointed monsieur campbell captain be scottish by birth be not be majesty by birth descent father be captain in scottish regiment fell at siege of la rochelle be may say adopted by regiment have good fortune to be trained in arm from child still greater fortune to attract attention of viscount de turenne who young a be obtained commission for appointed to staff well young sir viscount rewarded for great service that rendered at turin duc d'enghien have similarly rewarded for service to at rocroi be ours to reward for service to france cardinal mazarin will in name hand tomorrow estate of de la villar in poitou carry with title of baron de la villar soldier who have rendered such service to can not be allowed to remain soldier dependent on pay be sure must need arise will do a good service a have rendered to turenne enghien majesty be too good gracious hector stammered overcome by sudden unexpected reward be assured madame recovered voice be steady must there be need will willingly lay down life in majesty service in of king son mean also queen said gently in of minister who may need faithful friend even more than do under whose advice have now acted assuredly madame cardinal mazarin be minister a long a posse confidence represents france in eye will render a faithful service to a to well spoken baron queen said graciously henceforth will count a among friend held out hand for to kiss a did little king after deep bow to to cardinal hector left audience chamber still almost bewildered by honour bestowed upon hector made way through crowd to side of colonel maclvor general verdict of who watched being that have not met with same good fortune a who preceded that for reason other have be reprimanded well lad colonel said what fortune have met with judging by face queen cardinal have failed to recognize service that have rendered upon contrary colonel have so heaped favour upon that at present can scarcely realize good fortune feel almost humiliated that so much must have be given for what be mere matter of duty attended by great peril what have done then campbell well colonel absurd a seems even to myself queen have graciously bestowed upon estate of la villar by gift say become a owner baron de la villar be fortunate indeed dear campbell colonel said heartily shaking by hand show that duke gassion be of same opinion that expressed namely that discovery of ambush be chief factor in bringing about victory of rocroi be such simple thing hector said be merely reconnaissance such a have made score of time in italy doubt campbell see other reconnaissance did not lead to result while did dear lad be by result that men be judged that young officer on enghien staff must unbidden a say a matter of duty have undertaken business show how thoroughly have profited by teaching under turenne a such deserve what have gained though say that must have obtained dessert have not reconnaissance saved enghien from defeat now will take to madame de chevreuse again beckoned to after entered audience chamber told to bring up again when came out a duchesse de longueville have taken great fancy to now dear boy position be changed have become french noble however unwilling may find mixed up on one side other with doings of court lady have power be well to keep in with for of might prove valuable friend protector first rule here be make a many friend a possible for one can say when may require hector again followed colonel to group of lady madame maclvor said have honour to present why have not presented to already madame de chevreuse said with laugh memory must be singularly short colonel memory be not short madame be somewhat different personage have now to present to madame have honour to present colonel campbell baron de la villar lady uttered exclamation of surprise why what have done colonel duchess exclaimed must have be remarkable action surely for to be made colonel by brother baron de la villar by queen in opinion of duc d'enghien general gassion duchess performed service to large extent brought about victory of rocroi young friend be at present not beyond age of modesty therefore if will allow will state circumstance under general de turenne be in habit of constantly visiting post at night with viscount alone endeavouring to discover position intention of enemy night before battle started voluntarily to perform same duty accompanied only by servant crept into wood lay between two army there discovered thousand musketeer who be lying in ambush reported discovery to general gassion who on part informed duke of most important intelligence for be evident that have ambuscade be unsuspected must have taken cavalry in rear at critical moment of battle must have opened so heavy fire even bravest of cavalry thus surprised shot down by unsuspected foe in rear might have fallen into confusion being forewarned duke directed first charge upon wood took musketeer by surprise annihilated before charging routing enemy horse thus see lady that have illustration of mouse saving lion lion be generous noble minded enough to give mouse full credit for service that have rendered then have good reason to be grateful to monsieur le baron madame chevreuse said laying aside bantering tone in have before addressed young scot majesty have done well to reward loyalty for

addicted to military study than most lad of age that a be good enough to say reminded of own boyhood be owing to kindness tuition have now made way be still further to increase military knowledge that sent for time to serve under duc d'enghien therefore much a admire glory that duke have gained recognize extraordinary genius feel that duty gratitude alike bind to great master quite right duchesse de longueville said warmly be sure that brother will approve of decision admires a much a do regard a master in military science may be perhaps that one of day will take part in battle in brother turenne will have command if be so madame hector said there can be little doubt of victory for with two greatest military genius france have produced during last hundred year must be hard indeed if victory did not attend united banner news of honour have be bestowed upon young colonel circulated rapidly through salon many gentleman came up begged colonel maclvor to introduce to one who have received so marked proof of queen favour who have won praise goodwill of turenne enghien might well become in time man of mark so many compliment be showered upon hector that be glad indeed when queen again passed through room on way to apartment be at liberty to retire walked slowly back to conde palace went up to room changed court suit for have worn during day then went out again feeling that must be hopeless to attempt to sleep paced backwards forward for hour on quay thinking of change three day have brought about must scarcely realize even now that who week ago be captain with nought pay be now not only colonel noble of france with estate of whose value be ignorant a carried with patent of nobility be evident that must be one of dimension sufficient to support title change excited feeling of exultation whole thought so far have be directed solely to career a soldier have hoped that day might win colonelcy more than that have never thought of high command in france be matter of birth interest connection gassion who have just earned marshal baton be sole exception to rule hitherto general still more marshal have always be men belonging to first family of france have be matter of course that when army went to field be under command of prince of blood utmost outsider must look for be command of regiment promotion have delighted not for sake of pay position because if obtained command of one of regiment be rapidly being formed to meet danger threatened france must have opportunity of doing good service of earning esteem of such men a turenne civil dignity however oppressed rather than gratified must have heavy responsibility when not on active service must be expected to show at court must have difficulty in holding aloof from intrigue conspiracy thought turned to scotland have relation there be true on father mother side be stranger to moreover scotland at present be torn by civil religious war in england civil war be raging extreme party in scotland having got upper hand have allied with english parliamentarian cause of king be well nigh lost scottish officer men in french service have for most part left home owing to bitter religious difference of time under easier condition of life in france have come to look with disgust at narrow bigotry of scottish sect feeling heightened perhaps by deep resentment still prevailed in france at insolence with knox scottish reformer have treated princess queen mary among french officer feeling be wholly in favour of royal cause in england queen be french have france not be engaged in warfare number of young noble must have gone over drawn sword in cause hector must gladly have done same for time at rate have idea whatever of returning to scotland if better time came have often thought that if successful in winning competency must return to native land for close connection with scottish regiment kept alive in feeling of nationality always regarded a stranger in france estate title now bestowed upon seemed to put hope further away than ever to fix permanently in france contingency more disagreeable to more saw how completely france be dominated by faction how unstable be condition of life there musing therefore a walked up down for hour be very different from most young men must have felt at so great sudden change in fortune chapter xi castle of la villar next morning called at

baron be like foreigner ready to risk life in service of france will understand how be situated how feel happily for be not so highly placed a to excite enmity although doubtless not few of who flocked round yesterday evening to congratulate on good fortune felt sensation of envy that young soldier of fortune must be so honoured in case envy be accompanied by deepest animosity great noble find obstacle in way of grasping power must hesitate at nothing to rid of be not for support of queen position must be untenable even for hour without queen herself must speedily become a much cipher a be so long a weak king reigned have need of of men of heart devotion such a take to be ask for engagement sir felt that there be genuine ring in voice yesterday evening when promised faithful service to majesty feel that if such service be needed will be ready to render will indeed eminence can not conceive that circumstance can occur must render such aid a must offer of service to be assured must such occasion arise queen may count upon to render to extent of life when say queen of course include eminence a trusted adviser supporter well spoken sir believe word may be that

in box order for to place in possession of castle estate whensoever may present a at present moment service can be spared from army might be a well to visit at once if only for few day possibly

officer ask to assemble to whom have pleasure of speaking senior officer introduced others report have told that new colonel be still young man that have served with distinction under turenne enghien be not prepared for so young commander a french regiment have a rule two colonel one veteran soldier who have won way to rank by long service long fighting other young nobleman who have gained post solely by family influence possessed knowledge whatever of military matter who be never with regiment except when went upon campaign even then generally preferred pleasure of paris to hardship of war have hector be appointed to what be called second surprise must have be felt at youth that anyone must have gained position of first colonel at age by sheer merit be astonishing indeed to in twenty minute officer be assembled introduced by senior captain to hector will not begin business now latter said leave of absence doe not terminate until tomorrow morning think that be much more pleasant to talk over matter comfortably round table than be to do so in set manner therefore gentleman if will all sup with evening at fleur de li after have finished meal will talk over wine opinion be that officer of regiment must be good comrade regiment benefit by everything go on more smoothly comfortably be specially so in newly raised regiment where officer be altogether new to military matter join from other regiment have previous knowledge of other in same way men be new to other to officer unless there be perfect harmony among officer there can not be perfect harmony in regiment if one officer look after comfort of company treat a must do while company be neglected left solely to care of sergeant there will necessarily be envy ill feeling regiment will cease to be unit may say gentleman that be dictum not of of marshal turenne who be instructor in art of war who followed out better system from time that be boy of fourteen until now result be that regiment be finest in service will be aim ambition to raise poitou regiment a nearly a possible to same condition will rely upon assistance cooperation to bring about supper will be served at six have only just returned from country have heard news suppose that intimation have be received a to what be destination whither will march none colonel de thiou senior captain said better hope that will give couple of month to get into shape there be little time for drill discipline when be once in field so saying saluted officer returned to hotel who must have thought of seeing mere lad placed at head of regiment a colonel one of captain said can not imagine how such thing can have come about for certainly can have family influence newly raised regiment like ours want bright man one that can look up to respect fancy that will find that young gentleman will be respected de thiou said be young pleasant looking whatever be must say that be levelheaded that have infinite fund of firmness resolution must certainly advise nobody to take advantage of youth have seen more service than of have family possessed influence at court must have be colonel by time unless be greatly mistaken will find that have man good man strong one do think that must have won way to regiment at age of twenty unless there have be something quite unusual be talking other day with one of gassion staff who have come back until wound that got at rocroi be healed told that gassion france have better soldier said publicly after battle that victory be largely due to young friend of ours have not be for thing might have gone altogether differently said that enghien proud ambitious a be frankly admitted same thing of course can only go upon what have seen of from what said manner in said be convinced that must not get better chief than young colonel believe that will make comfortable regiment to be in also believe that who oppose will find that make grievous mistake next day hector took up in earnest work of organizing regiment in first place insisted that officer must learn drill then that instead of handing over practical command of company to sergeant must command on drill ground look after discipline comfort of men in barrack become personally acquainted with character of man under command many of sergeant be inefficient be speedily deprived of rank men of good conduct zeal appointed to place regard of men be won by insisting that contractor for food must send in meat bread wine of quality that have guaranteed to supply three officer be told off day to examine quality of food sent in reported a being bad be examined by hector if complaint be well founded be at once condemned great attention be paid to cooking to cleanliness of barrack room to many other detail have until then be entirely neglected there be at first grumbler not only among men among officer a well extraordinary rapid improvement in efficiency of regiment appearance condition be such that be not long in recognizing that although work be hard unnecessary labour be imposed upon while a knowledge of drill increased work became easier le irksome recognized that by far hardest worker in regiment be colonel morning for first month drilled officer in courtyard be not overlooked when knew work sent to take charge of company until considered officer competent drilled company by turn when drill be over made tour of room in barrack visited kitchen conversed freely with men listening to complaint at first number of men brought up for drunkenness be large first offence always condoned giving offender lecture on folly of conduct of discredit that brought upon regiment for second offence man be confined to barrack forced to wear coat inside out even at drill ridicule that men have to suffer be worse than punishment inflicted upon case occurred of third offence by turn three officer of company dined with chatting with a friend not only gained liking made acquainted with individual character came to paris short time after hector assumed command of regiment a soon a heard of arrival latter called upon heard from cardinal of good fortune viscount said congratulate heartily upon mazarin be good enough to say that discovery of spaniard ambush be result of teaching indeed feel somewhat proud of pupil be going to rhine a perhaps may have heard hope to have honour of serving under with regiment sir will be glad to have fear there be little chance of be to take command of weimar troop death of duke have be heavy blow to be thought that unless go down there say because have served there be known by weimar troop that force will break up altogether from what hear hardly think there be much chance of having french regiment with now being raised be likely to be sent to fight under enghien in flanders position be a know painful one owing to bouillon having gone to italy to take command of pope troop believe be reason why mazarin have withdrawn from command of army in savoy however a soldier accept work have given not allowing family matter to interfere in way with though be opinion that bouillon have be very hardly treated by breaking of engagement be given when surrendered sedan to france week later hector presented at levee of cardinal mazarin be expecting to see baron received note saying that have taken command of regiment must do honour of presenting a soon a have put matter in trim be satisfied with men officer with eminence trust that in two three month time will do honour of inspecting how did find barony be delighted with castle be strong one be taking step to add to strength believe when be finished that will be almost impregnable save by army well commanded then think cardinal said with smile with certain air of seriousness that must offer safe asylum if needed one trust event may never occur eminence if must castle be at disposal will guarantee that will resist for three month might attack one can never say cardinal said mournfully oh noble be a have ever be curse of france man think only of of increasing domain what france may suffer matter nothing to so that be enriched be one of capable of ruling france must gladly retire who be there orleans vain empty headed treacherous to friend man whose word be not to be relied upon conde who think only of enriching adding to possession beaufort roistering trooper none of men must maintain position for moment whole country seethes with discontent at heavy taxation necessitated by war paris a be always case when there be trouble in air be restless turbulent have good friend be insufficient to sustain against intrigue of enemy queen alone upholds truly burden be too great for one man to bear will wonder why be speaking thus to colonel campbell be of greatest necessity that majesty must know upon whom can rely absolutely in case of trouble sir being altogether unconnected with of great family of france stand in different position from of great majority of officer of rank look where will see regiment officered by men connected by birth family with one other of men who be at present intriguing against be ordered to take step to arrest for example one of person connected with might without openly refusing give such warning to that must be able to escape now sir ask to tell frankly whether under contingency queen can rely upon service give word that reply be will in way count against there be case in must doubtless be painful to to carry out such order be protege of monsieur de turenne monsieur de turenne be brother of duc de bouillon a know be staying for month in castle of sedan where went to be cured of wound now monsieur frankly be ordered to arrest duc de bouillon must carry out without fear favour certainly must excellency must give such order to marshal turenne must do so be soldier of queen before thing have taught that duty be towards sovereign who represents france regardless of other consideration cardinal while speaking have watched young soldier face scrutinizingly faithful a turenne have always be to crown even when brother be in arm against mazarin have still in heart doubt a to fidelity under circumstance must not be conscious that faith have be absolutely broken with bouillon accustomed to tortuous way must scarce imagine turenne must hold altogether above family interest saw by manner more than word of hector that be speaking from profound conviction in asking question have be thinking more of turenne loyalty than of young colonel having be four year in closest connection with marshal must not know real sentiment felt sure that have turenne expressed anger at treatment brother have received must have seen in young man face answer be reassuring one thank monsieur le baron musketeer swiss guard know can absolutely rely upon will be glad to be able to inform queen that can place implicit faith in regiment need not impress upon necessity for conversation being regarded by a absolutely confidential hector thinking matter over have great difficulty in end in arriving at truth namely that own loyalty be very secondary object of interest to minister that real motive in thus apparently opening mind to have be not to gather own sentiment to endeavour to ascertain of turenne from talk among officer have already learned that general opinion be that although queen have always entertained most favourable opinion of turenne have nominated a marshal commander of force on rhine mazarin have assented to arrangement because feared that army of italy must probably follow commander must latter take up quarrel of brother while on rhine with few regiment to of whom be stranger under command must be practically powerless whatever sentiment might be with regard to bouillon in middle of august hector received order from mazarin to take part with regiment in review queen intended to hold at versailles two day later at review musketeer swiss guard scottish regiment two regiment of line besides own queen young king mazarin most of member of court be present poitou regiment acquitted admirably marching steadiness with went through manoeuvre be in such strong contrast to of other two infantry regiment have be formed for year a to excite surprise admiration of spectator after be over mounted officer rode up to hector told that queen wished to speak to riding up dismounted advanced to queen pavilion monsieur campbell queen said graciously wish to express to how well satisfied be with efficiency of regiment admirable way in have gone through manoeuvre never have seen better performed be more surprising a have be four month raised three month under personal command cardinal have informed that learns that be due entirely to personal exertion care that have bestowed upon wish that officer showed same zeal diligence in order to mark gratification at conduct of regiment have requested monsieur le cardinal to order two company of regiment will be quartered at barrack now occupied by scottish regiment be to march east tomorrow hector bowed deeply immensely gratified at praise that regiment have received returned to place at head marched back to st denis on arrival there informed men of gracious word queen have be pleased to say about regiment great honour bestowed upon by quartering of two company in paris men broke into loud cheering a concluded hector then called officer together gentleman said have to thank for admirable way in have seconded effort by aid of regiment have just gained high commendation of majesty within so very short time after have be raised have be thinking matter over a rode back have decided that where did so well must be invidious to give to sole honour of being thus quartered near louvre furnishing guard to yourselves pleasure of being in paris therefore gentleman will send in first place first tenth company at end of two week ninth company will take place of tenth fortnight later second will take place of first so in order so that company will in turn have share in honourable service there be general murmur of satisfaction next morning formal order be received that two company of poitou regiment must march into paris occupy portion of barrack scotch regiment have just vacated hector called up two company have selected now men said see advantage that have gained by discipline good conduct have doubt that before granting honour of forming part of garrison of paris minister have made inquiry respecting conduct of regiment here have doubtless heard that have be eminently satisfactory that authority inhabitant have complaint of drunkenness misconduct against of misconduct there have be case of drunkenness very few indeed for past month there have not be single case among trust that will remember while in credit of regiment be in hand that single case of drunkenness brawling in street will take place feel confident that will be so need hardly say must there be exception punishment will be vastly more severe than have previously be awarded be sure that offender will find in contempt with will be regarded by comrade still more severe punishment than can inflict that evening captain de thiou other officer of two company be to march into next day dined with hector after dinner de thiou rose said colonel have be requested to express to on behalf of whole of officer of regiment deep gratitude for honour that regiment have obtained be good enough yesterday to ascribe partly to feel that be wholly due to although of be at first little inclined to think that change made by in work be unnecessary now recognize fully how great have be benefit not only to regiment to ourselves duty be at first considered irksome be now regarded a pleasant feel that a said must be case have acquired respect of men that be upon that rely not upon sergeant own time pass more pleasantly from being fully occupied from consciousness that be doing duty a to regiment in general benefit have be enormous men seem pleased with interest shown in a much a with comfort that now enjoy in turn endeavour to satisfy by attention to drill by bearing manner by avoidance of giving cause for complaint monsieur have be work be sure that be conscious of difference of display made in park that must have shown have not be for reform have be introduced by trust that day may not be far distant when will be able to prove on field of battle same efficiency have won credit upon parade ground thank heartily captain de thiou for what have be good enough to say on own behalf that of officer of regiment can only say have endeavoured to act up to teaching of monsieur de turenne felt sure that although method might at first seem irksome to of value must gradually become appreciated be scarcely le pleased at decrease in drunkenness at general improvement in men than by increase of discipline efficiency do mean to come to paris colonel de thiou asked presently will remain here will ride in day presence will be more necessary with regiment than with only two company a senior officer will be responsible for general order of detachment hector rode in next day with men after seeing comfortably lodged in barrack returned to st denis week later report reached st denis of strange scene at court haughty insolent duchess of monthazon who belonged to party of importants have impertinence to insult queen grossly in garden of tuileries have at once be disgraced ordered to retire to rochfield duke of beaufort friend be furious at exercise of mazarin authority next day hector received message asking to call at hotel de clef cardinal residence on presenting be at once shown into mazarin private apartment monsieur de villar mazarin said be sorely in need of friend have heard of what have happened from threat that have publicly uttered against be convinced that beaufort will hesitate at nothing to bring about ruin hear that be still with regiment at st denis will be glad if for time will take up abode at paris will hold in readiness to be of service to if there must be occasion beaufort be capable of even attempting life be very unscrupulous will hesitate at nothing will be glad if will take up lodging within short distance of so can communicate with instantly certainly excellency will keep company always under arm so at shortest notice will be in readiness to act a may direct surely excellency have queen musketeer close at hand queen musketeer be body of gallant soldier will take order only from queen be strongly anti cardinalist in late reign suppose that be better affected towards than be towards richelieu if heard that hotel be attacked must not move foot until received order from queen to do so at rate will have reason to complain of delay on part excellency can assure of devotion hector at once went to auberge few hundred yard from cardinal residence thought better to put up there than to take lodging a must then have four mounted men with riding to st denis returned same night with horse be always to be saddled said to when have dismounted orderly have come up to room one of by turn will always remain here armed ready to mount without instant delay others will put aside scarf one of will always be at cabaret nearest to hotel de vendome residence of duke of beaufort who be son of duc de vendome at time two of can be there so a to drink play card together a appearance of one sitting too long might attract attention object be to find out from conversation of duke guard servant whether have idea that anything unusual be going to take place have reason to believe that there be plot against cardinal be much concerned in defeating when four scotch soldier have retired hector said to paolo now paolo place more reliance upon finding out anything be afloat than upon soldier be not likely that plan beaufort may form will be communicated to people until moment for action indeed be probable that will rely solely upon personal friend now want to disguise in way may think best watch beaufort hotel see who come in out if messenger go out follow see house call at mark if who dwell there repair at once to hotel de vendome if perceive that be case let know at once see if can get hold of dozen street gamin employ to watch house of gentleman especially that of monsieur id captain of beaufort guard of two monsieur de campion count de beaupuis who be know among duke most intimate friend there be score of street boy who for few sou day must gladly undertake work will do master can take word that by tomorrow at lodging of four gentleman will be strictly watched be business after own heart in first place paolo take note from to hotel de clef wait for answer note be short one merely gave name of auberge at have taken up quarter added if eminence will be good enough to send morning list of visit that may intend to pay journey that may make during day must enable to regulate movement accordingly in order to be always here ready to carry out order that may send from hotel cardinal reply be even more brief be well thought of will go nowhere to louvre tomorrow will probably be there greater part of day unless hear from to contrary need only remain in between twelve one next morning paolo appeared dressed in ragged clothes what be bundle of paper that have got be lampoon on cardinal nothing so natural a must try sell in front of hotel de vendome nothing must be better paolo have already picked up dozen gamin master sharp little beggar who jumped at idea of being set to watch people between everyone who go in come out from hotel will be followed will in first place find out name bring to after will follow wherever go from time to time let know what be doing several day passed four gentleman specially named together with several others be frequently at hotel there be in however nothing suspicious a hector easily learned that be vassal close friend of house of vendome on third day however heard that at least dozen of gentleman met in two three at various cabaret near duke of beaufort spent greater portion of time there hector at once procured dress suitable for gentleman of middle class for trooper gave instruction to spend greater portion of time at cabaret at gentleman stopped report be that talked of indifferent subject that be evidently waiting for someone a invariably turned glance at door whenever fresh comer entered next day hector received note from cardinal be just starting with duke of orleans for maisons where will dine with two hour later three trooper who have be out returned almost at same minute with news that person be watching have got up suddenly gone out after messenger wearing beaufort cognizance have come in spoken to few minute later paolo arrived said that duke of beaufort have gone with count of beaupuis to convent of capuchin that several horse have be taken there hector thought matter over certainly said to a cardinal note be dated at nine o'clock be now distance on way a soon a duke received notice of having gone notified friend can only be on way home that will venture to attack even if have intention will scarcely do so if duke of orleans return with unless indeed duke be in plot a none of paolo scout have brought news of communication between beaufort orleans be hardly likely that be so paolo do go down watch convent of capuchin if duke of beaufort remains there with friend may doubtless be joined by others let know if ride away if doe so attack may take place anywhere along road if remains will doubtless attack cardinal a carriage pass must there be more than one entrance to convent put boy to watch bring news must party sally out will be at barrack be there that must bring send word trooper be ordered to put on military clothes saddle horse quarter of hour later hector rode to barrack followed by de thiou said want other five officer to have horse ready at moment notice have sort of idea that there be plot on foot against cardinal want to take hand in matter fancy that with five trooper will be strong enough to disconcert plotter two hour later received message from paolo saying that duke of beaufort three other gentleman be still at convent that most of others have gone to residence of henri de campion in rue st honore mean to attack just at end of journey hector said to close to hotel de vendome now only depends upon whether duke of orleans stay at maisons return with cardinal ordered officer trooper to mount with took post on road by cardinal must return in hour saw carriage approaching then moved forward a carriage passed hector saluted saw to satisfaction that duke of orleans be with cardinal after carriage have gone fifty yard hector turned with party followed carriage at distance when within quarter of mile of rue st honore horseman came along met carriage immediately passed turned galloped back along road hector felt doubt that be placed there to warn conspirator to be in readiness if duke of orleans be not in carriage that there must now be attempt however closed up to within thirty yard a entered rue st honore be quiet there nothing happened until cardinal alighted at hotel de clef a did so looked round beckoned to hector to follow chapter xiii battle of freiburg cardinal did not address hector until have entered private room when turned said sharply what mean colonel when saw officer on road felt sure that be not there for nothing still more sure when on alighting found so closely following be convinced cardinal that there be plot against life believe that be only because duke of orleans returned with that be not carried into effect possibly because saw troop behind carriage now tell reason for supposing be in danger hector related various step that have taken spy worked better for than mine did for cardinal said that dozen so of beaufort friend be for reason other spending time at angel inn other cabaret be aware have have word of proceeding today have be better served doubtless because plan be better laid hardly think that must have attacked when orleans be with there be saying for if beaufort have daring insolence enough to attempt to slay queen minister within quarter of mile of louvre must not trouble greatly whether prince of blood be in carriage not especially if have reason for believing orleans must not regard deed with very great disapproval however whatever intention might be be clear that appearance of party of twelve armed men decided question may regard a certain that news have escort be carried to by man who galloped on ahead thank sir thank very heartily not only for sake for of france will ask to go across to louvre will take dozen armed servant with there be little fear that attempt will be renewed today must be too much disconcerted by failure of plot to make fresh arrangement so speedily will go first to louvre inform majesty of what have taken place will remain here for hour will then leave by gate at back of house make circuit enter palace by river gate musketeer on guard will stop will give pas wrote few line on paper queen confidential servant laporte will be at door to meet will have instruction to escort by corridor where will be unobserved so to majesty private closet be to accompany beaufort must soon hear of must be shrewd enough to perceive that meeting with be by mean matter of chance hector followed out instruction on presenting at palace be at once taken up to queen closet laporte went in returning immediately requested to enter queen be walking up down room face flushed with indignation majesty must fain hear from own lip monsieur le baron statement that have made to queen sat down listened intently while hector repeated story there can be doubt about cardinal keeping of number of armed men within call for day summons to to gather in rue st honore while with others took up post at convent of capuchin hard by moment spy have discovered that have left for maisons must have be for one purpose will learn that although woman anne of austria queen of france be not to be deprived of minister faithful friend without striking back in return monsieur de villar have rendered great service be there boon that must ask of be granted beforehand thank majesty most humbly hector said already have received honour far beyond anything deserve have honour when thanking majesty to hope day to be able to give proof that be not unworthily bestowed still hope to do so have already shown worthy queen said by manner in have in so short time rendered regiment to appointed so efficient however if there be at present boon that can bestow then remember that queen of france hold debtor that have royal word that boon that may hereafter ask for be in power to grant will be given take a pledge of promise took off gold chain exquisitely worked gave received kneeling now sir will keep here no longer have much to say to excellency trust that will present at levee evening one thing more colonel mazarin added doubt not that of beaufort people will endeavour to find out how be that came to be behind carriage if do so might carelessly mention that officer have ridden out in party at st germain that on way back chanced to fall in with carriage at barrack hector called officer together gentleman said have doubt that little ride today have somewhat puzzled be not at liberty to tell reason why requested to ride with be very probable that may be asked question beg to remember that have be on little party of pleasure to st germain having dined there be on way back when overtook carriage of cardinal seeing that have duke of orleans with reined back followed deeming that must not appear respectful be to gallop past carriage please bear story in mind recall also that dined at lion d'or there that dinner be good one that be sort of celebration on part of two company having honour to be chosen for duty in paris be matter upon much depends be in fact matter of state may well imagine must not be recalling event to mind be not that good deal depends upon have received strict order that little comedy will be carried out know that can rely implicitly upon discretion have indeed answered for story will be true in respect instead of excursion having come off today will come off on first day can arrange that can be off duty that evening at palace hector be a cardinal predicted accosted by one of beaufort officer to whom have be previously introduced after talking on other subject for few minute said saw today monsieur riding with party of officer along rue st honore did not notice assure did not sir must not have be so rude a to pas without saluting then added with laugh be riding slowly too for cardinal coach be in front of must not have be good manner to have galloped past especially a have duke of orleans with have be far other asked carelessly no great distance little party of pleasure with officer to eat dinner together to celebrate honour have received in being brought into paris officer have worked very hard matter served a good excuse for giving little dinner for next day two everything passed off quietly four of officer reported that when dining at cabaret two three of duke officer have come in entered into conversation with have brought up subject of riding in after cardinal almost looked a if be serving a bodyguard to one of laughed daresay did be answer be rather nuisance must not have be courteous to have ridden past carriage then repeated story a have be arranged although duke of beaufort have be told by of friend that there be rumour abroad of plot against mazarin life that must be best for to leave paris for time refused to do so saying that even if be discovered cardinal must not dare to lay hand on moreover reply have be obtained from hector officer convinced that riding behind mazarin carriage be accident on nd of september duke presented at louvre a usual after speaking with for few minute queen left room with mazarin guibaut captain of guard at once came forward arrested be kept at louvre night next day be taken to castle of vincennes two company of swiss guard marched first followed by royal carriage containing duke guibaut carriage be surrounded by royal musketeer body of light cavalry followed two company of poitou regiment brought up rear thus people of paris be shown that queen have will power to punish fickle population who must day before have shouted in honour of beaufort be delighted at seeing that royal authority be once again paramount in other member of party of importants fled be arrested campion beaupuis others succeeded in making escape from france marquis of chateauneuf governor of touraine be ordered back to province la chatres colonel general be dismissed from post duc de vendome be forced to leave france ambitious bishop of beauvais several other prelate be commanded to return to diocese member of vendome family be exiled to chateau of annette madame de chevreuse de hautefort large number of other member of party be ordered to leave paris thus party of importants ceased to exist people of paris seemed greatly pleased at what appeared to end of trouble exclaimed that richelieu be not dead that have simply changed appearance have become twenty year younger mazarin chose number of soldier belonging to own regiment several officer who belonged to richelieu own guard be at time to follow wherever went selected number of nobleman of distinguished merit influence created five of duke thus secured to party must to extent balance power of adversary also made effort to bring about union between duke of orleans condes failed owing to enormous demand that put forward conde demanded government of languedoc for of burgundy for enghien normandy for duc de longueville entire domain of late brother in law henry of montmorency orleans on part demanded province of champagne three bishopric of metz toul verdun town castle of sedan a demand if granted must have rendered two family powerful mazarin gave up attempt decided that best plan to prevent trouble be to let dangerous family continue to be hostile to other a soon a have finished work of crushing importants mazarin sent for hector now monsieur campbell said have breathing time conspiracy among noble be for time crushed now that see that queen be determined to protect be not afraid of using power committed to hope that will be time before venture to conspire again have further strengthened position by granting honour to many distinguished gentleman who be well inclined towards on whose support in future will be able to rely now be time must turn to man who have probably saved life to whose evidence given before queen in small degree owe that resolved to suppress insolent noble have not hurried in matter since by answer to queen be evident that desired change in position that matter must wait still monsieur offer be to grant honour for service rendered to state matter of service that have rendered to cardinal mazarin be still untouched be something so new to that anyone in france must be so perfectly contented with lot a to refuse such offer a made to by queen feel somewhat at loss what to do can understand young ardent increased rank must have charm for be otherwise must bestow highest rank upon be aware that habit be simple for have made inquiry money in go for little in eye still sir one who have honour of being first minister of france who be also very rich man can not remain with debt of gratitude wholly uncancelled hear from agent in poitou that have voluntarily remitted fine that vassal must pay on occasion of new lord taking possession on account of heavy taxation press so sorely upon honour sir for step have even mentioned to queen a proof of goodness of disposition feel sure that there be nothing must please better than must grant tenant of estate immunity from taxation can not do private interest must give way to necessity of state deplore suffering of cultivator of france suffering have of late driven many to take up arm be duty to repress such rising have ordered utmost leniency to be shown to unfortunate men that troop must not be quartered upon inhabitant that officer will see that there be destruction of house damage to property must increase still further difficulty in paying impost regret to say press so sorely unduly upon tell frankly what be greatest object of ambition thank excellency most heartily for kind intention towards ambition may have have be already much more than gratified have never for moment thought of even wished that might day become lord of fair estate noble of france have not ventured to hope that might become colonel of regiment for fifteen year thing have thanks to kind appreciation of majesty for very simple act of duty fallen to if might ask boon must be that regiment may be sent to join force of marshal turenne so long a there be danger here must not have wished to be removed from position where might be of assistance however slight to queen now that danger be at end must be glad to return to active duty have endeavoured humbly to make marshal turenne model have one thought one desire namely to do duty to make soldier under command contented happy have hope of ever emulating great merit a commander that request be easily granted mazarin said drawing sheet of paper towards wrote regiment of poitou will at once proceed to rhine where will place under order of marshal turenne added signature handed paper to hector that count for nothing said must remember that life be short especially in case of minister of france uncertain in own case might be disabled in field unable to serve further advent of party hostile to in power must doubtless be signalized by act of vengeance against who have be friend estate change hand so frequently in france that la villar might well be confiscated man be above chance of fortune have agent in england have morning given order to intendant to place in hand of monsieur wilson well known citizen of london goldsmith sum of fifty thousand crown to stand in name to be payable to order here be address be small sum for saving of life will place above risk of contingency of fortune in country wish for thanks said with wave of hand a hector be about to speak have given more for most trifling favour now bid adieu doubt not that will hear that regiment have greatly distinguished yourselves in east where hostility will in probability shortly be commenced have better present at levee evening to make adieu to queen hector did early next morning rode with two company to st denis where news that regiment be to march towards rhine be received with great satisfaction be now middle of october when after ten day march regiment reached epernay heard that turenne have withdrawn troop from rhine where imperialist have already gone into winter quarter have stationed in various town of lorraine headquarters be at nancy turenne greeted warmly upon arrival matter have be going on slowly since saw in paris have be too weak to fight bavarian who fortunately be too undecided to attack must have made up mind to throw in fortune with austria might have overrun lorraine for aught must have done to withstand trooper be without horse infantry almost without clothes a court be unable to send remittance have be forced to borrow money upon own estate for public service have mounted five thousand horse enrolled three thousand foot be still sustaining however hear from mazarin that will in week send off large convoy of treasure will be welcome indeed for be nearly at end of resource of troop be quartered in town most part be among mountain where trouble inhabitant le have small temptation towards rioting excess must rather must much rather go into country marshal regiment be in good condition now to stay in quarter in town be bad for discipline so be might make headquarters at village of saline there be other troop within thirty mile of on arriving there will make inquiry a to supply to be obtained within circle of fifteen mile round fortunately have good supply of tent men for whom can not find quarter in village can be placed under canvas can draw a much wine a require for three month ration from store here two month ration of flour will direct intendants to take up cart for transport of supply take from here will doubtless be able to buy meat up there hope that will be able to obtain sufficient flour wine to last till end of winter for transport will be very difficult when snow be on ground firewood soldier will of course cut for in forest winter passed quietly hector managed to obtain quarter for troop village being allotted to company before marched off to various quarter hector urged officer to impress upon men advantage of behaving well to villager of course presence of so many men will be of serious inconvenience to will doubtless make best of if find that be treated civilly that lodger endeavour to give a little trouble a possible see that everything down to smallest article be paid for investigate complaint will punish offender severely have inquired into average price sheep fowl pig goat other article fetch have made out list for company peasant will be gainer by for will be saved journey down to town let be stuck up in conspicuous place in village intendant will go round make contract for supply of meat will see whether will be more advantageous to erect oven for baking of bread in village to arrange to buy ready baked there supplying flour for troop after being accustomed to good bread at st denis will not be content with black bread upon poor people exist will pay visit to company in regular order see that be going on well try men who have misbehaved listen gladly to suggestion that respective captain may make to first company be quartered at saline although cold be severe life rough troop be well contented hector be glad to find that instruction be carried out that excellent relation be maintained between troop host early in spring turenne collected force of three regiment of cavalry two of infantry passing rhine at breisach fell suddenly upon force of imperialist in black forest defeated took three four hundred prisoner among whom be many officer rest of escaping to army commanded by count merci in may bavarian army numbering eight thousand foot seven thousand horse marched to besiege freiburg five league from breisach turenne followed with force now numbered ten thousand men found however that imperialist have occupied strong position in neighbourhood of town not caring to run risk of defeat great loss receiving information that town have already opened negotiation for surrender fell back five mile from town sending news to court that force be insufficient to attack imperialist mazarin thereupon sent order to enghien to set out at once for germany a soon a reached rhine army prepared to cross enghien who have be appointed generalissimo rode forward with marshal de gramont who be in command of army under to camp of turenne meeting between enghien turenne be most cordial enghien have always felt warmest admiration for talent of older marshal have be most intimate with whenever be at court regarded a master in art of war turenne be free from vice of jealousy a army of france be almost always placed under supreme if sometimes nominal command of prince of blood seemed nothing natural to that enghien must receive supreme authority character of two men be in complete contrast with other one be ardent passionate prompt in action swift in execution other though equally brave be prudent careful anxious above thing to accomplish object with smallest possible loss of men while enghien risked life of soldier a recklessly a own always acted together in most perfect harmony friendship remained unimpaired even when in subsequent day stood in arm against other at council turenne be in favour of making circuit taking up post in valley of st pierre by must intercept bavarian communication force by famine to issue out from strong line fight in open urged to attack position so strongly fortified must entail terrible loss even if successful marshal de gramont d'erlac governor of breisach be of same opinion duc d'enghien however be for attacking enemy in intrenchment idea of starving out enemy be altogether repugnant to one of impetuous disposition a generalissimo overruled opinion of others led by turenne reconnoitred position of enemy decided that one army be called army of france consisting of six thousand foot four thousand horse commanded by marshal de gramont must attack enemy position in front on right flank other called army of weimar of five thousand foot a many horse under turenne must move round by narrow pas attack enemy on left flank merci army occupied almost inaccessible hill whose summit be strongly fortified be against de gramont army be to hurl entrance to valley by turenne be to fall upon left flank be closed at mouth by very strong intrenchment be behind that main body of horse be posted to gain point of attack turenne have to make very wide circuit started at break of day on rd of august be arranged that enghien who remained with de gramont must not attack until three hour before sunset in order to give turenne time to attack at same hour at time agreed upon enghien sent forward two battalion to begin attack regiment of conde mazarin be to follow while duke held two others in reserve in order to get at enemy assailant be forced to climb very steep ascent cross vineyard intersected by many wall four foot high facing terrace on vine grew be occupied by bavarian french attacked with such vigour that enemy be driven back when however latter reached great cheval de frise formed by felled tree in front of intrenchment must make further progress so heavy be fire maintained by enemy enghien seeing dismounted placed at head of regiment of conde led forward while marshal gramont officer did same encouraged by example troop be filled with enthusiasm following leader unfalteringly made way through cheval de frise pressing forward without pause obtained possession of intrenchment driving bavarian into wood behind battle have lasted three hour have cost bavarian three thousand men while french suffered at least equally turenne force have be a hotly engaged merci best general in austrian army have foreseen that attempt might be made through defile have posted strong body of infantry among tree on side a soon a turenne entered defile be encountered by heavy fire from unseen foe who falling back through tree a advanced continued to gain strength turenne have to fight foot of way in order to dislodge enemy be not until enghien have brought battle to conclusion on side that turenne arrived forcing intrenchment guarding mouth of defile found in contact with merci who be now able to concentrate whole force against combat be furious one troop be engaged at forty pace apart sometimes have hand to hand encounter merci brought whole of cavalry into play turenne be unable to use a be behind infantry must not make way out through mouth of defile for seven hour battle raged in darkness after losing three thousand men here general merci decided that army must be totally destroyed if enghien must bring troop down from hill at daybreak accordingly leaving body of musketeer to hide movement by fire withdrew rest of army took up strong position partly on height known a black mountain covering entrance of valley of st pierre partly in valley thus covering line of retreat have french be able to attack early next morning before bavarian have time to intrench might have won easy victory for past twenty four hour rain have be falling incessantly turenne army have be marching on previous day have be fighting for seven hour be incapable of further exertion while of enghien be in little better plight having passed night in rain on ground have won after such hard fighting commander agreed that twenty four hour halt be absolutely necessary day must not be termed one of rest for there be thousand of wounded to be collected cared for arm to be cleaned for have be rendered useless by rain provision to be brought up from rear merci made most of time thus given bottom of mountain towards plain be fortified by several row of felled tree portion of infantry be posted between point town of freiburg be mile away intrenchment have be formed during siege of town be occupied by a front be covered by fire of gun from fortress a well a by of infantry on hill considered position to be impregnable therefore placed main body of army at edge of flat top of hill strong body behind wood about halfway up slope cavalry extended from point to wall of city after reconnoitering position enghien determined to make two attack one on trench between foot of hill town other on row of felled tree at foot of mountain false attack be to be made between two point turenne force advanced nearly to foot of hill prince army followed also took up position just a attack be about to be made great tumult be heard on hill enghien turenne rode to neighbouring height in order to ascertain what be going on leaving strict order movement be to be made until return count d'espenan who commanded two advanced regiment of enghien army however ordered detachment to attack redoubt stood within line of attack merci sent support to defender d'espenan sent more troop on side engagement became serious suddenly imperialist artillery opened fire along whole of line enghien troop apparently taking for signal of beginning of battle moved forward for assault without order leader a be broken confused by endeavouring to pas through abattis of felled tree bavarian rushed out drove back with great slaughter enghien turenne galloping up in haste in vain attempted to rally officer men alike be panic stricken two general then rode to turenne army advanced against defence of tree for long time battle raged without marked success on side several time french made way in to intrenchment be a often repulsed merci ordered cavalry to dismount led into fray darkness falling suddenly assailant ceased to attack occupied for night ground on struggle have taken place fight that day have cost two thousand troop bavarian twelve hundred a latter have lost infantry in first day fighting french be still superior in number during night turenne have wounded of nationality carried to breisach after giving army four day rest enghien determined to resort to tactic turenne have from first recommended marching along plain ascended valley of bloterthal made for st pierre where must cut bavarian line of retreat a soon a merci saw movement gave order for army to fall back with haste although turenne pressed hard on rear succeeded in drawing troop off though in order to do so be obliged to abandon baggage cannon altogether lost between eight nine thousand men with artillery most of horse french loss be equally great though battle be claimed a victory by owing to bavarian having finally fallen back be really drawn one chapter xiv just in time regiment of poitou have suffered heavily in battle of freiburg in first advance turenne have placed in rear of infantry must have hector said reserve upon can implicitly rely brought up at right moment might decide fate of battle if be beaten can allow disorganized regiment to pas check pursuit of enemy retire in good order contesting foot of ground until rest of force have emerged from mouth of defile be enabled to form up in sufficient order to withstand effect of enemy cavalry regiment therefore took part in work of clearing defile of enemy infantry for first four hour of battle remained in rear then turenne ordered to front to take place of regiment have already lost strength be no longer capable of resisting continued assault of imperialist turenne rode with hector at head of regiment pushed way through hardly pressed troop in front when faced enemy deployed poured terrible volley into assailant for remaining three hour bore whole brunt of battle standing four deep flank resting upon rising ground on side of mouth of pas two front line alone maintained fire so long a infantry only pressed two line behind being ordered by hector not to fire shot when however bavarian infantry drew aside cavalry thundered down front line fell back through behind latter received cavalry with such terrible volley of musketry that time broke fled turenne after seeing poitou regiment take up post occupied in reforming remains of other regiment raising spirit by warm word of commendation at manner in have fought until assured that in turn must if necessary join first line if be forced to give way when have done rejoined hector who have dismounted moved backwards forward among men seeing that gap caused by enemy fire be constantly filled up encouraging soldier with praise exhortation turenne sat upon horse pace behind rear line when saw bavarian infantry draw aside heard roar of cavalry charge lip tightened half turned horse a if to call up regiment behind when however saw line have hitherto be in rear take up place in front stand there quiet immovable look of irresolution passed from face after bavarian horse have fallen back shattered by volley pressed pace two forward shouted regiment of poitou thank in name of france never saw regiment fight more bravely steadily men responded with loud cheer to praise from one whom respected loved turenne then rode up to hector splendidly done colonel campbell have rather wondered why kept half men idle in such fight now understand why did so have be firing three quarter of musket must have be empty must possibly have be overthrown be stroke of genius may have taught many lesson in war tonight have given one turenne remained with regiment till end of fight marked with approval way in line fought by turn while other remained behind ready to receive charge of cavalry a soon a bavarian drew off saw that wounded be carried to rear where surgeon rendered what aid be possible while rest of troop threw down to snatch few hour sleep when three hour later enghien troop came down from hill have won turenne force marched out from defile turenne mounted horse calling upon hector to follow rode forward with principal officer to meet enghien have be terrible battle prince if loss equal mine victory have indeed be won at terrible cost mine have be heavy too enghien said have gained object not wholly turenne replied for merci have taken up position a strong a from have driven wish must have lent hand in fight enghien said bavarian have fallen back into wood knew not whether still held ground there in rain darkness must have be dangerous to have crossed broken ground with wood ravine troop after exertion heavy march be incapable of such effort indeed have lost fully half infantry cavalry must be useless for such work must indeed have be sorely pressed having merci whole force to contend with still have doubt even if must not issue from defile must be able to check enemy then general in turn repeated detail of battle in have be engaged loss have suffered turenne then introduced principal officer to enghien when have done so called up hector need not introduce officer to prince said indeed enghien replied holding out hand have good reason to recollect colonel campbell have heard marshal what good service rendered at rocroi have rendered one le night turenne said never saw regiment stand more steadily than one command have trained to what seems to perfection for last three hour regiment alone bore brunt of battle although assailed alternately by infantry cavalry thus afforded time to reform regiment fought earlier in afternoon to give hope that even be enemy to overcome resistance of men must still be able to check further advance then told manner in hector have arranged fought troop good device indeed enghien said warmly methinks worthy of adoption whenever infantry have to meet other infantry cavalry for musket take so long to reload that there might not be dozen men ready to give fire when cavalry charge be that one of many lesson that tell have given indeed have not so far a be aware ever be tried before part of regiment be often held in reserve to reinforce comrade if necessary method whereby regiment be able at moment notice to meet cavalry with musket loaded be methinks entirely new in such case a present very valuable in second day fighting turenne army have taken small share for during retreat of bavarian cavalry alone have come into play bavarian having retreated into wurtemberg council of war be held to decide in what manner greatest advantage must be gained during absence most of chief officer be in favour of retaking freiburg turenne be of different opinion represented that siege must occupy considerable time that if successful must at end of campaign have simply retaken town be when began must therefore point to advantage gained by effort by loss of so many men advised therefore that a bavarian army be now sixty mile away must not very well return a must need large reinforcement fresh cannon baggage wagon must take opportunity of making master of whole course of rhine even of palatinate duc d'enghien declared for plan turenne went at once to breisach arranged for transport by boat down rhine of necessary for siege of philippsburg army started on th of august part of turenne army being detached to capture small town castle on rd of august philippsburg be invested by turenne enghien force arriving on following day philippsburg stood on rhine at point formed sharp elbow land being low many morass surrounded town approach therefore be exceedingly difficult eight hundred pace from town stood square fort commanded river be connected with town by causeway town have seven bastion round ran very thick hedge moat be wide full of water garrison be weak one not exceeding thousand men have hundred piece of cannon large store of ammunition feeling that must not hold fort so far from town commander withdrew garrison from turenne seized placed strong force there enghien then threw up strong line in semicircle round town to protect army in case large force of enemy must endeavour to relieve occupied four day in meantime boat have arrived with cannon ammunition provision bridge be thrown across river in twenty four hour force be sent over attacked captured germersheim then marched to spire at once opened gate on th of august in meantime siege of philippsburg be begun in approach must only be carried on in one place where ground be sandy continued so up to two of bastion of town turenne commanded attack against right bastion de gramont on left first diverted brook running through plain be enabled to use channel a approach thus advancing fifteen hundred pace nearer to town then formed intrenchment must be used by column from on st of september began to open trench against respective bastion de gramont work be attacked on following day by sortie however be driven back on fifth night column made lodgment on counterscarp battery opened fire after day work filled up ditch seeing that force be too weak to oppose so strong attack commander surrendered on th of september although merci be advancing with army enghien continued project have be formed remaining with own troop to protect philippsburg sent turenne with horse five hundred foot to worm threw open gate oppenheim surrendered without resistance arrived in front of mayence garrison be very small upon threat of turenne that must attack on side citizen sent deputation offering to capitulate turenne sent word of to enghien who rode there at once received surrender of town bingen capitulated landor mannheim neustadt several other place be taken thus from strasburg to point near coblenz whole course of rhine palatine country between rhine moselle fell into hand of french enghien returned to pas winter in paris greater part of army be recalled turenne be left with few regiment to hold newly acquired territory do wish for leave campbell turenne asked hector have few day in new lordship have right to spend at least portion of winter there thank marshal have idea of leaving have be good enough to say that will fill up gap in regiment by embodying in remains of regiment of ardennes will bring up to nearly former strength certainly must not like to be away while work of fusion be being carried out new men must be divided equally among company officer so arranged that one of now appointed will be attached to company with two of own then must see that so work together a to arrive at same standard a before must have wished that if possible captain of ardennes regiment must be appointed to new regiment that be about to form that place of who fell in action must be filled from list of lieutenant certainly lost five captain did not yes sir if send name of five senior lieutenant will promote at once thank marshal will make lieutenant captain lost five of three second lieutenant then will require thirteen more officer looked at list there be eight belonging to ardennes rest will draw from other regiment there be little fear of objecting to exchange for corp won reputation that will be glad to join will send back to nancy there be barrack there other troop a be not likely to be disturbed until spring will have plenty of time to bring regiment up to former mark winter indeed passed quietly officer be greatly pleased when heard arrangement hector have made by most of obtained step in rank instead of being a have feared passed over by officer belonging to ardennes regiment battle of freiburg have shown great advantage have be gained by steadiness discipline of men took up work of drilling again with even more zeal than before be not long before regiment be restored to former state of efficiency reason why have sent regiment back from rhine be explained by turenne to hector before started order from court be said be to retain only weimar regiment must have be obliged to send back with of enghien have not represented to that might be of greatest importance to to have even one good french regiment within call talked over at length finally agreed to take upon responsibility of ordering that regiment must not go beyond nancy upon ground that there be very few troop in lorraine peasant rising have taken place there a in other department owing to terrible distress caused by heavy taxation have handed to paper authorizing to take such step a may think fit a soon a receive news of such rising to aid civil authority if must take place at point within reasonable reach regiment stationed at metz will naturally maintain order north of pont mousson while will send detachment to point south east of nancy will understand that be not to move troop on strength of mere rumour only when request for aid be sent by local authority indeed during winter of a in preceding trouble broke out in many part of france in rising of barefooted one a be called became for time very formidable rage of unhappy peasantry be principally directed a during jacquerie against noble chateau be sacked burned within killed

lesson have be severe one indeed upwards of two hundred eighty being killed in two encounter insurgent be completely disheartened by loss during rest of winter aid of troop be not again called for a soon a spring set in poitou regiment marched to join marshal bavarian army have be weakened by withdrawal of four thousand men to aid imperialist who have be defeated by swede in bohemia turenne on hearing news at once prepared to take advantage of crossed rhine on bridge of boat at spire passed neckar general merci retiring before stuttgart opened gate turenne established at marienthal on river tauber merci a fell back have caused rumour to be spread that be making for danube there be great scarcity of forage in country round marienthal officer of cavalry strongly urged upon turenne that must divide take up station at various point where must obtain food for animal be much exhausted by long heavy march turenne for time resisted entreaty at last seeing that cavalry must speedily be ruined unless must obtain food permitted course to be taken before allowing to leave however sent party of horse forward in various direction to discover what enemy be doing returned with news that bavarian army have broken up be fortifying in town among have be divided turenne however be still apprehensive kept cannon greater part of infantry with also general rosen with portion of horse refused to let rest of cavalry go farther than three league from army rode out with regiment of cavalry ten mile beyond marienthal along road by imperialist must advance be to assemble to attack at two o'clock next morning party have sent to watch bavarian brought in news that merci be advancing with force rosen be ordered to hurry forward to spot where advanced division be lying messenger be sent off in direction to recall scattered cavalry having seen that everything have be done to place affair in better position turenne rode off with what troop must gather to aid rosen latter have made serious blunder in front of position held by advanced division be large wood through bavarian must pas instead of taking possession of holding until reinforcement came up fell back drew up troop on plain allowed bavarian to occupy wood without resistance with troop arrived with marshal have now under three thousand infantry seven regiment of horse placed infantry on right with two squadron to support with rest of cavalry formed left wing took command here rosen commanded on right merci after passing through wood drew up army in order of battle opened fire on french artillery however in way shook firmness seeing more troop in distance advancing to reinforce merci began battle by attack on little wood on french right rested while at same time turenne charged bavarian right wing with cavalry broke up captured cannon twelve standard while on side victory be almost won on other side disaster have befallen french infantry perceiving that bavarian who be advancing to attack be much superior in force be seized with panic scattered in direction left wing of bavarian advanced rapidly throwing behind turenne wing prepared to fall upon in rear turenne ordered cavalry to retire passing through wood found beyond three regiment have just arrived with fifteen hundred horse have be with in battle placed in position to make vigorous defence bavarian did not venture to attack now sent officer to rally scattered infantry gave order that must at once retreat without stop to philippsburg distance of seventy mile with cavalry started for hesse whose landgravine be in alliance with france with two regiment covered retreat so enabled rest of cavalry a came up from distant quarter to cross tauber be bold successful movement for have fallen back with infantry to philippsburg enemy must have possessed of town have captured whereas must not now advance without exposing line of communication to attack poitou regiment have when turenne advanced to marienthal be left at town four league away messenger reached hector from turenne with note scribbled in pencil have be beaten infantry behaved shamefully be hastening crowd of straggler towards philippsburg will retire along tauber with cavalry make for hesse do march with speed for river if a approach river hear that have already passed do direct march to hesse leave choice of route to must be guided by circumstance at rate be unlikely to be attacked except by cavalry if not in too great number may be trusted to beat off ten minute after receipt of order regiment be on march arrived on tauber just in time for quarter of hour after have piled arm after tremendous march cavalry came along be in scattered party for road be terribly bad be obliged to break up make way a best must by mere track across rocky hilly country turenne when arrived have twenty horseman with hardly expected to be up in time campbell said a dismounted men must have marched well indeed a see though unbeaten for on side defeated enemy horse be a much dispersed a if have suffered disaster be trying to cover retreat with two regiment of cavalry be not engaged in battle hour since charged drove back in confusion party of bavarian horse formed up again main body be ahead be a scattered a be for besides difficulty of keeping together on horrible road be necessary that must occupy track by enemy horse must move might get in front of play havoc with will have to march night must advise to break up command into half company with order to to attach a far a possible to such party of two regiment of cavalry a may come across will not proceed at great pace a must give time for troop ahead of to get clear horse be utterly worn out being half starved fatigued with march so far know not whether whole of bavarian cavalry be behind be probable that one of two division be pursuing infantry wish have be there with in first place example must have prevented breaking in second must have covered retreat a be fear that few of three thousand who be with will reach philippsburg will be glad if yourself will remain near if regiment be going to keep together must not take from being broken up into fragment must exercise supervision over in darkness hector at once called officer together gave necessary order understand said that main object be not so much to save yourselves though be most important to enable cavalry to beat back bavarian horse be terrible march horse foot made way along with difficulty through darkness men horse be alike fatigued cavalry for most part dismounted led animal along there be several sharp fight with body of enemy who ignorant of line by french be retreating feared to press rearguard too close lest must find in very superior number once when passed lane running down to river turenne who have taken opportunity of making way across line of retreat seeing how be going on said to hector will ride up here campbell cheer up party may come across tell that be going on well that by morning will find that enemy have given up pursuit will be able to halt take few hour rest give battle must enemy come up in force horse must be a fatigued a ours for must have be marching for eight ten hour since morning hector have only paolo now with having appointed four trooper to go with different party of infantry to act a orderly to captain rode rapidly up lane presently heard cavalry passing across there be one party paolo said urging horse into gallop in two three minute came up with column of horse where be officer asked drawing rein a reached seize voice cried in german before paolo must turn horse dozen trooper be upon surrender cried in german seeing resistance be impossible who be monsieur officer demanded be colonel of poitou regiment of infantry said man be lackey where be cavalry sir can not tell exactly seeing that one know thought that formed part of rearguard how come that infantry officer be there heard that there be infantry with joined just before nightfall be at once divided up among various regiment of horse must inform colonel of come along with pushed past trooper until arrived at head of column when officer reported to colonel donner blitzen latter exclaimed be well that learned news for must have fared very ill if have come upon horse foot together poitou regiment be one heard beat back charge so often at freiburg say best regiment in french service be use going farther might well fall into ambush in lane must shoot down helplessly will move on quietly until get to place where there be space enough for to dismount bivouac must not have gone many more mile for if did must be regiment without horse tomorrow morning proceeded very slowly cautiously until when came upon open tract of ground colonel ordered to dismount sound trumpet regiment like of turenne have be broken up have squadron with in hour whole regiment be assembled few fire be lighted most of men threw down by horse at once went off to sleep colonel officer sat down at one of fire where hector be requested to join suppose that regiment took part in battle sir be way from marienthal received order only after day be lost to join marshal turenne cavalry on tauber arrived on river just at sunset having marched ten league in eight hour regret bitterly that regiment be not on field for assuredly must not have given way have stood rest of infantry must have stood in case must now be pursuer colonel broke in for turenne completely shattered right wing well sir be fortune of war at least have honour of having given marshal defeat be grand general caught napping today be not fault sir general rosen officer insisted so strongly that unless be allowed to move off in search of forage whole army must be disabled by loss of horse by hunger that be almost forced to comply with request even so made mistake colonel said if instead of marching to meet in front of marienthal have fallen back directly have news of coming must have be joined by detached troop before came up with said a much to tonight hector replied even greatest general be liable to make mistake sometimes indeed have general rosen with advanced division held wood in front of instead of retiring on to plain must have be able to keep at bay until troop came up undoubtedly that be terrible blunder on part colonel said rather than turenne be to blame now sir may ask how be that who can not be more than twenty come to be colonel in command of regiment have be five year officer be fortunate on two occasion to obtain approval once of monsieur de turenne once of duc d'enghien congratulate sir be seldom indeed that so young officer have opportunity of distinguishing have seen well nigh thirty year service before came to command regiment now sir will give parole not to attempt to escape certainly sir hector replied promptly knew must refuse four five trooper must be set to watch even if evaded be well nigh impossible might be recaptured on following morning a detachment of bavarian horse must be sure to be pressing hard upon turenne troop pursuit be indeed taken up again during night turenne succeeded in keeping pursuer at bay reaching frontier of hesse there found infantry cavalry who have not be engaged already assembled for have received order to march instantly to spot have now with four thousand horse two thousand foot be joined by six thousand troop from hesse four thousand swede be thus soon in position to advance with much stronger force than commanded before battle of marienthal bavarian cavalry have followed rejoined general merci at kirchheim hector be with paolo taken to place upon refusal to continue parole be confined in prison there paolo being allowed at request to remain with have have interview with general merci who have treated with much courtesy for there be scotch irish officer serving in imperial army a well a in of france be held in high esteem for courage daring battle of marienthal be fought on nd of may be late in july before fresh movement took place turenne must willingly have advanced with army movement be arrested by peremptory order from paris sent on receipt of news of defeat that be not to take offensive until joined by enghien who have with force of eight thousand men therefore marched to join reinforcement two army met at spire on nd of july a before enghien be in supreme command with de gramont a lieutenant general long conference took place between general turenne general geis who commanded hessian konigsmark who commanded swede bavarian be known to be very strongly posted to have be reinforced by four thousand imperialist under command of general geis there be much difference of opinion between a to best course to be pursued enghien who be always in favour of great battle finally determined so to place army that enemy must be forced to come out fight therefore marched to venecher captured wimpfen threw bridge across river whereupon general merci fell back twenty league into franconia a soon a have passed river occurrence took place threatened to overthrow plan of campaign hasty word spoken by enghien so angered general geis konigsmark that determined to retire at once with swede hessian turenne be requested by enghien to endeavour to arrange matter by kind gentle manner succeeded in conciliating geis who consented to remain with hessian konigsmark however a hot tempered a enghien refused to do so with whole force retired to bremen in lower saxony french hessian marched towards tauber captured rothenburg other town thereby obtained large quantity of provision store hearing that bavarian be advancing to nordlingen marched in haste to give battle there chapter xvi escape after being confined for week in prison at kirchheim hector be sent with number of other prisoner to ingolstadt here be confined in castle separate room being allotted to in recognition of rank paolo be at request allowed to remain with can not think master that must have done better if have given parole not to try to escape in case might have have comfortable quarter in town instead of bare chamber if there have be chance of escape must have be different seeing strength of castle methinks there be prospect whatever of being able to get out remains to be seen paolo fancy there be always chance of escape if one doe hit upon right way at present know nothing of castle vigilance of guard doubt will take little time to find matter out first thing require be patience doubt will allow out to take exercise like enough if give word that will return day at certain hour will allow to go in to town seeing that can scarcely be called prisoner having military rank position being in eye only lackey if will do that will be great step gained for will be able to bring in anything that may require however will not ask that must be permitted to go in out for little time lose opportunity of making friendly with of soldier if chance must occur be useful to of officer commandant be evidently disposed to be civil say that will grant indulgence in power short of passing gate of castle have doubt that when campaign be over army have gone into winter quarter turenne will offer to exchange prisoner of same rank for have wish to be cooped up here when perhaps great battle may be fought a far a can see difficulty will not be so much in getting out of castle out of town for be one of most strongly fortified place in empire one reason why want to go into town be that may be able to obtain shelter there for must find a expect will that be impossible for to escape from citadel town at same attempt place be indeed so strong that careless watch be kept over prisoner in castle soldier be confined to quarter save that be allowed for hour day to take exercise in courtyard company of troop being kept under arm while be out officer be free at time to wander about hector be soon on friendly term with many of officer of garrison a in case there be none of hostile feeling with french officer be regarded youth singularity of having so soon attained rank of colonel also predisposed in favour be evident that young soldier of fortune unsupported by powerful family interest must have distinguished in altogether exceptional manner to have obtained command of one of best regiment of france paolo be a popular among sergeant men a master be with officer a italian a hector lackey be not regarded a prisoner of war by unfailing good humour readiness to enter into fun might be going on to lend hand in cleaning accoutrement completing job that soldier have left unfinished when turn came for duty became quite popular character colonel who commanded frequently walked with hector in courtyard sent dish from own table more than once invited to dine with a be very curious to learn how young prisoner have so early attained rank hector one evening gave sketch of career from time when turenne gave commission to at be taken prisoner omitting only incident of attempt to assassinate mazarin have certainly be fortunate said be equally certain that have deserved fact that in addition to military duty have learned italian german besides transforming newly raised regiment into one of best in french service show how assiduous have be in work trust when campaign be over may be exchanged think be foolish of not to give parole for must know well that have chance of escape from here say everything come to who wait colonel hector laughed if see chance will certainly avail of even if such chance come will still be gainer by not giving parole be exceedingly comfortable a be can wish for nothing better one drawback be have nothing to do except perhaps to improve german must be just same if be living in town if be on parole must lose amusement of planning method for escape do unceasingly up till now may tell in confidence be a far from having hit upon plan a be when entered by way colonel although be clear that can not be allowed to go outside castle gate must be glad if lackey must be given leave to do so be not soldier be frenchman can scarce be counted a prisoner of war be willing cheerful fellow must enjoy run in city much more than must besides occasionally may want book other little thing can not get here such a file rope disguise colonel campbell commandant laughed be not thinking of at present hector said smiling besides can give order that can always be strictly searched when come in colonel shook head will tell will do said will let have pas to go in out at will if will give promise on honour a soldier that will not bring in anything can be used by for facilitating escape must much rather trust to word than to search soldier might make a man come in thank colonel hector said cheerfully though at heart felt considerably disappointed give word of honour that will bring in nothing may aid in making escape be much obliged to for letting have run of town colonel at once wrote pas authorizing paolo monti lackey to colonel campbell to enter leave castle at time when gate be open paolo laughed when hector told condition on pas be granted commandant be shrewd fellow master be not quite shrewd enough forgot that though may bring in nothing may be able to arrange with someone else to bring something in flashed through mind at once paolo at present file rope disguise must be of use however may be so later first thing for to do when get pas will be to make master of plan of town fortification see if there be place where think escape be possible even when find one think that might be managed must afterwards find place where can be hidden for time at rate for few hour see be to go out in disguise must do so in broad daylight for supper be served almost directly after gate be closed be missing there must be search for at once sentry on wall must all be warned must be impossible to get past if must get out two three hour before gate be closed at nine o'clock might a soon a became dark attempt to get over wall before alarm be given might possibly go out in same disguise left here in through city gate across bridge see that sir seems to that must be easier than trying to find hiding place for in town however will set wit to work have be able to think of nothing in here one eye always help one wit if be in town might see something must give idea how matter might be set about day after day paolo went into town always returning discouraged must be growing downright numbskull said one evening in disgust have be three week at single idea have come to need not be discouraged at paolo be not such simple thing to plan escape from fortress like a be to get into citadel at turin where also have advantage of starting with disguise can no more think of disguise in can pas gate than can be good deal too tall to pas a woman face be perfectly well known to soldier in castle even if hit upon disguise must be very difficult to get brought in struck today that if be to get out must be in vehicle have come in with supply be great idea master if have not be thick headed fool must have thought of before at same time will not be easy to manage quite see that paolo even if driver be bought over must be difficult indeed to manage to get into cart with so many soldier standing about paolo shook head yes see that must be managed at master stood thinking minute have exclaimed joyfully know sir sometimes train of waggon containing faggot flour other thing come in late be unloaded before gate be closed go out at once others be unloaded that evening empty cart have to remain in castle till morning a great gate be never opened between sunset sunrise though officer come in by postern now if must manage during night to slip into one of waggon say one have brought in flour might be so covered over by empty sack take out that one must dream anyone be hidden there capital paolo be evident that head be not so thick a thought be just now yes have noticed that a rule if eight ten waggon came in together full sack be carried in same number of empty one be placed in one of cart being counted a be put in certainly must hide easily enough if be there to assist in arranging sack a regularly a before over a generally get up until eight o'clock first meal be not brought to till nine might be on way two hour before be discovered that be missing how must manage must get countryman suit master must go out soon after gate be open find quiet spot where must have hidden clothes day before slip on over own then must join cart a came along generally begin to harness horse up till gate be open so must get quarter of hour start of must go out with without question a must be thought that belonged to party must pay for beer at first cabaret come to make sign wanted lift in waggon must of course pretend to be deaf dumb a although have picked up little german since came into part must not possibly pas a countryman must be better still paolo for to put blister on to cheek then before join put great lump of tow into mouth so a to swell cheek out almost to bursting point then tie bandage round face must then by pointing to make out that have so terrible swelling that be unable to talk must be better certainly master indeed must be capital plan of course must get into waggon in be gradually shift sack so that must crawl out when smuggled in must try put in with couple of brace of pistol if be armed with carter must not venture to interfere with of course master must have to get disguise for must never be tramping across country with dressed a french officer get something must put over clothes wear long frock loose breech rough cloth to wrap round leg below of course pair of countryman shoe best plan must be for to stand treat again at cabaret few mile out of town get in there then must slip out of waggon throw sack back into place of course must choose spot where cabaret stand alone be at end of village so that there may be one standing by must when got down walk quietly back along road can make sign to that live hard by must leave there then if there must be suspicion have escaped in waggon troop of cavalry be sent in pursuit men must be able to declare that have seen nothing of so must give clue must set on track well be quite settled that will try way may be time before opportunity occurs however may a well get two disguise two brace of pistol stow away somewhere where be not likely to be found there be plenty of place where one can do master there be row of old tree inside fortification warrant that if can not find one with hollow large enough to stow away in can hide in branch with small chance of ever being seen month passed paolo made point of occasionally going out soon after gate be open saying casually that master have fancy for bottle of better wine with breakfast that be going to get egg to make omelette for hector be in particular hurry for news have come that turenne with own troop of hesse have with swede marched away for rhine be rumoured that must be joined by army for in other way must imperialist account for turenne having retired when have force at least equal to merci must set in field against hector saw that at rate there be chance of great battle being fought just then felt therefore impatience to be off two three time cart with faggot have be unloaded after gate be closed a took nothing out be impossible for to conceal in at last to satisfaction number of waggon of flour came in late one afternoon determined to carry plan into execution night storehouse be not in great court in smaller one off beyond two soldier at gate sentry at commandant door guard be kept in courtyard though few sentry be placed upon wall hector have supper a usual paolo brought in news eight of waggon have not be unloaded in time to go out fatigue party of soldier be now completing work must be finished about nine o'clock taking off boot little after hour went quietly downstairs then put on again boldly crossed courtyard for night be so dark that there be fear of figure being perceived a entered inner yard again took off boot walked up to cart in two of carter be fast asleep passed on quietly feeling in cart for sack be delighted to find that be placed in one farthest up yard must therefore be last to go out be tidily piled in line side by side at forward end of waggon cautiously removed sack of middle line hector lay down foot foremost paolo laid sack regularly over till reached level of others dozen be doubled packed neatly in at end so a to conceal head prevent being noticed that have be taken out rest be distributed evenly so that sack be a level a before one must have suspected that have be disturbed paolo then returned to hector room a double sack closing orifice at head have not be packed very tightly enough air entered for hector to breathe increased opening somewhat by pressing one of sack little aside left so that must readily pull into position in morning a soon a paolo reached room applied blistering plaster to cheek kept on till must no longer bear pain then threw down on pallet master slept much hector being kept awake by heat discomfort of position paolo by smarting of cheek a soon a be light latter rose sat impatiently waiting for time when gate must open looking into courtyard must see troop coming out from quarter moving about then gate opened tying bandage over cheek went down crossed yard be out early sergeant of guard remarked nodded be nigh mad with pain said pointing to cheek be going to get salve from apothecary seem to be bad indeed sergeant said commiseratingly 't be terrible inflammation paolo went down to spot where have hidden bundle in hollow of tree be unfrequented place slipping disguise over clothes after putting pistol in belt took second bundle returned to street through waggon leaving castle must pas few minute later saw coming along have already stuffed cheek full of tow several people struck with raw swollen appearance of face have compassionately asked be matter have simply shaken head opened lip pointed to clenched teeth signifying that must not speak fell in with waggon a came along passed through gate without question when short distance away from town made sign to driver of last waggon that if must give lift in cart must pay for drink carter nodded told to climb up after have gone four mile from town came to wayside inn now be time master be going in to get drink there be one about waggon stopped there for there have be opportunity for driver to obtain refreshment a passed through town therefore sauntered into inn salutation to host showing that be accustomed to stop there paolo followed in putting down money for large jug of beer handed to carter shaking by hand made motion that be going farther then went back to end waggon hector have already pushed out bag in front of have with great difficulty crawled out be all right master have good ten minute there be one about have better keep below waggon rail until have got disguise on couple of minute sufficed for then hector leapt to ground while paolo replaced sack in position then together hurried across twenty yard of broken ground entered wood be capitally managed business paolo now have to find way across country can not keep by river for turn away to south must take far from point want to reach at rate for day two must travel at night after think can venture boldly along for be not likely that news that prisoner have escaped will travel very far although doubt strict search will be kept up for day two think that for today have better make way north keeping in wood a much a possible be le likely to search for in direction than to west found that forest be fully two league across agreed that be unlikely in extreme that attempt must be made to search so extensive area where two men must anywhere conceal paolo have on previous afternoon placed couple of loaf cold meat in bundle now sat down by little stream ate hearty meal then crawling into thick growth of underwood lay down to sleep did not awaken until sun be setting there must be country track through forest paolo can not do better than keep along edge of stream until come to one then follow be sure sooner later to take to small hamlet can go into cabaret get couple of flask of wine buy enough bread to last until tomorrow perhaps sausage be not likely to have other meat in place of sort german be good enough to pas muster even if sound strange to ear will merely suppose have come from different part of country for dialect differ greatly from other a soon a became quite dark found impossible to follow rough ground after one two fall have to stop hector said wo do will twist ankle break bone if go on will light fire master have brought flint steel with for knew that must want be better to run risk there may be road near for aught know if anyone passing saw fire among tree might come to see who have made not master there be too many robber about deserter from army men who have be ruined by war may be sure that if belated villager have courage to go through forest by night must on seeing fire hurry on a fast a leg must carry well doubt be right paolo though night be warm enough air be damp under thick covering of leaf will certainly be more cheerful will go short distance among tree before light feeling way for be pitch dark in forest went on until hector stumbled over fallen trunk be best place for halt said for here be wood ready to hand tree have be lying here for year can feel that be quite rotten paolo set to work took handful two of crumbling wood broke up into dust then struck spark on to tinder touched with slow match inserted into little pile of wood minute blowing flame sprang up drew out slow match putting foot upon placed in wallet then broke off more wood soon have blazing fire have enough food left for supper master if spit of cold meat on ramrod of one of pistol hold over fire will be more tasty wish have flask of wine that be speaking of seems to that after sleeping for ten hour will find hard to go off again for time even though neither of got sleep last night how furious governor will be when find that have escaped be good fellow hector said save that will be annoyed because will be blamed for escape think will be sorry have got off left note for on table saying be about to make escape that on honour have not obtained anything must aid by assistance that have never brought anything into castle save what showed on entering to guard must not like to think for moment have broken promise taken advantage of kindness how doe face feel be mightily sore doe not smart a did at first can tell be very glad when be able to slip great lump of tow out of mouth a soon a entered forest think in future that need use so large wad paolo half size will be ample of course need only slip into mouth when be going through village meet party likely to question a to cheek will be day before fiery mark disappears talked until nearly midnight then lay down slept till four by time day have broken for be now first week in july after walking for hour along edge of wood came to track issuing out of followed in about two hour saw village in front of will go in buy thing that want paolo do make circuit round if news have reached of escape will have be told to look for two men entry of single countryman will excite suspicion for of course one will know what disguise have chosen be anxious if come along for hour will be more natural must call for bread cheese beer eat there then can say carelessly may a well take with to eat later on be early owner of cabaret said a hector entered ought to have be earlier replied in grumbling voice be so late before reached other side of forest that instead of passing through thought best to wait till daybreak for must be desperately dark under tree sometimes there be pretty rough fellow to be met with there so slept in shed until hour before daybreak then started lost time in getting through can tell what can give now usual thing man said shrugging shoulder bread beer black sausage might be worse hector said a seated food be soon placed before ate hearty meal have long way to go said when have finished a be blessed with good appetite will not be long before be hungry again suppose there be one in village sell bread sausage so if will let will buy whole one from couple of loaf will sell to willingly enough will come to village three mile on sha' be hungry enough by time hector laughed besides like to choose own place time sit down by wayside eat meal one need never go very far without coming upon stream though like beer better than water can put up with when there be nothing stronger to be have nothing bread sausage again paolo hector said a joined comrade quarter of mile beyond village good enough too for hungry man have often longed for such meal in day before took in spite of warning have often done better since paolo when have be on march will start on now wait until get to stream will hold on for bit master black bread be so hard that need lot of washing down making several detour to avoid village walked day towards evening came upon main road running west unless be mistaken in line have taken must be road through eichstadt can see tower ahead have doubt that be of town there be bridge there across altmuhl river make loop at point road cut across to northwest to gunzenhausen where there be bridge from there road run to hall thence can cross neckar at heilbronn neckarsulm be then in own country short distance from spire philippsburg where will be likely enough to meet turenne advancing again will at rate learn where be will lie up now not cross bridge until get dusk wish have sword master yes must not suit disguise when get into town will buy two woodman ax couple of long knife that peasant here carry fancy from what heard when be at hall with turenne that country between eichstadt there be for most part great forest there be rough hill to pas before get to hall will be just a well to have weapon that can use with effect if must come upon band of robber quite so master good axe be a good a sword in rough sort of fight be there not way can travel so a to avoid great forest that speak of not without making great detour that through country where there will be body of merci troop quartered everywhere very well master then think that risk will be le with robber especially a have not apparently much worth stealing upon not only apparently really paolo fortunately purse be pretty well filled when be taken prisoner spent good deal at ingoldstadt principally in buying article must have done without got in order to give excuse for going into town in disguise pistol however will not hope require much more outlay after getting ax knife will have enough to pay for food such a be for time however there be certainly nothing in pocket to tempt robber master if searched must notice clothes must show at once that be person of quality although a left scarf behind might not know that be officer must see that there be mystery about be true think that perhaps must be a well if of be to take off own clothes when get beyond town tonight go on only in got for when rejoin friend can get money replace have money with master paolo said have have occasion to spend aught for long time have changed wage a paid into gold have forty pistoles sewn up in waistbelt of breech heard say that be always good thing to carry certain amount about with one in case of being taken prisoner laid up wounded be wise precaution paolo just at present moment must rather that did not have about however suppose will be interfered with may a well continue to wear breech under have outside leave doublet when change after if be to be searched pistoles must show that be not what seem unless must make up plausible tale a to how came possessed of oh must manage easily enough master there be other way of getting pistoles than by earning thus chatting have crossed bridge be now entering eichstadt going to quiet cabaret ate hearty meal hector afterwards bought ax knife left town just before gate be closed have walked mile when thunderstorm have for time be threatening broke over must get shelter if can hector said see light on ahead let push on take refuge before be wet to skin on reaching house saw that be wayside inn be in luck paolo hector said a lifted latch door however be fastened on knocking voice asked who be there at time of night traveller hector replied come open door quickly will be wet to skin emphasized word by kicking at door be however minute two before be opened hector who be becoming furious at delay have just taken axe from belt be about to break door in when opened man with torch in one hand sword in other stood on threshold chapter xvii robber den what mean by knocking thus furiously landlord of little inn asked angrily what mean by keeping door shut in face of traveller on night a hector replied even more loudly be honest men to be kept waiting in rain while be taking step to let in how must tell that be honest men landlord retorted because if have not be honest men must long before have battered door down a indeed be just going to do when opened well come in landlord said with evil smile maybe must have done better to have passed on showed into taproom where two three rough men be sitting what did fellow mean by knocking so loudly one of asked angrily mean hector replied that traveller have right to claim shelter of inn indeed inn inn one must refuse shelter to traveller on night a be going to be word be emphasized by crash of thunder overhead crow pretty loud young fellow man growled speak loud because have right on side desire to quarrel with man one need indeed be saint to keep one temper when one be kept standing outside door with rain coming down in great drop threatening in minute to come in bucketful be worse when a see one have sick comrade with one man spoke in low voice to three others seated at table with may ask whither be journeying when thus caught in storm asked

after eight o'clock approached town be now greatly fatigued for have done two long day march without sleep between turning off from road made way to little clump of tree there threw down in shade slept until late in afternoon think that after experience of last night paolo hector said a walked towards town have better wait until can join party going to hall before leave place from what hear road be great deal more infested with band of lawless men than along have come then master think have certainly better wait for want anything worse than have yesterday went to small inn have supper then lay down on straw in outhouse slept soundly until morning then breakfasted a there be one else in room paolo be able to eat freely presently landlord came in hector entered into conversation with want to go on to hall said have friend there be obliged to leave home because must be taken for army well think that will find better off at hall than here be catching up ablebodied young fellow putting into rank a look strong active except for comrade face be likely to be seized a soon a enter hall especially if have paper to show be not thinking of entering hall landlord friend live few

there waggon in town country round have be fetched in to carry store baggage convoy of ammunition must say that must not do better than go on with waggon one be likely to ask question for will be

that french be marching upon heilbronn that general merci be concentrating army there to oppose passage of river that troop be to push on with speed leaving baggage train at hall hector at once decided that with bavarian army gathering in front must be madness to endeavour to push on that indeed must be far better to fall back until direction of french march be fully determined when must make detour come down upon flank without having to pas through bavarian army did not however care about remaining in hall might be occupied by bavarian if fell back therefore after entering town with waggon purchased store of provision going out again established in small farmhouse whose occupant have deserted fled into town upon hearing that french be thirty mile distant day hector went into place to gather news learned that wimpfen have be captured by french by sudden assault that have crossed neckar on returning at once started with paolo on approaching neckar learned that french have

in strength first question on entering camp be a to quarter of own regiment at once rode there a soon a be recognized men ran to cheering wildly so great be tumult that turenne whose headquarters be short distance away rode to spot to enquire cause of tumult when saw hector surrounded by cheering soldier passed through crowd reaching shook warmly by hand have hoped that might have made exchange for during winter colonel have not thought possible must see again before time for in first place captured prisoner in campaign on contrary have have many of own officer taken in second place have be too busy ever since marienthal to enter into negotiation have suppose given slip varlet of yours for see over there yes marshal have very great difficulty in getting away have be very well treated until heard that be again taking offensive have reason to fret over imprisonment well have joined just in time for at moment may fight great battle when have leisure evening come over to tent will be glad to hear how managed to escape news have gained a to merci force intention a soon a marshal have ridden off officer pressed round before speaking to individually hector said few word to men thanking for greeting have given saying that be glad indeed to be back among then talked for time to officer two three of whom after saying few word apart to captain de thiou have hurried away hour later de thiou said have doubt that will be glad of supper colonel ours be just prepared hope that will join be hungry de thiou now come to think of for except crust of bread morning have not touched anything today be fortunate that be better off than usual de thiou said have luck to buy pig from one of weimar trooper cavalry get best of for though there be order against pillaging there be doubt that good deal of go on marching a have be there be one to see that order be strictly carried out however have benefited by afternoon accompanying de thiou hector be surprised to find at short distance in front of spot where regiment be bivouacked large arbour have be erected did not notice a rode in said be not even thought of then colonel be begun few minute after rode up men have worked right willingly fortunately there be copse hard by may say that be men own idea have given order that table must be made of material came to hand one of men started idea of building arbour over a many hand make quick work have a see be constructed in little over hour a evening be warm front of arbour have be left open inside rough table have be constructed of empty cask plank taken from bottom of waggon couple of door from cottage near while powder barrel served a seat now colonel will take head of table de thiou said certainly not de thiou be guest upon occasion so do take place will sit upon right hand only wish that must have given dinner like so often gave at st denis will enjoy a much a if be royal feast hector said seating for indeed since escaped from ingoldstadt ten day ago have be living on black bread sausage cheese meal be joyous one for at assault of rothenburg on previous day several barrel of wine have be captured by soldier of regiment have be bought from by officer who have feared that of men might drink to excess so damage reputation regiment have obtained for sobriety discipline one of have be broached pork afforded excellent supper even though bread be of worst possible quality when meal be over de thiou stood up proposed health of colonel congratulated most warmly upon escape from enemy expressing extreme satisfaction of men a well a officer at return toast be drunk with enthusiasm hector briefly returned thanks then in accordance with general request related particular of escape from ingoldstadt of journey paolo who have be waiting behind master chair came in for warm praise for share have taken in matter certainly did not think when first against advice of everyone took paolo a lackey five year ago that must turn out so valuable servant a have done hector said a de thiou handed goblet of wine to man have be more than servant have taken part in adventure truly regard a friend indeed gentleman have not be for certainly must not be here tonight for own money gave out altogether at hall have to borrow from store mean of buying clothes horse by way colonel de thiou said from day that be captured have drawn pay for knowing that if fell into arrear must have have hard work in getting so that have now three month of money in regimental chest thank de thiou will be very welcome though paolo must not have be very hard creditor at eight o'clock party broke up hector walked across to turenne quarter latter have just returned from consultation with other general will open trench here tonight place be of importance a be on direct road to nordlingen be a well not to leave behind however will do if news come that merci be marching to give battle before city expect will do imperialist will like to fight there for be scene of great victory over duke of weimar swede must hope that will reverse matter time marshal must hope so latter said gravely if fight on fair field have misgiving merci always take up strong position entrenches enghien be so anxious to fight that will do so at disadvantage rather than wait until can meet on even term know what happened at freiburg where lost nine thousand men gained great advantage while if have moved round threatened line of retreat enemy must have fallen back at once must have obtained object without loss of man might possibly have fallen upon merci in retreat well nigh annihilated army think campbell be for moment underestimating enghien genius be extraordinary in hour of battle be superb not only from extreme personal bravery from quickness with grasp point seizes upon spot where blow can be best delivered snatch victory where must see only defeat before be reckless of life so long a carry point rather than lose day in turning enemy position so forcing to relinquish will sacrifice whole regiment by marching straight against most formidable entrenchment have patience in addition to own splendid quality think must be greatest military genius world have ever seen now let hear what happened to after left side that night after marienthal hector again related adventure turenne laughed at account of escape hidden under flour bag be good scheme said be well that have that lackey of yours with for think that must ever have managed unaided be sure must not marshal be entirely suggestion arranged detail splendidly be equally valuable in way afterwards described fight in cabaret be more dangerous than taking part in pitched battle seven against two be heavy odds indeed though have advantage of weapon fellow have ready wit to think of rolling against man who be waiting for chance of running in stabbing must have made fortune somehow even if have not have good luck to fall in with in respect resemble other have enterprise quickness daring lack studious habit determination to master everything connected with profession ability to turn knowledge to account must have made good soldier excellent leader of irregular corp must never have gained distinction well be very glad to have have quiet talk with take one out of one worry anxiety by way have letter from mazarin reached while be at spire said be sorry to hear that have be taken prisoner requested to make exchange for a soon a possible even if have to give general officer for for be very deeply debtor have highest esteem for have be doing to make debtor never mentioned anything of sort to matter be to degree state one marshal must have told of a took place nearly year ago circumstance be altogether changed can mention to in confidence for even now be known might make powerful enemy then related how be that have thwarted attempt on mazarin life be piece of singular good fortune turenne said mazarin be staunch friend bitter enemy owe goodwill for have behaved shamefully to de bouillon refusing to hand to estate for exchanged principality of sedan permit to allow family interest to weigh with against duty to france truly a say be well to hide share in business sent de beaufort score of others to prison dozen member of powerful family into exile might well cause serious trouble be known did well to keep matter to did specially well to refuse to accept personal honour for have done so mazarin enemy must at once have connected that fact with discovery of plot on returning to regiment hector found that order have come just after left for four company to march down under guidance of engineer officer to begin work on trench de thiou knowing that have gone to marshal have gone down with four leading company other infantry regiment have furnished similar contingent showing that siege be to be pushed forward with haste enghien doe not allow grass to grow under foot captain mieville said stormed wimpfen few hour after arrival before carried rothenburg in single night expect that by tomorrow evening will be master of place in morning four more company went down to relieve who have be at work night have made great progress when in afternoon news came that merci be marching with strength towards nordlingen trumpet at once sounded to recall troop from trench meal be hastily cooked at sunset army marched for nordlingen night pushed on through forest just a leading squadron emerged from on to plain merci force be seen issuing out from forest facing army at once formed in order of battle enghien anxious to attack rode forward with turenne de gramont geis to reconnoitre ground be found that between army there be small river with great pool swamp on side that only approach be by narrow winding path where two horseman must scarcely ride abreast even enghien felt that must be madness to venture upon attack artillery opened fire that of bavarian replied cannonade be continued till inflicting certain amount of loss on side in way altering position seeing that battle must not be brought on here enghien marched two hour before daybreak for nordlingen at nine army came down on to great plain in front of town found that merci have be beforehand with have already taken up strong position two league away between city that troop be already at work throwing up intrenchment prince ordered baggage to be left behind at once marched against enemy at four o'clock be facing other merci have a usual chosen position with great judgment in middle of plain rose two little hill about thousand yard apart on hill on left stood castle of allersheim here merci left wing under general john de werth be posted while at weinberg right commanded by general gleen took up station main body of army under merci lay behind village couple of hundred yard beyond hill at head of passage between have cavalry on two wing infantry in centre have thrown forward regiment to hold village on two hill have planted cannon sheltered by intrenchment in position to sweep entrance to valley army consisted of between fourteen fifteen thousand men that of enghien of seventeen thousand after examining position council of war be held turenne be strongly against attacking enemy in position of such strength enghien a usual overruled opinion turenne then urged that cavalry on wing must not charge up hill attack position held there until enemy centre have be defeated advice in respect be taken general then separated rode to respective command de gramont commanded right wing consisting of french cavalry having a second line reserve consisting of four battalion of infantry six squadron of horse commanded by chevalier de chabot turenne commanded left consisted of own army with twelve squadron of weimar cavalry with hessian army six battalion six squadron a second line centre consisting of ten battalion five squadron of horse be commanded by count de marsin enghien took special command preferring to remain free to go where presence be most needed chapter xviii nordlingen be five o'clock in afternoon when arrangement for attack be completed a on rd of august evening be long be judged that there must be sufficient daylight to carry out battle french began with cannonade against village be replied to by gun on two hill not only did position of latter give great superiority much time be lost by french in being obliged to move forward gun a army advanced slow tedious process in day when cannon be very heavy cumbrous seeing that be losing time suffering more loss than inflicted enghien gave order to infantry of centre to advance went forward with great speed eagerness for be burning to retrieve cowardly conduct at marienthal carried intrenchment merci have thrown up at mouth of pas heedless of firing of gun rushed at village here however be received by so heavy fire of musketry from infantry posted there who have loopholed wall house that came to stop being shot down in great number turned fled count de marsin be dangerously wounded duc d'enghien sent marquis de la moussaie forward with reinforcement of several regiment too fell back before imperialist fire duc d'enghien then rallied infantry added to not yet engaged led to charge merci on part brought forward main body to village battle be now desperate one enghien seemed to lead charmed life be ever where fight be hottest encouraging soldier setting example clothes be shot through in many place two horse be killed under received contusion in thigh merci on part showed equal valour intrepidity be le fortunate for be struck by musketball killed news of fall excited soldier to fury hurling on assailant cut greater part of infantry to piece french on right have done no better for bavarian cavalry charged with such impetuosity although fought sturdily be broken routed de gramont did that leader must do to check flight lead back to battle when saw that be powerless to do put at head of two regiment have not yet be engaged received bavarian horse with heavy volley leading trooper to charge broke into advancing too far be surrounded taken prisoner john de werth then fell on reserve broke penetrated baggage be plundered then pursued fugitive far away from field of battle have instead of allowing troop to be carried away by ardour brought round attacked french left in rear imperialist victory must have be complete here for time conflict be doubtful turenne in spite of fire of imperialist artillery led troop in good order up hill of weinberg horse be shot under cuirass be struck not pierced by musketball on gaining top of hill terrible fight took place between weimar hessian troop on one side austrian bavarian on other former showed valour in strong contrast with conduct of french ally after repeated volley have be exchanged infantry cavalry rushed upon other fought with bayonet sword at last first line of imperialist gave way general gleen brought up second line threw turenne first line into disorder although still maintained ground at moment conde seeing that centre be destroyed right utterly dispersed came up joined turenne placing at head of hessian who formed second line brought forward enemy squadron be broken infantry defeated gun be then turned upon imperialist on slope of hill leading down to village when be shaken by fire turenne squadron charged down upon completed defeat general gleen be taken prisoner turenne troop descending hill took village in flank have defender here fought with same courage that have previously evinced must have given time to john de werth to return fate of battle must have be doubtful be seized with unreasoning panic at once surrendered night have long since closed in so far a fighting have gone battle might be considered drawn one french right centre be utterly routed left have captured one of key of position village behind have john de werth when returned from pursuit shown able general rallied imperialist sent to recapture village with victorious cavalry made circuit of weinberg fallen upon turenne rear imperialist success must have be a complete striking a have won on nearly same ground over swede although impetuous leader of cavalry have military genius on returning after dark hearing that weinberg be lost village captured drew off from field be joined by imperialist infantry when morning broke turenne division stood victor on field number of officer many standard cannon of enemy fell into hand of french infantry not more than fifteen hundred be rallied after battle of allied army turenne german troop although have suffered severely alone remained intact john de werth retreated with remains of imperialist force to donauworth crossed to other side of danube although force be still superior to of turenne for loss suffered by french turenne german troop be very much greater than of imperialist enghien in despatch announcing victory acknowledged in letter to queen that be due to valour honour of turenne nordlingen dinkelsbuhl opened gate to victor enghien fell ill be forced to return to france leaving turenne in command de gramont be exchanged for gleen turenne took counsel a to course have best be pursued john de werth have already recrossed danube french general fell back to hall where remained for twelve day to refresh troop provision being plentiful in neighbourhood position be daily becoming more untenable duke of bavaria greatly alarmed by result of battle of nordlingen wrote to emperor that unless austria largely increased force in field must retire from contest of have hitherto borne brunt make term with french emperor who have just brought war with hungary to close despatched archduke leopold son with great body of horse soon effected junction with gleen john de werth together pushed forward at utmost speed to surprise french a soon a turenne received news of movement de gramont agreed that instant retreat must be made seeing that force be le than half that be advancing to attack baggage be abandoned a there be bridge available army crossed neckar by swimming cavalryman taking one of infantry behind continued retreat until arrived at philippsburg here turenne with whole of army took up position covered by gun of fortress while gramont passed river with remains of enghien army cavalry imperialist after examining turenne position came to conclusion that must not be attacked marching away besieged captured town taken by french in advance thus beyond empty honour of nominal victory at campaign under enghien turenne ended without solid advantage being gained by french poitou regiment be only french battalion in army of turenne have be placed with hessian in second line have fought with distinguished bravery on crest of weinberg have publicly be thanked by enghien who have on day of battle ridden by side of hector at head when fell upon imperialist have suffered small number of casualty for enemy be already shaken before charged have after receiving shattering volley broken fled a regiment charged with fixed bayonet turenne be always anxious to impress upon hector lesson be to be learned from action while be encamped round hall went over event of campaign with on map see said that what said to on evening before marched from dinkelsbuhl have be completely justified instead of manoeuvring so a to fight in open dashed against strong position with inevitable consequence two third of army be routed infantry of centre right annihilated although by hard fighting on left gained advantage be only impetuous folly of john de werth saved from destruction now see be in position to fight battle victory won in one own country be decisive for considerable time victory in enemy country unless involves disastrous defeat utter breakup of army be practically without value can receive reinforcement for none can reach from france in le than couple of month enemy on other hand have rapidly filled up rank have received be about to receive large reinforcement a soon a advance must retreat in haste sacrifice advantage have gained will be lucky if can maintain footing on side of rhine five six thousand life have be thrown away nothing whatever gained now see have instead of knocking head against enemy position manoeuvred to place between danube must have retreated without fighting battle for be inferior to in number must have be able to go into winter quarter in nordlingen possibly lay siege to eichstadt genius may win battle campbell genius if accompanied by impetuosity thirst for great victory will very seldom win campaign love a well a admire enghien be chivalrous generous have great military genius possibly with age impetuosity may be tempered with discretion at present although brilliant leader be not general must choose to serve under in long campaign when weimar cavalry crossed rhine with de gramont broke into mutiny declaring that be raised to fight in germany must not fight in france turenne crossed endeavoured to get to return to duty recalling to how nobly have fought under appealing to in strongest way not to desert now portion of gave in to entreaty rest rode away to effect junction with swedish army be therefore deprived of considerable portion of force have be mainstay of little army upon other hand archduke leopold marched away to bohemia to oppose swede who have gained several success in direction turenne however determined to carry out one more enterprise before winter set in to reinstate elector of treves who have be deprived of dominion for twelve year in consequence of having entered into alliance with france in order to effect marched in first week in november with small force of infantry cavalry to moselle distance of forty league be joined by of enghien troop from metz on th of november invested treves imperialist be unable to gather force of sufficient strength to relieve town be therefore after short resistance forced to capitulate small garrison from other town in elector dominion be speedily driven out elector restored to possession result doubly gratifying since restoration produced widespread effect among german prince who have thrown in lot with france while material advantage be no le a closed door through imperialist when in sufficient force must at time pour troop into france brought campaign of to close turenne be called to paris where received honour be due to for skill bravery by with insufficient force raised equipped paid to large extent from private purse have for two year guarded rhine frontier from invasion by united force of bavaria austria hector regiment have be left at philippsburg when turenne marched away marshal told that there be occasion for to remain with during winter thought indeed that must be advantageous that must pay short visit to paris present to mazarin then go down see how matter fared with estate to have paid flying visit therefore set out without delay turenne entrusting with despatch to cardinal be of great importance said be always well for officer returning to paris to carry despatch with show that have hearty approval of commander in leaving post for while that have distinguished in special degree to be thus selected have several time in despatch have occasion to speak of excellent service rendered by regiment will ensure good reception at court besides mazarin be evidently disposed to regard with special favour occasional visit keep that feeling alive whereas naturally cool down after prolonged absence therefore in respect be a well that must show in paris for short time before going down to poitou where hear there have be troublesome rising of peasantry province being broken hilly for most part offer considerable advantage to irregular force who move unencumbered with baggage against whom cavalry can not well act know that of trouble have occurred in neighbourhood of estate must naturally wish to see for how matter be going on seems more than two year since left here master paolo said a rode into paris doe indeed be more than six year now since first rode away with turenne month later entered service have gone through good deal together since day paolo yes indeed sir be fortunate day for when brother took to

glad to see that regiment bore a well in field of battle a in park of versailles what news do bring nothing of importance hope for there can hardly be good news when marshal have so scanty force with to guard frontier viscount de turenne be too zealous in service madam to remain idle however small force started suddenly day left with cavalry small body of infantry to march to treves with two three regiment have persuaded duc d'enghien to send from metz with gun hoped to capture city clear electorate of enemy before can receive strong reinforcement seeing that be scattered in winter quarter bold stroke indeed cardinal queen said much gratified have touched honour that elector must so long have suffered for fidelity to france moreover possession in hand will relieve of much anxiety give moselle a barrier against incursion of enemy in corner of dominion be indefatigable good viscount cardinal be not one of who look for great reward for service have indeed carried on war largely on own resource have be of slight advantage to seeing that exchequer be too often strained to meet demand from other quarter if succeeds in enterprise must write in name bid come hither to receive thanks in person to rest for while from labour in service have changed somewhat monsieur de villar since last saw lady of court called then little colonel not because of size for already overtopped greater

to be anxious to know how matter be going on to see that castle be secure from attack by insurgent excuse be good one must be well if more possessor of estate must spend time in endeavouring to alleviate condition of people instead of wasting time money in paris monsieur de villar took step in direction majesty before leaving for war for agent who keep informed of most thing take place acquainted with fact that monsieur de villar entirely remitted usual fine on taking possession reduced annual payment of tenant by one half until time must mend noble example queen said warmly must

left behind at philippsburg for cure of wound that have received at nordlingen hector be mounted on one of horse enghien have given other be in hand of imperialist traveled fast met with adventure until arrived at poitou where hector learned that in western part of province peasant have almost everywhere risen have defeated royal troop who have marched against from la rochelle nantes have captured burnt chateau slaying person of better class who fell into hand a neared own estate learning that tenant there have so far not joined rising that several body of insurgent be in neighbourhood rode still more rapidly forward sign of trouble be everywhere apparent in village only woman be to be seen there be sign of life movement in field passed two chateau be now empty shell a soon a have crossed into own estate found house entirely deserted man woman child be to be seen animal grazed in field little stack of hay straw have be carried away be evident said to paolo macintosh have called tenantry into chateau have joined insurgent woman child must still be here a ascended steep hill on whose brow chateau stood must make out that there be number of men posted upon wall be evidently determined that will not be caught napping paolo peasant of poitou must not take place unless be well provided with cannon chateau indeed still retained characteristic of castle site have evidently be selected with sole eye to defence hill on stood fell abruptly away on three side must hardly be attacked except in front here plateau extended three four hundred yard long upwards of hundred yard across wall with flanking turret have be sufficient defence on other three side here there be strong tower on flank also on side of central gate wall inclosed space of two acre in centre of stood castle have be to extent modernized window having taken place of loophole in upper floor while looking into inner courtyard extended to ground point where road reached plateau be three hundred yard from gateway a hector galloped towards wall be evident that be recognized for shout be raised by men on guard drawbridge over fosse cut in solid rock along foot of wall be lowered a rode across gate swung open macintosh ran out to meet be well old friend hector asked a sprang from horse clasped sergeant hand be well so far colonel still be glad indeed that have returned for at moment trouble may begin hear that peasant mean to attack hardly think will venture to do so have doubt will play havoc on estate burn house because tenant instead of joining have come up here to aid in defence be good day indeed when madam daughter came here have made so loved by tenant that must do anything for ah if lady of france have be a good to people a have be must not have trouble on hand here come to welcome hector hurried across outer court where two line of paling have be erected forming passage from one gate to other keeping back animal crowded enclosure welcome back welcome back colonel campbell baroness said a came up with hand extended word be echoed by daughter in year have elapsed since started under charge of paolo have changed look of care anxiety have be heightened by terrible event of two previous day have passed from elder lady face have be succeeded by one of contentment happiness norah showed even greater change have now attained full height figure have filled out stood on threshold of womanhood bid fair to attain high degree of beauty of type characteristic of nationality hair be dark eye gray expression changing rapidly from grave to gay latter movement generally predominating need hardly ask madam hector said a entered chateau whether have be comfortable here for face show that have at least be contented with lot a chatelaine have be more than contented have be very happy monsieur campbell have be pleasant task indeed to be almoner to be able to carry comfort to in distress sympathy aid to in suffering within castle nothing must be more pleasant than position captain macintosh have be unwearied in effort to make comfortable steward have in case be willing to aid with money counsel when asked for proof that goodness have be appreciated by tenant be that one of without exception have refused to join insurgent have forsaken home in order to come up aid in defence of castle be indeed gratifying madam methinks action be due rather to kindness of mademoiselle norah than to gift receive choose to be called norah girl said tossing head be irish on side have not drop of french blood in vein to stranger be miss norah obeore to to may love be plain norah think that can be to anyone norah now like colonel campbell may do at court of louis xiv not at chateau of la villar if be going to pay compliment will be stiff unpleasant will insist upon being addressed a miss norah obeore a did not mean to compliment for spoke truth will not accept penalty now went on unromantic a may sound own be hungry be sure that four follower be also for have ridden far fast have not stopped save to bait horse snatch mouthful while ate since daybreak in truth news received made sorely anxious though felt sure that macintosh must hold chateau against attack be likely to be made on chapter xix peasant revolt after eating meal hector have talk aside with macintosh do really think that varlet will venture to attack do indeed old sergeant said have taken several place a strong a by sudden assault be desperate a hear fight like demon regardless a to how many fall a far a stout arm go be well supplied for there be at least hundred men capable of bearing arm have have more le drill since have be here unfortunately however wall piece be old scarce fit for service several of will feel sure burst at first discharge have artillery at macintosh be sorry to say that have sir good amount of captured ten field piece when defeated troop have obtained score of others from chateau that have taken have only to plant three four hundred yard away at end of plateau must easily batter down gate might even in time effect breach in wall be serious indeed macintosh be there other way in can attack save in front think not be careful to examine face of precipice when first took command here wherever seemed to that active man must climb up have portion of rock blown up have so scarped face think be scalable by human foot there be nothing to prevent crossing fosse on dark night so stealing along making attack on side of house then first care must be to prevent macintosh by building wall along by fosse from corner tower to edge of plateau distance be very short not more than eight ten yard at outside have see number of horse not few cart let tenant be set to work at once going down road into ravine below cart with block of stone haul up here let active boy be sent out in direction a scout to bring in word when insurgent be approaching at same time let twenty well armed men of garrison go down with cart so a to give confidence to tenant cover retreat up road if insurgent must suddenly make appearance let of men take billhook ax down with cut pole must be sharpened a wall be built fixed among stone so a to make cheval de frise at same time let dozen stout ladder be constructed so that defender of wall may if unable to hold make retreat up to battlement now that have ordered strong bastion to be thrown up so a to cover gate from attack by artillery did not seem likely that must be besieged by force having gun let matter remain until tenant must be better off must spend money on such work however be too late now to think of suppose there be portcullis to gate yes got in good working order when first came here cannon must speedily shatter that a well a bridge drawn up in front of gate behind then a have doubt that there be plenty of flour sack must fill with earth pack between bridge portcullis fasten bridge in place with chain may be available so that will keep erect earth packing however much may be battered will protect portcullis of gate for time against fire be good idea if have time to carry out colonel have still four five hour daylight a think that be of even greater importance than side wall will set tenant to work at once will save time if take down sack of a say have abundance few minute later dozen active boy left castle scattered to various point on hill around so a to command view over considerable extent of country soon after thirty cart went down road accompanied by number of men with shovel twenty of garrison commanded by one of old soldier returned loaded with sack of earth be taken into castle when portcullis be lowered drawbridge across fosse raised opening be left on top to allow sack to be lowered into space between bridge portcullis score of men with rope went on to wall above lowered behind drawbridge where five six men stowed away a soon a became dark torch be lighted by ten o'clock solid mass of sack filled with earth be packed in space between portcullis drawbridge night passed off quietly horse cart remaining beyond fosse plank have be placed across one end of horse cart taken over horse be picketed round castle supply of forage being placed there for use while cart be packed closely by fosse so a to form obstacle to of assailant who might try to pas at daybreak be again run across plank horse brought round harnessed scout being sent out a on day before day work went on by nightfall two wall twenty foot long eight foot high bristling with pointed stave be erected stood twenty foot back from edge of fosse extended from wall to verge of precipice cart horse have before wall be built be taken round to back of castle where plateau extended fifty yard beyond defence evening be just coming on when boy came in two of bringing report that great crowd of men must be seen approaching from west macintosh with thirty men be at once lowered down from battlement took up place in intrenchment have be during day thrown up at point where road came up to plateau while score of tenant assembled at edge of cliff where great pile of block of stone have be collected in readiness to throw down lighted torch be placed at interval along road three four great cressets holding ball of tow soaked in turpentine oil be set up on edge of plateau be to be lighted when peasant attempted to mount hill hour passed then flame sprang up from house outbuilding in valley lighting up ground around showing that great crowd be gathered on road there how many must say there be macintosh must put at four five thousand yes be certainly not short of four thousand what wild looking figure be just same in appearance a who attacked madame de blenfoix chateau see be lighting torch expect mean to make attack at once gun be with group in rear of others at rate will not be of use in assisting to make way up road be evidently working up to state of madness there be dozen fellow addressing from various point men who have be brought down to guard intrenchment at head of road be armed with musket carried in addition long pike presently roar of shout yell be heard then there be rush on part of crowd towards foot of long ascent hector moved to place where tenant be posted single stone down until give word light cressets torch carry will be quite sufficient for to make out attack will be more successful if come a surprise then returned to breastwork men here have be posted by macintosh eight abreast when head of column of insurgent be halfway up hill opened scattered fire have armed with musket have taken from troop gun will be of little use to for few of can ever have have firearm in hand before fire shot macintosh until give order be clear that someone must have told that have thrown up intrenchment today must not have wasted ammunition not shot be fired until leader of peasant be within forty yard up to time torch have be shown in intrenchment now be suddenly brought forward hector in helmet body armour mounted on to breastwork head of column paused on seeing row of levelled musket three row of pike forming hedge of steel men hector shouted in loud clear voice halt beseech before harm come to know that have sore grievance know that wife family be well nigh famishing how do think that will better condition by assaulting castle burning down chateau be preparing labour for yourselves heaping up fresh impost on own head for be who will have to rebuild be who will have to pay for damage that have done at rate none can say that have cause for enmity against mine for have done in power to mitigate suffering of people proof be that not one of have joined tax press so heavily upon be not work of feudal lord be caused by necessity for defending france against assault of foreign enemy be noble in land slain must still be necessary that tax must be collected unless france be to be overrun by spaniard austrian must fain abstain from spilling one drop of blood must defend if attack warn that numerous a be will not succeed in capturing castle be soldier of france a have shed blood in defending against enemy so if persist will not hesitate in shedding yours in own defence implore to disperse to home even if gain success for time must draw down vengeance upon assailant have paused when commenced to speak in front have listened to word behind not knowing what be going on continued to shout to press up hill a finished speaking there be yell of defiance column rushed forward aim low hector shouted a leapt down among men fire eight musket flashed out second line fire now handle pike rear line will reserve fire although ten twelve of leading rank of insurgent have fallen there be pause among others rushed forward to hedge of pike take charge here macintosh will run get stone at work in minute stood by side of tenant heave then down said have chosen spot where rock rose perpendicularly above road drop over said so that may fall straight biggest must roll over with lever work to edge let topple over thrust out will bound over road now twenty rock be dropped down together even above din of shouting crash a fell below be heard followed instantly by yell cry move farther on give shower hector said again rock fell on crowded causeway first volley have caused pause number have be crushed many of stone a rolled down road have carried confusion to below second volley completed discomfiture appalled by discharge against have shelter be wholly unexpected near whom stone have fallen turned in panic swept below on road down into valley many being overthrown trampled to death ignorant of what be going on behind crowd above spot where stone have fallen be still pressing upward in front hewing with scythe ax at pikeheads hector ran back there two rear rank will now fire said men dropped pike two volley of musketry be poured into insurgent of front line be swept away by fire for moment whole recoiled now men hector shouted cross breastwork sweep away with pike with cheer men leapt over embankment there be room for ten abreast in treble line with levelled spear bore down upon rebel charge be irresistible few of leader of peasant threw on to spear died there others strove in vain to fly comrade behind ignorant of what be going on still pressed up be not until scream shout of in front pressure downwards brought column to stand then bore backward that learned that defender have taken offensive be sweeping before then panic arose peasant rushed down road tenant above saluting a passed with volley of rock halfway down hill hector halted men led up to intrenchment again over road encumbered with dead body think will do said after tale who have got down safely will have to tell may be sure will hing until morning may well be that may think advisable to be off to attack other place not so strongly defended however will presently beat up if possible capture cannon without must not hope to take fortified house well defended for time there be prodigious din in valley sound of men shouting quarrelling of others trying in vain to make voice heard to address excited peasant in hour quieted down by midnight be still hector have be busy with preparation how many horse have asked well nigh hundred colonel be more than enough now macintosh do men here go down road pitch body over must never get horse over then went to where tenant be still waiting now lad said want big gap made in one of wall built today wide enough for horse to pas through strong plank laid across fosse then ascended ladder up to battlement found baroness daughter standing over gateway be over asked a came up to yes for present have beaten handsomely without loss of single man will attack again in morning do think feel sure that will not do so see relied upon cannon for taking chateau find be useless be going to make sortie before daybreak for want to capture cannon so long a hold will continue work may not always meet with so stout resistance loss of cannon will dishearten a well a lessen power for evil will take man who can carry arm leave ten at breastwork to defend there be chance whatever of attempting to come up here while be attacking so need have fear will not be afraid colonel campbell confidence in be absolute do not think that be running great risk in attacking force forty time a large a own one can not call force be simply mob mob have suffered terrible repulse loss of three four hundred men tonight will take by surprise be going to mount tenant macintosh tell that have be drilled a cavalry a well a infantry with twenty men of regular garrison on foot ten of tenant will make straight for gun will be with horseman a soon a have scattered mob will harness horse to gun bring up here so that will strengthen castle a well a weaken peasant tenant be informed of what be going to be done will be to benefit a well a ours said for may be sure that in morning if give up idea of again attacking will scatter over estate sack burn house whereas if succeed in dispersing small portion of will at once scatter to home rest will take care not to come near neighbourhood again at twelve o'clock macintosh sent man to say that road down be clear three hundred twenty dead body have be thrown over at three o'clock in morning horse round whose hoof piece of sacking have be tied be led across fosse one of macintosh sergeant be put in charge of ten men who be to remain at intrenchment castle being left entirely in hand of woman boy mounted tenant be eighty in number carrying long spear sword torch have long since burnt out man leading horse went noiselessly down road macintosh with footman leading way halted at bottom of road there be sound from spot where insurgent be lying couple of hundred yard down valley fatigued by very long march on previous day exertion of dragging cannon for only few of be horsed presently day began to break not until became light enough to see perfectly did hector give order to mount leaping into saddle prepared to lead mounted men have be divided into four band of twenty paolo three trooper took command of party hector order be keep together until peasant be in full flight then separate in pursuit movement must be put down whole province will be ruined therefore give quarter pursue until horse be tired then return here now macintosh do advance straight upon gun be probable that be loaded therefore carry with rush moment see engaged will charge horseman be in single line extending from side to side of valley hector kept eye upon macintosh party be close to gun before of sleeper awoke then there be sudden shout number of men rushed to cannon macintosh be there a soon a be pouring in volley rushed upon gun at same moment hector gave word to charge with levelled spear horseman rode down into midst of crowd appalled by sudden attack be wholly unexpected resistance be slight many of peasant at once threw away arm fled who resisted be speared overthrown by horse a valley widened four troop separated little cutting way for through peasant be no longer fight wild panic seized upon whole of insurgent rushed straight down valley others ran up opposite hillside slope here be gradual horseman be able to pursue paolo take troop up hill let others keep straight down valley heading hector galloped on shouting to macintosh to harness what team there be to of gun take up to top of road then bring horse back for more for two hour pursuit continued occasionally group of peasant gathered together tried to stem tide be speedily overcome long spear bearing down without being able to strike blow at rider at end of time insurgent be scattered over wide extent of country flying for life hector now ordered trumpet to sound be soon joined by other troop at leisurely pace rode back to starting point not more than gun have a yet be taken up for macintosh have found necessary to put double team to in order to drag up steep road mounted men have brought rope with dismounting eight yoked horse to gun in hour whole be brought up to plateau drawbridge be lowered sack of earth cleared away portcullis raised gate thrown open garrison filed into courtyard greeted by cry of welcome from woman think that have crushed insurrection in part of poitou hector said to madame de blenfoix have certainly killed six seven hundred of be sure that remainder will never rally will rest today tomorrow morning will set to work to complete defence of chateau so that may be held by comparatively small number of men joy of woman be extreme when found that not single man have fallen though few have received gash more le severe next morning whole of men boy set to work under hector direction intrenchment at top of road be greatly strengthened opening through cart must pas being left in middle gun be placed on side of twenty sack of earth laid down by side of opening so that in course of few minute must be closed gun placed close by run into position between other two greater part of men however be employed in raising mound of stone earth in front of gateway so a to cover from fire of gun after outward intrenchment have be stormed might be brought up on to plateau woman even child assisted in work by carrying earth while men with horse cart brought stone up from valley took fortnight hard work before outwork be completed be twenty foot high triangular in form solid in construction many of tenant be accustomed to stonework while rest of bastion be constructed of rough stone mixed with earth parapet four foot thick of roughly dressed stone be carried along on crest of two outward side four gun be mounted here rest of cannon be placed on outer wall instead of honeycombed gun before in position castle be thus prepared to stand regular siege hector remained for week after work be completed paid tenant liberally for service have rendered dismissed to home for terrible blow have be inflicted upon have so cowed peasant order have be completely restored in part of poitou then after taking affectionate adieu of madame de blenfoix daughter rode back to paris where remained for two month at end of time being heartily tired of frivolity intrigue disgusted at immorality of court obtained leave from mazarin to rejoin regiment a campaign might be expected to open shortly again cardinal have warmly congratulated upon suppression of insurrection in poitou of have received full detail from agent long before hector reached paris have always exhorted officer troop engaged in putting down rising to spill more blood than be absolutely necessary needed great lesson such a have given otherwise a soon a troop be withdrawn peasant must rise again turenne have also be in paris have strongly represented to mazarin necessity for army of france sweden in germany acting together since while be acting separately at great distance apart austrian bavarian must unite crush one while other must offer assistance be owing to that conquest made by troop of france weimar have be repeatedly wrested from cardinal listened to advice determined to bring about union between two army of confederation in meantime conference be going on at munster between representative of various conflicting power put forward such exorbitant demand that progress be made duke of bavaria indignant at small support austria have given be playing off france against latter power mazarin be persuaded that be only waiting for opportunity to desert imperialist cause therefore ordered turenne not to cross rhine a duke have promised that must remain neutral unless french advanced into germany when feeling of subject might force to take field again on side of austria turenne be therefore ordered to besiege marshal however have belief in bavarian promise on arriving on rhine early in april seeing be to march with army away to luxembourg cause of france germany must be lost continued to make various excuse for not moving until duke of bavaria having obtained many concession from austria threw off mask marching with army joined that of emperor in franconia thus whole imperial force be posted between french swede turenne saw that only hope of success must be to effect juncture with swede wrote to cardinal to effect then without waiting for answer set army in motion tremendous circuit have to be made forded moselle six league above coblenz bridge over rhine being in possession of enemy marched up into holland obtained permission from king to cross at wesel reached after fourteen day march crossing rhine on th of july marched through country of la mark through westphalia on th of august joined swede under general wrangel who have received news of coming have intrenched so strongly that enemy who have arrived before did not venture to attack enemy now fell back at once encamped near freiburg army be superior in force to of ally having fourteen thousand horse ten thousand foot while ally have ten thousand horse seven foot ally have however sixty piece of cannon against fifty of imperialist ally advanced to freiburg offered battle archduke leopold who commanded imperialist declined to come out of great intrenchment have thrown up round camp turenne then marched towards maine halting ten league from mayence sent for infantry of have left portion there to join whole force of ally be now united took many town a however be still inferior in force to imperialist turenne refused to weaken by placing garrison in place contenting with blowing up fortification of carrying off principal inhabitant of others a hostage imperialist army still remained inactive turenne be able therefore to turn attention to bavaria crossing rhine at donauwurth besieged augsburg rain latter place be captured former being reinforced by fifteen hundred men held out stoutly be necessary to open trench proceed in regular form against duke of bavaria greatly alarmed at invasion of dominion sent off message after message to emperor complaining of manner in imperial army remained inactive leaving ally to employ whole force against threatened that unless army advanced at once to assistance must make term with france imperative order be thereupon sent to archduke to move against french ally fell back a force be greatly superior to theirs archduke took up strong position intending to force ally to retire into franconia a soon a country round be exhausted turenne wrangel divined purpose although be now beginning of november snow be on ground marched against on arriving near camp found that be strongly fortified must be attacked only by passing behind great marsh defile changing intention left two thousand horse in front of camp making believe that intended to attack then marched with haste to lech advanced against landsberg took by assault in city be principal magazine of imperialist army ally finding sufficient provision there to last for six month encamped round city decided to winter there unless attacked in meantime sending out body of cavalry levied contribution up to very gate of munich leopold thus deprived of magazine retired with austrian contingent bavarian returned home duke of bavaria finding that whole dominion must be captured unless made term therefore opened negotiation on th of march peace be signed term being that must separate entirely from empire deliver five of fortress to ally who must thus must again break word have mean of access into dominion allied force be now in condition to march upon vienna have during winter plundered large portion of bavaria horse have recovered from fatigue force now amounted to fourteen thousand foot twenty thousand horse at moment when imperialist believed that be lost for without assistance of bavaria must put army in field must hope to make head against ally mazarin interposed saved austria from destruction catholic power have long be privately urging upon danger must arise must austria be crushed swede must acquire very large accession of territory protestant german prince ally must similarly benefit protestantism must become dominant religion in germany such must indeed have undoubtedly be case have ally marched to vienna dictated term of peace there order be therefore sent to turenne to march with army to flanders where spaniard be gaining great advantage a enghien now become prince of conde by death of father have be sent into catalonia with greater portion of army turenne foreseeing that german regiment must refuse to march to flanders leaving own country open to invasion plunder by imperialist warmly opposed plan sent messenger after messenger to cardinal urging to countermand order friend of bavaria catholic prince urged strongly upon queen that continuance of war must utterly destroy catholic religion in germany that swede alone must reap advantage from fall of house of austria moved by argument of mazarin to same effect supported latter peremptory order be sent to turenne to march to flanders where matter be going from bad to worse turenne obeyed captured on march towards rhine several town fortress destroying fortification so that must not be able to oppose if returned to germany on arriving on rhine anticipation of trouble be fulfilled general rosen whose blunder have be cause of disaster at marienthal who have since return from captivity persistently worked in opposition to turenne fomented discontent among troop of weimar directly crossed rhine absolutely refused to advance have just cause for complaint have fought with distinguished valour alone have saved french army from suffering crushing defeat at pay be six month in arrear proposal now that must leave own country fight in flanders be naturally most repugnant to at once marched away towards strasburg turenne followed with three thousand infantry four french regiment of horse only one of weimar cavalry have remained faithful to came up just a be about to recross rhine partly by entreaty partly by showing confidence in by putting wholly in power marshal induced portion of weimar cavalry to return to duty general rosen who be to large extent responsible for mutiny be arrested imprisoned at philippsburg rest of mutineer rode away with loss of portion of number joined swede after order for turenne to march to flanders be countermanded war languished for few month imperialist be defeated after hard fought cavalry battle by turenne swede country be overrun by latter whose horseman raided almost up to innsbruck party be growing weary of conflict have now lasted thirty year have inflicted incredible suffering upon who be concerned in have produced no important result except that have prevented entire crushing out of protestantism in germany peace conference for first time began to work in earnest at last after bavaria have be wasted from end to end duke driven into exile peace be concluded emperor yielding point demanded by france a saw plainly enough that unless did so turenne army must be at gate of vienna at commencement of next campaign in october hostility ceased turenne went to munster acted a french negotiator in arranging peace to genius steadfast determination expenditure of own mean by have kept army on foot have so largely contributed chapter xx old score hector be not present with army during last three campaign of war have joined turenne in april shared in general disappointment when order be received that army be not to cross rhine because bavaria have promised to remain neutral if did not do so can not think marshal said to day two after received order for have always maintained same pleasant relation with hector have subsisted between in italy placed most entire confidence in discretion of young colonel how mazarin can allow bavaria to hoodwink indeed can not believe that be really deceived must know that crafty old fox duke be not to be relied upon in way that be merely trying to save time 't be hard indeed to see powerless to move now that season for campaigning be just opening when by advancing must cut bavarian off from austria a to besieging luxembourg must be waste of time for before must open trench must hear that duke have again declared against must have to hurry back with speed be indeed fortnight later that news came that bavarian be on move to join imperialist fortnight later be known that two army have effected junction turenne at once collected troop from town village where be placed marched to mayence be going to send to paris campbell said on evening of arrival there be lost if enemy now united throw upon swede have resolved to take upon responsibility of marching round through holland joining wrangel there be of course risk in such expedition cardinal may object very strongly to undertaking movement especially a will leave frontier of france virtually unguarded have fear that evil consequence will arise enemy will not hear of march until ten day after have started even then will probably suppose that have gone to flanders by time find out what intention be will be too late for to take advantage of absence even then must have to storm philippsburg other strong place before must cross rhine before must do wrangel must be at heel moreover a must know that instead of pursuing might after effecting junction make straight for vienna that army must be got together to oppose consider that movement be perfectly safe one now be going to send to mazarin with despatch telling of intention be choosing for purpose because will be able to explain enforce reason have given have high opinion of will listen to when perhaps must not pay regard to rosen other of weimar officer might send remember that there be occasion for extreme hurry smiled of course be necessary that must travel with certain amount of speed founder horse day be of value to if be once well on way north mazarin must hardly recall say that take five day to get to paris by time must be north of cologne courier from mazarin can hardly overtake until be in holland must then feel justified in disregarding order seeing must by pushing on effect junction with swede quite a quickly a must return here of course must be too late for to overtake will give written order to remain in paris until be again so near rhine that can join regiment consider that will be advantage to have near cardinal a knowing intention method a do must be able to so explain matter to that will understand reason for various movement very well marshal be ready to start a soon a hand despatch will do tomorrow morning will then be able to tell mazarin that be just setting out when left a will be time before will rejoin regiment may ask to appoint captain de thiou a second colonel have now served a senior captain of regiment for three year aided heartily cordially in organizing have seconded throughout in manner of can not speak too highly distinguished greatly at freiburg on occasion in have be in contact with enemy think very desirable that there must be officer of rank superior to others while be away for sake of regiment a reward for merit conduct of captain de thiou must be very glad be promoted must feel that regiment must in way deteriorate during absence certainly campbell will carry out recommendation have fairly earned promotion a say be better in absence that regiment must be led by officer of rank above others not by captain having very slight seniority to of doubtless will be saying goodbye to officer tonight authorize to inform de thiou that will be placed in order tomorrow morning a second colonel of regiment did not think that be likely to be back in paris before next winter master paolo said rather discontentedly when hector told that be to start early next morning did paolo must very much rather have remained with regiment a marshal be good enough to consider presence there may be of advantage to have of course nothing to say against there be great regret among officer when heard that colonel be not going to lead be pleased that de thiou who be general favourite have obtained promotion that officer be at once surprised gratified at news for be not often that men without strong family interest rose to rank of colonel know that be doing said gratefully never expected to get above present rank be sure must never have done so have not be for thoroughly deserve de thiou for be by support be enabled when first joined to introduce reform get officer to take upon more work responsibility thus make regiment what be hope will rejoin before end of campaign may be last for now that have begun peace conference at munster something must surely come of sooner later for party must be thoroughly sick of long terrible war have ruined germany impoverished france from party after nigh thirty year of fighting have gained material advantage at rate will be great satisfaction to to know that regiment be in hand know that during time have be away winter thing have gone on satisfactorily be clearly impossible for officer to keep regiment well in hand when a in case appointment be only day two earlier than of of others be likely to have stiff marching now for only one other infantry regiment besides ours will accompany cavalry rest will remain here until get opportunity of rejoining of course will take paolo four mounted trooper back with to paris may probably send on to la villar a be not likely that will need at court on evening of fifth day after leaving mayence hector arrived in paris alighted at cardinal hotel so be again bearer of despatch monsieur campbell cardinal said a hector entered apartment need be important marshal must hardly have sent with be a will see important eminence be sent rather to explain further than marshal must do in letter reason for step that have taken a have learned long before duke of bavaria have proved false to promise have effected junction with imperialist army marshal have news that be marching against swede who be in strength to show fight against so great force cardinal opened despatch read in silence 't be grave step for marshal to have taken without order said frowning do mean to say that have already started on expedition troop have fallen into rank when started by time must be well on way towards holland there be time sir for marshal to await reply to despatch matter be most urgent day be of importance for if swede fell back a might do before archduke latter must be able to overrun northern germany to capture town of protestant prince break up confederation compel to give in submission for turenne with small force must be powerless to interfere with operation even if by pressing after with speed arrived within striking distance think that will reach wrangel in time hope so sir sent off messenger before starting with order to buy fresh horse at cost at halting place to carry news a quickly a possible to wrangel that be on way to join imploring to intrench in strong position until must come up how long hence will be march will be pressed forward with speed eminence with such delay only a may be needed to keep horse in such state that may be ready for fighting a soon a join swede hope to be there in month from day of starting in meantime mazarin said france be open to invasion say indeed that imperialist must hardly venture to march hitherward a thereby in turn must leave open to swede to march into heart of austria assuredly be so sir archduke will hardly get news that marshal turenne have moved until have be ten twelve day on march even when hears will not know in what direction have gone may think likely that intends to seize luxembourg to reinforce army in flanders by time discover true object will be within week march of swede possibly le than that will be too late for then to think of marching to rhine if consider strong enough to fight marshal swede together will do so at once if fear to give battle still more must fear to be attacked by when entering country where must have in rear be hemmed in between rhine not to speak of risk of leaving austria open to invasion must instead of pursuing direct march thither if might presume to judge must say that expedition that marshal have undertaken be at once worthy of military genius will at same time do far more to ensure safety of rhine province than must do be to remain there with small army until imperialist having chased swede out of country reduced northern germany turned whole force against see monsieur campbell cardinal said turning subject that have be five day coming here from mayence be very different rate of speed to at traveled from rocroi be so eminence on occasion duc d'enghien have placed relay of best horse along road so that be enabled to travel without making halt moreover dear colonel mazarin said turenne far from urging to haste be desirous of getting so far before received answer a to render impossible for to recall can not think that eminence must do that be grand enterprise almost without precedent in point of daring in great advantage to be gained from turenne thought that by sending must be able to assist in persuading to regard favourably well well be certainly too late to recall now have taken responsibility upon must stand fall by result now in first place be going to hurry back again be going to remain here regiment be one of that have taken with sir a must not hope to overtake have requested to remain here until receive order from will be gainer so far cardinal said cordially be sure that from knowledge of country of turenne method advice upon military matter will be of great service to must now go report to queen sudden change in situation if disapproves of will tell that if will listen to will convert to view that escapade of marshal be for best seems likely indeed to retrieve position have be caused by treachery of bavaria during stay in paris hector soon found that intrigue be more rampant than ever duke of beaufort others who have be implicated in plot on mazarin life have be pardoned have returned to paris a lesson have be given have taught prudence be now openly on good term with court be secretly however intriguing with parliament of paris be now bitterly opposed to mazarin have refused to register of decree have even forced to dismiss superintendent of finance italian named emeri latter have imposed tax at will to satisfy extravagance avarice have raised octroi duty made sale of firewood monopoly in various way have incurred indignation hatred of parisian mazarin own greed have be in slight degree cause of unpopularity who have come to france penniless priest be now owner of great estate be even said that much of money must have be devoted to need of army have be privately sent into italy by throughout country be felt to be scandalous that while deepest distress be universal on account of weight of taxation two italian must be piling up wealth for avaricious a be cardinal be lavish in expenditure among friend adherent honour title dignity estate be freely bestowed upon did not hesitate to pay sum must gain support of whose aid deemed to be essential madame de chevreuse be again at court be a have always be centre of intrigue be going on one evening made sign for hector to take place by side have taken fancy to young scottish colonel on evening when have be first introduced to be always gracious to now monsieur le baron said in low tone do think that air of paris agrees with a well a of army felt from manner in spoke that meant more than said so far madam have not disagreed with said even did do so must not be able to leave a have order to remain here by way monsieur said changing subject of conversation be whispered that party of pleasure to took officer of regiment at st germain did not come off at least none of landlord of hotel there can recall such gathering be even said that falling in with carriage of duke of orleans be not altogether accident only mention report of course be matter of moment whether party dined at st germain at sevres sometimes misapprehension of kind lead to trouble especially when happen few day before serious event like colonel campbell be why have mentioned understand have doubt turning to gentleman who have at moment approached entered into lively conversation with hector rose with word thank madam bowed moved away be easy to understand meaning beaufort conspirator whose plan have thwarted who have suffered imprisonment exile thereby have in way discovered that be to that owed failure disgrace at moment explanation that of officer have deceived doubtless someone whose connection with plot be unsuspected have instituted inquiry found that party have spoken of have not taken place have at once come to conclusion that have in way discovered intention have really ridden out with officer to furnish guard to mazarin have afterwards acquainted with what have discovered doubtless a madame de chevreuse have warned air of paris be at present dangerously unwholesome for have be mean of bringing disgrace punishment upon duc de vendome duke of beaufort two of most powerful noble in france host of friend be probable that only recently assured that be who have thwarted plan have be otherwise must scarcely have escaped vengeance last time that be in paris now from what madame de chevreuse have said have doubt that plot must be made against life might thwart one such attempt others must follow resolved to lay matter before cardinal take advice accordingly waited until be leaving several gentleman of suite accompanied at entrance to louvre men of cardinal guard fell in on side when reached be hotel hector moved up to can have few word with eminence certainly colonel campbell never retire to bed till long past midnight be something serious see said quickly a entered apartment where number of candle be burning obtained full view of hector face plot not against eminence be matter concern only have be warned tonight share in last affair have be discovered that inquiry have be made at st germain that various innkeeper have declared that party of officer dined there that morning that be therefore concluded that presence behind carriage be not accidental doubt guessed that be who discovered plot in consequence of so many be arrested exiled have be distinctly warned that air of paris be unwholesome for who warned cardinal said abruptly must not be fair of to mention name be at rate one who be of beaufort party ah cardinal said sharply noticed sitting for few minute by madame de chevreuse never mind will respect confidence can well understand after what have said that there be great danger here be danger from be well nigh impossible to protect unless take up residence here never stir abroad do know that must be safer with army assassin knife can reach man a easily in camp a in city with perhaps le risk of detection beaufort vendome be men to forget forgive injury have score of fellow who must for few crown murder anyone indicated of gentleman of higher rank who although not assassin must willingly engage in duel especially who suffered in plot that discovered frankly what do think might retire to la villar cardinal must be safe there in own castle so long a did not leave man with musket in ambush behind hedge might cut career short be probable enough that be watched in case must doubt whether must ever get to la villar do think that if left for rhine must get halfway now see monsieur campbell that cause be mine that safety touch a if be own for be in service that incurred danger must think matter over in meantime beg of to sleep here tonight will send word to servant that will not return must of course send guard with to hotel of servant there may have be bribed to murder a slept can look after seldom leave house except to go to louvre never go even short distance without guard be much more difficult to protect have own bodyguard excellency four stout scotch soldier lackey paolo who be good swordsman also a doe not seem to must be safer elsewhere than here will at rate stay for time must imagine that warning be general one have just found out that have hand in thwarting plot against dare say used threat threat of angry men come very often to nothing at rate choose that must obtain satisfaction of driving from paris against will cardinal shook head see monsieur that beaufort be man who hesitates at nothing scrupulous person must hardly endeavour to slay cardinal who be also minister of france in street of paris in broad daylight be capable of burning down pome d'or within in order to obtain revenge on feel very uneasy about however sleep may bring counsel will talk over again in morning have thought of anything monsieur campbell mazarin asked when met in morning have not sir save to go on trusting to own sword follower can think of nothing cardinal said save to send order to turenne for two company of regiment to march hither where on arrival will receive order to proceed with to castle of la villar to use in king service in repressing trouble may occur in poitou what say to must not deprive majesty of two hundred of best soldier to guard from what may not be after very real danger own conclusion after thinking over morning be will remain here for time trusting to friend own sword if serious attempt be made on life must then consider whether must be best to withdraw if so whither to go will not run away merely on vague hint that life be in danger have faced death in battle many time danger can hardly be considered a more serious imagine that in first case of duke follower will force into duel before proceeding to try assassination although doubtless have good blade among friend think that need to feel uneasy on score be always practising with sword a boy since have be in army have spent good deal of time when in winter quarter in such practice with own officer with maitres d'armes in town where have be while in italy have opportunity of learning much for there be fine fencer there so be then mazarin said if matter go to extreme remember consider responsible for believe that saved life although there be many thing that men say against none have ever charged with ingratitude if can protect in other way will have arrested sent to frontier be to say to sea frontier put on board ship sent to england scotland a choose with chest containing sum will suffice to purchase estate may choose there be in earnest went on a hector be about to answer be for own sake a much a yours when friend be attacked be attacked be doubly bound in case need stroke of pen to make duke lord of province if can not do here because must still be within reach of enemy can a far a estate go do for abroad fail to let know day if anything new take place hector felt that there be more to say bowing left cardinal presence went out paolo macpherson be waiting outside cardinal messenger who brought news last night that must not return master former said when saw by hector look of surprise that have not expected to see there said also one of men have best be here at eight morning wait until came out did not know that have sent message paolo will when get to hotel tell why sent street be somewhat crowded hector have gone short distance when saw three gentleman who knew to be intimate of duke of beaufort coming in other direction one of be monsieur de beauvais who said in loud tone to companion just a hector be passing be scotchman whom cardinal employ to do dirty business hector faced round at once at rate monsieur de beauvais scotchman in question be not employed by cardinal a assassin be even more dishonourable post de beauvais turned white with anger behind luxembourg in hour time monsieur de villar will be there hector said coldly paused minute after three gentleman with customary salute walked on did not like to go to hotel mazarin lest cardinal must obtain news of what be going to take place so waited in neighbourhood knowing that of mazarin personal friend must be sure to arrive about hour presently saw colonel who like be spending winter in paris who frequently attended cardinal levee colonel de serres a fellow soldier have service to ask of be entirely at disposal monsieur campbell have just have quarrel forced upon by monsieur de beauvais have to meet in fifty minute time at back of luxembourg a be in company with two gentleman comte de marplat monsieur de vipont will be glad if must kindly act a second if can find officer who must do so will be glad of service also will be glad to support monsieur campbell can lay hand on second at once for here come friend yours monsieur emile de chavigny who will like be charmed to be concerned in affair against duke friend de chavigny whom hector have seen at court on previous day for first time since have parted in italy agreed at once to hector request de beauvais have reputation of being good swordsman campbell said a walked together towards luxembourg paolo companion having now returned to inn at master order must say that will want skill now be by far best swordsman among when left suddenly in south doubtless since then skill will not have fallen off know good deal more than knew then chavigny there be few day when be in winter quarter have not hour work in fencing school with officer of regiment whenever heard that there be professor of art have never failed to frequent salon to learn favourite stroke be right then need have fear whatever a to result reached point fixed upon minute two before clock struck just a chimed de beauvais friend made appearance second exchanged few word selected piece of ground for encounter principal at once removed doublet faced other be duel la mort de beauvais said in loud voice for be quite prepared hector said quietly be likely to find monsieur de beauvais that be not so easy thing to kill colonel of one of majesty regiment a be to stab churchman in carriage de beauvais at once took up position without parade of courtesy usually preceded encounter fell furiously upon hector latter did not give way step with wrist of iron put aside dozen thrust then lunging ran de beauvais through body sword hilt striking against adversary chest de beauvais two second ran forward a principal fell be dead one said a knelt over then rising addressed hector monsieur le colonel campbell said claim satisfaction at hand for take that word applied to a well a to de beauvais though addressed only to may take so hector replied coldly for be also at house in rue st honore on occasion know of hector two second endeavoured to interpose said gentleman must ask to let matter go on be ordinary duel gentleman with whom have personal animosity have picked quarrel with at request of one higher in rank than be simply agent have hesitation in killing first of a monsieur de vipont wish encounter with in spite of what have seen will give one will content with le severe lesson than have given monsieur de beauvais now sir be at service de vipont knowing now how dangerous opponent be meeting fought cautiously hector however be anxious to finish matter before be interrupted therefore took offensive after two pass ran antagonist through shoulder now monsieur le comte do desire turn said carelessly count be pale answered steadily claim by same right a monsieur de vipont agreed hector said a soon a count have removed upper garment engaged sword have scarcely clashed when count weapon be wrenched from hand sent flying for distance of twenty pace be enough colonel de serres said stepping forward have done what thought to be duty monsieur le comte need very different blade from of companion to stand before colonel campbell have at mercy have right to take life if chose a refrained from doing that when have sword in hand certainly will not do so now monsieur wish good morning may mention hector added to person of high rank that will be happy to accommodate a many of gentleman of following a choose to take matter up will send more to campbell chavigny said a moved off leaving count whose valet now ran up to obtain vehicle carry dead wounded comrade away fancy not will try other mean now war have only begun men like lei brillet campion be not sort of men who must act a bravo even for duke of beaufort think that must even venture to propose to will be meaner instrument that will employ next time however will of course go straight to cardinal acquaint with what have happened doubt not that will lay matter before queen then beaufort will hear of passionate revengeful a be think that will not be turned from purpose even if know that may be forced to retire to estate even leave country till matter blow over chapter xxi duke revenge cardinal listened gravely to hector account of duel of circumstance gave rise to will go at once to louvre appeal to majesty said know how warmly spoke to on day when saved life still fear that sternest reproof even order to retire to estate must not turn from purpose be sure of eminence still a have proved victor in first battle in campaign will bide second mind that get stabbed in back colonel will beware of sir whenever walk street in future paolo will keep pace behind warrant that will protect from attempt of sort at rate remain here until return from louvre in hour mazarin returned duke have be beforehand with said when told queen of what have happened why quarrel have be fastened upon sent at once for duke drew out order signed for to retire at once to estate royal messenger returned with news that have hour before ridden away to visit father at vendome courier will start at once with order doubt whether will be found there be probable that have gone to one of own estate may be time before find out where be however be something that have gone on return to inn hector told paolo what have taken place be pity that did not kill master not at paolo have done so one of friend must have be set against men be of good family will doubtless report have life at mercy spared after gentleman of reputation must take matter up will have to be very careful in future now that duke have gone there be not likely to be further trouble just at present paolo shook head nay master think danger greater in first place know that have gone think far more likely that be hiding in house of one of friend have pretended to leave because be sure cardinal must take matter up in order that if be absent from paris when harm befell must not be brought home to suppose that next time will employ of own people be most popular among mob of paris who call king of market will have difficulty in getting a many dagger a wish from scum of faubourg must be difficult in extreme to prove that have aught to do with for may be sure that must really go down into country with speed moment deed be done in future master must not go out without having close behind a for others must put in ordinary citizen garb let follow twenty yard behind so a to be in readiness to run up at once must carry sword openly have pistol hidden under doublet might be a well at rate for present if a think beaufort be hidden in paris be certain will lose time paolo nodded will get men disguise at once have better be different macpherson can be dressed a soldier nicholl a burgher sandy grahame hunter a rough mechanic of course must not carry sword might take heavy cudgel must not walk together seem to have knowledge of other sandy might be ten pace behind nicholl twenty others thirty where street be wide must keep abreast of on other side be going to louvre evening yes cardinal said that queen wished must appear there must much rather have stayed away a doubtless affair behind luxembourg will be generally known by evening will feel position very unpleasant one though imagine that queen intends by countenance of to show have not fallen into disgrace for duelling such be indeed case eye be turned upon hector when entered royal saloon many of mazarin friend came up shook hand with warmly while adherent of beaufort vendome stood aloof from with angry face presently door opened queen closely followed by mazarin train of lady gentleman entered a passed hector stopped monsieur le baron de la villar said in clear tone be heard over apartment much a object to duelling determined a be to enforce edict against feel that in encounter morning be in way to blame that be forced upon be scandalous that one who have so bravely shed blood risked life in defence of france must be assailed in capital for what reason because proved faithful to queen minister have punished chief of aggressor will know how to punish who stood behind with gracious bow in response to deep reverence moved on little speech created deep sensation among courtier that queen herself must so publicly give countenance to young scottish gentleman must for one doubted to whom alluded even threaten one of most powerful noble in land showed how strongly felt one with exception of dozen person understood allusion to service that have rendered to cardinal felt that must be something altogether exceptional many of noble who belonged to party of beaufort cardinal came up congratulated received sign of impression that queen word have conferred upon quietly be very sorry for what have occurred said have killed many in battle be first time have killed anyone in private quarrel be not one of seeking be none le sorry a passed near madame de chevreuse made gesture to to come to did not accept warning said sadly remember storm be not past because first flash of lightning doe not strike be well aware of madam thank for warning be bound here by duty a tree be bound to earth by root can move at will to escape storm passing overhead must hear of fresh danger monsieur campbell said in low voice will have informed of be more probable that will not know be state secret must surely hear of in matter like none save concerned must be likely to know of until be over be always on guard night day can not tell when bolt may fall motioned to to pas on again a before hector accompanied cardinal a far a hotel then went towards own lodging paolo with hand on dagger keeping pace behind while four trooper followed one by one at distance street be almost deserted until just a approached inn number of rough men rushed out from side alley doorway hector have just time to throw with back to house draw sword paolo knife have levelled first man who approached then drawing sword took place by side of master ruffian stood round anxious to be first to strike yet fearful of meeting sword have a have heard mastered three gentleman run in at fool man in cloak with hat pulled down over eye keeping in rear of others shouted before order must be carried out there be sudden movement four men burst through joined hector assailant hesitated again man behind shouted coward there be six of be five twenty be such cur that be afraid to attack when be nigh five to one then with hoarse yell crowd rushed forward one be struck down by heavy cudgel three fell on pavement one tottered back disabled others took place for time little band be hardly pressed four scotchman fought stoutly although fair swordsman gained great advantage over opponent until betook to pistol when several of assailant fell not without inflicting wound paolo also fought well brought three to ground hector however took offensive before swift blade with deadly thrust opposed to fell back a one after dropped dead down with down with voice shouted be ye men thus to give way before single blade be man hector shouted back to set on others to fight when dare not fight whoever be be coward with fierce oath man pushed way through in front of drew sword threw back cloak to obtain full use of sword arm rich gold braiding of doublet confirmed opinion hector have already formed a to identity be better lord duke be at least more honourable to fight in own quarrel than to employ band of assassin to do work with roar of fury beaufort rushed upon be good swordsman personally brave rage neutralized skill after parrying two three of lunge hector repeated thrust with have that morning disabled de vipont ran assailant through shoulder fell back with curse kill kill shouted at moment there be cry watch watch four of fellow caught up wounded man carried off of others skirmishing with watch to hinder advance to inn hector cried to men leave matter to watch sheathing weapon ran on to door of hotel obtained entry there before watch came up a soon a have passed hector said come with paolo see cardinal there be fear of renewal of attack now do know who be wounded paolo asked a hurried along master be too busy to look round be beaufort ran through low down in shoulder paolo uttered exclamation of dismay can not be helped now hector went on there will be living in paris even in france after mazarin have not retired to bed when reached hotel what now monsieur asked have have second battle eminence have be serious one be attacked by five twenty ruffian slew ten of then leader who have be keeping in rear shouting to seeing that men be not likely to get best of pushed through attacked wounded somewhat seriously at least thrust be just below shoulder when tell that be beaufort will see that matter be serious indeed must not be worse cardinal said gravely will have whole of adherent of house of vendome banded against even bravery must not long triumph over such odds france be no longer place for
