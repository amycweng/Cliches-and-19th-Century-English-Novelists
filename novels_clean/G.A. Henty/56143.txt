lad said with effort at cheerfulness though thought of leaving school loved be painful one indeed will get on right somehow know there be never chance of doing anything brilliant though say that will not be sorry to leave rugby be nothing beside having to give up horse carriage sort of other thing will of course make wide difference to yorke father said gravely must be faced in right spirit lot have be exceptionally pleasant one up to present time hope that none of will repine will henceforth be a other clergyman having nothing stipend to depend upon will nothing be saved out of wreck john mr harberton asked must be a well to assume at once annie that will be lost can only trust when matter be gone into depositor who have trusted in bank will be paid in full fortunately be limited

patience contentment to congregation very many of whom have suffered heavily from agricultural distress what preach can practise without undervaluing advantage of money can show that have idea of grieving over loss one of greatest regret be that in future will be somewhat stinted in mean of helping neighbour next day accordingly rector wife daughter drove over to skating party although few knew how great be change effected in circumstance by crash at bank majority believed that report that greater part if not whole of rector private property have be swept away have be grossly exaggerated for there be nothing in manner appearance to afford indication of changed position yorke said that must rather stay at home when others started went to stable patted talked to horse have

good shot in time have doubt that must master yorke man said heartily have learned to ride well man with good seat on horse be generally good behind gun yorke harberton be a said nearly sixteen be typical public school boy straight clean limbed free from awkwardness bright in expression possessed of large amount of self possession a must have called cheek be little particular about set of eton jacket trouser appearance of boot a hard a nail almost tireless good specimen of class by britain have be built up colony formed battle field won class in point of energy fearlessness spirit of adventure readiness to face overcome difficulty unmatched in world thought be turned into fresh channel by conversation with william strolled away with hand deep in pocket mind busy well yorke what have be doing with be father first question when returned know have be doing anything father doe not mean that have be in mischief hope no boy laughed have went to stable first since then have be walking about garden be quite new amusement yorke especially in winter one of sister said in tone of astonishment fancy walking round round garden wonder will never cease well be quite a sensible anyhow lucy a tearing about grass playing lawn tennis on hot summer day like most boy of age yorke though very fond of sister regarded a mere girl especially objected to being in way a considered patronized by know dear mother said gently be not often do walk about garden by so be natural that lucy must be surprised quite natural mother yorke admitted frankly well have be thinking over something what conclusion have arrived at father asked boy hesitated will tell after breakfast to morrow said be too long to talk about now then asked question about afternoon have spent subject be not alluded to before until next morning although be chief topic of conversation between father mother night boy have something in head mr harberton said there can be doubt that very unfortunate business affect more seriously than rest of to mean quieter life gaiety little pinching to mean great deal more be change in whole prospect change in career think must have come anyhow yorke have never said that disliked thought of going into church mere fact that be topic always avoided be quite sufficient to show that heart be not in must in case have exercised strong influence in matter for unless man feel have call to vocation be better that must not enter now must be still more unwilling to put pressure upon certainly will not be able to afford to send to college unless must gain open scholarship must go far towards paying expense of see prospect whatever yorke be fool have great application school report show that although not at bottom of form be never more than way up if viewed merely a worldly profession church be now worst that young man can enter value of living have long be falling off owing to drop in value of tithe land number of curate be immensely larger than of living chance of preferment unless through powerful patronage be slight in other profession man value be in proportion to age in church be otherwise incumbent like having curate older than man of fifty will obtain le pay than one of five twenty see prospect whatever of improvement while class have become more wealthy landed gentry who may be considered best supporter of church have become poorer owing in part to fall in value of land to very heavy death succession duty must need much national effort to make real improvement in condition see hope of such national effort being made must not be greatly surprised if a result of cogitation to day yorke tell to morrow that have made up mind to give up idea of entering church must be sorry mr harberton said almost tearfully have so looked forward to doubt whether must have gone in circumstance husband said certainly must not have urged to do so have expressed reluctance be in opinion highest noblest career that man can adopt must be only taken up with highest motif yorke be good lad studious serious in disposition possibly have kept at home have tutor for must willingly have fallen in with hope wish be on very account sent to public school there be nothing more unfortunate than that man must too late discover that have mistaken avocation a be decision if be decision have be quickened by crash path to church be no longer easy for fancy while be away to day have be laying own plan for future be so young to have plan at john be nearly sixteen rector said decidedly public school boy of age have learned to think more for to be more independent than one two year older who have always be kept at home perhaps educated with two three others by clergyman have always taught to be self reliant have let ride horse generally act on own device a long a be in position to maintain advance in career might choose have right to very considerable influence over still retain right to advise to warn must no longer oppose wish providing that be not altogether impracticable must not let go to sea surely wife said boy seem to want to go to sea must certainly be sorry if set mind on that be too old for royal navy must afford to pay usual premium required for entry a apprentice a be called in good firm of ship owner must be sorry because must see so seldom otherwise personally have objection to life have younger brother in merchant service died few month before married death have nothing to do with sea service liked very much never regretted having entered however can wait till know what yorke say in morning when breakfast be over rector said now yorke come into study will have grand council now sit down comfortably went on tell exactly what have be thinking of be only natural that must have considered seriously change that unfortunate affair have necessitated a have plenty of common sense will gladly hear view about be evident can not go back to rugby father fear be case yorke see how must be done will have very small balance left after paying call will be made upon must set apart portion of income to insure life for benefit of mother sister in case must be called away at same time need not necessarily deter from carrying out plan of entering church took second class at oxford must work with at home push forward have doubt that bishop must ordain when time arrived thank father yorke said quietly more think of le willing be to enter church think that be fit for be sure must never make good clergyman can not fancy working for year perhaps among poor in manufactory town meant to tell so before long in case be sorry because know that mater have always wished be so must not press yorke father said in church above other career worker must be willing worker heart must be in if be not be far better out of have not surprised at now let consider settled suppose have be thinking of something else have be thinking of sort of thing father thought about going to sea be not sure must like besides want to get on want to be help instead of burden not of course at first in something where there be chance of making one way in case in case know what mean father might be able to provide home for mater girl quite right yorke father said encouragingly of course be very young yet be so far a know strong healthy man still life be always uncertain even if be spared for many year be hardly likely that will be able to make great provision for certainly will not be able to afford to insure life for adequate sum for comfortable maintenance will do best still be in hope that in meanwhile sister will be married provided for well what be thinking of yorke be thinking that a cousin herbert allnutt offered last year to take back to cape with for year two must be good thing to go out there if be to stay with for couple of year must have got to know country see a have be out there for so long must have lot of friend must be able to give plenty of introduction be near railway from cape town must know people up in mining district so might get good berth through what sort of post of course can not guess from what one hears young fellow who be steady so on be sure to make way of course must never think of settling down to farming a have done there must be plenty of other opening out there at rate will be able to earn own living to start with be more than must do here must thousand time rather lead that sort of life than take place a clerk mr harberton be silent for minute two greatest objection see to said at last be that state of thing there be very unsettled ever since jameson raid matter seem to have be getting worse expedition be very unfortunate one be ill advised premature be outcome of great wrong there be doubt that european in transvaal be abominably treated by boer still now that chamberlain have taken up matter something must be done doubt when white colonist be placed on same footing a boer matter in transvaal will be greatly improved cousin be saying that there be gold field yet untouched because amount of extortion on part of boer people necessity for large bribe tremendous taxation cost of powder other matter be subject of monopoly be so great that fresh industry be stopped existing one crippled when be abolished a must be sooner later there will be immense impetus to business may be two three year before matter be placed upon proper footing by time be old enough to avail of such chance thing may have settled down there will be rush of immigration know much about matter believe that steady energetic young men acquainted with country will have great opportunity from what cousin said boer have for year be quietly building fortification collecting arm can hardly think will be mad enough to defy demand of england for fair treatment of class call uitlanders especially a latter be guaranteed right of equality by last treaty well will think over yorke be quite new idea to at first blush be not inclined to reject there can be doubt that young fellow fairly well educated energetic above steady well conducted have far greater chance of making way in south africa than must have in older at least more established colony must be great advantage to to have two three year experience there before set out for benefit of allnutt introduction must doubt be considerable week passed before subject be resumed yorke felt almost like culprit mother sister have evidently be told about project went about house with face far more gloomy than have shown when first heard of bank failure yorke felt that girl at rate highly disapproved of plan kept out of way a much a possible at last be called again into study on occasion mother be also present have talked matter over very seriously yorke father began although at first mother be very much against idea have come to see that be probably best must be done under circumstance acknowledges that must be le anxious about than if be at sea see also that with somewhat restless disposition idea with have be brought up must really never be happy in london office even if must obtain berth there for in way have influence besides be two three year too young for have therefore agreed that at rate for time must not do better than be acquiring experience in south africa by time be eighteen will be better able to estimate chance of getting on there will then have acquired knowledge of world so must decide to come home harm will have be done for will not be too old to make fresh start in other direction be sure cousin will be glad to see invitation be very hearty one hope may remain with for time must not do so have doubt will make comfortable arrangement for elsewhere say because be sure that though personally must in way do best to make happy think be very strong man fancy from word that let drop that wife be head of partnership be dutch woman family be a told among leader of what be called africander party what wish intention may be really know for have scarcely given thought to matter seldom read cape news however know that hold that dutch party ought to be predominant at cape however need not affect certainly must have occasion to take interest in politics of cape for year to come well boy be very grave step to take own that doe appear to best be open to must turn out otherwise will have plenty of time to remedy will pay fifty pound into bank at cape in name so that if at time decide that have made mistake can take passage home again will certainly be none worse for having spent year two out there thank heartily father hope sha' come back like bad penny feel sure that life will just suit when have once learned to make useful on farm will have difficulty in getting employment elsewhere if a hope will not be case get on well with mr allnutt wife father say climate be very good yorke mr harberton said tearfully seems to terrible thing for boy like to go out there alone going to relation be not like going among stranger know liked mr allnutt when be here yes thought very jolly be sure will get on capitally with of course have fancy for going out when spoke to because thing be different thought of at once when began to wonder what must be best thing for to do must have liked to stay at home for time yorke mother said with quiver in voice father be of opinion that a be to go sooner go better think so mother horse will be sold next week must only be idling about house doing good must be just a painful saying good bye three month hence a be now yes must be looking forward to time besides want to see if like business whether think that will be able to get on if want back again in time for anything may turn up therefore in respect sooner go better suppose there will be much trouble about outfit will want two three suit of rough strong material coat made like shooting jacket with big pocket also flannel shirt good supply of stout boot strong stocking coming up to knee have better have trouser made knickerbocker fashion get couple of pair of soft leather gaiter will get double barrel small bore gun be coming into fashion now though must rather have twelve bore say smaller one make very good shooting be good deal lighter to carry will be time enough for to think of getting rifle in couple of year if decide to stay there besides a everyone seems to use rifle out there doubt will practise at mark mr allnutt will lend one will drive over to yeovil afternoon get measured for clothes mother will go with to see about shirt so on to morrow will write to donald currie people secure second class berth for more occupied be le time there will be for fretting will lose time in writing to head master stating why be obliged to take away dare say will have letter to write to chum from moment be busy in spite of assurance that cape be warm climate girl applied to knitting comforter mitten there be general overhauling of yorke clothes a white shirt english clothes must probably be required on sunday will not get more thing of sort father said be of use carrying about more clothes than want be likely that will outgrow have before wear out will give letter to post to mr allnutt a soon a land then can stop two day at cape town before starting wo come upon altogether by surprise hope will get on well with wife there be fear of getting hearty welcome from will tell that if after have be with short time find that wife be not pleased with arrangement a cordial invitation be given without consultation with must take to nice people english of course where work might do in first place must be considered equivalent for board for naturally whether stay with anyone else will have to work certainly father be what be going out for if be to work might a well stop here idle time away a at cape suppose one of first thing to do will be to learn dutch something of native language for although in farming one might be able to get on well without one must certainly want if one be going into business in mining region will get dutch grammar if can before start learn a many word a can on voyage might be very well worth while yorke believe that language spoken be sort of dialect call taal still be founded upon dutch anything that can learn of must help well will make point of working hard at father own idea be to go up to kimberley johannesburg when have be out couple of year with introduction from mr allnutt to store keeper manager of mine there then work way up of course expect to make much money for time will certainly lay by penny earn over above keeping do be too sanguine because if do will assuredly meet with severe disappointment mean to father once get into thing seems likely to turn out well will stick to patiently there be one comfort have read that out in colony men care what turn hand to one think worse of young man for doing honest job so that keep straight mean to keep straight be determined will never touch liquor of kind unless be ill under extraordinary circumstance must not make better resolution yorke believe that in colony even more than here drink be bane of too many young men be certainly obstacle to success with know cousin when be here said nineteen out of twenty of young fellow who go to bad after arriving full of hope energy owe downfall solely to drink life at back station be lonely there be entire absence of amusement be especially dull of evening temptation therefore to take drink to cheer up spirit be strong when have once yielded to man be almost sure to go from bad to worse experience ' said ' have known of instance where young man who resisted temptation to drink be complete failure may suffer very heavily from drought have misfortune over have control can keep head afloat so do fairly well in end ' native spirit be to say boer spirit cape smoke be called be vile be simply liquid poison however dutch be not drunken set very often drink to excess perhaps very badness of liquor keep from that being case yorke be evident that can not be too careful must be comfort to mother to know that have set out with stern resolution to avoid liquor except of course in case of illness in exceptional circumstance such a long journey in pouring rain when small amount of spirit may prevent bad consequence mr allnutt said that even then be more effective if stripped poured of into hand thoroughly rubbed with be good idea father will try under such circumstance week later after tearful parting from mother sister yorke went up to town accompanied by father who took on board one of castle line steamer remained with until went out of dock voyage be altogether uneventful there be several young fellow son of gentleman going out in second class yorke be three four year younger than of took to have pleasant time for three four hour day worked steadily at dutch received good deal of assistance in pronunciation from dutch gentleman returning home from visit who took interest in boy who so steadily sat apart from rest studied language yorke also made acquaintance of several of third class passenger miner carpenter other worker who have be back to old country to see friend from learned good deal more of colony than have hitherto known say that be not necessary to learn dutch one of said in answer to question if be going into store mean to farm in town be not much needed for dutch have much to do with other very few of be engaged at mine even in store treat a dirt under foot general idea be that wo be very long before there be change england be long while making up mind to see righted will do so day when doe will find tougher job than expects for past four five year have be importing arm ammunition of sort one can understand out there why england doe not put stop to will certainly pay heavily for in future boer have idea that can not fight be big mistake know with such great country with hill big hill too pass sort of thing boer who be mostly good shot will be able to make desperate resistance even if be only transvaal there be general idea that orange free state will join in case will be big job especially a there be dutch over cape colony who likely enough will rise also people in england seem to have idea what big place south africa be why be a big a england scotland ireland france thrown together can count mile by thousand instead of hundred fellow too have horse number of men marching on foot must not have ghost of chance of catching tell will be big business if ever begin chapter ii on dutch farm voyage have passed so pleasantly that yorke be quite sorry when be over acquaintance have made be going up country few to farm where have friend greater part to kimberley johannesburg where thought must be sure to find something to turn hand to three four be going on to

learn enough to make start with make feel like as if ca ask for simplest thing get understood in country under own flag after reaching hotel yorke made enquiry of english clerk a to hour at train for kimberley left found there be only two day that morning one arrived at brakpoort station destination distance of four hundred mile from cape town at twelve o'clock on following day letter to mr

with dozen fellow whose language one doe not understand know boer be not inclined to be civil while be out be chatting to man who have just come down from pretoria say that everything there looked very gloomy of course people have have hope raised owing to fact that case have be taken up at last by home authority be convinced that kruger who by account be one of most obstinate conceited old brute that ever lived will never give way inch that in fact will fight rather than do so indeed believe that be bent on forcing on war boer say openly that in year rooineks will have to go rooineks mean english so will be much more pleasant for to travel together heard just now trying to talk to coffee coloured servant saw that be able to make understand little so if want to ask question about

be of almost equal importance ground round retains moisture instead of rain rushing off being carried down in torrent before have have time to do much good however have idea of farming be sure that

used to be when game be plentiful of course shooting be not so important here a be in transvaal where man may be called upon at moment to go out on commando against native still be accomplishment on boer pride may find useful if stay in country for if one be to believe dutchman say there be likely to be lot of trouble out here before long not in part suppose uncle for so yorke have taken to call cousin know there may be row in transvaal surely not here know yorke if begin in one part there be saying how will spread believe that if transvaal begin war orange free state will join have not shadow of grievance be wholly independent of have always be quiet peaceful there doe not seem to be of ill feeling against english prevails in transvaal still there be never saying believe that steyn

be old man steyn must naturally be successor be why may be expected to drag free state into matter must there be row can hardly think that england must consent to let go be what do think yorke since majuba business fatal surrender afterwards despise altogether believe for moment that will fight be positive that if must venture to do so must thrash without slightest difficulty have accumulated enormous store of rifle artillery believe that a licked so easily when be unprovided with thing will be mere walk over now kruger will keep up correspondence with chamberlain until everything be absolutely ready then will break off negotiation there will be war be if england be bold enough to venture upon be boer idea of thing yorke will hear openly discussed up at house even in farm round here there be store of ammunition hidden away if war doe begin material advantage be gained will see whole country on fire from cape town to pretoria of course there be many of dutch of better class who must far rather let thing remain a be at present have ground of complaint against be free to elect own representative to make own law british authority be little more than nominal have not five thousand soldier in colony natal seems to that peril be very serious one there be nothing to prevent twenty five thousand boer marching into durban force of same strength capturing cape town force must be swollen a went man must be mounted must be armed with best rifle that money must purchase be good shot must need transport for must seize cattle of british colonist plunder store a went ask

idea of power of england than most of countryman belief england will not fight that even if doe will soon see impossibility of reconquering such tremendous country a really can not disagree with after what saw in last war from what know of preparation boer have made think be wrong uncle say that may be able to reconquer whole of south africa feel sure that cost england will hold cape durban other seaport for be of immense importance to let say more about lad be causing deal of trouble so hold tongue for ca afford to be on bad term with neighbour in constant hot water at home there be amount of ammunition in house so can practise a much a like there be plenty of spot among hill where can do quietly so far away from house that there must be chance of being heard of course must occasionally fire near for must seem only natural to wife that must like to learn to shoot when everyone else doe will be last day that will ride with always take han may look like fool think be one be slim a dutch say be be crafty if must turn hand to anything must have to do good deal more work than at present be like monkey know say must talk well enough if liked know that if did must be compelled to

distance on level broken ground from saddle on foot guessing a nearly a must then stepping at end of four month must judge very closely distance of object saw up to seven eight hundred yard be tolerably sure of hitting have practised too shooting from saddle after have be there short time mr allnutt seeing that must sit horse on farm have given one of own be a yet unbroken yorke took great pain in training teaching to halt when at full gallop to remain immovable while fired from saddle standing by used a rest for barrel must lie down when told come at whistle sire be english hunter mr allnutt have bought to improve strain of horse so that be faster a well a more powerful animal than native bred horse while possessing equal amount of hardiness endurance think be best ever bred said to yorke three month after latter have arrived at farm chose for especially because saw at once that must do credit that day might be of utmost importance to to be well mounted a to myself doe not make difference whether ride mile slower mile faster hour on whole prefer going mile slower besides see a relation of mine wish to do credit like to take conceit out of of dutch lad who think so much of know when be more pleased than when beat dirck jansen yesterday by twenty length be always boasting that have best horse in part of colony of course have advantage of being at least two stone

however need mind except fancy have made enemy may have trouble with by by dutch often forgive injury if can not avenge at once rankles in mind till see opportunity for wiping out chapter iii quarrel a time went on yorke felt position increasingly uncomfortable dutch farmer became more more aggressive in talk regarded war a certain spoke so scoffingly of courage of british soldier of easiness with must be defeated driven out of country yorke found well nigh impossible to hold tongue have often to leave room to prevent from breaking out be sorry lad cousin said to one day be trial to have sometimes to leave while be talking ca well quarrel with people a have to live among hope time will come when will have satisfaction of seeing mighty change in tone mind rest so much yorke said be middle aged men certainly believe what say have be so long with that be almost regarded a one of certainly take notice of being present have thought of hurting feeling be different with dirck jansen have be unpleasant ever since came now seems bent upon picking quarrel with talk at when be saying insulting thing about soldier people if stay here one of day will have desperate row with be just what want be afraid be so have noticed have even spoken to wife about be prejudiced in favour say that speaks more strongly than true afrikander must speak besides what good must come of having quarrel with be nearly nineteen two year older than be big powerful fellow be what be trying to do nothing must please better than for to give chance of thrashing be great deal stronger bigger than be uncle suppose that have slightest idea of boxing can use fist pretty well might get thrashed certainly must not be thrashed easily however be anxious not to have row sooner war begin can enlist better have stood a much a can do patience have pretty well come to end must not have put up with so much for sake happened unfortunately that dirck jansen came over next day with four five other farmer house be favourite resort for mr allnutt be far more hospitable than be custom always produced bottle of spirit when have visitor inducement of free drink be one few boer can withstand news be good dirck jansen shouted boisterously a rode up hear there be doubt that steyn will go with transvaal say that kruger will very soon stop fooling rooineks that have got everything now ready for kicking out of south africa must advise to be packing up at once young fellow wo have much time when get soldier on run wait till get on run yorke replied will be time enough to begin to brag then brag other said scornfully what can fellow who know one end of gun from do against there be good many who know more than a will find to cost dirck if be man enough to go out try there be who can shoot straight anyhow for instance dirck said scoffingly hear have be popping away among hill have not heard of bringing in much game care about shooting at thing ca shoot back in return maybe can shoot a straight a of can do do mean dirck replied angrily yes mean among others dirck jansen will try dirck shouted a dismounted certainly will be told be best shot in neighbourhood if ca beat who have only taken to lately may acknowledge that who shoot worse than will have great chance against englishman who shoot great deal better than see of insolent young fellow have challenged to trial of skill dirck said to companion must not have condescended to compete with for there be credit to be gained in beating boy want taking down be glad to have opportunity of doing now mr allnutt will leave to to settle distance mark say anything between hundred five hundred yard two hundred be general distance have for match what do say to two hundred yorke will suit very well though must prefer thousand boer have dismounted then let go out behind house mr allnutt one of said can easily choose mark there yorke went into house to get rifle soon joined went short distance then boer said that rock there be about two hundred yard away will make very fair mark must be difficult to judge be centre yorke said might give rise to dispute be so boer said gravely saw empty tin in yard bottom of will make very good bull eye mr allnutt shouted han lad be standing at gate of yard looking after have heard conversation dared not follow han wrench top off tin by kitchen door bring here then walked on to rock where in two three minute han joined with top of tin have be two pound tin circle be four inch across will stand very well on projection on face boer said will then be a nearly a possible in centre will tumble down time be hit han will stand near pick up again mr allnutt said have better be fixed boer remarked there be little crack in rock nail driven through tin must hold there be better to do thing properly dirck laughed by mean do properly though can not see why must trouble about farce a mr allnutt paid attention to speech said go take hammer han good sized nail cut bottom out of tin bring here too if three four hole be made question may arise a to be last lad ran off now mr van laun while be away may a well arrange a to how have better shoot how many shot will fire whether will shoot alternately one fire shot at one of piece of tin then other take new target think will be best then dispute can arise agree with how many time will fire after discussion be agreed that must fire ten shot now will be fair boer said to toss up for who will fire first what do say head will mean dirck tail lad do mean whichever win be to have choice ever win fire first coin be spun in air came down head when han returned one of disc of tin be nailed up at spot arranged then mr allnutt stepped two hundred yard dirck unslung rifle filled magazine han stood three four yard from rock knew that there be little chance of of missing stone although dirck have so far treated affair a almost joke be not disposed to be careless for quiet composed air of young antagonist seemed to show that latter must be at least fair shot must never have carried thing so far a soon therefore a have loaded rifle took place with greater seriousness gravity than have hitherto manifested put gun up to shoulder then lowered again be there time limit asked boer mr allnutt consulted together moment then latter said have agreed that there may be minute between of first five shot limit of two minute for reloading then minute between of last five shot dirck again raised rifle to shoulder almost instantaneously fired there be clang han ran forward pointed with stick have cut to spot near edge of tin a soon a retired again rifle cracked ten shot be fired well within time han took down tin ran with to group then going to rock fastened other there seven of bullet have hit tin fairly have cut semicircular bit out of edge other two have be outside circle hole be dotted about over tin with one exception none be within inch of centre be very good shooting mr allnutt said four inch be not much of mark at two hundred yard have done better dirck said carelessly fancy be quite good enough for purpose yorke now took place at firing point there be not breath of wind blowing a have practised so often at similar mark felt pretty confident that must do better than dirck have done shouted to han trouble to point out where shot strike must rather fire quicker first five shot went off at interval of only about ten second reloaded quickly again fired rapidly have not overrated shooting boer who have taken lead in matter said shot hit walked up in body to target a neared uttered exclamation of surprise ten shot have fairly struck tin be trick infamous trick dirck exclaimed furiously that boy must have punched hole before put tin up be not one showed a went along be lie yorke said know thought be in to take licking in good part fellow who boast so much very seldom stand being collared with howl of rage dirck pointed rifle at forgetting that have not reloaded pulled trigger a there be report threw gun down with oath flew at latter stood steadily a assailant be on point of closing with struck out with right fist throwing whole strength into blow caught dirck just on point of chin went backwards a if have be shot have passed so rapidly that others have time to interfere in moment ran in be sorry have happened leading boer said to mr allnutt dirck have be wrong altogether be aggressor be fairly beaten by lad who be certainly marvellous shot have be more thoroughly beaten now if rifle have be charged must have shot opponent so richly deserved punishment have got have better take lad away now will see to dirck then turned a yorke walked off with colonist assisted others to raise dirck who be half stunned by blow on to foot illustration yorke prof metal have behaved shamefully dirck jansen said sternly when found that young man must understand have brought discredit upon have be beaten at shooting by mere boy instead of taking fairly in good spirit first accuse of playing trick upon then try to murder now big a be have knocked silly be ashamed of han go fetch mr jansen pony now dirck will mount ride off at once will tell mr allnutt that will not come to farm again for time why there be murmur of approval from others dirck stood sulkily until han arrived with horse then picked up rifle slung over shoulder mounted rode off without word others walked to house be sorry to tell mr allnutt that dirck jansen have behaved scandalously have fair trial of skill with husband young cousin lad beat hollow then falsely accused of unworthy trick levelled rifle pulled trigger must have be murder have not happily rifle be unloaded then rushed to seize lad be knocked senseless by have apologized friend here join in apology to young fellow for gross conduct of dirck jansen trust that will not receive dirck in house so long a lad remains here seems hardly possible mr van laun that dirck must have behaved so must have be grossly insulted to begin with hear that shooting arose out of quarrel be not exactly quarrel though be angry dirck began by saying rough thing to lad who be not to be blamed because spoke up for countryman just a must have done other dutchman must have done have englishman spoken so of people be sorry to hear what say mr van laun mr allnutt said somewhat stiffly can not think that dirck must have have great provocation dirck be hot headed young fool cousin though be a nearly related to a be say so without hesitation for part be not altogether sorry that young english lad must have given lesson fact that be perhaps best shot round here have cocked up altogether unduly have in heart to commit murder to day for must have be murder if there have be cartridge in gun though must have be hard to testify against one of own blood must have said so in open court have be tried for act however hope will hear more of that lad will not meet again till dirck have come to sens will hear truth from of who be present at affair may be better for finding that be not such fine fellow a thought be mr allnutt did not reply be evident that sympathy be entirely with dirck farmer did not stop mounting horse rode off mr allnutt went out into yard a expected found yorke talking in stable to han latter be in high glee for hated dirck jansen who have sworn at many time when did not bring horse round a quickly a have expected be once on point of laying whip about shoulder when mr allnutt coming out of house seeing what be about to happen have arrested blow by saying sternly drop that dirck be not master here yet han be servant not yours anyone else will touch yorke be still talking when mr allnutt entered motioned to han to go outside be unfortunate affair yorke very unfortunate consider that be in way to blame that hardly make le unfortunate here have beaten fellow be proud of skill with rifle shooting certainly astonished for although knew that have used tremendous lot of cartridge in past six month have idea that have done to such good purpose in next place have floored a neatly a ever saw man knocked down have done with dozen of own friend looking on in third place have brought into disgrace with a story will soon get about will be terrible blow to pride now have never liked dirck be very bad type of dutchman in part though have doubt must pas muster in transvaal be rude overbearing although man may be yet at bottom good fellow think dirck be so will never forgive unless be greatly mistaken will try in way to get even with will not care what step take to do so now know lad have be talking for little time past of going down to cape town joining corp newly got up there when war break out be afraid will do very shortly tell frankly sorry a be to say so think will be better for to do speedily mean to morrow next day shortly be also sorry to say that affair will not make matter more comfortable at home know wife be very fond of dirck will take great deal to make believe that must be wrong in anything van laun spoke out straight to said that fellow be altogether to blame must see that sympathy be nevertheless with belief that be at fault in matter must go to morrow uncle yorke said must look like running away will stay at home for week then will go mind whether aunt be displeased with not be conscious of having done wrong if show that be no longer welcome will tell quietly that will only have to put up with for week may be unpleasant be not going to disappear a if be culprit afraid of dirck jansen right yorke can quite understand feeling be heartily sorry feel that must not hope to be comfortable if stayed here be sorry now that asked out here at time did not foresee that ill feeling on part of dutch must become so deep bitter have done so must not have asked knowing that wife be a prejudiced a neighbour need not be sorry uncle that invited here have have pleasant time have learned great deal if have not be out here must be slaving at greek mathematics at home whereas now if war break out seems almost certain will have most exciting time of when be over may see way of making start for mr allnutt did not appear at supper will tell uncle yorke said after talking matter over for time that will leave day week that if presence be obnoxious to will take meal apart be awfully sorry that presence here must inconvenience really can not go away a if have be sent off in disgrace be afraid to meet dirck jansen again quite right lad hope that aunt will be in better state of mind to morrow morning when once take thing into head be between a obstinate a mule well whatever may think of quarrel angry a may be at can not feel after what van laun said that dirck brought upon be fair minded woman when be cool have doubt before go will be really sorry for although acknowledge that affection be very strongly devoted to dirck have certainly during time have be here taken to good deal have several time said be wonderful how little trouble be in house have always be very kind be really very sorry that however innocently have incurred displeasure know that be so uncle if there be place near must go to without seeming to run away must leave at once rather than stop here where be not welcome trouble about yorke invited here ask to stay if wife in teeth of what own friend tell chooses to consider to have be in wrong ca help one else can will not attempt to argue matter with know that presently will see that have acted very unfairly towards hope that will even in time recognize dirck jansen be by mean what think matter not to whom leaf farm to must not like to see go to must not have uncle be curious arrangement old man left farm to child after if must have if not have power of leaving at death to of descendant of married sister whom might choose be at death to be valued must under management have increased in value increase be to be estimated by firm of dutch valuer whom named in cape town be to receive either in cash a mortgage upon farm sum fixed a increase in value old man saw that have good idea must improve place said to short time before death ' must not like to see change that tell wish to make have doubt that will increase value be fair that if daughter dy before must have benefit of work that have done so have have farm valued will be valued again by same firm if dy before will receive difference doe that seem to to be fair 'quite fair ' said will be same thing during lifetime have set down what farm have brought in for past twenty year be to receive average rental to be mistress a warned before married will have englishman master here may have use of one third of income to be laid out in improvement be to be a loan to to be repaid from extra profit of place thought arrangement although curious be very fair need hardly say that income be now four time a great a be when old man died money used for improvement have long since be paid off have laid by very considerable sum wife never talk about money matter have amount be annually made by father with run house spends a like asks what farm now brings in interferes with in way so that get on very well together if dy before will in addition to what have laid by have heavy mortgage on farm between ourselves be morally certain that dirck jansen if leaf to will never be able to pay interest for will work on old groove so far a work at in couple of year after take possession will foreclose have farm put up to auction in case hope that englishman will buy must certainly not remain in colony after death be plan have formed for yorke when be in england invited to come up be with vague idea that day might possibly succeed here mortgage will hold over property be larger than anyone must be likely to bid for farm thought that might therefore purchase in name since have be here have seen that must not do in first place must never be contented to settle down here have too much energy to take to life of farmer quarrel with dirck must alone render plan impossible there be enmity already established if after coming into possession of farm be turned out by must become deadly enemy must assuredly have sympathy of relation indeed of boer around therefore will not particularly care who buy farm pay off mortgage have be very much pleased with ever since came here what be two year ago only vague idea be now fixed intention will be heir at death have nearer relation have not felt attracted towards anyone whom have met except family of course may die before wife in case claim to estate for improvement have effected will drop though of course sum have laid by will not be affected opinion be asked on subject when old man made will willingly agreed to because seemed to fair one besides there be one at time whom cared particularly to benefit after death yorke who be greatly surprised at what mr allnutt said began to thank for kindness of intention towards latter said there be occasion at for must leave money to someone a like better than of other relation be only natural that must be heir may be good many year before benefit largely by be only three four twenty year older than be live healthy outdoor life may for aught know go on till be eighty however now that regard a heir of course will give helping hand when need when trouble be over have learned way of country be able to start business with good chance of success will be ready to give thousand pound to set up in if decide that must like to return home settle in england will have sum to pay expense at college such further sum a may be required to maintain until be in position to keep there let say anything more about now boy must advise not to go outside farm until leave boer seldom forgive injury certainly dirck jansen will not be exception to rule if have chance will attempt to do harm for example might pick quarrel with might come to shooting affray although may be better shot than be must not hesitate to fire first have example of to day so must keep out of way till go certainly will not come here for next week after what van laun who may be considered head of family said now lad feel tired after unusual excitement so may a well go off to bed yorke did not get to sleep for time be naturally excited a well a surprised at news of cousin intention towards felt that must make immense difference to in most favourable circumstance must not have hoped to save sum must enable to start for to obtain share in established business now cousin generous offer must enable to begin to climb ladder a soon a be qualified to do so a to alternative of returning to england going to university set aside at once liked life in south africa must not have cared to take up of student again with prospect of becoming hard working curate in poor neighbourhood year of waiting for brief a young barrister with business out there might soon be able to help at home to supply sister with pocket money most pleasant of to be able to present mother with carriage pair of horse such a used to drive before with such pleasant thought in mind at last fell off to sleep in morning after a usual partaking of bowl of milk bread started for ride round farm with han in attendance three day passed quietly mr allnutt have so far relaxed a to come down to meal although spoke a little a possible to yorke be at least civil on fourth morning took rifle went up valley to practise for first time since contest with dirck han be little distance behind a be on point of dismounting caught gleam of rifle barrel behind rock two hundred yard away did not hesitate for instant threw from horse action saved life for a did so shot be fired ball went through hat slightly grazing head a foot touched ground fell with face towards rock unslinging rifle a did so letting fall in front of still grasping close to trigger with almost imperceptible movement brought butt to shoulder then lay perfectly still face be downward from short distance seemed to be on ground in reality be able to look under brim of hat for two three minute lay thus then saw dirck jansen cautiously look out from behind rock for minute did not move then slowly rose pointed rifle at object behind latter did not doubt that be taking aim at han moment thought struck fired dirck dropped rifle exploded a touched ground fell forward few second later han galloped up be hurt master exclaimed shot thought that have not waited for until saw lying there then caught sight of dirck saw point rifle at thought be dead for although beat dirck be fine shot at three hundred yard must not have missed then saw rifle flash be bad business han tried to take life thought that have succeeded be near shave a see bullet went through hat be in act of dismounting fired inch two too high put hand on top of head when looked at be covered with blood be just a well said a han uttered exclamation of alarm be only graze if have missed altogether story might not have be believed now let go see what have happened to hope have not killed if have have time must have aimed at shoulder knew that in instant must have fired at just sighted pulled trigger went over to where dirck be lying have be hit high up in chest three inch farther up must only have broken collar bone yorke said regretfully even a be hope that may recover mauser bullet do comparatively little damage if hit vital point be certainly so with game now han lay down a before will ride back to farm send back help to bring in yorke returned to horse mounted rode back at full speed mr allnutt have just risen come out into yard what be yorke asked in

number of british officer have be quietly arriving that be a yet in ignorance of work have be sent out to perform at present greater portion be waiting for order be believed that most of must be employed in work of superintending transport on railway that if war really broke out many must be placed in command of body of volunteer to act a scout must doubtless be raised in colony everything be still doubtful yorke heard fear expressed that kruger must back down at last moment made up mind that must hing hurriedly have money enough to keep for considerable time be better not to make choice that might afterwards regret there be sure to be opportunity directly matter came to crisis among officer be many civilian men who have come down from johannesburg found be almost unanimous in opinion that kruger adviser be bent on war occupied several table lady with be dressed in latest style of fashion wore extravagant amount of jewellery guessed husband to be mining potentate speculator men whose fortune be already assured who must afford to contemplate worst must happen without anxiety after have finished meal went out stood on step of hotel until han came up must hardly have known for

nonsense han be loose everywhere though not so baggy a others by way have better keep others must be le likely to be noticed in if entered strange place than must be now care about being noticed han said must have a much right to be there a anyone else yorke laughed well han a have agreed to go with know very well that intention be if possible to get job with army can see that there might be plenty of occasion when might be going into place with where must not wish to be noticed day two after arrival a yorke stood on doorstep hesitating way must go young officer who be entering stopped looked hard at hulloa said be harberton be not yes be parkinson what in world brings out here why be quite youngster when left old school to enter sandhurst two year ago now be nearly a tall a be have be out here six month what have be doing have be at farm up country belonging to cousin of father a to what have be doing can only say have be riding shooting learning to speak dutch have learnt to speak yes can speak well enough to pas a boer in short conversation well come sit down in garden behind hotel tell about suppose be wanting to get up to front wherever may be a came out with good many men who will be employed in organizing transport other job of sort may be able to help if know something about what have be doing out here told old school fellow why have left rugby come out life at farm event have led to leaving suddenly have done awfully well parkinson said when yorke have finished story deserve to get on anyhow if can help will three week passed quietly a yet nothing be settled kruger reply to mr chamberlain despatch be more more unsatisfactory still general feeling at cape be that must back down at last moment grant term of suffrage for colonial secretary be pressing refugee from johannesburg be not of opinion believe mean to fight said one of group gathered in billiard room hope with heart that will now do so what doe matter to whether give suffrage to men after five year seven year residence in first place have always broken engagement if be to agree to five year suffrage must devise mean for cheating out of afterwards besides not one in twenty of uitlanders must take trouble to claim in first place must know that member might return for few town where be in majority must be swamped by representative of country district in next place know that if took oath to transvaal government must forfeit right of complaining to england of ill treatment position might be commandeered sent off to fight swazi other savage at moment notice no no thing be begun now have best be carried through cost will have to be settled day other sooner better there be general chorus of assent only hope said that there will soon be end of talk have be going on for nearly year now be not one day nearer to conclusion trade be at stand still boer be not fool enough to buy good when expect to be able to grab without payment a will do directly war begin han have during ride talk with yorke completely imbibed latter opinion a farm servant have previously heard little nothing on subject be therefore quite ready to accept companion view a to dispute especially a be serving under english master against whom have cause of complaint at cape town found nothing to alter opinion loyal part of population formed large majority there be far more outspoken than africander sight of soldier in street of flag waving on public building on ship of war same flag a have seen hoisted on farm on holiday confirmed feeling of loyalty be prepared to follow yorke in service might engage one morning when yorke came down to breakfast saw that something unusual have happened instead of sitting down to meal resident be standing in group talking excitedly went up to parkinson who be looking delighted asked what be news splendid harberton kruger have sent in most insolent ultimatum that ever be drawn up demanding entire surrender of claim withdrawal of troop giving only forty eight hour for answer of course mean war old fox have be fooling until be absolutely ready to begin expect will be crossing frontier at once certainly have troop can stop out here there be enough in natal to make fight of will have own way in cape colony until get troop out from england by time will have raiding party over country there be doubt that will be joined by thousand of dutch farmer ultimatum be glorious thing one can say that forced war upon put stop to negotiation settle question have got to be fought out now thank god have not got government will permit majuba surrender expect will have hard fighting for time what must advise to do parkinson care in what capacity go up must not like to enlist in infantry because must lose advantage have in being good rider being able to speak dutch must enlist in capacity in dutch must be useful have idea what of be going to do yet doubt general order will come from home to day expect that most of will be at once sent up line to see about forming depot to guard bridge thing of sort at rate there be not much chance of getting to know anything definite for few day butler head of department will be too busy to go into detail certainly one of first step will be to organize transport train without that must be tied to railway news have already spread through town excitement in street be great most people believed that war must come sooner later sudden outbreak be altogether unexpected there be however feeling of relief that matter have come to head at last that kruger have placed so hopelessly in wrong by insolent defiance still there be uneasy impression that course have taken be in own interest wise one england have be caught altogether unawares be true that few thousand officer men have be quietly sent out during past few month still there be force must hope to withstand fifty sixty thousand mounted men with whom boer must at once invade cape colony natal doubt be entertained that orange free state must join transvaal steyn be known to be most ambitious man to be in closest communication with kruger among staying in hotel who have come down from kimberley who have connection there be regarded a certain that one of first movement attempted by boer of free state must be to try to capture kimberley lay close to frontier line in evening yorke again met parkinson party of engineer be going up to de aar big depot be about to be formed there take with lot of kaffir to mark out ground clear be glad to hear that there be biggish lot of store already collected here only one train day will be open to public expect will soon be stopped tell will do harberton will take to colonel pinkerton believe will be going up to morrow to inspect line probably will for present take command along came over in same ship with be very good fellow will tell who be what can do what want to do at rate advice will be worth having thank very much parkinson moved away towards party of officer talking together waited till broke up then went up to one of talked for two three minute then turned motioned to yorke to come up so be school fellow of parkinson officer said yes sir be at rugby together be very much senior so want to do scouting business to carry despatch generally make useful say that be good rider excellent shot that talk dutch well fairly well sir well enough think to pas a boer in short conversation have dutch lad with upon whom can rely yes sir can rely upon absolutely there be doubt that must be very useful know good deal about sentiment of dutch yes sir at least of dutch for twenty mile round richmond brakpoort be almost to man hostile fancy from what heard be same in most district will think matter over there be hurry for few day if boer advance to morrow when time have given be up push straight on must certainly seem to be best policy can not move forward will have to stand wholly on defensive till reinforcement arrive from home to take store up country will simply mean falling into hand of boer if go up will certainly be glad to take with boy must be invaluable in way of obtaining information if be a sharp a say be trustworthy see difficulty in employing a civilian there be great satisfaction in cape town when news came that government have announced in house that arrangement have already be made for instant transport of seven thousand men from india two day later yorke received invitation to breakfast with colonel found third person at small table that officer have secured be mr latter said young gentleman of whom be speaking to major mackintosh major mackintosh be in command of one of local volunteer corp here at request mr harberton have arranged to give commission in corp to allow to be seconded for service a one of assistant think that will meet difficulty while on service will of course receive pay of rank allowance for horse forage boy must also enlist in corp will similarly obtain leave to go a servant will while on duty draw pay ration of private thank indeed sir yorke said gratefully thank also major mackintosh be more than have ever ventured to hope for have more pleasure in granting colonel request officer said inasmuch a be public school boy be etonian can quite understand eagerness to take part in business have large number of application for enlistment have doubt that a matter progress several fresh corp will be raised staff of officer be nearly made up have difficulty in granting commission a when be seconded for other duty will leave vacancy so that be mere matter of arrangement will send in name to day to sir william butler have better attend at once at orderly room with dutch servant to be sworn in then get uniform dare say know what be yes sir saw corp march through street other day of course will not want full dress uniform mr harberton colonel said will take up civilian clothes stand in dress of dutch farmer servant will do same will of course dress a farm hand when be away on scouting expedition certainly sir suppose can bring rifle with yes what rifle be lee metford sir be right must be of use taking up one must not carry government ammunition how long have be in colony mr harberton major asked six month sir have done well to learn language so quickly cousin with whom be staying sir married dutch lady a have be out here twenty year dutch be generally spoken in house spent whole time in riding practising shooting always have dutch boy with talk english talked when together in dutch a be anxious to learn suppose be accustomed to ride before came out here yes father kept three horse bred so that learned to ride a far back a can remember left school early for can not be past seventeen yet yes sir father be clergyman have good private income birmingham coventry bank in money be invested went to smash a living be by mean rich one have to leave school have be invited here by cousin when be in england year before be thought that must not do better than to come out to after being with for time try to make own way so left because thought war be coming on yorke smiled not exactly sir though have made up mind to do so if there be war really left because of row with dutch cousin of cousin wife think be partly jealousy at being established at farm actual quarrel be about shooting be very proud of marksmanship beat in trial of skill two day afterwards shot at when be out riding put ball through hat made sure have killed returned fire hit be afraid at first have killed be not dead when came away fortunately han boy be with be able to prove that fired first shot cousin said that have better leave at once for affair must create ill feeling among friend life must not be safe so off came cousin provided well with money so thought that before deciding upon what to do must wait see if war really broke out in case thought of enlisting in cavalry regiment might get commission day if did few year in rank must perhaps do good must buy out when be able to see other way to earn living be a wise determination a must have taken under circumstance colonel said few year in army doe man harm if be steady well conducted if well educated a be be certain to get stripe in couple of year life of non commissioned officer be by mean unpleasant one there be always chance of getting commission though be not very bright one a so many young fellow who having failed to pas enter rank with hope of getting one day then talk turned to probable course of war two officer agreed that if boer contented with holding pass into natal threw force be estimated at fifty thousand in five division ten thousand strong into cape colony must sweep whole country up to cape town before force must arrive from england to arrest progress that in advance number must probably be doubled by recruit from discontented portion of dutch population be in great hope that will besiege kimberley colonel said having of diamond mine there have always be sore point with free state one of reason for joining transvaal undoubtedly be to obtain possession feel sure will not do then possibly considerable force of transvaal men may knock head against mafeking be nearest point to pretoria be from there that jameson raid started may take baden powell who be first rate man went up to take command there ten day ago be sure to defend place till last even if doe hold out for fortnight time gained will be invaluable to time be everything in case fear that be going to be very big job certainly great deal bigger than anything have have since mutiny if must get boer together fifty thousand men might do a be may want double that number though think home government have idea that force will be requisite made usual hideous mistake of not being ready still greater one of allowing boer to obtain enormous quantity of rifle ammunition when government be first warned of what be going on must have put foot down told kruger bluntly that a must be arming in tremendous manner only for war with must not allow importation of arm into colony must have got up through loureno marque major said well then government must have gone step further must have told portugal that although did not wish to quarrel with insisted upon refusing to allow arm to be landed at loureno marque that must send military officer a consul there to inspect import that must station ship of war there to support a must be impossible for to allow port to be used a centre through military munition intended to be day used against might be passed up country if portugal refused a doubt must to submit to high handed action must probably have be supported by several european nation certainly by france in present mood possibly by russia germany in case colonel said must have have two alternative to fight lot of with fleet must do else to send five thousand men up into transvaal to komati poort so to prevent arm entering from portuguese frontier boer be then comparatively unarmed if a be likely have chosen to fight must have have fairly easy job queen have sovereign right there be great stretch of sovereign right to quarter troop in country however have doubt must have fought after surrender at majuba thought still think invincible affair must have be mere child play to what will be at present be difficult problem doubt for british ministry to face ought to have be faced be question of grasping nettle with majority a have got behind stronger men must not have hesitated to do so fire can be put out easily enough when once start if be left alone till have got big hold there be saying what may happen when there be strong wind blowing now han yorke said after having told news to follower have to do credit to to try look smart when be in uniform to keep long arm of yours from swinging about to hold head up to walk briskly smartly will do best master yorke han said with grin think will ever look like soldier have seen walking about street especially chap with trouser look so tight ca make out how can sit down be cavalry han wo be expected to look like fancy corp here wear white in summer be certainly not good colour for campaigning major said that there be talk of dyeing sort of light brown must show dirt must not want so much washing above must not make such conspicuous mark for enemy be same sort of colour a regular troop wear here in summer expect that in short time will take to instead of scarlet well care much how dress so long a let go with master yorke after going to head quarter of corp being sworn in yorke went to tailor who have contract for uniform found that major mackintosh have just come in have ordered that more uniform must be made for member of corp until heard again from must be next morning a have summoned council of officer yorke han be however measured tailor promised to put uniform in hand directly received major instruction to go on yorke have be invited by adjutant to attend meeting of officer listened to discussion be glad to learn that khaki drill be generally approved of a material for uniform of corp to be used with brown belt accoutrement wide brimmed felt hat of same colour a coat be introduced to other officer by major mackintosh who laughingly told that must make most of a colonel pinkerton have requisitioned for service following morning han be set to work drilling with batch of other recruit be not necessary in yorke case a have for two year be member of rugby cadet corp therefore knew a much of drill a most of officer thus when in cool of evening whole corp turned out be able to play new part satisfactorily colonel pinkerton have strolled down to witness drill gathering be very motley one for men be not in uniform class be represented be glad to see knew work colonel said to on return did not tell that knew anything of soldiering know very much sir be member of school corp for two year flattered be pretty smart of course many of fellow be meant for army be very keen about think took good deal of pride in drilling well though be not officer of course knew where officer must be placed in movement well will not want much while be with when be among soldier be a well to be able to show that know work of officer at present there be idea of volunteer going to front there be saying what may take place in course of few week if boer be sharp enough to take advantage of situation three day later yorke han started with colonel up line have two young engineer officer with colonel two horse yorke be taken in truck under charge of han colonel soldier servant train of provision store for kimberley mafeking be being sent up rapidly depot formed at several point along line have not be deemed prudent to send very far until plan of boer be apparent horse box carriage in officer travelled be detached from train at point be considered important here remained for few hour be then attached to train while colonel assistant examined culvert bridge made note of relative importance yorke made enquiry from british farmer a to disposition of dutch population han resumed clothes in have left farm under pretext of looking for situation entered into conversation with men of own class report naturally varied good deal opinion of english colonist be that although dutch sympathy might be strongly with transvaal boer few of be likely to take active step to join unless invaded colony in great force many of young men however be missing be generally believed that have started to join kinsman in transvaal many of better class of farmer who have be often at cape town where not few of have received education be much better acquainted with military power of great britain than be mass of dutch population sympathy might be be of opinion that in long run strength must over power that of boer that enormous amount of suffering damage must result admitted that have nothing whatever to grumble at under british flag acknowledged that government of transvaal treated uitlander population there in very different manner have government be ready to grant same treatment to a dutch of cape colony enjoyed there must never have be trouble think mean colonel said one day when be discussing report brought in if thrash boer colony will remain quiet if gain big success greater portion of dutch here will join doubt there will be trouble in getting train through be impossible to guard enormous length of line utmost can be done will be to have detachment posted at bridge whose destruction must cause serious delay can hardly doubt rail will be pulled up culvert destroyed for can be done by two three men working at night of course train going up will carry few rail couple of balk of timber tool three four railway men repair can be executed with only very short delay four day after starting party arrived at de aar have be selected a most favourable position a base at place line of railway from port elizabeth joined that from cape town seventy eighty mile down port elizabeth line be junction at naauwpoort middelburg road former with main line running up through orange free state to pretoria pietersburg latter joining line from east london at stormberg north of be branch to aliwal north crossing orange river at bethulie joining main orange free state line at springfontein might be intention of dutch later on so far there have be no attempt whatever to meddle with railway waggon train loaded with store went up in rapid succession on way met almost a many crowded with refugee from transvaal free state kimberley miner store keeper millionaire mechanic be closely packed with little distinction of rank yorke fellow officer frequently expressed disgust that so many able bodied men must be flying when on crossing frontier might well have gone to kimberley colesberg other place to take part in defence of town first blow have be struck armour plated train going up to mafeking have on th be fired at with gun derailed lieutenant nesbit soldier with have defended gallantly have at last be obliged to surrender from natal telegram be of still more exciting nature invasion of colony began few hour before ultimatum expired be expected that force under general penn symons must be attacked in course of day two loyal north lancashire have passed day after started four company have gone on to kimberley rest have encamped at orange river station many mule trek ox have be sent up large number of kaffir station at de aar presented busy scene wooden shed have already be erected by engineer be being filled with more perishable article such a sugar tea stack of bag of flour mealie of case of tinned meat be rising in open while everywhere be pile of store of kind lying just where have be thrown from truck on siding hour after yorke arrival colonel be occupied in fixing on site for battery be selected on top of rising mound near station from gun when placed in position must sweep surrounding country tent be pitched for party in speedily settled down now mr harberton colonel said that evening doe not seem to that at present have occasion for service here will trace line of fort to morrow morning train with four hundred kaffir will arrive evening will get to work by breakfast time then one officer couple of sapper will be sufficient to look after while will attend to getting thing in readiness for arrival of more troop so far railway between kimberley be still open be certain that will not be so for long think can be most usefully employed in riding through philipstown petrusville scouting between zoutpans drift thence to hondeblafs river colesberg bridge between place there be so far a know ford may assume that if free state men cross in strength will be at one other of point small party may possibly swim river attempt to cut line north at rate be well that must learn what be going on get early information of movement of of enemy party be in hope that combined advance on part will take place till have got gun mounted for at present be certainly not in position to offer serious resistance to attacking force fortunately free state men be not a well prepared for contest a transvaalers know by fugitive who have come down very many of be altogether opposed to steyn policy moreover be probable that will direct first effort against kimberley be a well to be forewarned can of course if think proper cross orange river in dutch disguise gather news there can get very little reliable information from fugitive seem to have swallowed wild report in circulation if be to credit account must believe that at least hundred thousand free stater be to say pretty nearly adult male be already under arm on march for frontier have faith whatever in such report believe far more likely that a fast a can be organized portion will march on kimberley that main force will go down through pass in drakenberg to join transvaal force in natal that think be point upon be concentrating attention at present intend to sweep out of colony before undertake serious operation on side think may a well start in morning chapter v scouting suppose be feeling more comfortable han yorke said a cantered away from camp on following morning know master yorke be getting accustomed to uniform thing feel bit loose a if must shake out of feel good deal same han so propose going to free state master think be just a well that dirck jansen be laid up with wound gave if have be be sure must have mounted ridden to join steyn men directly war be declared must have be very bad if have run against very bad indeed though did not think of at yes be unfortunate now that be known to so many of dutch farmer round richmond brakpoort must say good many of will have joined enemy suppose ever noticed very particularly for always kept out of way a much a possible when came a must not put up with abuse of english still of might recognize there be one thing always wore shooting suit brought out from home dutch clothes bought at cape town when knew work might have to do have altered appearance good deal wish now that have thought of buying three four of wisp of long hair that one see in hairdresser shop there if have fastened inside hat so a to fall down round on to shoulder must have altered appearance just a cutting hair short have changed must have looked like rough young dutch farmer from one of country district rode on little farther without speaking then went on suddenly have idea han horse tail be about same colour might very well cut off about nine inch must give plenty of hair for purpose only trouble must be fastening into one hat will stop at farmhouse a go along when get to english settler will borrow needle thread from wife will take out inside lining of hat sew hair in round except just in front then sew lining on to will keep tight han laughed will make look very much like what be before visited barber one must recognize third house at stopped found to be english settler a rode to door be in usual hospitable way asked to come in have something to eat be english like yorke said be serving a officer with force at de aar be going scouting to gather news of movement on other side of orange river may cross go farther a have be living for time near richmond may run against of rebel dutch who have gone to join so want to disguise come in sir will do anything can when saw riding up certainly took at first for dutchman see now that be far more clean fresh looking than generally be have many dutch joined from colony not so many about here farther on say good many have gone from colesberg that district most of be waiting for boer advance then think greater portion of will join from hear be arranged thing boer reckon confidently on being joined everywhere by own people be going to start to morrow for de aar will sell cattle there for if boer come will be sure to carry off hear commissariat be buying up for use of troop be giving fair price for so will be loser by will sell horse to also have not got

meal in room be quite evident that have idea at present of attack in force on de aar will not do for to cross at zoutpans drift there must be no inventing probable tale to account for movement will be great waste of time to go down to bethulie there be bridge near colesberg be good bit out of way very likely that will be guarded too be wrong not to have brought with english clothes then must have said be english refugee from bloemfontein there must have be hindrance to passing a be think must make up mind to swim orange river a came along bank there be several place where land sloped gradually down to water edge on side be case two three mile below drift will make for point can follow road for distance without much risk of meeting anyone for be evident that greater portion of men have be commandeered few who remain will have plenty to do on farm if must have bad luck to fall in with small party can give out be carrying order from field cornet for men at drift to be very watchful if british force be seen on other side be to ride off at once bring news here then telegraph to bloemfontein know by way whether story must not pas across drift must say that field cornet whose name luckily heard said that must do better service at present by crossing drift scouting on other side than in going on a there be not likely to be fighting at present especially a train must certainly be so full at edenburg that must not be able to carry on whole commando han nodded right master yorke must rather do than swim river for never swam stroke in life be told can cross river like by holding on by saddle horse tail have wish to try well will start first thing in morning before boer be about have not very long march before be not to start till eight will be off at daylight going downstairs told woman of house that must pay at once a have to be off early horse have be fastened up in little yard at back of inn there must be difficulty in getting out matter turned out a yorke have hoped town be still asleep when started although met two three boer riding at full gallop to join commando on march paid attention to fortunately at drift men who have spoken to evening before have be relieved by others who be where be going one of men asked han a usual acted a spokesman be going scouting on other side field cornet hatjens said that train from edenburg must not be able to carry commando will stop at fauresmith for day two a said wanted to be doing something ordered to ride here scout towards railway see if train with rooineks be going north especially if guard be stationed along line suppose will find out much will be something to do will have time expect to join others before start if get news will be telegraphed from fauresmith to bloemfontein then a if further parley be necessary rode on into water be soon on other side be long day ride to de aar got there late in evening yorke went at once to colonel tent to report can come in sir said a reached opening of tent certainly harberton hullo broke off a light fell upon yorke face why what have be doing to yourself recognized voice at once if have not spoken certainly must not have known yorke took off hat wig colonel exclaimed where on earth did get hold of be horse hair sir yorke replied handing hat to be examined thought possible that might be recognized by of dutch who knew when be at farm so cut good bit of hair off of horse tail got english colonist wife to make hat up a see excellent plan colonel said examining naturally be coarser than ought to be many of boer have very coarse hair difference must not be observed in casual inspection must certainly pas excellently after dark passed well yesterday at fauresmith at officer repeated in surprise yes sir finding must obtain intelligence of kind side of river crossed at zoutpans drift went into fauresmith be full of dutch commando having assembled there mingled with two three hour one paid slightest attention to have done well indeed before tell what news have gathered will point out to that doubt men be bent on discussing work upon be going to be engaged must scarce give casual glance at stranger that although hair might pas unnoticed there among must hardly be so be entering place where might be observed with suspicious attention think that idea of wig be excellent one must advise to write down at once to major mackintosh ask to go to cleverest hairdresser in cape town get to make wig imitating long hair worn by dutch say that be of utmost importance that must be a indistinguishable from real thing a possible a life might depend upon being undetected have best send up directed to a might be away will do so sir must not generally wear for most of men saw at fauresmith have hair quite a short a mine many of have almost close crop a get farther north chance of meeting of men from round richmond must grow smaller so there must be occasion to alter appearance there must always be danger of wig going wrong still will certainly get one must be wrapped up very small if must get into mess be hunting for must change appearance altogether if must slip on certainly must do so think that will be called upon to go in disguise when once move on will of course then have scouting party ahead will get information from kaffir sometimes perhaps from well disposed colonist now please tell about journey what have discovered be most satisfactory news most satisfactory be most important point at present there can be doubt that in day two communication with kimberley will be cut off place will become base of advance for relief immense amount of store must be collected here before can move forward doubt small body of boer will be hovering about be not likely to make attack indeed doubt if force must do so successfully still be great thing not to be obliged to spend strength on erecting strong earth work to feel that can work in security at same time be sorry that be evidently going to invade colony south of orange river from what have heard dutch population round colesberg steynsburg stormberg be likely to join almost to man country be mountainous will be difficult to drive out of round aliwal

at work then will move straight forward when see do so will descend from hill join a pas between of may be too far off to meet there will see track will follow till overtake have better remain here with han watch at work take han said when native have started that scouting for enemy be same sort of thing a crawling up to herd of deer except that deer be good deal sharper than men can approach men from side while with deer have not much chance to get near unless wind blow from towards be so han boer eyesight be sharp enough have not power of smell if be stalking must be best always to try to come up against wind for although must not smell horse might do so show sign of uneasiness well have stalked good many deer together fancy will help good deal with work here dismounting went with han on to eminence stood watching kaffir through field glass saw that a passed first small eminence one man separated from rest rode up distance then leaving horse ran up until nearly at top when threw down crawled forward with zigzag movement taking advantage of cover of rock sage bush next hill be wider longer two three men turned off beyond that must not perceive movement same thing be going on on other flank will do splendidly yorke said turning to han when start scouting in earnest want to get up anywhere near boer will have to take off blue clothes of own skin wo show a much on sand rock a clothes will after waiting for hour mounted rode slowly forward be joined a passed through dip in sand hill by five men from one flank four from other there be not time for who have gone

of parting yorke spent pleasant evening with officer of tiger started soon after daybreak next morning wearing uniform bundle containing other clothes being carried on one of four horse ridden by kaffir attracted notice whatever in passing through camp at bridge yorke have to show pas have received from quartermaster general on previous day ordering that must at time be allowed to leave enter camp enjoining officer of patrol detached party to render assistance in power once across bridge rode on at trot unmounted native keeping up without difficulty did not follow line of railway struck off to right a boer who might be on look out on top of kopje must be watching line be frequently patrolled for mile from camp in order to prevent from being torn up injured country on side of river be greener le arid looking than on plain south of riding east for three four mile across undulating broken ground yorke felt that have probably got beyond hill where watcher be likely to be stationed han now dismounted took off uniform dressed in boer attire kaffir be told to scatter made way a much a possible over rocky ground keeping mounted party in sight dozen of went ahead ascending elevation whence must get view of country round discover boer on watch be now travelling parallel with railway continued that course until a yorke judged must be nearly abreast of belmont spot be chosen in narrow valley between two kopje be thickly strewn with great boulder rock of size here kaffir at once set to work to build up rough wall where huge overhanging mass of rock formed natural roof six horse be given good feed be then allowed to wander about nibble grass leaf of bush growing thickly between rock illustration yorke surprise major yorke han took possession of rough shelter ration be served out with tinned meat handful two of mealie kaffir be well content a cloud be banking up for thunder storm soon found shelter for among boulder storm came up rapidly thunder be incessant for hour then sky cleared up star shone out yorke have procured stock of bread for han extra water bottle have be brought a major rimington have insisted upon taking two bottle of wine before starting made comfortable meal thought did not drink anything tea coffee master yorke han said when latter poured little wine into water in tin mug a general thing han can not get tea coffee at present water

week expect before time will join troop at belmont han must mind have story perfect be dutch from cape colony crossed river at colesberg bridge decided to come north to join cronje outside kimberley of course must be very careful a to where say live be pretty certain that good many of dutch from round richmond will have come to aid free stater know by sight who used to come to farm doubt know more wo recognize in changed dress must know name of farmer for many mile round must never do to say that came from that part of country have better say that came from near pearston be good sized place in east somerset district about way between two line going up from coast to middelburg be very unlikely that of dutch from neighbourhood must come up here will be waiting for boer to come down across orange river through steynsburg molteno before take up arm so that there will be very little fear of falling in with who must question very closely a to farm came from of people knew propose to go in among enemy at belmont be almost certain that although may fight there perhaps at of kopje farther on be at crossing of modder river that big fight will be time went into camp risk must increase of men who saw at one place heard story must be sure to recognize at next of course if remained with time shared in fighting retreat must be all right have not least idea of being shot by own men cut down in pursuit for there must be time to explain to lancer coming right at that be englishman holding authorization from lord methuen so will content time with telling off four of kaffir be to make way separately to belmont to get into conversation with kaffir driver teamster so on to endeavour to find out about how many boer be assembled there what gun have with whether there be talk of being joined by larger force whether know of place farther on where intend fighting if be questioned at belmont can tell story like can say that be working for english settler that a have left be out of employment want job must arrange among where to meet at night then after comparing note a to what have learned one of must steal away make way back here other three if have be hired to look after pony have better remain there retire with boer if retreat next day will send off to act exactly in same way so night will get messenger back men not engaged in work will scout country round visiting farm asking for work finding out whether more men be coming from east through fauresmith if there be band about who be likely to be making down to cut line side of belmont will scout along line of hill there may be party lurking among with intention of damaging line next morning at daybreak yorke informed kaffir of work be to do chose four of a first to carry out plan explained fully to manner in must proceed story be to tell have better draw lot at once said of be to bring news that have gathered tell same story two of can go in together can pretend have come from deserted farm other two have better say have come from one of little native collection of hut by river where there be boer there be sure to be waggon be probable that of native driver will have deserted boer will be glad to take on fresh hand be not at probable that of will be exposed to fire waggon be sure to be sent off a soon a troop be seen to be advancing in few minute whole party have scattered with exception of three men left to look after horse yorke han spent day in hard work climbing up to summit of highest kopje whence commanded view over lower hill near line of railway closest examination through field glass failed to show that there be force stationed on though on several single figure must be made out evidently posted there a scout at dusk save four who have gone into belmont have returned brought news of importance kaffir have fallen in with when questioned have heard nothing of further commando coming in from east stated that be believed that great number have assembled behind modder that be digging trench throwing up breast work on side of river general talk be that must annihilate english army when arrived there boer be disappointed that kimberley have not already be captured everywhere feeling of kaffir be in favour of british believed that have chance against boer yorke have brought candle writing material with at once sat down wrote report of news three hour later one of men returned from belmont report be that many of boer have be there for upwards of month that kopje have be fortified by wall of rough stone round summit that have be continuously occupied by lower class of boer labourer cattleman kaffir be not good at figure by careful cross examination yorke gained information that there be more men there than must make two of regiment have seen at orange river said that more must move up from behind when british advance began that leader richer boer must then arrive in cape cart on boer felt confident that british must never be able to storm kopje kopje be isolated hill apparently composed of rough boulder rock from be formed rising sharply above about belmont be seldom more than five hundred foot high in many case rose fully three time height be up two of lofty crest yorke han that day laboriously climbed a soon a yorke have written down information have gathered dispatched one of men with horse to ride back with to orange river yorke instructed man that when challenged be to reply friend with despatch then be to stand still till sentry called to sergeant who must send forward two men to conduct to proper authority who must pas on to head quarter three day be passed at same work then one of messenger brought back order for yorke to join troop on following evening at fincham farm half way to belmont troop must halt there for night advance to attack on following morning be from fincham farm that yorke have obtained water for men horse five of kaffir have be down there day in charge of han with horse to give animal good drink fill men water bottle there being water to be have yorke be glad to receive order for after first day news from belmont have varied little fresh party of boer have arrived not in great number although be believed that stand must be successfully made at belmont be intended that great a expected final blow be to be struck at party started early reconnoitred hill on way down late in afternoon cloud of dust be seen out on plain moving figure must be made out might have be sand storm such a sprang up nearly afternoon yorke have doubt that be army with waggon baggage when rode into fincham farm found rimington guide lancer already there hour later head of column marched in figure must scarcely be made out until be within few hundred yard of place so completely did universal khaki disappear in cloud of dust raised on arid plain over be marching yorke han have resumed uniform former received hearty greeting from rimington officer how have got on harberton major asked cheerily be be hard work by mean exciting sir be afraid that such news a have sent in have be of great use to general yes think have be useful saw quartermaster general yesterday said that scout be doing very well better than anticipated thank goodness work be going to begin at last so think there will be stand made by boer until get to belmont be convinced of that kaffir have searched kopje up to point beyond vedette two on of hill have force along line of railway side of belmont have strong body there from two thousand to two thousand five hundred a far a can make out have few gun also got near enough to make out with glass that be at work on three hill from four to five mile east of station gun be on two hill farthest east what be ground like behind will give chance of acting on line of retreat ground be very rough broken behind centre there be big range of hill not kopje still farther behind to right be flat ground where cavalry must act must have to pas through line of smaller kopje forming continuation of three principal one there be men on when be watching yesterday if must retreat across plain small body of placed there must check advance if not stop altogether then if understand harberton major said examining leaf of pocket book on yorke have roughly dotted down position must move along line of railway without boer being able to trouble from position occupy certainly major of course must be able to come down behind directly pas attack baggage train being mounted men must move very fast yes see that might give lot of trouble must think lord methuen must clear out before go farther yorke reported to quartermaster general be told to wait a general might wish to question further indeed five minute later be sent for general have only dismounted few minute before be now in room in farmhouse have before rough sketch of boer position that yorke have sent in on previous evening information have gathered be valuable mr harberton rough a sketch be have given better idea of boer position than have previously be able to gather from map do understand to say that if boer be prevented from making off across level ground to right rear of position must be thrown back across line of high hill be marked in map a mont blanc yes sir went up to highest point of hill so far a must see must have to go by road run round foot of mountain to south east that road might be cut by cavalry force making way round to south of three kopje from witputs station what be length of front along three kopje at present held by must say from five to six mile sir be about a far from right hand kopje to belmont station left southern kopje be good deal farther from line of railway have erected breast work on hill yes sir rough barricade of rock boulder horse be gathered on low ground behind kopje think will fall back at approach must not think must sir kaffir say that think absolutely impossible for troop to scale hill in teeth of rifle fire thank sir be attached for present to rimington guide be not have better continue with until kaffir can get to work again still have among boer have not yes six have obtained employment with instruction be that be to retire with that night one other must make off bring in news of what be doing said be to come in first place to major rimington a must probably be there general nodded thank mr harberton arrangement have be very good next morning column advanced to farm on road on western side of railway two mile from belmont movement for attack on following day be at once begun ninth brigade consisting of northampton regiment st northumberland fusilier nd yorkshire light infantry four company of loyal north lancashire two company of st royal munsters passed station took up position to north of three regiment of guard halted at house known a white house four mile short of station naval brigade have just come up after tremendous march portion of cavalry went on to town of belmont be nearly three mile beyond station while portion remained at witputs station unfortunately in arm force be extremely weak cavalry consisting only of two hundred fifty th lancer rimington guide have with th th battery of field artillery numbered in ten thousand infantry artillery five hundred sailor order be issued for troop to be under arm ready to move at three in morning from gun visible on crest of third kopje be called gun hill northern be christened table hill southern be locally known a kaffir kop guard be to march against gun hill naval brigade be to cover right of guard from attack by boer force from kaffir kop northumberland northampton be to attack table hill while other regiment of brigade be to form connecting link between guard be clear from instruction a kaffir kop be not to be attacked lord methuen plan be to throw back boer right force in retreat to move by road south of mont blanc so sever altogether from boer force farther north that complete success did not attend operation be due to difficulty of moving in dark across unknown country chapter vii belmont graspan modder be bright moonlight night when men set out on march order have be issued that absolute silence be to prevail that match be to be struck that order be to be delivered by sign not by word of command at halt men be to kneel down ground be undulating wherever be possible column took advantage of shadow thrown by rising ground sight of body of men moving almost without sound across sandy soil on foot fell noiselessly be almost weird occasionally there came deep rumble of wheel a gun passed over piece of rocky ground murmur of annoyance must be heard in column for knew how important be that must get a near a possible to boer position unheard grenadier led way in right column scot guard be on left rear two battalion of coldstreams be in reserve unfortunately position be not maintained scot guard came up abreast of grenadier distance to left grenadier instead of maintaining direction bore to left marched against kaffir kop coldstreams diverged still further to left thus instead of being concentrated for attack on central kopje brigade be scattered over front of two mile doubt effort of various battalion to find out others position delayed advance did not arrive until day have broken sun be just rising over eastern hill when grenadier came within three hundred yard of foot of kaffir kop suddenly gun placed on eminence to right opened fire at once roar of musketry came from top of hill while heavy flanking fire also opened from gun hill storm of bullet swept line many men falling at once while dust rose thickly around a mauser bullet pattered fast on sand order have be given that troop be not to fire be to carry hill at point of bayonet pause be short one joined by of northampton who apparently have also missed way grenadier fought way up hill boer here a at talana on other side lost heart a soon a found to astonishment that in spite of tremendous fire troop whom have despised still pressed up hill did not await arrival at crest fled precipitately down into valley behind took up fresh position on hill there while grenadier have be engaged in short desperate conflict scot guard on left have effected capture of central kopje rushed to attack a bravely a brother in arm boer on summit have opened a hot fire upon assailant a have defender of kaffir kop troop be not exposed to terrible cross fire consequence be loss be comparatively small on left fighting have be sharp enemy have thrown out outpost towards railway from table hill northampton be soon engaged in driving in at foot of hill however boer made stand have thrown up stone breast work held until northampton pushed forward to right so took defender of sangars in flank forced to quit position retire to hill two regiment then advanced to storm position defence of boer here be more feeble half hearted than offered at gun hill kaffir kop on gaining summit infantry halted until gun came up opened fire on next range of hill where boer driven from first line of defence have now ensconced keeping up continuous fire from among rock two regiment advanced seized ridge to south from boer have be maintaining flanking fire must advance farther for yorkshire munsters who must have be support have be withdrawn be unfortunate tactical error have be with brigade have be strengthened by one of coldstream battalion left must have pressed steadily on have driven boer by south east route where must have be harassed a passed by fire of guard brigade cut up by little body of cavalry have arrived there from witputs coldstreams came late into action attacked carried hill called mont blanc while aided scot guard to capture eminence to south of hill be aided by artillery by gun of naval brigade now after tremendous effort by marine sailor have be brought up enemy disheartened at manner in have be driven from position after position now gave way altogether only mean of retreat be to cross level ground to north east have there be strong force of cavalry with battery two of horse artillery under lord methuen order defeat must have be converted into disastrous rout half of little force be on other flank there be horse artillery although little party of lancer rimington guide attempted to perform work assigned to be unable to do so broken ground running north from table hill be held by strong body of boer who covered retreat of waggon gun in case must have overtaken flying horseman for charger be worn out by heavy work of scouting have carried on water too have be short since have left orange river after suffering good many casualty fell back battle be virtually over by six o'clock having lasted about two hour yorke have ridden with rimington guide from belmont a be on extreme left of fighting line have seen little indeed of combat that british be gaining ground be evident from direction from roar of battle reached when at order came for to advance have ridden forward eagerly until checked by heavy fire opened from low line of rocky eminence facing to have pressed on against rifleman hidden among rock must have be to incur certain heavy loss might have deprived army of already utterly insufficient cavalry force consequently colonel gough who be in command reluctantly gave order for to retire yorke have evening before handed over kaffir to medical department a stretcher bearer a soon a firing ceased be evident that battle be over rode across country to give what aid must in work found that greater part of british wounded have already be carried off by troop in ambulance waggon on stretcher by past ten infantry be already in camp by one wounded be being attended to in hospital loss of grenadier men killed wounded officer exceeded that suffered by whole of rest of division northumberland northampton have over casualty among men among officer of northumberland have by far larger share yorke after seeing last of wounded briton boer placed on ambulance be now free fastening horse to sagebush han ascended hill grenadier have won on reaching summit saw that have be carefully prepared for defence have evidently be occupied for long time wall be not a have appeared continuous be broken up into little enclosure fort sufficiently large for two three men to live sleep in straw old sacking brushwood formed bed in be generally to be seen ash of fire cooking pot meat tin fragment of bread other sign of continued occupation empty cartridge case littered ground everywhere while many still loaded showed how hasty have be flight of boer several dead body lay in little fort be for most part of men of lower class farm servant others with rough ill fitting clothes closely cropped head among however be few of very much superior class clean carefully dressed be quite exception yorke afterwards heard from prisoner that men of class generally sent on best horse rode in on spare animal in light carriage cart a soon a saw that fight be going against ran down hill jumped on to fresh horse rode off leaving unmounted men to fight die eighty three boer be found dead be certain that body of many of better class boer have be carried off when fell more than fifty prisoner be taken twenty wounded sixty four waggon considerable number of horse be captured next day wounded be sent down by train afternoon troop moved forward again knowing that boer force be collected at graspan seven mile to north ninth brigade naval brigade started in afternoon for swingspan while guard moved on somewhat later with naval gun armoured train baggage lord methuen intention be time to attack left of boer position be planted along low range of hill highest most commanding of lay on left ninth brigade with rimington horse lancer bivouacked at swingspan deep depression in valley surrounded on side by hill of volcanic origin march have be uneventful one cavalry have scouted ground in front of beyond beating up herd of springbok startling occasional covey of partridge scaring up little bird called dikkopfs sending lizard hurrying to shelter saw sign of life effect of previous day fight be evident from fact that although line of march be everywhere commanded by low hill shot be fired be difficult for troop gathered round pool to believe that smooth circle of hill around be age ago number of active volcano that pool might have be crater fact have be well ascertained fire be lighted soon burnt down for men be glad to stretch on sand fall to sleep a soon a kettle be boiled bread have be eaten picket went up to surrounding hill one of found in sangar field glass walking stick showing that boer have occupied short time before at three in morning troop be in motion again marched for five mile towards line of kopje three mile from railway station station bore two name of enslin graspan by of battle be afterwards called lancer scouted ahead while rimington guide watched hill on right at last enemy entrenchment be seen extending along series of kopje right be on two hill one lying on side of railway left upon high conical hill three mile to east of on ridge between be several gun through field glass boer must be seen hurrying towards eastern kopje against already perceived main attack must be delivered one of field battery at once advanced opened fire against hill armour plated train have moved to graspan station sailor got out two of twelve pounder gun leaving others in waggon a there be not hand enough to work presently be joined by two battery of artillery at half past six opened fire two company of northumberland acted a covering party rest be to line low crest to right keep touch with other battalion of brigade posted there to oppose movement might be made from boer centre of such movement however there be little probability a boer from point be galloping with haste to reinforce defender of hill be about to be assailed for two hour fight be purely artillery duel naval gun of two battery being answered by six gun hotchkiss maxim be well hidden from sight behind crest line be only by light smoke rose above that gunner be enabled to direct fire guard be in rear be held in reserve to take part in fight wherever service might be most required naval brigade be upon extreme right be upon that honour of assault be to fall entrenchment have be thrown up by enemy along whole range of kopje be evident that boer be in way discouraged by defeat two day before for very large body of mounted men be seen far out on flank in readiness to swoop down if recoiled in confusion after failing to carry position rimington guide be detached to watch keep in check force at eight o'clock two battery of royal artillery moved away to right to concentrate fire on kopje about to be attacked naval gun be ordered to withdraw a boer have now accurately obtained distance be keeping up tremendous fire with shrapnel upon enemy fire however be so incessant well directed that officer in command feeling that to attempt to withdraw gun must lead to annihilation of men engaged in work maintained position men throwing on ground at flash of enemy gun then leaping up working own piece so well be served directed that gun opposed to be gradually silenced naval brigade composed of two hundred marine forty blue jacket at last advanced in skirmishing order pushed round to right of kopje although be within nine hundred yard of not rifle be fired seemed a if fire of two battery have completely cleared out defender lancer have moved still farther to right to prevent body of boer coming down through break in hill there to take naval brigade in flank ground over be moving be completely exposed having gained desired position naval brigade now moved direct for kopje closing up somewhat a converged upon base when within six hundred yard from summit from rock boulder storm of fire flashed out hail of bullet swept line men lay down returned fire that of hidden foe enormously superior in number be not to be checked north lancashire who be following naval men completely lost sight of so great be cloud of dust raised by bullet ploughing up sand be evident that to remain inactive be to court annihilation captain prothero rn gave word for advance at double men leaping to foot rushed to within four hundred yard of base then terrific fire be opened from projecting spur men fell fast again made rush to within two hundred yard of base of hill prothero have fallen wounded ethelston second in command be killed major plumbe of marine called upon men who nobly responded be shot dead before have gone ten yard lieutenant saunders of powerful now rushed to front maxim gun have accompanied remained immovable one of men who worked having fallen reached base of kopje there threw down to breathe have left comrade nearly officer behind din be appalling two british battery maintaining continuous fire on face summit of hill yorkshire light infantry followed by north lancashire came rushing forward to support of naval men in open order with bayonet fixed marine began to make way up boer did not await onslaught deserted entrenchment rock fled greater portion making way along valley through ran road to north only few joining friend along line of hill in centre of position handful of desperate men defended rock to last be bayoneted there seeing that position have deemed impregnable have be captured boer began to retreat drawing off gun with again weakness in cavalry prevented pursuit indeed lancer rimington guide be too far away to be brought up in time for successful pursuit of mounted men who formed majority of enemy force a to unprovided with pony have to scatter over hill where cavalry must not follow lie hidden among boulder make off after loss have be heavy of naval brigade six officer ninety nine men be killed wounded yorkshire have fifty three casualty north lancashire twenty guard brigade be not engaged closed up at end of action be not called upon to fire shot two of yorke kaffir who have be away came into camp after battle be over have left waggon while fight be going on have hidden among rock until night fell none have gained information a to boer position on modder none of boer whom have heard conversing have be there have be told that british must never get across river even if did so must assuredly never be able to break through strong position at magersfontein where cronje intended to arrest further advance have heard that native have be allowed to accompany boer who be posted on modder river that new comer have be directed to graspan step yorke concluded be designed to prevent spy well wishers to british from seeing preparation be made reported a usual to quartermaster general be pity that ca get news a to what be doing mr harberton certainly have done be possible that way will try go in disguise sir if will give leave think there be chance that attempt must be successful be evident that cronje be determined that plan will be kept secret have doubt that must a have already done join commando wished with fair chance of plausible story being believed fact that new arrival be sent on here that even kaffir driver be not allowed to approach river show that ordinary story must pas muster for moment must simply be going to death have be tougher work than expected harberton one of officer of tiger said to yorke next day of course thrashed loss have be heavy a kopje be scattered over country may have to fight number of battle like see beggar only have to ride off on pony take up fresh position necessarily be kept at distance out of fire before can take up pursuit cross hill have be defending have got couple of mile start of besides horse be ever so much fresher than ours so must go on at game for very long time there can be doubt loss be much lighter than ours a be always fighting in open while be so hidden behind rock that get sight of until begin to bolt however will be stronger to morrow for hear that argyle sutherland will be up will good deal more than fill up vacancy caused by casualty at belmont here next day be passed in quiet on th after wounded have be sent off by train force moved forward to pool of honeynest eight mile south of modder march have be short for heat be great after halting troop revelled in luxury of bath fact that water be thick muddy scarcely detracting from enjoyment next morning one of rimington guide came in reported that have be fired at from apparently empty house near river hour later of yorke kaffir came in told yorke that boer with whom have be have made long detour after battle have arrived at spytfontein kopje found that there be very strong work there that be not strongly occupied have learned that part of force have day before moved towards modder that communication be allowed between spytfontein yorke at once went reported news be important officer said will be glad if will come with at once to lord methuen may a well bring native with general may wish to question further general indeed considered information of such importance that sent at once for one of rimington guide who spoke kaffir perfectly through asked native many question there can be doubt that news that main body of boer have at rate moved forward towards modder influenced in deciding upon course adopted have before be open to to leave battalion to hold railway bridge to prevent boer who might be there from crossing so cover line of communication while with rest of force made detour through jacobsdal making wide sweep a french cavalry did later on come down upon kimberley from north fact that large main boer army be massed if not at modder at place near altered situation river be fordable at many point be to move away cronje might throw whole force across crush detached battalion take possession of railway be therefore imperative that direct advance upon kimberley must be adopted quarter of hour afterwards general with two staff officer rode down to within short distance of modder appeared still there bank be fringed with bush few horse doubtless belonging to party of boer scout grazed quietly near mile away to right be hotel garden of village far beyond be hill of spytfontein magersfontein there be high ground two three thousand yard behind river to right of railway riet river joined modder sign of large body of enemy earth work other preparation for defence must be perceived although staff be within easy range of river bank not shot be fired lord methuen came to conclusion that passage must be opposed at most by comparatively small body of boer that not until have advanced distance must come upon position where cronje be prepared to give battle accordingly decided to lose time yorke have ridden out with party of rimington men ascended low hill from obtained excellent view of country riet came down at sharp angle to point of junction with modder be fringed on side with willow enemy lying along line must take in flank force advancing towards broken railway bridge even with field glass must see sign of life near bank albrecht cronje engineer officer knew work have done well very large body of boer have be at work night day for fortnight within line of willow bush deep trench have be dug from boer must fire with scarcely danger to gun emplacement have be formed on northern bank of riet modder have be so arranged that gun must be easily shifted from one point to whenever gunner discovered exact position got range house wall have be loopholed on hill behind very heavy gun have be placed battery have be erected on rising ground near village trench dug everywhere close to farther side of river nearly ten thousand men be lying down in absolute stillness eagerly awaiting moment when unsuspecting enemy must fall into trap so carefully prepared for transvaal commando held line from railway bridge far up bank of riet while west of bridge to village free state men be posted look all right one of officer with party said can not make out single soul stirring think almost too still one said there must anyhow be boer about must see moving if there be not imperative order for not to show be impossible to believe that will allow to cross river without firing shot that a have known for time past that be coming must have made preparation for defence perhaps only few hundred of be there said may have got such strong position farther on that prefer to fight there if be to keep from crossing must not have gained much if be to defeat somewhere on other side of river disaster might be terrible one for force must come down behind cut off retreat can never defeat first speaker said may feel pretty sure of boer be so confident in own fighting power that may very well believe that will do so of course disposition will be in accordance with belief not with ours there be general with two staff officer riding back see not shot have be fired at certainly look a if did not intend to dispute passage of river officer said though may have left few hundred men a rear guard when force retired be evident that boer prefer hill fighting at four o'clock next morning troop moved forward infantry leading way followed by cavalry artillery when reached level plain sloping gradually towards river three mile across advanced guard be fired upon by boer at extremity of position on riet lancer galloped forward in direction two battery following at seven o'clock opened fire drove boer from advanced post cavalry then threatened to cross river be forced to retire before heavy rifle fire took up position further back in order to cover right flank must boer take offensive three boer gun now began to exchange shot with battery one of be effectually silenced others fired only occasionally in meantime infantry have be advancing in open order to right of railway be nd coldstreams grenadier scot fusilier wing of st coldstreams on left of line be north lancashire yorkshire northumberland argyle sutherland highlander with battalion of st coldstreams in reserve on side be one battery of artillery naval gun took up position close to line so far lord methuen have reason to suppose that be opposed by larger force than have established on further bank of riet accordingly there be check to advance noise of battle there have ceased party of enemy must be seen in retreat cronje plan have so far succeeded admirably have led enemy to believe that have small force opposed to that be already in retreat therefore tempted on to plain where must be exposed to murderous fire along whole front must be swept also by strong force on riet not shot be fired until leading company of guard be within thousand yard of river when from screen of tree bush line of fire burst out hail of bullet swept plain though many fell confusion be caused by terrible surprise guard at once lay down steadily returned fire of invisible foe there be shelter to be taken favouring rock bush plain be perfectly even bare be fortunate enough to find ant hill between foe others scrub eight ten inch only in height most of lay on bare sand be well for that have marched that day without greatcoat for must have shown up clearly upon light sand whereas at thousand yard khaki clad figure must scarcely be made out by keenest sighted scream of bullet overhead be unceasing dust be knocked up a if by hail storm driven by mighty wind even above rattle of musketry roar of cannon quick thud of machine gun firing one pound shell afterwards called by men pom pom added new horror to warfare scot guard have suffered most from outburst of fire because be nearest to riet therefore more exposed to flanking fire of transvaalers there than be battalion to left maxim be almost immediately disabled by pom pom most of men serving killed to remain in position annihilation fell back few hundred yard to old reservoir grenadier nd coldstreams be fortunate in finding little protection under very slight rise in ground through day guardsman lay prone in position in have first halted to retreat under ceaseless hail of fire must have be a dangerous a to advance there be nothing to do to lie still suffer sun beat down upon with withering heat most of lay with rifle under for breach barrel be too hot to handle be parched by terrible thirst many be wounded water stretcher must be carried to through hail of bullet stream of ball from pom pom tried even more than bullet at time there be slight lull in firing slightest movement caught eye of watchful foe then broke out again with renewed fury be clear from first that nothing must be done on side of railway that coming of darkness must alone bring relief happily however thing be going better to left of railway two battery of artillery have galloped across to side pushing on with extreme bravery have opened heavy fire upon village boer entrenchment be exposed not only to continuous musketry fire to cannonade from boer gun on height more numerous of heavier metal than own maintained ground aided by four pounder of naval men at half past eleven however one of battery have to fall back having lost heavily having nearly exhausted ammunition twenty five horse be killed a dragged gun back officer charger have to be harnessed in place be due chiefly to artillery that day be finally won not only did keep down fire of boer marksman by hail of shrapnel shake courage of free state men men lying helpless be cheered by knowledge that gun might yet be preparing way for to advance to come within striking distance of lurking foe until two o'clock little progress have be made on left by sorely tried troop advance have be brought to stand still when reached point abreast of obtained by guard frontal fire be a heavy be not like comrade scourged by flanking fire for although party of boer have pressed distance round extreme left where there be rough ground afforded shelter be kept in check by fire of north lancashire at two o'clock relief be furnished to gunner by arrival of battery have made tremendous march from belmont have now come up in time to take part in desperate struggle at once came into action aided in sweeping boer position with shrapnel lord methuen moved a many troop a must be spared from right to aid in left attack where alone success seemed possible fire of newly arrived battery speedily drove boer established on extreme left across river fire from free stater in trench among willow on south side began to slacken affording ground for belief that here also be becoming demoralized by fire to be exposed be crossing stream yorkshire northumberland highlander sprang to foot with rush charged farmhouse strongly held have covered approach to drift boer here fled at once troop without halting dashed forward cheering loudly delighted that at last have become assailant closely following boer reached weir erected across river to deepen water above made way across holding by iron bar above feat be performed under tremendous fire though man after man fell behind crept forward until four hundred men have crossed established on northern bank two hundred of lancashire followed be great success decided fortune of day although for time still hung in balance general pole carew who be in command of brigade led along bank pressing on towards boer centre cronje however drew support from left after winning way for three quarter of mile pressure brought to bear against british be too great to be withstood opposed by greatly superior force in front suffering from flanking fire from entrenched slope above troop fell slowly back again maintained near dam against effort of boer to drive across so fight went on until darkness fell fire ceased troop must do more have be at work since four in morning without breakfast have suffered torture from heat thirst during long hour of inactivity have throughout day be exposed to terrible fire have be unable to return effectually general colville who have succeeded to command at half past five when lord methuen have be wounded felt that must ask more of contented with making preparation for passing whole force early next morning across dam pole carew have won in morning boer have gone with right turned free stater utterly demoralized cronje felt that must not hope to prevent main body of british from crossing in case must be placed between kimberley must be impossible for to regain position have so carefully prepared boer therefore silently left entrenchment have occupied marched away to spytfontein have men from free state possessed hardihood of from transvaal be morally certain that passage of river must have be effected military system north of vaal be vigorous though irregular made man soldier be shadow in orange free state at peace with neighbour fearing attack on good term with british government whose territory adjoined own to south west for most part to east save where basutoland wholly under british influence touched seemed there be occasion to maintain military organization have given up to peaceful pursuit although pastoral people be immeasurably in advance of neighbour north of vaal majority too wholly disapproved of war into ambition of president have forced in such mood might well be shaken by terrible bombardment have to face considering incessant fire to for twelve hour british troop have be exposed be remarkable that casualty must not have exceeded four hundred fifty of one hundred twelve be contributed by argyle sutherland highlander sixty nine by coldstreams even to troop lying helpless day hour have not passed more slowly painfully than to cavalry in enforced inactivity have dismounted to ease horse men officer of rimington guide stood in little group ready to mount at moment notice be awful one of officer said be simply awful one must think that not single man exposed to storm of fire must be found alive at end of day what maddens one be thought that might have be spared if have not blundered into a if have be going to picnic why if only troop of have be sent down yesterday afternoon early morning to reconnoitre must have be spared must have dismounted here made way down in very open order on foot say fifty yard apart pushed on till got to willow through to river bank better still must have entered willow to right here searched thoroughly right round across railway a far a village a turn out of course must have lost three quarter of number who got back must have told of hidden rifle pit fact that boer be gathered there in great force somehow be taken for granted that there must not be serious resistance even when troop went forward there be scout pushed out in front of attacking line have just fallen into trap set for be same at belmont at graspan only found out where enemy be in force when opened blaze of fire at be chatting with private in infantry who before joined army be volunteer in one of london battalion told that when lord methuen be in command of district there be one more particular than a to patrol being thrown out far ahead ground being thoroughly scouted be very popular for though strict be always kind considerate a to bravery there be question way in be exposing to day galloping about from point to point open to boer fire be splendid fancy staff will be thinned out before end of day fellow must be well in hand said must never have held fire when rode up to within four hundred yard of yesterday must have made certainty of picking two officer with off at distance if only dozen have fired must have seemed that there might still only be little party left behind beggar seem to have more idea of discipline than gave credit for must have be sitting a quiet a mouse until opened fire for watching bush closely with glass did not see a much a leaf stir so talked until saw rush of men of ninth brigade down to river although must not make out exactly what be doing concluded by gradual disappearance of troop roar of musketry that must have succeeded in crossing river relief be intense men shouted cheered waved hat in greatest delight officer joined in lively argument a to what be likely to take place agreed that must be next to impossible to move troop over to support who have crossed for by own feeling of exhaustion brought on by hunger thirst heat excitement felt sure that troop who have gone through far more severe ordeal must need food drink at least hour rest before must again take up stern work at same time saw that if boer hurled on little force on other side of river assistance must be sent whatever state of men might be have only to call for volunteer one officer said doubt if man must hold back after what have gone through must almost galvanize dead man into life to know that there be chance at last to meet face to face men who have be making target of expect boer must be nearly a done up a be be in place before daylight although suppose bullet have disposed of many of nerve must be so shaken up by artillery fire ca think there can be much fight left in know that fire on left have be slackening for time fact that fellow have be able to fight way across be proof of besides a saw at last two fight lose heart directly see retreat threatened must know that will be cut off altogether from place have fortified farther on if can maintain footing for success on left must put between kimberley chapter viii dangerous mission next morning portion of troop crossed modder rest moved down encamped on south side of river first task to be performed be sad one of collecting burying dead that of carrying off wounded have begun a soon a slackening of boer fire permitted stretcher bearer to move about on plain many of soldier a soon a have quenched thirst have in spite of fatigue assisted in work by midnight have received first aid from medical officer for there be sleep for night be engaged in attending to more serious case by twelve o'clock next day greater part of wounded be ready to be despatched by train a soon a yorke have seen horse picketed with of rest of corp have eaten few mouthful of preserved meat biscuit have gone down with major lindley surgeon of guide many of men officer aided in carrying in wounded on arriving with first batch at hospital said to surgeon who be busy at work can be of assistance sir yes can help if will be very short of hand a so many of men have to go down with wounded from belmont graspan if will keep supplied with water sponge lint bandage will be of great service be trying work to yorke unaccustomed a be to such scene several time felt that must go out for few minute to breathe fresh air stuck to felt well rewarded when in morning surgeon have be attending said heartily thank warmly sir have saved great deal of time have be of much assistance to be surprised that have be able to go through with for even to accustomed to hospital work have be very exhausting on leaving hospital marquee went away to quiet spot dropped on ground slept for hour then went to camp of guide most of be already away scouting having duty to perform walked down to river crossed by dam by men of ninth brigade have effected passage on previous afternoon men not engaged in duty of burying dead of preparing for important work of throwing pontoon bridge across river by gun waggon must pas be cleaning accoutrement cooking bathing in river while many of argyle sutherland highlander be seated at edge of stream dipping leg in water have suffered more severely than other regiment of brigade advantage of trouser over kilt have be abundantly proved on preceding day from fact that dark kilt have shown up while companion in khaki be almost invisible casualty be heavier than of other regiment leg have be so blistered by sun ray that many be almost unable to walk on passing through street of village yorke met head of intelligence department latter stopped ah mr harberton said kaffir failed when most wanted have one of brought news that whole boer strength be here must have saved number of valuable life be sorry indeed sir yorke replied know one who came in before battle did bring news that kaffir teamster others be allowed to go near modder village have to make detour on way to spytfontein yes know did be pity now that did not take news more seriously be always difficult to rely upon kaffir evidence man might never have gone way at might have got up story a excuse for not bringing in news when lord methuen rode down close to river saw sign of life in place now a to yourself understood from colonel pinkerton that have specially joined with intention of scouting carrying despatch did sir have very good horse can ride be light weight speak dutch well enough to pas can get on in kaffir tongue must be happy to undertake duty with might entrust want message carried into kimberley there will probably be delay of fortnight before can receive reinforcement will enable to attack enemy with hope of success in strong position be said to occupy will undertake to attempt to get round will consider honour to do so sir must go in uniform a dutch farmer think in uniform must have more risk of being taken if captured must have right to be treated a prisoner of war while if go in disguise must have doubt shoot a spy be not a if wished to gather news be question entirely of speed of evading observation very well mr harberton where be horse be over at major rimington camp sir well will send mounted orderly for in meantime can examine map be by mean perfect at least will afford indication especially when approach kimberley runner brought three day since sketch map showing position of boer round town when get there will certainly be of value to one of sergeant will make tracing for will see despatch be to carry have better get by heart so that if be pursued find likely to be taken can destroy for must doubtless be searched so thoroughly that however well might conceal must be likely to discover now let look at map entering house where have established office passed through room in non commissioned officer be at work entered one behind here be map said see boer position round kimberley be much closer together than on side for until crossed modder must be naturally considered that be from side relief be expected that messenger might come go on side there be also great many of be thick round wimbledon thicker still between scholtz kop spytfontein must of course be intended rather for resistance against force advancing way than for offence against town there be two here however standing to right of road between place town there may be patrol thrown out on road be probable that there be here be principal danger between road railway town of wimbledon there be entrenchment marked of course may exist kimberley people be only able to send post can make out with glass by fire a see ground be very rough broken must probably be very difficult to ride across in dark if be to leave road may say that small party of cavalry have be out morning seven eight mile along road encountered opposition be fired at several time by party on hill be certainly likely enough that come down on to road after dark will send dozen trooper a escort with for first four five mile must say sir that must be best for only to ride for few mile then to dismount make way on foot if will allow will send note by orderly who fetch horse to two of kaffir bidding accompany here one of especially be very shrewd fellow eye ear be much better than mine must send one of back with horse take other with have compass must be of use in dark might lose bearing altogether if by myself for must not venture to strike match must be very good plan mr harberton please write note at once have already sent for mounted orderly yorke at once wrote note to major rimington officer commanding in absence begging to send two kaffir ugly jack long peter with orderly who must bring back horse while orderly be away studied map when officer returned from head quarter with despatch be written in small character on strip of thin paper learned by heart stated that army have after engagement crossed modder that must not advance until joined by reinforcement now on way asked for intelligence might be gathered by besieged a to boer position force enquired a to state of provision in town how long in case army failed to arrive must maintain stated that large reinforcement be on way out that buller have so far failed to relieve ladysmith hoped that must soon do so that boer be making little way in invasion of cape colony added bearer will give further detail a to state of affair be directed to colonel kekewich after business be concluded yorke be invited to join staff at lunch be not sorry to do when be finished be asked to dine with also a must not be able to start till after dark many of boer rifle have be picked up great quantity of ammunition have be left in trench collected arm be to be destroyed yorke at luncheon asked officer to give order for kaffir who be going with to take one of be quite certain said that if be caught will shoot native whether be armed not think man ought to have chance of at least trying to defend life will give order for to take one have better be put in office till start must have trouble with officer met think that a say be only fair to give man chance though suppose will be of much use to for be not likely to be good shot even with ordinary rifle must know nothing of working of mauser must show how to work in five minute yorke said if can not shoot must load a fast a must fire officer smiled fancy if get cut off mr harberton best plan must be to tie handkerchief to rifle in token of surrender possibly might then content with taking a prisoner of war while if be to shoot of others must not be very likely to respect uniform want to fight certainly yorke said must not think of resisting unless saw chance of doing so successfully a for instance if be seen chased by two three mounted boer when be getting near own line yes in case rifle might be useful boer have considerable respect for single man with good rifle in open however hope will get through unobserved certainly will have more chance to night than must otherwise have for will be even more tired than men a probably marched night to spytfontein moreover have wounded to attend to will doubt be very much down in mouth at being turned out here where felt absolutely certain of holding own still cronje must not have have anything like force here of men who stopped in line will be sent out to watch road to night lest must push forward brigade to relieve kimberley on going out yorke found that kaffir have arrived with horse peter said in dutch be going to try to get into kimberley want to go with have chosen for two reason in first place because know that be good man in second because be only one of party who have be in town for told that have worked there for two year be willing to go be very dangerous business for if be caught boer be not likely to show mercy will go baa man said speaking a usual in dutch if can go can if be killed will be killed danger be greater than mine peter will be in uniform may take prisoner must be certain to shoot kaffir nodded shoot sure enough baa will go with will go in dark suppose how must find way if be alone must not keep on road boer be sure to keep watch there feel that peter if be not for must not risk anyone else life mean to ride first part of way jack will go with so far bring horse back take to major rimington line will give letter to han to tell to look after till come back can not go with too baa man asked must be of use jack more there be of more chance there be of being seen now here be order on supply store for two day ration draw at once go back to camp fetch spare water bottle got at de aar bring four of two for of may not be able to get through to night may have to lie up at hiding place till be dark again will get hold of biscuit tin of meat having now finished arrangement yorke went down made inspection of deserted trench of boer be generally four foot deep like at graspan have evidently be tenanted for day be for most part seven foot long four foot wide have be untouched since occupier have fled for there be nothing in to tempt soldier to search have difficulty in finding couple of tin of meat a much bread a required be littered with empty cartridge case showing how large be provision have be made how steadily boer have for hour maintained fire there be too pile of still unused cartridge own bandolier be full put a many a must carry into pocket in afternoon went to office where have placed mauser rifle when have by officer order be handed to put own rifle in place slinging mauser on shoulder went out again presently found two kaffir squatted near horse be feeding with bread have picked up calling peter to follow went into quiet spot among tree be going to carry rifle peter said one have got on shoulder can shoot can shoot with common gun baa know that thing doe seem to have hammer be mauser be gun boer use will show how work for if must get into trouble there be only few boer might fight see slip holding five cartridge breech open like push five cartridge into magazine close with bolt gun be ready for firing five shot without removing from shoulder when last shot be fired reload a before see how do now let see try pull trigger if be to fire must alarm camp after dozen attempt kaffir learnt knack of loading firing gun have plenty of cartridge here have better go look in boer trench will find score of bandolier lying about pick two out one for one for fill with cartridge when start will divide have with will amount to something like two hundred shot apiece be going to leave rifle here take mauser a cartridge wo fit gun here be two tin of meat enough bread to last for day in case can not get straight through have to hide up get hold of piece of stuff to tie up in bundle can sling on rifle fill four water bottle with best water can find take out of river be likely enough that there be good many dead boer in now there be nothing more for to do before start have better watch horse by turn take down to river give good drink hour before sunset will find plenty of blanket in boer trench take couple of cut up into strip before get dark fasten thickly to horse hoof so that will make noise on road fasten roll of on to saddle will twist round boot when dismount then will be le likely to slip in climbing over rock now have one more word to say to if must be surprised by boer find must be taken be to escape if possible death must be of benefit to if be killed must not forgive for having brought with now quite understand that be absolute order at same time when have escaped may be of immense service be to remember that of course if be kept prisoner at spytfontein must find altogether impossible to get near if be sent to pretoria might follow at distance possibly aid to make escape so see must be to interest a well a own that must get clear away kaffir who have looked sullen at first part of instruction brightened up understand baa a long a baa fight peter will fight when baa say ' peter will run off do what can to help afterwards yorke now returned to office asked one of sergeant there to look after own rifle till returned then went to heap of boer weapon picked out mauser being now ready lay down slept until sunset then went in to dinner after meal be over colonel took in to general quarter said be mr harberton sir be going to start in hour so with despatch for kimberley do know country mr general asked sir be taking with one of kaffir who have be there for two year worked at dutoitspan be say on side of town not far from beaconsfield so that know country round perfectly have confidence that will be able to guide in especially a ground for last few mile be flat of course will leave road when have gone few mile make way across hill will be hazardous journey mr harberton admire spirit in undertaking such mission understand that speak taal well a be going in uniform will be no great advantage to if succeed need not say that will have rendered very great service will not be forgotten be just service have hoped must find opportunity of performing sir when volunteered to undertake work of scouting obtaining information instead of enlisting in one of regiment at cape town yes hear rendered valuable service to officer in command at de aar by going in disguise to fauresmith discovering that boer have intention of attacking base for be thus unnecessary to draw body of men from other point to aid in defence of place must not advise to endeavour to return by road by came although will be best judge a to seems to that must be easier to get out by other side make detour across river somewhere near douglas then make for honeynest kloof so here above tell colonel kekewich privately that be by mean certain that will be able to force way past spytfontein lord methuen will try to do so after what have seen of boer style of fighting here there be assurance that will succeed for position by account be very strong one of course will be impossible for now to travel far by road from here boer position extends across best chance be to strike across country come on road from jacobsdal whether be posted on line not can not say certainly lie beyond main position will hardly have neglected altogether yes sir be route propose taking well wish good fortune safe return shook hand with yorke at eight o'clock yorke started horse hoof have be effectually muffled have be provided with countersign passing through picket rode off kaffir trotting by side have told officer in command of picket one of must return with horse in course of hour after proceeding about four mile glow of light must be seen here there on scholtz kop short distance to left of road be following also away farther over on same side on hill of spytfontein be reflection of fire in trench where boer be cooking supper smoking pipe flame betrayed position held by hill seemed lit up by faint glow be time to turn off peter yorke said reining in horse may have outpost on road a must be keeping quiet might get in among before noticed although be still nearly two mile from boer position must distinctly hear in stillness of night faint continuous murmur such a might be made by waterfall stream running among rock knew to be talk of thousand of enemy have be conscious of even before reached turn in road whence saw light for own advance have be almost noiseless kaffir be running barefoot horse hoof have be so well muffled that footstep be more audible than of native be now time to dismount send horse back yorke handed animal over to native who be to return to camp when get half way back jack yorke said take off blanket from horse foot so that sentry can hear approach if be to come up quite silently did not hear till be close to might fire hastily therefore lead horse when get near line strike up song not too loud so that can hear hundred yard away when challenge be to say when call 'who come there ' answer a told then will let pas though may keep until officer come a spoke to on way out will pas through go right into line near modder mile outside lead horse off road wait with till be daylight must be challenged by sentry in camp if be to enter in dark good fortune to baa wish be going with jack said then led horse away now peter continued yorke work begin first thing be to put strip of blanket round foot have better put on own shoe muffle otherwise might lame among rock must be fatal to native did a be told then said let stop little baa listen there may be boer on hill have to cross stood for minute two listening intently there be men up there said did hear voice heard click a if kettle have hit against stone be certain that there be of up there not many perhaps certainly there be men there have better go back little between hill next will walk first follow quite close to can see in dark much better than can if there be rock in way will stop then put hand on shoulder will lead between show where to climb across right peter trust in entirely for must not see stone size of head on ground took four hour of severe work before came down on jacobsdal road ground have in many place be covered with rock boulder through must have be hard work to pick way in daylight quite impossible in darkness for yorke have not be for guidance assistance of peter sometimes have to climb rough precipitous hill more difficult still to descend boulder strewn slope in spite of care of guide yorke have have several heavy fall have cut hand knee seriously damaged garment now will follow road baa have better not there may be party moving between jacobsdal boer line round kimberley reinforcement coming down to jacobsdal from north must not travel at night peter said positively boer can ride day nothing must make go out at night if must help boer sleep like pig well will keep to road for bit then must like to push on a fast a can for have sixteen mile to go yet have lost lot of time in getting across here if be to take to rock again there must be very little chance of getting through boer line before daylight have gone about mile when native stopped men on road baa be sure quite sure baa heard one strike match walking very carefully must presently make out dark mass ahead of waggon baa peter whispered at once left road moved couple of hundred yard to right then stepping with greatest care continued way parallel with road must hear sound of voice a two three boer talked together occasionally movement among ox must not make out outline of waggon see in direction have be moving guessed that be party of boer from north moving down to strengthen jacobsdal might be convoy of store from town for use of force beleaguering kimberley for next hour progress be very slow for have to make way through thick bush needed greatest caution to avoid being heard by party on road be not that feared being hit by fire sound of rifle shot must put boer within sound of on watch greatly diminish chance of getting through a soon a be quarter of mile beyond waggon came down nearer to road again here there be bush ground be thickly covered with boulder of size at time hill approached so close to road that be obliged to take to for while whenever be case went at trot a be now abreast of line of boer fort took to rock again a soon a possible twice heard party of horseman coming along road hid up until have passed mean to be caught napping peter yorke said be evidently uneasy have doubt be well prepared along spytfontein line can not be sure that will try to break through way may believe that will attack jacobsdal making wide circuit enter kimberley from north in respect might be better plan have doubt general have well considered although might get into kimberley way without fighting must be worse off when got there than be on modder have not sufficient store collected yet to provision kimberley for length of time fighting other day showed that have not enough men to defeat whole boer force stationed among kopje so that must be completely cut off with enemy between force coming up to assistance steadily plodded on keeping for most part along road stopping frequently to listen several time peter declared that there be boer among hill on side of once twice even yorke must faintly hear what judged to be snoring in stillness of night air at length even keen ear of native be unable to detect warning sound declared that must now have passed outside line have done with now peter till get near round town went fast now for night be nearly over sky be beginning to lighten in east when leaving road ascended hill saw level plain stretching before be too late to get through yorke said quarter of hour will be light dark mass of house see there must be nearly three mile away yes baa be beaconsfield kimberley be more away to left can just make out what will do now baa go back bit hide go on to little house mile away close to road think have best go on must have to go good bit back to place where boulder be thick enough to give good hiding place will certainly be light before get there indeed be afraid will be light enough before can gain that hut if there be boer on look out on kopje to right started at once have gone way when found that distance have be deceiving that be nearer mile than mile to hut being white washed have seemed much nearer than be light be broadening out rapidly ran at top of speed just before reached place shot rang out from low hill four hundred yard away for moment yorke hesitated knew that where there be boer there be pony that must be overtaken long before must reach british camp have better fight out here peter firing may bring up help can certainly keep boer off for time illustration race for life hut be twelve foot square rough building of loose stone with light roof apparently have be made for occupation of men working on road have window door stood open now peter get to work get stone two out on side so that can fire on enemy hole must be a small a possible if can make one two on side so much better will bring stone from outside to block door up then will help rolled in block closed door placed against then set to work to make loophole wall be loosely built so that in two three minute have made satisfactory hole in front of hut while peter have already made one at back be lucky that did not run on yorke said a looked out there be dozen mounted boer coming along from behind hill work away peter have better have two hole one on side of door will show fellow that mean fighting when come little nearer be sure to draw off talk will give plenty of time to get ready for when mounted boer be within four hundred yard took steady aim fired one of fell headlong from horse others reined in sharply before must turn rifle spoke out twice man fell third swerved in saddle evidently hard hit others galloped off fourth cartridge in magazine did work man fell yorke recharged rifle stood in corner then aided peter hit baa have killed three wounded one said quietly will make careful anyhow have learned that can shoot there be men coming down hill baa very well then do go on with work will check bit too went to loophole native have completed twenty thirty men be coming down hill lesson given to horseman have not be without effect on also for be taking to what cover boulder bush afforded waited till got good view of man making way from one shelter to a fired boer fell headlong dozen rifle flashed in reply two three bullet went through roof be only of felt spread over light framework others pattered harmlessly against wall look out occasionally to see what mounted men be doing peter there be little chance of fellow on hill making up mind to try rush across open ground though may be good shot chance of getting ball through hole two inch wide three high be not very great must be a well to make two more so that can move from one point to peter soon finished work may fire now baa asked eagerly yes make sure of aim have fired about twenty shot at least eighteen have told certainly eight counting at horseman have be fatal be what keep so quiet number of miss must encourage always rest muzzle of rifle on bottom of loophole have best fix upon man watch shelter where be lying then wo be hurried can fire directly move change position well done exclaimed two three minute later when a peter fired saw boer pitch forward while native raised triumphant shout for hour exchange of rifle fire continued wo move till be dark yorke said at one o'clock then will be dangerous time will be able to creep up to door blow in when get dark baa best plan will be for to slip out run will keep on firing will think that be here when have got good start will run too boer on foot must never catch a to mounted men must not find in dark must hear must not hear must always find bush boulder where must hide if came way will not do that peter unless give solemn oath that will not stay more than five minute after have gone be good runner too will promise baa want boer to catch if be to stop firing must guess at once that have gone will fire very quick sometimes out of one hole sometimes out of other so that will think there be two of must stop minute two after have done firing then come up very slowly cautiously only fear be from mounted men who will be out on plain a soon a be dark chapter ix kimberley boer fire slackened a day went on for besieger have learned that be death to raise head above rock there be originally hundred boer on kopje of eighteen have be killed twelve wounded proportion of killed being so great in consequence of majority of wound being in head messenger have be despatched to from hill on other side of road hearing that there be only two men in hut aid have be sent to be now lying waiting for night for none dared ascend hill again exposed to deadly fire from defender one other of have remained at loophole day not shot have entered for boer have fired too hastily to take accurate aim roof be riddled with bullet be getting dusk when peter held up hand listened then threw down putting ear to ground what be peter horseman coming baa many horseman yorke ran to other side of hut must see nothing at first for night be fast closing in have just said that in quarter of hour must be dark enough to make start soon saw dark mass be fast approaching for moment stood irresolute then shouted hurrah be friend be riding abreast if be boer must be riding anyhow pull stone away from door mass halted a spoke then two horseman galloped forward towards hut who be there voice shouted in english yorke opened door darting out placed on side facing despatch from modder then feeling certain that boer two hundred yard away must not be able to make out figure in gloom called to peter together ran forward number of shot be fired whistled overhead boer have also doubtless heard approaching horse be firing in direction forgetting for moment two men who have day kept at bay in couple of minute yorke peter joined rescuer be glad indeed to see sir officer said a came up have heard firing going on day must make out that came from point a did not know how many boer be on kopje must not go out to see about till became dusk be there only native be then may a well be off at once for though think boer can make out at distance may get stray bullet among at moment will mount behind thank will run alongside keep hold of stirrup leather very well will break into walk a soon a be out of range of rascal then will tell news gave order troop faced round went off at trot maintained until boer fire have entirely ceased tell how got through line be possible that that native alone have kept boer off day firing sounded heavy at time thought that must have considerable force there after first outburst be for most part only dropping fire there be about hundred of must say yorke answered happen to be very good shot kaffir be very fair one consequence be very soon learned that be death to show head mounted men came out first waited till be within two hundred yard four of horse went back riderless did not show again have be duel ever since between men on hillside advantage being with a loophole through fired be couple of inch wide at opening stopped rush at once have be in hiding ever since heard that lord methuen be advancing to relief how far be off crossed modder river day before yesterday a near a be officer exclaimed then may indeed expect to see soon be there fighting there thought heard faint rumble on day might have be thunder at great distance have fought three battle first at second at graspan third on modder battle on modder be very severe lasted whole day be afraid wo see here a soon a expect have have upwards of thousand casualty in three fight have only about ten thousand troop with after way boer fought on modder will not march until be joined by reinforcement coming up a position at spytfontein be said to be very strong think will be twelve day fortnight before move forward five six regiment be on way up heavy naval gun store be being pushed forward a fast a possible train can only run during daytime a dutch along line might at moment pull up few rail blow up culvert so that even if general did not wait for reinforcement must have to wait for store ammunition three battery fired away nearly have consumption of ball cartridge be also very heavy then boer fought stoutly fought stoutly a be in deep trench scarcely caught sight of man during whole time there be very great credit in have heard from prisoner that free stater be for most part placed in rifle pit on south side of river a have be dammed rendered unfordable have choice in matter did give way at last compelled whole force to fall back transvaal men be never really attacked be only on left that there be possibility of advancing so have lost thousand altogether officer said about ten per cent of total strength be pretty heavy fighting suppose considerable proportion be only wounded yes doctor say that mauser bullet make very serious wound unless hit vital point know that be quite surprised at rapidity with many of wound be healing that men seem to be recovering from injury at first believed to be mortal what corp be yours be kimberley light horse be three hundred fifty strong suppose be right here at present oh boer must be fighting great deal better against methuen than be doing here annoy bit by throwing shell into town have cut off water supply have raided lot of waggon cattle blown up de beer dynamite magazine be great loss a will put stop to most of work at mine last be result of mayor timidity about explosion if dynamite have be taken down into mine must have be in absolute safety water seems most serious item well be not a serious a look lot of water come into one of mine enough to keep big pumping engine at work anyhow there be sufficient to supply animal with drinking water though authority have have to forbid use for watering garden sort of thing be first battle like be same in case boer be entrenched on kopje a must not leave in rear have to storm fighting lasted very short time grenadier in first fight naval brigade in second lost very heavily modder be quite different boer be hidden in bush fringed river have on rising ground behind number of gun fighting began at five o'clock in morning be not until nearly five in evening that regiment on left got across river maintained there till dark boer fearing that whole force must cross in middle of night cut off retreat retired silently carried off gun won passage of river be in way decisive victory so have have fighting yet very little on th made sortie with one troop of men of cape police forty of fellow stormed one of redoubt brought in thirty three prisoner be encouraging though major scott turner who commanded be wounded led out again day before yesterday must just hear low rumble guessed that methuen be fighting so thought must be well to keep boer round here prevent sending reinforcement to spytfontein expect boer have thought that must be likely to make such move for be prepared for gained ground at first be soon on spot in great force rifle fire be terrible poor scott turner be killed twenty one of fellow twenty eight wounded so be bad affair altogether think will try more sortie of kind if have be for dare say must have come out directly heard firing after experience of mauser fire must have be folly to get within range of unknown strength of boer posted on hill so waited till there be fair chance of succouring whoever there might be without running extraordinary risk have anxious day of did not seem that considerable force must have got through yet be evident that whoever be be able to hold ground must make out little hut with glass seemed to that be point against boer be firing though at distance must not see smoke of rifle firing a did from side facing hill have by time reached line of defence now sir officer said if will mount horse one of trooper will ride with to commandant quarter will bring horse back with colonel be in office during greater part of day passed time at look out at wesselton mine be erected on top of mine head gear hundred twenty foot above level lofty look out commanded view of whole country round yorke be shown in at once have honour to be bearer of despatch from lord methuen sir yorke said a came have managed to get through boer have done well indeed did come alone came with kaffir scout be one of small party under order have be two year at work here know country well must never have got through without have stood by most bravely day ah then be firing that have be hearing officer in command of light horse sent message to say that intended with permission to go out a soon a be dusk to ascertain if possible cause of firing bring off party who might be defending against boer of course be willing that must do so anxious a be must not run risk of losing number of men by sending out force by daylight take seat sir while go through despatch general evidently think said when have read that know have be taking place outside know nothing beyond fact that column under lord methuen be advancing from orange river station now will be obliged if will give full information a to what happened between time left arrival on modder yorke gave full account of movement battle boer be making much stouter resistance than expected of colonel said when story be brought to conclusion now tell if please how managed to get through here yorke then described adventure very good indeed sir admirably done kaffir must be good marksman indeed to have a say killed eighteen of wounded twelve others distance be short not over two hundred yard a be in almost perfect shelter have to expose to fire at must scarce miss hitting now sir have message to give privately despatch be think intended to be made public must think fit to do so a encouragement to inhabitant moreover if fell into enemy hand must do great harm have verbal message from general colville who be in command while lord methuen be temporarily disabled told be to give to privately a must not be desirable that everyone must be aware of be to effect after desperate resistance offered by boer at modder river fact that only portion of force be engaged there be quite possible that attack upon very strong position hold at spytfontein may fail in case there may be long delay a attack must not be renewed until large reinforcement arrive from england be therefore anxious to know exactly how matter stand here what store food have how long consider that can possibly hold out upon that movement will necessarily depend if be approaching period when starvation must oblige to surrender effort to relieve must at cost be made if not must not repeat operation even if successful can only be effected at immense loss might lead to being in turn beleaguered here can quite understand anxiety on score colonel kekewich said a to holding place have fear whatever have five hundred lancashire three hundred eighty kimberley rifle volunteer ninety five men of royal artillery one hundred eighteen diamond field artillery of cavalry have three hundred fifty kimberley light horse be armed be paid by rhodes three hundred cape police one hundred fifty diamond field horse besides have town guard comprises greater part of able bodied men about two thousand eight hundred so that altogether can oppose attack with four thousand eight hundred men of whom must be sure be trusted to fight best think there be chance of boer attacking believe can starve out of course must do so in time feel sure that can hold out for month de beer people got up quantity of provision before line be cut large firm at cape town also sent up great supply have cattle enough to go on for time when be used up must take to horse flesh will obtain rough account of store for to morrow will be best for to learn by heart for if boer who have fancy idea how be supplied be to learn fact might move away for few day to strengthen cronje at spytfontein in event of lord methuen failing to break through might see that be wasting time here leaving enough to keep methuen in check might send five thousand men on raid into colony whereas at present be keeping that number idle here suppose wo be starting again at once sir be feeling pretty well done up for have not have much sleep since night before attack on modder besides must like to see defence so must explain situation to lord methuen will lend copy of plan mr harberton say lend because must not do for to take out of here for must be very valuable to boer if be to fall into hand will place horse at disposal to morrow be sorry to have kept talking time must be famished indeed sir brought tin of meat bread out with ah well will be better for dinner mine must be ready by time hope will join there be bed upstairs at disposal will tell to give boy something to eat too a soon a dinner be over yorke went to bed slept till next morning when obtaining permit signed by commandant authorizing to go wherever pleased made tour of fort round town several of be placed on great heap of debris from mine commanded wide view over country heap be very steep on outward face have not be deemed necessary to erect serious work on crest breast work of stone have be thrown up to protect men from rifle fire must boer venture to make attack ground round town have be cleared of house must interfere with line of fire native hut have be levelled bush cleared away so that enemy must have to cross open be exposed to musketry artillery fire be great advantage from point of view of defence on other hand be equal disadvantage to british when made sortie against enemy a latter must lie hidden among bush while men have to advance across open search light have be established on lofty top of one of mine work at night swept circle of cleared ground so that be impossible for boer to crawl up to make sudden attack barricade have be formed across street leading out of town one be allowed to pas in out after nightfall be hoped that in way boer sympathizer in town must not be able to carry news to friend outside in spite of precaution however there be doubt that throughout siege enemy be aware of be done in town there be few visible sign of bombardment though here there house in ruin showed that shell have burst inside town be full of people for although of wealthiest men have left before siege began place be filled by hundred who came in from house outside line be to be held from farming station in surrounding country many too have moved in from outlying suburb of kenilworth from part of beaconsfield must be most exposed to fire of boer gun number of kaffir have also come in so far bombardment have effected comparatively little damage for boer have not a yet brought up big gun nevertheless most of inhabitant have erected sort of shelter with bag filled with earth roofed with timber over more sand bag be placed underground shelter must not well be constructed for soil be eighteen inch deep below be solid rock be intended that directly enemy began bombardment in earnest with heavier gun woman child must be lowered into mine where must be perfectly safe from harm yorke be out whole day taking note of everything saw in order to be able to report a fully a possible be accosted by many officer warmly invited into mess room must not refuse invitation a knew how intensely anxious be to hear news from outside especially account of fighting took peter with on round pointing out everything to so that if be captured on way out kaffir escaped must be able to give a much information a possible to general on returning to dinner at commandant found list of store in readiness understand be only approximate mr harberton great many of resident have store of own having a soon a be evident that be going to be cut off bought large supply from store keeper for own use a will see only item in be likely to fail be preserved milk unfortunately boer managed to drive off milch cow day two after closed in have only tin left to rely upon be not of much importance to men be supply to run out fear must be very trying for young child with exception will see be fairly supplied for three month possibly for longer a of course ration will be reduced if find that be not relieved yorke spent two three hour that evening learning by heart item of list then put figure down in order in stood without key must furnish information have fear of forgetting what group referred to in morning asked colonel side of town considered must offer best chance of getting through unobserved do mean to go on foot on horseback of course will furnish with two horse if decide on riding must be glad of if be once through boer sir there must be so much greater chance of being seen if mounted must much prefer going on foot think be right in case will be best for to make to north east leaving by road to boshof go out close to de beer mine boer have entrenchment on tarantaalrand kop on right one on tafel kop on left be le likely to be watchful on side than be on south west a must be in direction that messenger despatch rider must be most likely to go what time do propose starting at nine o'clock sir will be quite dark by time very well then will get troop of cavalry to go out towards kamfers dam will open fire from gun on side of course will be told not to push attack home to retire a soon a boer begin to fire hotly in way attention of boer on kopje have to pas will be attracted will have better chance of getting through unseen will of course order that search light will not be directed near road that be travelling will play frequently on two kopje beam will pretty nearly blind men up there best eye can not stand glare of search light long when be turned off can see nothing for time so think that what with attack on other side will be able to make way through if have luck of course will not go a far a boshof once past line will journey due south in way will strike boshof jacobsdal road when do so course will be west with little south will lead into camp without going near line at spytfontein magersfontein have better have good look at map be not a accurate a ought to be will at least be of assistance to have compass yes sir be of use at night unless one be quite sure that there be boer near a striking of match may be seen very long way will give american match be beastly thing with lot of sulphur in have advantage that strike with sudden flash like most english match especially safety match there be only just enough phosphorus to light sulphur without allowing flame to catch wood will give enough light to let see compass say that must be safe to strike one of if there be boer within hundred yard think that light must be seen mile away especially a must naturally strike in heart of bush in shelter of clump of rock of course there be chance of getting back to camp before daylight for morning begin to break soon after five o'clock thank sir will be very much obliged for match must certainly prove most useful yorke did not care to walk about much a have hard night work before spent day in one of fort be exchanging occasional shot with boer battery chatting with officer in command boer be shocking bad shot latter said be in much more danger of being hit when be not firing at than when be aiming at direct fire principally at wesselton mine in hope doubt that shell will go down pit damage pumping gear for if must succeed must find very difficult to maintain water supply a must all have to be carried up from mine by hand not single shot have fallen within hundred yard of have damaged house good deal in line of fire have never be able to give gun right elevation fancy powder be by mean good be very uneven in quality sometimes will carry good deal beyond mine at other time fall short of have good supply of shell have not yes very fair supply de beer people have begun casting have turned out very fair specimen be rougher than british work doubt serve purpose very well can make a good practice with a with own ah here come man often come up here for look out think get on very well with commandant people here swear by presence be immense encouragement to there can be doubt that with resource have at back with whole army of well trained mechanic of sort machinery to say nothing of miner kaffir be host in illustration yorke gave full account of battle a spoke rhodes came up yorke looked with interest at man who be napoleon of south africa square built man with smoothly shaven face except for thick moustache with hair waving back from broad forehead strong determined chin mouth somewhat broad in cheek giving face appearance of squareness light eye keen kindly altogether strong pleasant face good morning said to officer thing seem pretty quiet to day fight three day back must not be called success in must have given boer higher respect for fighting power made dislike more than ever idea of trying to attack think know face sir went on turning to yorke thought knew officer in place only came in day before yesterday in evening bringing despatch from lord methuen to colonel kekewich gallant action sir mr rhodes said holding out hand to of course heard about of plucky defence day till kimberley horse went out brought in heard at mess of diamond field horse yesterday that have be there hour before given account of lord methuen three battle if have nothing better to do sir perhaps will kindly tell story have better sit down on sand bag commandant sent copy of report that of course gave detail yorke gave full account of battle doe not seem to mr rhodes said when have finished that there can be sufficient scouting of course be not military man know nothing of handling of troop certainly before attacking place must have taken step to find out exact position of enemy a far a possible strength must have be done by handful of mounted men now tell little more a to how got through yorke much more briefly gave account of journey now mr harberton for such hear be name will tell how come that so young officer be entrusted with such hazardous work first of must mind telling something about like to know in out of thing believe be not asking from mere curiosity yorke felt that in strong able man might find valuable friend therefore gave sketch of reason for leaving england so be at rugby hearer broke in be public school boy know there be always fellow feeling among public school boy even if be not at same school came out to cousin say be eight month ago what did do with looked after farm bit greater part of time spent in learning to shoot to speak dutch do speak dutch well well enough to pas in ordinary conversation sir have dutch boy a companion a cousin wife be dutch that language be principally spoken in house why did leave must have gone anyhow sir because from what heard from dutch who came there there be certain to be war a must ride well have made good shot must speak dutch little kaffir thought might be useful in scouting way if have not be able to enlist in such corp must have enlisted if possible in regular cavalry left suddenly be shot at by young boer relation of cousin wife who be jealous because have beaten in shooting match ball went through hat naturally fired back in return bullet struck in chest did not think that wound must be mortal cousin thought better must go at once a fellow have many friend round who must certainly take matter up then related how have obtained commission in latter corp have gone up with colonel pinkerton have ridden out dressed a dutchman a went up line to obtain information a to sentiment of africander how in same disguise have gone with dutch lad who have accompanied among boer have learned that commando be going south that there be intention of attacking de aar how twenty kaffir have be placed under have done what scouting be possible on way up to modder see that have plenty of intelligence a well a grit mr harberton when war be over come to be sort of man want promise that will find good friend thank very much sir no have to thank mr rhodes said lad who will learn dutch in six month instead of contenting with sporting amusement a too many young fellow who come out here do who will undertake dangerous enterprise carry through a successfully a have done be certain in case to make way deserves to do so be hard worker be only too glad to have men round with clear head capacity for work in pinch plenty of pluck decision have shown have come out at younger age than most men have already highly distinguished be foolish take commission if be offered to at rate not for permanency be poor business unless have income of own must be a much a must do to keep head above water until time when might become captain in rhodesia will by time be in position that colonel might envy thank sir have thought of taking commission where must render little service except a interpreter did take must certainly resign at end of war came out here to push way be able to help mother sister to extent in event of death of father whose income a clergyman will of course expire with who can now only afford to insure life for small sum therefore most gratefully accept very kind offer when business be ended will come to be only too glad to accept post that may think fit for have be alone during conversation a officer in command of battery have left to attend to duty when first sat down to talk mr rhodes now rose shook hand with yorke then nodding to officer said will be up again afternoon if boer make fresh move strolled away yorke dined that evening at mess of kimberley horse left directly cloth be removed having said good bye to colonel kekewich started with peter officer accompanying to pas out through line already there be sound of musketry away near kamfers dam boer gun joined in battery at have passed morning replied to fire will occupy attention on kopje near road peter will keep along close to a far a can be open veldt a far a can make out foot of kopje be at least two three hundred yard from so that walking will be good deal easier than be coming here mind if be surprised peter be to follow order make bolt for at once a long a ground be open like can use own eye wish now to fall back walk thirty forty yard behind be of use being captured have given copy of figure have put down have gone through over over again with so that know what of mean have also told message colonel kekewich sent be to repeat to general when get back to modder when have got well past kopje can come up to again until do so keep well behind if be suddenly pounced upon make straight off have agreed that can follow help if there be chance of making escape hardly think that chance must occur however must leave to must remember that be not to follow long not more than day two for be important that message must get to modder a soon a possible if be order must obey kaffir said like baa never mind that peter have to do thing like sometimes now drop back yorke have before leaving line again muffled boot walked along fast feeling confident that must get through unobserved be walking close to road be within four five hundred yard of kopje when took to again a there be clump of bush in front of suddenly fell on face with crash foot having caught against wire stretched tightly six inch above ground before must spring to foot dozen men rushed out from bush seized run peter run shouted then said a boer raised to foot surrender several of raised rifle faced towards road by have come thinking that might be followed by strong force after waiting for three four minute two of ran forward cautiously returned in five minute saying that there be sign of one there man shouted to someone whom did shout to asked yorke roughly shook head thought best to profess ignorance of dutch man repeated question in english be kaffir yorke answered be coming to show way across country when have passed through line be spy then man said fiercely not at yorke replied if be daylight must see by uniform that be english officer if have come a spy must have disguised preferred coming in uniform so that if be captured must have right to be treated a prisoner of war be for field cornet to decide man said grimly now come along with chapter x escape having relieved of rifle bandolier boer led yorke with along road until have passed kopje then turned off to left took to where several fire be burning at back of hill strong party of boer be sitting round smoking others eating supper whom have got there le clus enquired one of with white cockade in hat say that be british officer mynheer be coming along road when tumbled over wire have in moment be walking along road be yes then hardly can have be sent to spy out position strength man said if have be must not have kept to road why be quite boy say be not spy mynheer have be sent out to carry message to british on modder claim to be in uniform so to be treated a prisoner of war illustration strong party of boer be sitting round smoking others eating supper conversation have be in dutch field cornet then said in english to prisoner have paper about have only little scrap yorke said be written in cipher suppose english general will understand be only lot of figure boer opened held so that light of fire must fall upon be like way down do understand cipher asked a be military cipher be only general who must know thing be kept very secret cipher must be told to young officer like why must choose to carry can only suppose yorke said with smile because thought must be better spared than older officer besides be good runner must bet that if have twenty yard start none of men must overtake perhaps not lad rifle bullet must travel faster than there be laugh among boer standing round be what yorke have aimed at knowing importance of keeping in good temper well in morning will send on to boshof field cornet said know anything of usage of war whether uniform will save skin not will leave to others to settle must be bold young fellow to have undertaken job for be ridiculous to suppose that must get through in uniform must probably be shot by first of men met without stopping to ask question will give word that will not try to escape to night if so will not tie up two three of men grumbled know english officer said be willing to take word still to prevent risk two of must take by turn to watch yorke looked indifferent till spoke to in english then said will give word of honour sir not to attempt to escape to night say that if can get chance afterwards wo do so be right think will get chance at rate accept word that will remain here quietly night so saying reseated by fire began to puff at pipe yorke thought must be best to imitate example have when at farm taken to smoking occasionally did in self defence for sometimes when there be several dutch visitor room be so full of smoke that must scarcely breathe in therefore took out pipe filled lit sat quietly down near field cornet then took from pocket flask have be filled for at mess with whiskey handed to cornet boer eye twinkled took long draught of be good stuff said good deal better than sell at store please pas round cornet be afraid wo go very far be heartily welcome to drink generally carry in case must get hurt anyhow sprain ankle among rock may a well hand pistol too yorke said have be unnoticed in dark by men who have taken rifle be certain that people will not let keep may a well have a suppose cartridge will fit have dropped own on way a say may a well have a field cornet said taking besides might go off by way be well to avoid possibility of accident now a have given word of honour that will not try to escape to night will assure on word of honour that have not come out to gather information in fact that be not spy willingly sir give word of honour be not sent out on such mission be simply told to make way to modder so far from trying to make out arrangement great object be to try to avoid coming near of what say be true be certain boer said in dutch to companion be sure by face that be not lying be shame to have sent lad like on errand however will send strong letter with in morning to commandant at boshof assure that there be question whatever that young officer story be true that be entitled to be treated a prisoner of war have not gone into fight in order to kill a many englishman a possible because want to help friend of transvaal to keep independence for one hope that there will be no more bloodshed than necessary young fellow like simply do what be ordered just a do of course do best when be fighting certainly have ground for animosity against england have always kept engagement with have be just a independent a if there be one in south africa have always be good friend with english who live among once come to killing spy must kill hundred of men to one must kill know everything pass in natal cape colony from friend there be only natural that must want to know what be passing among if shoot man on ground that be spy may shoot hundred of dutch who be sending news from among have not heard of shooting one say if find englishman doing what so many of men be doing let stop work by imprisoning until war be over if transvaalers like to act differently can not help hate english why know for have got rich at expense still do hate before began be a good friend with english neighbour a be with own people see reason for change be not fighting be who be fighting say that steyn be wrong in joining kinsman across vaal be business that of men elected anyhow be bound by rooineks have got to shoot other till one of give in be sure will do best to win have shown that can fight have shown that can fight when come to shooting in cold blood will have nothing to do with in first place because call murder in second because where english have got one man sending information from side have got thousand doing same from theirs must be fool indeed if be to set example take one life for action might entail shooting of friend in colony there be good deal in what say mynheer one of others agreed be sure be right for part when see shell bursting in there often say to myself 'it be woman child be suffering from let fire at fort though see that doe much good leave peaceful people alone wo give in because few hundred woman be killed doe not seem a if must take town by force at rate have made attempt to do so at present be not likely to will starve into surrender might just a well leave alone till have eaten last crust for part think ought to have made rush finished business directly got here must have lost good many men must have be end of end will come just same will have killed many woman child soldier will have lost in long run a many a must have done if have attacked place before have time to build fort prepare for see use of keeping up fire isaak field cornet said again be not business order be to hold kopje mean to do so heart ache whenever see shell burst in middle of town commandant have got to account for not be time now for men on hill to be relieved let next two to go on guard duty get rifle keep watch over lad have fear of trying to escape say have with for that know there may have be three four may try to crawl in get off idea that peter might attempt have already occurred to yorke sincerely hoped that kaffir must not do so one of men brought armful of straw put down for between two rock here lay down two men told off sat on ground in front of after lighting pipe in short time be quiet yorke soon went off to sleep in middle of night be startled by one of guard leaping to foot shouting who be there what be jan other said rattle of stone over there on right again challenged answer came be only hare other grumbled fire jan do will be rousing everybody nice temper must be in with for disturbing believe be hare other said sounded like rock have shifted place when someone trod on be too big stone to move with weight of hare well if hear anything else will send bullet in direction whether wake camp not heard what field cornet said someone may be trying to get in to help lad to escape yorke lay awake for time then a everything remained quiet went off to sleep again in morning breakfasted with field cornet have bowl of cocoa milk with bread broken into now latter said when have finished must send on to boshof if must have own way lad must send back into town must tell there that be keeping sharp look out that be of use one trying to get through ca do must send off to boshof four of men have to go there to buy provision will look after have written letter to commandant hope that will treat well wo be starting until afternoon a will sleep there come back in morning of course will ride can have one of pony mind went on with smile will be slowest of lot have for promise not to escape expired morning four men will be on better pony than yours so will be of use trying to get off sha' try yorke laughed even if must not overtake must shoot pony want to be made target for four of rifle chance have not arrived yet when doe will take at three o'clock party started field cornet shaking hand warmly with yorke saying a mounted be sorry caught lad must have done harm if have got round to people at modder though perhaps be lucky in not being able to get farther for might fall into hand of transvaalers although be friend must acknowledge that be pretty rough lot be very much obliged to for kindness for have treated a well a men must have treated if have fallen into hand minute later be riding along road with two of boer on side of distance be five twenty mile sometimes walking sometimes cantering reached town between six seven yorke have chatted cheerfully to one of guard who spoke english feeling apparently little anxiety a to position where do suppose will send asked order be to send prisoner to pretoria most likely in first place will send to bloemfontein from there can be taken up by rail prisoner taken in natal be sent up way not of course through bloemfontein by line through standerton suppose will be there very long for of course a soon a have driven soldier out of country will send prisoner after count chicken before be hatched yorke laughed war have be going on two month have not done much towards yet one of guard admitted have killed thousand thousand of troop in natal will finish with on modder directly advance again people in cape colony be only waiting for order when will rise to man be expecting day to hear that ladysmith have fallen then joubert will drive people to take to ship at durban will leave enough men here to starve garrison will then march to cape town with transvaalers expect fighting on way because people will have risen captured place long before arrive there sound easy enough doe at present see have not taken ladysmith have not defeated buller army have not starved kimberley have not even taken mafeking dutch in cape colony have not risen when thing have happened may find clear sailing must remember that although be prepared for war britain be not at present have not more than fifty thousand men here have found difficult to deal with must send will send if necessary five hundred thousand more must be big lot boer said doubtfully with dutch in cape colony must not be afraid of well have seen that can fight anyhow yorke said have advantage in being mounted in nature of country be in favour while be attacking must be in favour be attacking besides see what men of free state have to do with if be driven out have republic kruger must be president transvaal master be great deal better off a be know everyone know how hard government be kruger people must keep rich for do think that must get higher price for cattle must be in way better off for change think that must not there must be monopoly of everything a in transvaal must have to pay twice a much for good wanted to buy a do now perhaps know story of monkey who took cat made pull chestnut out of fire for well think that if drive out of south africa will find that transvaal must be monkey free state cat if win be possible unlikely a seems to will certainly lose independence for without shadow of cause of complaint have wantonly taken up arm against will have lost great number of life be worse off than be at beginning though nothing like so badly off a if have be under kruger know very well that under rule dutch in cape colony have nothing to complain of government be dutch dutch have a free voice a english in electing assembly making own law may be sure be free state annexed must after time be a free a be dutch in colony be bad business one of men said wish steyn reitz have be anywhere before dragged into however now be in have got to go through with can tell good many of must not have come out on commando that have to choose between doing so being shot well hope that will soon be over one way other can get back to farm who be commandant at boshof be transvaaler free stater one of people be good man be brother in law of field cornet most of be free state men about here many of round kimberley two third of at spytfontein be transvaalers main part of force be in natal then subject of conversation be changed boer asked many question about britain showing astounding ignorance of distance from cape population russia germany france be going to invade britain boer said hear that be going to divide between so what say about so many troop coming over here be nonsense yorke laughed there be more chance of three country combining against than there be of flying if did must not be afraid of why hear that have got very much bigger army than have be true enough navy be larger than theirs put together must have to thrash before must do anything why must march army into england leave fleet alone because britain be island there be more than twenty mile between nearest point of france so that a long a fleet be master of sea can hing even if did beat fleet must have to get ship to cross in requires tremendous number of ship to carry big army with horse artillery store ship of france collected at one spot must not carry army across capable of beating ours russia have practically ship at so troop must hing at worst although germany must send more men over than france there be need to fear for must never join france russia against be not good friend with france not very good friend with russia if britain be conquered france russia must next turn attention to russia france might join against russia must do harm in europe must not aid france in way except by attacking in india so practically france be only power must if wanted to help a must smash fleet up in month after war began must have nothing to gain everything to lose by siding with at present however have not slightest idea of doing anything of sort be nothing to whether transvaal be independent not have large interest in gold mine must lose great deal of money if boer be successful have frenchman fighting for german doubt have in country there be certain number of people ready to fight anywhere if be paid for what do sort of men who be fighting for must rob farm just a readily a be robbing farm of british settler be scum of france germany will be source of more trouble than advantage to build hope on foreign assistance have yourselves to depend upon yourselves only a long a kruger can lay hand on gold from mine can buy men gun from europe wo last for most of miner have gone once take johannesburg there be end to will never do that be for future to show yorke said thought that must never cross modder have done thought that be going to march to durban fortnight after war began have not done thought that be going to take ladysmith kimberley mafeking in week have done none of thing yet so see unexpected happens sometimes opinion though may be wrong be that in three month will be at johannesburg have old saying in england beay difference of opinion never alter friendship ' there be reason why must not enjoy own opinion without quarrelling about british have always be good friend have got on comfortably there be reason why must not do so again when trouble be over on arriving at boshof found that commandant have ridden over to farm five twenty mile away must not be back until eight nine o'clock place be about usual size of country town in free state contained church town hall school perhaps two hundred house inhabitant speedily gathered a party rode in eagerly asking for news a to progress of siege of men looked sullenly threateningly at yorke for most part little animosity be evinced many of woman even looked with pity towards among population war be regarded a practically over for have be told that buller army have be annihilated that tremendous loss have be inflicted upon methuen with only about dozen casualty among own men have heard that capture of britain by russia if not already accomplished be matter of day be little puzzled why kimberley have not yet fallen be confident that final attack upon be only deferred until methuen army be annihilated here be specimen of men with whom own big brawny relative have to fight mere lad without hair on face who ought to be at home with mother wonder boer have gained such magnificent victory be nothing short of madness that such soldier must be sent to fight against invincible champion of country be not fault poor fellow for have not authentic report reached town showing how british soldier have have to be ironed intoxicated before must be got on board ship how many have cried like child at being compelled to fight so far away from home therefore when yorke be lodged in lock up of town one woman brought bowl of milk to barred window fruit third plate of meat bread for believed that having come from kimberley must be in state of starvation while many said word two of pity consolation although pretended not to understand word yorke be touched at same time amused by comment poor young fellow one said suppose be much younger than paul though be not size must be very hard up for soldier when take lad like men who brought in said that be officer one of said officer other repeated in surprise wonder beat so easily when have boy like that a officer why field cornet officer be big men wisest in district what chance must such lad have against if be officer must soldier be like several time two men on guard outside door told woman to go away soon returned wonder what have become of peter yorke thought to expect be on look out somewhere among rock morning waited there till saw ride by must know that must hing against four mounted men hope that by time be well on way towards modder a say landdrost here be good fellow brother in law of friend of last night think there be chance of harsh treatment by time have gone stage question about being spy will have died out will be supposed be captured in sortie something of sort at nine o'clock key grated

have letter for yes mynheer here be read through then passed to companion young chap trying to carry despatch said walked right into arm of odental men have time to make resistance not that must have done good there be evidently nothing to do to send to pretoria feel sure that be not spy landdrost a if people must send out lad like a spy be evidently just fresh from england what must want to spy about people in kimberley can see for where fort be if wanted to send out spy must have chosen somebody who must speak dutch besides have got uniform on first dutchman met must have made prisoner need

to write in cipher landdrost said must not have be safe to send message that must read if caught landdrost have be warm when returned from ride have thrown up window suddenly rifle be thrust in voice in dutch called out hold up arm shoot men astounded at sudden threat did a be ordered gentleman yorke said quietly suppose that of friend have heard of capture that party have got through be heartily obliged to for kindness landdrost only leave because journey back from here be good deal shorter than must be from pretoria will take gun for present will find four of outside after have gone other

burst upon rain coming down in torrent wind blowing fiercely have now fallen into jog trot a yorke have looked at compass when first drop fell be able to keep on without delay for must steer course by direction of wind driving rain hour storm ceased a suddenly a have begun kaffir have be running yard two ahead of yorke for latter must see nothing while former be able to make out bush in way from view have obtained of country when came into town lad knew that there be kopje for long way round that only danger be of falling into spruit when sky cleared star shone out there be longer fear of accident sometimes walking sometimes trotting held on course until morning broke have travelled calculated nearly thirty mile last four five have be over comparatively broken ground being continuation of hill through have passed on way to kimberley hid up on side of rocky kopje when be light made out road from boshof to jacobsdal about mile to right there be little town in distance yorke said looking south must be wesselton think be more than eight mile so from river what have got to do be to get round that place keep bit to right of road till be close to river then strike due west of course most dangerous point be where cross road from jacobsdal to kimberley once past that be safe except that may have scout out towards camp to give notice of move might be made against jacobsdal say that strong force be there who intend of course to try cut railway in rear when lord methuen move forward now best thing can do be to take few hour sleep in few minute be sound asleep kaffir slept lightly half hour so lifted head looked out over road towards boshof yorke awoke about midday peter be at moment looking out do see anything on road peter yorke asked one now baa three hour after went to sleep two boer rode past going fast expect be sent from boshof to say that have got away three hour after more than twenty men came other way when got to plain separated rode about searching country a went looking for doubt yorke said well wo find show alarm have spread will have to be very careful now peter where be that food bought at boshof did not feel hungry last night appetite have come back again morning if go to boulder fifty yard to right will be in shade better stay where be baa boer be accustomed to hunt have got very good eye almost a good a ours might see said that there be none of along road now be so baa there may be of on hill hiding among rock must feel sure that must come way doubt while went out on plain climbed up there in hope of seeing move quite right peter be use throwing away chance will stop where be put up with sun have meat baa knew very well there must be chance of cooking have got bag of biscuit bottle of whisky have got water bottle not left behind baa well then will have water when have drunk half of can pour little whisky in rest for whisky bad thing baa very nice may be nice in small quantity for who like like never touch if can help be ruin of people know be against law to give to against law baa can always find plenty of men ready to sell for good money be bad men peter harm do be very great be why so many of people be in rag though can earn pay when be willing to work will only labour for three four day then spend pretty well all have earned on spirit be drunk next three be true baa peter do very often big fool peter often tell so when get sober when get money smell spirit then make fool of again well have better make up mind to give up altogether peter be getting good pay now ought to have lot of money saved by end of war enough to go back to own people build kraal buy cattle exchange of for wife true baa peter will try not to be big fool again well then have better begin to try at once drink water without mixing whisky with peter face fell heaved long sigh now just suppose peter at boshof have opened that bottle of whisky have doubt that if have begun must have drunk almost of by time got sober must have found long way towards pretoria be just what said to myself peter said with laugh take bottle out of pocket four five time look at time took out said to myself 'peter if take out that cork know what will be will get drunk boer will carry baa away well peter fought battle mastered there be reason why must not do again be better to be free man than slave how slave master peter asked puzzled man be slave who allows to be mastered by drink be of use to say ' will only have drop be ten time more difficult to stop then than be at first now peter have done great service very great service will have done quite a good one if can persuade to give up drink altogether then when part from will be always able to think of a doing well among own people instead of working in rag somewhere for day pay peter will try master will try hard time smell gin will say to 'baas yorke tell that ruin if touch say true will not touch ' be right peter will smash bottle now baa smash when get into camp be good for medicine very bad a drink may have to sleep near river perhaps in wet clothes besides be better for to carry with without touching see that have begun to get better of will not say no to if ask for will please very much if now let eat biscuit when have finished simple meal yorke said have have sleep out be evident that can not have slept much therefore may a well get good sleep before start will keep watch late in afternoon yorke saw boer straggling back have doubt come to conclusion that with be not hiding out on plain will probably place extra men on watch during night thought yorke to make sure that pas through wesselton have better keep to left of place because will think more likely that must turn off to right a must be natural course in making for modder however can not think that will take great trouble to look out for except on road through hill for can not be sure that from boshof did not work round other side of kimberley try to return to town from west chapter xi magersfontein a soon a be quite dark yorke companion be again on way be toilsome work kept a well a must judge mile from road be very rough piece of country there be steep hill to climb descend tract of boulder rock to be crossed have not be for keen eyed native yorke must have found impossible to make way fortunately night be starlit enabled to keep direction without having recourse to dangerous expedient of striking match presently country became le rough hilly think have passed range peter wesselton can not be very far off keep sharp eye on look out for light directly see will know exactly what position be have taken very long time to cross hill want to sight river before daylight be sure to find bush willow growing by bank where can hide hour walking peter said in low voice there be light baa pointing somewhat to left of track be taking for time yorke must not discern anything then light shone out disappeared almost instantly be somebody carrying candle lamp across room said be much obliged to whoever be road can not be far to right so bear more other way if there be boer about must probably feel sure that must strike off to right making detour presently left town behind kept on due south have fear whatever of anyone being on watch beyond wesselton therefore stepped out boldly over slightly undulating ground once twice yorke struck match looked at compass to be sure that be keeping course think be near river now baa peter said at last what make think that peter smell water do peter did not know that have smell yes baa ox deer sheep can smell ox always quicken pace when get near pool must seem to show that be right still think there can be smell there may be more damp in air near water sens in way be more delicate than of white man a say think be near water have doubt be right anyhow hope be for have knocked skin off shin in dozen place among rock have pretty nearly twisted ankle a often so will be glad enough to lie down certainly have several hour sleep yesterday did not make up for loss of sleep night before besides foot be getting very tender have not walked in month have be out here a much a during two night baa walk very well dutchman ever walked half a far a do perhaps not peter never use leg boer must get on horse if only wanted to go fifty yard to fetch anything used to be good walker on farm got to be almost a lazy a dutchman quarter of hour later line of bush rose in front of look a if river be near just on other side of bush baa so turned out after climbing down to taking long drink for have emptied water bottle before starting took mouthful of food lay down among bush there be not least occasion to keep watch yorke said will be morning soon if of wake can peep out from edge of bush see if there be dutchman in sight if there be not can sleep on a long a like yorke did not wake till sun be almost overhead native be crouching down near bush well peter do see anything asked have seen boer at house there going in out just rode in waited hour rode away again did not look about at just paying visit did not see house last night though must have passed very close to did not look for house baa looked for river a there be horse cattle grazing about wonder did not startle of must have be farther away from house must have be sure to move if have passed near came near here morning baa grass longer here when river high spread over country near well a long a enter bush doe not matter peter if did came upon must be startled gallop away if boer happened to be looking from house might saunter down here to see what caused fright day passed quietly a soon a be dark be in motion again course be very little to south of west yorke said now be quite safe till approach road from kimberley to jacobsdal once past that be only about ten mile to railway by following latter will reach camp ca go in till morning for have not got countersign so must run risk of being shot by one of tramp picket four hour tramp took to road must hear a approached murmur of voice moved away to right walked for distance before attempting to cross boer evidently have party thrown out to give notice of force approaching from camp yorke said in low tone will have to be very careful for there be saying where be posted may extend almost up to railway yes must take care baa if only two three shoot if more of shoot go first come little after baa if there be boer be sure to be talking keeping awake if not talk sure to be asleep then pas safe yes if happen to tread on fear of baa can see little shrub twenty yard away see body of big boer farther than trusting implicitly to sight hearing of kaffir yorke followed ten pace behind having rifle now in hand ready for use bad gone quarter of mile when suddenly on left there be movement voice said wake up philip there be something moving be only deer hare other said sleepily be man replied angrily if have be wild animal must have dashed away when spoke instead of that noise stopped be footstep must almost swear most likely one of rascally kaffir going to rooinek camp with news will soon see come along way be where sound came from yorke have crouched down a soon a stopped saw that native have done same in minute saw outline of two dark figure can see boer who have first spoken shouted who be where be going answer put bullet through head yorke did not believe that be seen knew that if boer advanced two pace farther must make out first intimation must have that did so must be given by rifle bullet be question of life death accordingly took steady aim fired man aimed at fell without cry a pulled trigger yorke threw flat upon ground be a well that did so for other boer fired where have seen flash of rifle almost at same moment rifle be discharged boer dropped gun with oath ran off at full speed peter be by yorke side before latter must get on to foot illustration in minute saw outline of two dark figure be wounded baa no by sound shot went through water bottle two inch lower must have have in hip be aiming at same man a native said till fired saw fall before must change aim other man have fired be just too late to stop be good thing that hit peter for if have not done so must have fired again doubt magazine be full next shot might have done business have not time to think when threw down if have done so must have dropped with head towards then must have fired again went down sideways so for moment must not use rifle hit other man in arm think for rifle dropped did not throw down now must run hardest peter do hear shouting may a well go straight on a other way by row be making seem to be over place so be use trying to avoid keeping close together now ran at top of speed changing course occasionally when heard voice ahead of noise be in favour for completely drowned slight sound made by footstep served a warning to of position of various outpost maintained pace for nearly mile sound be behind now so broke into walk maintained until came upon line of railway will walk along on other side of keep ear open peter listen for slightest movement know how far outpost be thrown out want to stop before get near have walked three mile when peter said stop baa heard noise think soldier be stamping foot to warm right peter be sure can not be very far off now so will wait till morning can sleep till broad daylight three hour later native touched yorke sun be just up will go on now certainly will sling rifle again if have in hand sentry might think wiser to fire at once without asking question however now that can see uniform have little fear of be a well to be on safe side a approached must see that sentry called to comrade close by for at once joined when came within hundred yard sentry challenged officer with despatch from kimberley yorke replied can come on for bit soldier said will not let pas farther until officer come have permit from general colville to enter pas line then can come on gun of yours till have seen permit sentry be justified in being doubtful for many of boer have adopted khaki coloured clothes at very short distance yorke might well have be mistaken for one of be right sir soldier said when have read permit be obliged to be careful know if have come before got light must not have let pas without countersign be quite right to stop said be because knew must not get in without countersign have be sleeping for last three four hour quarter of mile away did hear firing in night did not sir man relieved told that have heard three shot over to right be charged to be extra vigilant need not be so longer one shot be fired at a came through boer outpost couple of mile side of road from jacobsdal others be two shot fired there be good many of boer about got through safely be kimberley right sir said came from there yes can hold out for time wo have to hold out long sir will be there before week be over hope hope so too yorke agreed then peter walked on followed line of railway there be two three strong post upon seeing that have be allowed to pas by most advanced sentry question be asked nearing river turned off proceeded at once to head quarter on arriving there be told that general colville be dressing must be out in few minute will take name in sir orderly asked will wait till general be ready in ten minute general colville came out with general pole carew on seeing yorke said heartily so be back mr harberton got searchlight to work last night for first time got into communication with kimberley have be flashing signal for day have not be able to answer until now last night asked 'have messenger arrived got answer left two day ago then be afraid report will be of little use to sir on contrary be most anxious to hear there be fellow in rank who have served with one more of can doubtless read signal have only asked if must hold out until arrive said 'yes abstained from asking further question for from prisoner hear that boer feel sure that kimberley can not hold out much longer now in first place what be report be have brought sir colonel kekewich be afraid that might be caught on way out consequently only put down a see on slip of paper estimate of amount of store will not take five minute to write out name of various article to figure refer be caught yes paper be examined must make head tail of threw on ground recovered well just complete list then will take in to lord methuen who be be happy to say going on well first can answer generally how long can hold out must think sir for three month item may run short in general colonel kekewich be of opinion that store available be considerably greater than indicated by figure a most of resident have laid in private store before town be altogether cut off be most satisfactory may be sure that wo have to wait so long a that if will write out list at once will take in to lord methuen after that can give account of how got in how got away after once being caught by boer yorke wrote out list very good indeed much better than have expected see have put query behind number of shell what doe mean there can be private store of shell sir de beer people have set to to manufacture have begun to turn out rapidly have already be tried gunner can make a good practice a with own good indeed see that there be mark after number of gun yes sir de beer people have begun making long gun heard that boer be bringing up hundred pounder hope that one be making will have longer range than piece although believe be not to carry so heavy shot two officer left room with list general colville returned in few minute lord methuen will see said must like to question yorke followed into room lord methuen be lying on couch congratulate upon safe return mr harberton said have be most hazardous service news have obtained have be invaluable dared not question kimberley about store of provision for if answer be understood by boer must see that chance of reducing place by hunger be so slight that might decide to abandon siege to march away into colony be thing of others wish to prevent colonel kekewich saw that sir yorke said be why must not give written detail lord methuen asked many particular a to defence of kimberley effect of boer bombardment temper of population did see mr rhodes yes sir how doe get on with commandant think sir from what heard that there be friction between military authority nothing serious at resource of mine have be placed by in hand of authority be employing large number of kaffir in making road pay feed be great relief to authority for have twice tried to send kaffir out of town time boer have compelled to return doubt because think that more mouth there be to feed sooner provision will be exhausted now mr harberton tell how managed to get into town to return here yorke related adventure have be fortunate indeed general said have have three very narrow escape in first place at hut defended so stoutly in next place when be first taken prisoner lastly in getting through boer line side of jacobsdal to say nothing of escape at boshof kaffir must be stout fellow be sir without assistance must by time be long way on road to pretoria well service have be most valuable will have great pleasure in recommending for commission if must like to take one thank very much sir must feel great honour even if resigned at end of war must be life gratification to have received queen commission suppose must prefer cavalry yes sir well then will recommend that be gazetted to th lancer colonel will be glad to have what with casualty illness be short of subaltern have be very favourably reported before for expedition from de aar across orange river there can be doubt that recommendation will be acceded to at once may ask what be

second lieutenant in th lancer detailed for special duty a extra aide de camp to general pole carew thank that officer said will be very glad to have for be one short already mr lucas be down with

nearly there managed to get in after skirmish have worse luck getting out for be caught however kaffir came to rescue got back without much trouble how be getting on there can hold out for long time

name of regiment to shoulder strap must not obtain red tab be badge of staff for collar of jacket after dinner rode back to head quarter where found that room have be got ready for troop be now arriving th lancer have come up battery of horse artillery highland brigade consisting of nd black watch st gordons nd seaforths st highland light infantry next day came into camp artillery be further reinforced by four howitzer line of communication have be strengthened by canadian australian several line regiment being posted along railway from de aar to belmont on th horse artillery th lancer heavy naval gun moved forward opened fire on stony hill that constituted boer position day gun thundered searching out rock behind be thought boer might be lurking naval gun distributed heavy shell broadcast great cloud of yellow smoke showing where lyddite charge have burst boer made reply not gun spoke out in return not boer be visible on face of hill nothing showed where artillery be where trench stretched in camp be filled with excitement be certain that time be at hand when must meet foe in strength face to face formidable a be position one doubted result at same time silence of enemy uncertainty a to strength position must not inspire certain feeling of uneasiness on afternoon of th black watch seaforths argyle sutherland highland light infantry moved out gordons have only come in morning remained in camp th lancer mounted infantry artillery accompanied force when within three mile of enemy position force halted be raining heavily there be nothing for to lie down upon wet ground with one blanket for two men at one o'clock in morning be on foot again position held by boer be of great strength centre scholtz kop be very steep lofty be close to line of railway spytfontein station lay at foot so strong did appear furnished a doubtless be with artillery must only have be carried with immense loss distance to left be magersfontein kopje le forbidding rough than of spytfontein from to river stretched low hill covered with bush from eight to ten foot high magersfontein once taken must render hill untenable must enable scholtz kop to be taken in flank rear be therefore against point that attack by highland brigade under general wauchope be to be made be pitch dark when column started so dark that be considered impossible for men to keep touch with other marching in line accordingly moved in mass of quarter column strangely enough not single scout be thrown out ahead probably because general thought that must be impossible to follow in dark moreover must come upon boer suddenly fire be opened attack by surprise must be altogether spoiled boer be fully prepared before main body must arrive be certain however have usual precaution be adopted catastrophe followed must have be avoided slowly feeling way along great column four thousand strong moved on silently men be drenched to skin hungry in doubt a to nature of position have to attack oppressed by darkness strangeness of situation be still distance from hill when order be given for column to open out into line instead of being a commander believed good half mile from enemy line be within two hundred yard of for boer have with great craft ability dug great trench along whole face of position quarter of mile out on plain suspicion have be entertained in camp of existence of defence highlander have marched unsuspectingly into trap a be in act of opening out with black watch in centre seaforths to left argyle sutherland to right highland light infantry in reserve light be flashed on left by one of boer who have probably kept near column a advanced in instant blaze of fire ran along whole front storm of bullet smote column told most heavily upon black watch for minute roar of musketry be unceasing then for moment ceased boer have emptied magazine of rifle be temporary pause for in few second fire again burst out loss among black watch have already be frightful general wauchope have fallen together with large number of officer although at first men have prepared to charge be impossible to withstand fire ran back spreading confusion in rank of seaforths who be still behind latter however remained steady have naturally suffered le heavily than corp in front of stood ground lying down returning fire of hidden foe black watch halted lay down behind a time went on troop managed gradually to extend two company of seaforths moving out to right while argyle sutherland highland light infantry crept farther still to right in hope of being able to open flanking fire on enemy movement be not executed without heavy loss twice seaforths sprang to foot advanced by rush at trench even made way to within few yard of be light now officer be shot down men decimated time survivor sullenly fell back for three hour lay upon ground near spot where have be attacked help came to for incomprehensibly brigade have be sent forward alone without reserve to attack whole force of boer in immensely strong position of artillery have however advanced with great boldness fire to extent relieved pressure boer have now pushed along low bush covered hill between magersfontein river have opened flanking fire on highlander at seven o'clock lord airlie brought up th lancer dismounted two squadron aided by battery of horse artillery who pressed forward to within two hundred yard of fighting line took up position on right of highland brigade to extent checked fire from quarter two hour later brigade of guard came up two battalion of coldstreams occupied ground next to dismounted men grenadier prolonged line until be in touch with yorkshire who be guarding drift across modder river other half battalion took up post by three battery have stationed in rear of highland brigade still farther to left be naval gun near railway be protected from attack in direction by northampton while howitzer battery further in advance joined in maintaining heavy cannonade at mid day gordons arrived to support highlander who hour be lying within two three hundred yard of boer trench unable to move while foe be unwilling to risk taking offensive have several time threatened to do so fire of horse artillery gun have time caused to abandon intention at two in afternoon boer fire have somewhat slackened again broke out fiercely to left appeared that attacking force be at hand men of highland brigade parched with thirst unnerved by fearful ordeal have gone through burned blistered by sun staggered back losing heavily little by little retired until reached line of gun three quarter of mile in rear straggled in in group regiment mixed up together here halted few officer who remained alive did utmost to restore order cohesion not until five o'clock in afternoon be accomplished when just a be about to advance again boer battery have strangely enough be silent day opened fire shell exploded short distance away from brigade at once broke down again officer in vain endeavoured to restrain men must not be rallied until reached field hospital camp for once nature have overcome dauntless spirit of of finest soldier in world for thirteen hour have be under tremendous fire during time have be practically without order beloved general have fallen together with many of senior officer even if have lived must have be impossible to send order from point to point to arrange for general action since slightest movement of position be certain to attract rain of bullet be in fact bewildered dazed by roar of musketry so terrible unexpected heavy loss impossibility of movement still more of getting at foe inability to do aught suffer have broken down speaks highly indeed for discipline courage of soldier at paardeberg must have entirely recovered morale have shown old conspicuous bravery unsurpassed by of other regiment brigade of guard maintained position night have covered retreat of highlander now prevented boer from taking offensive held post until be next morning recalled to camp then drew off suffering somewhat severely a did so under heavy artillery fire loss in highland brigade be fifteen officer one hundred twenty two men killed thirty one officer four hundred twenty one men wounded two officer one hundred ten men missing boer loss be caused almost entirely by artillery fire a of gun have be able to sweep portion of trench official account gave a seventy killed two hundred three wounded intercepted letter placed very much higher reported loss at from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred chapter xii prisoner be dreary time in camp during two day when operation of collecting burying dead be going on stillness prevailed be in strong contrast with activity cheerfulness reigned before battle then men have joked laughed in anticipation of success confidently expected now moved about silently not only be grieving over heavy loss sympathizing deeply with highland regiment have suffered so terribly felt that attempt must not be renewed that be doomed to long period of inaction until large reinforcement must arrive general gatacre have suffered very heavy reverse at stormberg on day before magersfontein be fought have made long night march in hope of surprising boer by treachery ignorance of guide fact that boer have be apprised of intention by rebel sympathizer have fallen into ambush everything have indeed from first gone wrong intention of general have be allowed to leak out two day previously thus large portion of population who be disloyal have ample time to warn boer at truck in troop be to be conveyed a far a molteno be not assembled at time named two hour be therefore lost portion of column missed way in dark be mile distant from main force when fight began lastly instead of troop being allowed perfect rest during day before starting on expedition demanded strength vigour have be up early spent hour under arm going through fatigue of field day so worn out be when time for action arrived that many fell asleep while battle be raging thus a boer be posted in inaccessible position action be massacre rather than fight have not be for splendid bravery of artilleryman whole force must have be killed forced to surrender loss in killed wounded be not great casualty being under one hundred six hundred men of irish rifle northumberland be taken prisoner two gun lost large number of captive be due to two cause first in attempt to get at enemy of troop have climbed rock to point where further advance be impossible retreat under tremendous fire maintained upon meant certain death secondly many be overpowered by fatigue want of sleep staggered out of rank during retreat dropping on ground slept until woke to find prisoner there be yet further bad news to come for four day after magersfontein buller be defeated in attempt to force boer line gun be lost there be heavy death roll be consolation to men who have fought at magersfontein to know that be not alone in misfortune that similar revers have be encountered in natal cape colony question that asked other be what must say in england must same craven policy have prevailed after majuba be adopted surrender be made to boer must nation show energy have in old time be evinced when danger be greatest rise to occasion even in case many week must elapse before sufficient reinforcement must arrive from england to enable to take offensive again for advance against boer position be impossible even most sanguine have to admit whole force be now gathered on modder have fear that boer must be able to drive from be poor consolation be burning to retrieve last defeat be gall wormwood to know that must be forced to remain inactive in camp of scottish regiment feeling be bitter in extreme now that long agony of conflict have broken down nerve of strongest be over felt that have to extent tarnished reputation of regiment have hitherto be without blemish blame be thrown by not on general whom so loved upon lord methuen imputation be unfounded one task before lord methuen be one of enormous difficulty point have selected for attack be best must have be chosen only fault committed by be that did not risk life of few mounted men by sending small party out to reconnoitre veldt to foot of kopje in order to discover exact position of boer trench instruction have be clear force be to advance to within attacking position of kopje there to halt until daybreak arrangement for advance of brigade be a always left to discretion of brigadier be for to send advance guard to feel way for to order heavy column to deploy into open order precaution be not taken by general wauchope trap have be set fell into trap without taking of usual precaution atoned for mistake with life to gallant regiment blame can be attributable for failure be true that broke down under strain may be doubted whether soldier in world must have withstood better surprise have be complete nearly five hundred men have fallen in few minute under terrible fire to must make effective reply have maintained day under blazing sun with ground round torn up by bullet slightest movement entailing certain death consequent depression of spirit be increased by exhaustion due to want of food water great proportion of officer have fallen there be one to give order be not wonderful then that nerve failed that when at end of awful day gathered bursting of shell near must have scattered like sheep soldier who in other circumstance must have marched up to cannon mouth without flinching must be remembered too that conduct of gordons splendid bravery showed went far in to retrieve high reputation of highland regiment three day after magersfontein general pole carew said to yorke officer with patrol be going down line to graspan to see that rail be clear for train of wounded will start later will be obliged if will go with carry despatch from lord methuen giving particular of wounded who will come in by train ordering medical

have not done so know that message have be exchanged morning if can communicate officer said see why must have be sent with despatch line wire be so fully occupied by message to de aar to cape backwards forward between general home authority that can not be spared for detail to graspan personally must much rather be cantering over there back than be idle in camp be just feeling other said be afraid that will be long time before have much to do here however there be one comfort will have chance to get supply from base must not let telegraph so have sent man down to cape town with long list of order whether not will get through know now if be ready will start order be given party rode off at trot one feel quite glad to get out of camp officer said everyone be so completely in dump that be downright misery to remain there however expect will last very long will cheer up bit if hear that people at home be not disheartened be going to send out big lot of troop carry thing through cost have doubt will yorke said be not often back down because have have heavy blow look how buckled to at time of mutiny sincerely hope so officer said one can never feel sure after way surrendered to boer before make one sick to think of even now still three such blow a have have in course of week be pretty hard to bear however let hope that whole country will harden heart determine that thing must be carried through so talking rode along until came to spot where foot of one of hill extended almost up to line then there be sudden shout fifty boer rose from behind rock heavy volley be poured into little party officer in command seven of trooper fell be horse went down suddenly shot through head other five trooper galloped on at full speed boer keeping up incessant fire upon three fell two rode on to graspan yorke leg be pinned under fallen horse made effort to rise for knew that motion must draw dozen rifle shot on when firing have ceased boer came down surrender yorke said a first came up to be wounded except leg feel crushed under horse must rather have be wounded than have lost will have occasion for at present boer said calling two three others to raised horse sufficiently to be able to drag out others be dead one of boer said of got dozen bullet through be officer be yes yorke replied be subaltern in th lancer can see number on shoulder strap carry field glass revolver a well a rifle what be name yorke harberton can walk think can at present yorke said may be able to do so presently that wo do man said will be having of cavalry from graspan on a two men who have got away will ride there with news however have got spare pony behind hill here two of take youngster carry suppose be not in command here went on a two men lifted yorke from ground carried off that officer be in command see be older than suppose be taking message to graspan did not tell yorke answered truthfully be not business to ask of course must have have order more troop be coming along three four hundred believe then there be time to lose hurry on men will see if officer have despatch on rejoined party just a reached pony not scrap of paper of sort said can only have have verbal order wo do for to carry out business came here for for might be upon before have time to pull up dozen rail be to try might catch before have time to get away at rate have done good morning work ten men officer have got prisoner two pair of field glass two revolver ten carbine three hour riding took party to jacobsdal yorke leg have hurt good deal on starting pain have to great extent gone off before reaching town now found must walk have managed a rode to tear up despatch have received have one by one chewed up piece swallowed must even if discovered have done harm now have be found at first boer must no doubt have torn up line might have caused accident must have be fatal to many of wounded have be asked question must have produced regarding only a young subaltern have not thought for moment that going with senior officer must be trusted with despatch be however glad when got rid of last fragment still more so when on being placed in guard room be searched from head to foot be supplied with food treated with consideration by boer who be in high spirit at three great success have gained why soldier give up one of asked must see by time that be good against must allow to go down to coast embark on board ship without molesting there be old saying with yorke replied that british soldier never know when be beaten though certainly have be unfortunate lately can assure that idea that be beaten for good have not occurred to of be angry at defeat in way disheartened consider that war have only just begun yet have doubt twice a many men a be in south africa now will be sent out a soon a ship can be got ready for poor fellow boer said hear that have to be made drunk to get on board ship wo drink have to be ironed be afraid yorke said that hear great many lie may be quite sure that be one of can tell last news have be that militia regiment be only raised for home service even of volunteer have sent in application asking to be allowed to come out on service ah know what be before poor lad death if escape that imprisonment till war be over allow to go away say that soldier be not brave astonished at belmont graspan be mere skirmish crossed modder in teeth yes boer admitted reluctantly looked like did not want to stop altogether there only to encourage to march against real position at spytfontein knew have chance there intended to annihilate yes did not do yorke said with smile suffered heavily from blundering up against trench of whose existence knew nothing there be annihilation about be opinion of many that if have pushed forward along line in afternoon must have won position at rate men be very careful not to make counter attack be only waiting for ladysmith kimberley to fall boer said then will advance into cape colony break up railway joined by whole of dutch people sweep before to cape town be good programme yorke agreed ladysmith kimberley have fallen yet can not hold out much longer man replied when people of kimberley learn help have failed to come to will not be fool enough to starve longer a for ladysmith be a good a taken garrison can not hold out many day longer then joubert will advance with whole army drive buller down to ship at durban well will see yorke said be not likely to convince other where do send prisoner to to pretoria good many of be already there seven eight hundred from natal six hundred from stormberg be only beginning have few others picked up here expect will be sent off in day two think will be badly off at first when get men men here safely stowed away will hardly be a well off for must say that there will be difficulty in getting provision for twenty thousand men so perhaps there wo be so many for hear that have killed over twenty thousand have only lost twenty thirty men must think that at least here can not believe last item yorke said something like hundred body have be fished out of modder there be doubt that still greater number be carried off field say that lost a heavily a did when say that have two hundred killed without counting magersfontein feel sure that be under mark oh there may be mistake about thirty boer said with grim smile still have certainly lost great many more than have even at belmont graspan though did turn out of kopje lost at least five to one may be true enough force attacking across open must always lose more than men who shoot down from behind rock who have horse close by on can gallop away a soon a find that be getting worst of if ever get in open fancy that loss will be a heavy a ours must be fool if let boer said be too slim for fight on own ground yes if invade cape colony a talk about will be fighting on ground of choosing will find out difference then three day later yorke started with fifteen other prisoner one of whom be officer for bloemfontein be placed in light cart guarded by twenty boer on horseback officer who have be captured fortnight before said to yorke after have introduced to other be glad to meet someone who can give true account of what have taken place since be captured of course did not believe boer report be serious enough to make feel very uneasy for if there be truth in even allowing for exaggeration certainly seemed that must have be awfully cut up casualty have be heavy certainly not greater than must be expected considering that boer held very strong position from turned out three time fourth time however attack failed ca tell exactly number of casualty think altogether exceeded one thousand six hundred of nearly thousand occurred in last fight then gave full account of battle thank be bad enough that have be stopped will not be able to move again until reinforcement come up still be not so bad a feared certainly underrated fighting power of boer foreign engineer who directs making of entrenchment must be very clever fellow for plan of making trench well out in plain in front of kopje be capital one a far a know quite new yes there never be more complete surprise although poor wauchope fell into trap can hardly be blamed for not taking precaution against entirely new plan of defence if have be for believe must have captured position without heavy loss for once among boulder on hillside troop must have fought way up under partial shelter a far a have seen boer attempt to make stand when once get near be afraid kimberley must fall officer whose name be d'arcy said think that there be fear of that have provision enough to last if pushed to for three month be good news be sure quite for be there ten day ago be there how on earth did manage to get out will tell to night yorke laughed have be talking steadily for past two hour what with heat dust feel in form to begin again now suppose will get to bloemfontein day after to morrow be about eighty mile think somewhere about suppose from there will be sent up by train to pretoria will be pleasant change for what with cart boer horse might a well be living in middle of dust storm except that can keep hat on head be indeed heartily glad when arrived at bloemfontein be taken direct to railway station where number of prisoner captured at stormberg be confined on following morning whole party started by train to pretoria there be several officer be placed in carriage by have be permitted to buy tobacco at bloemfontein having now recovered to extent from disgust at being made prisoner be disposed to view thing in more cheerful light a yorke be only one among who have be with methuen column be anxious to hear account of what have happened on side have again to repeat story of fight of journey to kimberley be in action at magersfontein one said suppose that a be on staff did not see very much of not much be sent with message to lord airlie when ordered two squadron of th lancer to go forward to cover flank of highland brigade followed for distance remained near until horse artillery came up to support coldstreams grenadier took up line between highlander river afterwards carried message twice to highland brigade still of course saw nothing of early fighting if can be called fighting for scotchman be lying down few shot be returned on part to storm of bullet passed over head for shot be sure to be answered by dozen rifle from boer trench escape be miracle horse be grazed twice saddle be struck have two bullet hole through clothes one through helmet did not remain long may be sure saw that highlander be showing sign of giving way that boer seemed equally unwilling to advance be principal object of mission a for finding out who be officer in command be impossible man knew anything of what be passing ten yard from said believed officer be killed of course be not so a afterwards learned fewer than forty six officer fell for most part in first terrible outburst of fire now will tell about stormberg there be very little to tell other officer said bitterly fact that be going to make night attack be known in camp night before of course boer heard of when arrived at daybreak after wandering about completely worn out exhausted by what be really five six hour march seemed like month tremendous fire be poured in upon of dashed up hill on one side up other place however be inaccessible be being shot down without power to retaliate order came to retreat great many of be lying under shelter of perpendicular rock must not leave without being exposed to fire of boer above on opposite side if men have be fresh effort must have be made be too worn out dispirited so be captured gun irish rifle covered retreat of rest if boer have be a enterprising a be crafty might have cut whole off not man must have returned to molteno to tell story be sickening business altogether made blunder upon blunder order for march must not have be issued until be paraded troop must have rested day taken food with truck must have be ready for to entrain when marched down to railway ought to have have better guide there ought to have be advance guard quarter of mile ahead be known that boer position be strong that enemy be at least a numerous a be so must have be brought up to fight fresh in good condition instead of being exhausted fagged out dispirited by tedious night march altogether business seems to have be very much like yours at magersfontein where be surprised just a be where men be already exhausted from want of food night spent in pouring rain dispiriting night march hope to heaven when next fight take place that there will be more of night marching that troop will have chance of going into action fresh well fed in good condition even in flat country without obstacle night march be always very ticklish business a found at belmont where a say regiment lost bearing attacked wrong hill in hilly country with bad map guide of doubtful honesty be almost certain to lead to disaster after twenty four hour of tedious travelling train arrived at pretoria officer be marched off to one prison men to building be small one hut have be erected in yard prison already contained officer who have be captured at nicholson nek in natal first batch of taken at stormberg hearty greeting be exchanged by companion in misfortune who pressed eagerly round asking for news took time to exhaust budget although news be far from good be well satisfied for too have heard most exaggerated report of boer victory from guard now new comer asked how do get on here be fairly well fed good deal crowded be talking of sending to race course great difficulty be to pas time have bought few ball play at five play card a one have more than few shilling in pocket play for money that take away good deal of interest see want to lose what little have got to win anyone else if more prisoner come in provision begin to run short in town be likely enough to do for there be one to work on field now to get in crop money will come in very handy of be stripped altogether of cash in most case boer although took gold left at most sovereign let keep silver suppose theory be that in first place gold be better in pocket than in ours in second that be safer to deprive of mean of bribing of warder be wise there for judging by appearance majority of guard be unmitigated ruffian irish german scum of place sort of men who must do anything for ten pound note yorke for first time regretted when heard that have a usual left money with paymaster there have be nothing to buy since have left de aar felt sure that if suspected when scouting fact of having money about must add to suspicion that be not what seemed therefore handed over money to officer who acted a paymaster to rimington scout have only two day before drawn from handed to paymaster at head quarter retaining only five six shilling a messing account must come in only once week must then draw sufficient to pay have congratulated on when be captured now wished that have made point of concealing few pound somewhere about must not have be very serious loss if have be taken from if now have must be invaluable if must find opportunity of making escape have there be attempt at escape asked yes winston churchill managed not from prison two of fellow got away result be that be looked after good deal sharper than be be locked up in room at nine o'clock there be four fellow always on guard in yard night day believe there be others round wall besides see even if one must get away one difficulty must only then begin disguise must have to be got that can not be bought without money in next place there be not soul among who can speak beastly language a must have to buy food must be detected at once will escape if can yorke said for speak taal well enough to pas anywhere once outside must make way across country even if have to steal dutchman coat still after what say see that escape can hardly be managed without money to bribe of warder go by mean if can officer said wo injure for case be hopeless now until hear bugle blowing there be not shadow of chance of out getting away chapter xiii friend week later jail in town be emptied prisoner taken to race course rough wooden hut have be erected for men officer be to use grand stand at least will have good view from top one of officer laughed will see fellow coming long way off bombardment of fort will expect be first thing done hope that if boer fight will make last stand well away from town must be maddening if there be to be battle going on before eye not able to help strictness of watch be in way relaxed men constantly paraded enclosure be formed of strong palisade others kept watch outside where several range of barbed wire to empty tin be attached in such way a to make clatter at slightest motion seemed to render impossible to get out without giving alarm even if palisade be scaled time passed heavily in spite of effort of officer to amuse with make shift stump bat ball played cricket men in part of ground did same ran race have high wide jump played rounder did best to keep up spirit be heavy work subject of war be avoided a much a possible be maddening to know fierce battle might be going on while have lost opportunity of sharing in that when friend on return asked what share have taken in fighting must only reply that be captured in one of first fight have seen nothing of war afterwards ten day after have be moved one of guard a sauntered past yorke coughed not in natural way a if to call attention yorke looked round with apparent carelessness a other guard might have eye upon man passed on without looking at have difficulty in restraining shout of delight when recognized han at first must scarcely believe eye a man lounged away recognized figure beyond shadow of doubt sat down upon ground took out pipe filled when han again came past asked for light where be room master yorke han asked a fumbled in pocket be at other side of house door nearest to right hand corner looking at from here will want time to think out master yorke only got taken on to day will speak to again to morrow so striking match handing to yorke han went away yorke felt that great caution must be used in speaking to han for a new hand might be watched for time to see that did not communicate with prisoner lay back on ground pulled hat forward a if to shade face tried to think thing over even now must scarcely believe possible that han must have travelled way from modder to pretoria knew how warmly faithful fellow be attached to not for moment while thinking over conceivable way of escape have occurred to that han must have come to relief han be slow thinker must not have given credit for undertaking enterprise even now that have succeeded in making journey in getting engaged a guard felt sure that must not have slightest idea a to what next step must be getting up after time went back to room where eight officer slept have formerly be office of sort outside door opened directly into hitherto have not examined lock for palisade wire fence beyond offered such impregnable obstacle that mere question of getting in out of room be of secondary importance now saw that there must be no great difficulty in shooting bolt of lock on inside there be strong staple with bar padlock outside have evidently be put on only when be decided to transform grand stand into prison pocket book have not be taken from have pencil attached now wrote be delighted to see even with help will be very difficult for to make escape of course nothing can be done before happen to be on night guard be posted near door can force bolt of lock inside there be padlock outside will either require file to cut through staple strong steel bar with must wrench off file must be easier with short rope must climb palisade difficulty be barbed wire outside will think over what can best be done with will let know of course will want disguise to put on if escape must be very dark night when attempt have money have having torn out leaf folded up small went out again strolled down to palisade looked through at wire with pendent tin must be awful job to get over even without tin with seems altogether impossible to do without noise thought to be very much afraid han have made journey in vain opened little bit of paper added will need little bottle of oil so a to shoot bolt without making noise will want one to help to file through staple han came on duty again at twelve o'clock yorke did not go near for hour then repeated performance of previous day a han held out matchbox to slipped tiny folded paper into hand presently sauntered back to companion joined in game of rounder evening when be locked in room told others must seem to madness have made up mind to try escape know may be shot in doing so mean to try thing be impossible harberton one of said will simply be throwing away life be perfectly aware that be very dangerous have made up mind to risk why tell be that wish to do anything must cause greater precaution to be taken so make still harder for anyone else to escape must not be harder than be one of said so if can hit upon plan of escape by mean try can speak dutch well might get off if must take out with must not try for betting against one making one way across frontier unless speaking language be at least thousand to one might not make extraordinary fuss about one fellow getting off if eight of be to do so must scour country everywhere telegraph over place think be a say piece of madness said of course if be willing to try want to prevent may be assured that even must by miracle succeed none of must care to take chance of getting out of country of course mafeking be nearest point there be boer round while regard a impossible that must get out consider must be still more impossible for of to make way across frontier if escaped with thank yorke said quietly certainly mean to try did not wish to regard a cad for going away not giving chance to escape with if have expressed opinion that escape if effected must in way make thing more unpleasant for others must have given up idea at once there be murmur of approval among hearer be very proper spirit harberton senior of party said know have always be considered that prisoner of war have right to make escape if can although escape may render watch over others more rigorous still think that be selfish ungenerous action for man to take unless be sure that others will not suffer for however in present case watch be so close obstacle to be overcome be so great in getting out in making one way across country in way must escape of one officer add to rigour of imprisonment of rest frankly a far a can see bribery be only possible mean of escape unless have secret store that abundant one can hardly hope to succeed with of fellow for there be question that hate bitterly be not thinking of method resource at present be represented by four shilling must not be sufficient think to tempt warder to give assistance be by mean sure that will get away if do will be with assistance of friend in town wish to say more because after be gone be if do go question may be asked must be best that instead of refusing to answer must be able to say that knew nothing of manner in have escaped who have assisted yorke again strolled down to palisade stood looking through thoughtfully for time fence outside be certainly a awkward obstacle a must be imagined post be six foot high wire be about eight inch apart barb little more than six inch on wire be hung three tin can between post there be three line of fencing lowest wire be four inch above ground differing from others only in having tin attached to there not being depth enough for to hang suddenly puzzled look on yorke face be succeeded by one of satisfaction be a good a done exclaimed with strong pair of nipper bottom wire can be cut will leave sufficient space to crawl under there will be about foot clear between ground next wire after deducting inch for barb there be still eleven inch lying perfectly flat one ought to be able to crawl under taking care to avoid tin day two day following yorke did not go near han one of other guard might notice latter talking two three day in succession to same prisoner on third day again placed in way handed note get strong pair of wire nipper let rope be about eighteen foot long there be nothing else will want to enable to get away if can get rifle ammunition hide little distance from prison better will save food enough hope to last for two three day have better bring in pocket too there will be moon on monday next if be on guard night near door have better try then at eleven o'clock will be listening for sound of file if hear by half past eleven will suppose that be posted somewhere else will listen three four night before night after at same hour will not write again be better that must not be noticed speaking to other so pay attention to unless have something particular to say a gave paper to han latter slipped into hand small tin oil can one of used for oiling sewing machine bicycle also paper of tobacco if be asked why be speaking to han muttered can say asked to buy quarter of pound of tobacco be well precaution have be taken for minute later one of other guard came up asked roughly what did man give yorke assumed look of surprise put hand in pocket took out little parcel there be said be quarter of pound of tobacco asked to get best must buy hope that have done so have not tried opened carelessly guard glanced at then went away satisfied with explanation be just a well yorke said to that told han not to come near again evidently that fellow have sort of suspicion must have seen speak to before for there be nothing unusual in guard fetching little thing want there be certainly nothing suspicious about han appearance have evidently not washed face for day look a dirty a of time passed a usual till three day before date appointed for four day yorke have not seen han who have be put on night guard evening have gone to door at eleven listened for hour without hearing sound have hidden away one of table knife on monday evening heard to delight low grating sound knocked gently three time to let han know that heard in hour heard bar cautiously removed with knife at once shot back bolt opened door night be pitch dark after silently grasping follower hand yorke went on to hand knee began to crawl down slope towards palisade where be sentry han asked when have nearly reached there be one at corner of stand one on side meant outside wire there be six eight of keep on marching round round when one of field cornet visited sentry other night found three asleep so order be that one must sit down stand still keep on going round round keeping a nearly a must same distance apart see how be to get through wire see way a to han have got nipper yes master yorke here be now say word till be outside just do a tell han be well content with order for have several time surveyed fencing must see possibility of getting over without not only being torn by barb also giving alarm have however not troubled very much about having implicit confidence in yorke came down upon palisade about way between two corner give rope han latter whispered cut in half made slip knot at one end of piece have taken off boot before starting now yorke went on when two piece of rope be ready do climb on to shoulder put two loop round top of one of stake let one hang down on side other outside when have fixed climb up lower by rope to ground be sure make noise a soon a be over will follow have better lie down a soon a touch ground a han be able to reach top of palisade from yorke shoulder must carry out order without noise yorke then climbed up by rope have rather doubted whether han must be able to accomplish a though strong be unaccustomed to anything like athletic exercise to yorke however matter be easy when reached other side lay down lie quiet till tell han nearest fence be six foot from palisade finding one of post yorke cut lowest wire close to then cut again four foot away from post carefully dragged severed portion further along have thought that must be best plan a if tried to coil wire up might spring back again strike one of tin on line above tin be for most part hung half way between post a vibration there must be greatest when have done whispered to han there be room enough to crawl under wire now must lie perfectly flat will be caught by barb push hat through in front of first if must catch try to move must set tin ringing will come free if be careful ought to have trouble can get through easily enough next line be five yard outside inner one a soon a han be through first fence yorke proceeded to cut lower wire a before lie where be till have cleared way through outside fence whispered to han dark a be might see if there be two of together while work be going on sentry have passed frequently followed other however at somewhat long interval a sauntered along slowly smoking pipe occasionally humming hymn tune kept fifteen twenty yard outside boundary fence so a to be sure that in dark must not run against not only tear clothes by shaking tin give false alarm to facilitate lantern have be placed at distance away from corner so that a soon a passed one must see gleam of walk straight for yorke waited till two of guard be about equally distant from where be lying before cutting last wire be very careful in using steady pressure on plier so a to prevent closing in with click time instead of risking second cut crawled along little distance with end then gave low hiss han be soon beside now han will go together certainly can not see here so will crawl under last wire then lie still till next guard pass wait till have gone twenty yard then stand up make dash run a lightly a can even if hears will be out of sight before can unsling rifle fire crawling under wire remained a flat a possible on ground until next sentry passed must scarcely make out outline of figure waited till have quite disappeared then yorke pressed follower hand rose to foot quietly made off footstep be almost inaudible even to on sandy soil a soon a be past line sentry be following quickened step after going fifty yard broke into run be free now there have be no challenge by guard on side of pause in slow dull tread of heavy boot have run hundred yard when yorke said now way han have got rifle for yes master got two from lot be standing against wall of drinking shop while owner be inside what did get two for han brought own out with did yes peter wanted one too peter yorke repeated in surprise what peter long peter master what have come with yes be who came to said 'you know baa have be taken prisoner ' said 'yes heard morning ' said must go get out of hand of boer have not thought of such thing then of course said be ready so went in told colonel wanted to go gave leave then put on farm clothes got yours from room peter have said that have better ride so mounted horse came off where be now han be at little house about quarter of mile from other side of race course be empty be there with clothes horse food must take turn go round there wo be easy to find on dark night yorke said will find easily enough han replied confidently peter pointed out to that from door two lantern on side be just in line so that when came round must only have to keep so must come straight to house kaffir be sharp fellow a well a faithful one yorke said be well have guide to house for otherwise might have searched about till daybreak horse must not matter so much without disguise must not hope to get away in few minute arrived at house native be standing at door holding horse be first rate fellow peter yorke said a shook warmly by hand downright brick to have made long journey run end of risk to get out be lucky indeed to have two such friend a han must not stop there baa know that be in prison native said simply not very difficult to get here for travel always at night way will go now have be thinking over have decided that have better go down to johannesburg be large town people be sure to be there from part will be le noticed what do think han be what have be thinking too master yorke do know how road lie from here peter yes baa sweep round town three four mile then come on road do think must find way right quite sure to find baa cloud clearing off soon have star come out then will start at once be not likely to meet anyone on road if keep on will be half way there by daylight can then decide what will do now where be thing in bundle baa have ready because if have heard shot fired must have run with horse in direction so a to meet yorke did not wait to take off uniform slipped boer clothes over now where be provision asked in bag behind saddle kaffir said four blanket tied in front one for of one for horse be right have better lead horse for next half mile for on still night like might hear sound if be to trot say that must give alarm a must not say who be if be to discover that have gone might remember that heard horse so guess line have taken went quietly along for quarter of hour then yorke said be far enough off now will mount here when be tired han can take place will walk han laughed can keep on time said will let know if be tired proceeded slowly for next half hour when a kaffir have predicted cloud cleared off star came out now can go on fast baa then have better get up behind han horse must have have little to do lately can carry double very well will thus gain lot of time will have rest at kaffir ran on lightly ahead at trot horse followed in hour came on road south maintaining pace breaking occasionally into walk for short distance kept on till morning broke be half past twelve when started by four have done twenty five mile be within ten mile of johannesburg think may a well push on to town yorke said if be to leave road take to veldt people might notice from farmhouse wonder what be doing there think so too master yorke travelled by night coming here because horse be too good for rough boer to be riding will get off now walk beside will look natural enough be young boer farmer be one of farm hand be going to johannesburg to buy thing want have brought one of kaffir to carry back one must think twice about will certainly be best han can not know yet that anything be wrong at prison fact that lower wire be cut will not be noticed for time later pulled up rope inside inclosure dropped outside before slid down so alarm be not likely to be given until go to open door of room put bar in place when closed at rate may calculate that will be fully seven o'clock before alarm be given outside prison even if telegraph direct to johannesburg to keep look out for must be in town before message arrives will doubt suspect that be with for will see that staple have be filed through on outside a will be missing when relieve guard at six o'clock probably description will be sent out with mine when get to town will go in with peter only have better not follow road go round enter town at other point han agreed that must be best plan dismounting taking hold of yorke stirrup leather trotted alongside when within two mile of johannesburg saw two mounted boer coming along in distance at once broke into walk when met boer latter be engaged in conversation paid attention to party beyond returning yorke salutation met one else until within quarter of mile of town han here left others peter who have hidden rifle in clothes since have first seen two boer approach now concealed in bush twenty yard from road must have be out of character altogether for native to carry arm in transvaal yorke rode on a soon a have be done found principal street comparatively deserted greater portion of store be closed many of have door open broken showing that forcible entry have be made content carried away of hotel be closed others be open uncleaned window general appearance of untidiness showed that there be few people staying there that owner kept open a matter of policy rather than of gain yorke dismounted before second rate looking establishment peter took rein led horse into yard kaffir boy came out from stable put horse in yorke who followed said may be staying here for day two after seeing done went into house want breakfast said in dutch to untidy looking german who sauntered into hall will want bed to night all right man said can go upstairs choose room like be empty suppose bacon egg will do for breakfast have nothing else except canned meat bacon egg will do very well will be ready in quarter of hour man said have put horse in stable yorke went on be there news yes have beaten buller again suppose have heard that farm be out of way of news when be on th at least be last of be fighting for week say that pretty near half of be killed took strong hill called spion kop drove out again buller have recrossed tugela expect now that will give up in ladysmith a know that be starving there be longer chance of buller getting in must know that by time will be turn next when ladysmith surrender will chase buller down to durban by tone in man spoke

darkness yorke handed matchbox saying go light lamp candle whichever have will stand at door while deliver message come out directly have given wish to alarm lady terrified girl struck three four match before must obtain light then went to door opposite english gentleman want to speak to sir show into dining room thinking be one of other englishman who have like stayed at mine mr chamber came out started with sudden exclamation a eye fell upon peter standing with rifle in hand by side of servant if will step inside mr chamber will explain matter yorke said stepping forward there be occasion for slightest uneasiness have taken step see not to alarm lady of family mr chamber be still further surprised at address by stranger who in spite of attire a dutch farmer be evidently english who be sir asked what be meaning of extraordinary conduct name be harberton be lieutenant in th lancer be when be captured by boer acting a one of general pole carew aide de camp have doubt heard to day of escape last night from one of prison at pretoria think be sufficient introduction quite mr chamber said holding out hand shaking that of yorke congratulate on escape now will explain to why have thus fallen upon servant walked into dining room shut door before answer question mr harberton must ask if be in need of refreshment not at sir will now give account of business related how han have overheard plot to capture treasure with aid of mr chamber own servant how be at moment already gathering round house fool mr chamber said must have doubt taken life murdered wife daughter gold must never have got will explain that afterwards have indeed rendered inestimable service thank with heart in own name in of family so have rascal of mine tied up safely illustration be prisoner yorke said sternly think so sir must be a well to see to little more closely for will want two men when fellow arrive in first place can enter at other point than at front door have iron shutter to window be not closed at present moment for on hot evening one want air however will be first step will turn light out then can shut window close shutter without being noticed outside will then go round with to other room shut up too bolt bar back door be lined with iron in drawing room will ask one of girl to shut window draw down blind even if scoundrel be watching that will seem natural act will then shut shutter there tell lady that there be little trouble ahead that need not fear be in slightest way uneasy a have plenty of assistance can easily dispose of ruffian who have idea of breaking in have better request to go upstairs until matter be over in quarter of hour preparation be made three servant have be more carefully bound be beyond possibility of loosing rope unless by very prolonged exertion have just finished preparation when whistle be heard outside be signal for to be seized mr chamber said grimly suppose will give accomplice five minute to carry out how have better post mr harberton must say two in doorway will have rifle ready must let get well into hall then can step out when say let drive at three mauser will give fifteen shot have one with rifle five with revolver a will be taken wholly by surprise be hardly likely that will be able to fire single shot ought to be able to account for almost of think have better turn out light in drawing room lower lamp in hall so that will have indistinct view of a open door be done two minute later there be light tapping on door outside yorke stepped forward opened short distance be asked of course be be all right yes everything be ready for quickly stepped back until level with others door be thrown open number of men poured in turn up light one said with oath what have turned down for there shut that door behind one of woman may have got revolver want sound heard now where be here yorke replied turned up light other three instantly stepped out four rifle be fired almost simultaneously shriek oath of fury heavy fall be heard a yorke companion emptied magazine of rifle into group crack of mr chamber revolver joined in din not shot be fired in return when last cartridge have be fired most of assailant lay dead in hall men who have last entered panic stricken at sudden outburst of fire have tried to open door have just closed backward rush of others prevented from doing so be not until ten have fallen that other two be able to open door fly hastily recharging magazine yorke two follower ran out moment later heard sound of galloping horse cracking whip knew that pursuit must be futile however a have name of owner of cart mattered little returned to house mr chamber have at once gone upstairs to assure lady that affair be over that none of in house have be hurt examining body found that most of have two bullet wound three mauser bullet having at short range passed through two even more body several be hit in head most of in chest be just a well yorke said when have ascertained that none of be breathing will save further trouble at moment there be sound of step outside loud continuous knocking at door mr chamber threw open window upstairs who be asked have just run down from mine sir heard sound of firing here thank lad be over now may be of use ran down opened door six men be there armed with gun see there have be hard fight here lad said a exclamation of surprise broke from men at scene in hall fortunately have be warned just in time with aid of gentleman friend have a see killed ten of only two got away now want talk about lend hand will to get body outside then want hole dug deep enough to hold put hundred yard away from house will be heavy job will put right with on saturday will get other five men up from below sir want matter talked about fewer that know of le chance there be of getting about trust that will all keep silent tongue about affair can trust for sir none of be hurt hope not in slightest there be not shot fired on side took completely by surprise must say sir best place to bury must be to make hole in foot of one of pit heap then can shovel loose stuff down from above must be much shorter job than digging hole there be chance of ever being disturbed there very good plan simmonds will be unpleasant job anyhow wait minute on going to dining room returned with two bottle of whisky han peter assisted in carrying body outside then offered to bring pail of water remove blood stain in hall after to assist in carrying body away by time servant have come down relighted lamp in drawing room yorke mr chamber went in there wonder sir yorke said that be not afraid to keep so large sum in house generally do so a gold be melted down be brought here for safety once week be sent to bank so that amount seldom exceeds two thousand ounce time have be altogether different when saw that kruger be bent upon war put hand on to get richest stuff in reserve consequence be that weekly output be five time a large a usual sent ordinary amount to bank keeping other by intended to send down at once by rail in box with false mark on if must not do to keep here till war be over kruger sudden ultimatum took a well a everyone else by surprise be certain then must not get down that if sent to bank kruger people must lay hand upon a in fact did with what have sent in be only few of official in smelting room who have idea of output even must hardly have told what amount sent into bank be clear however that one of must have carelessly mentioned that fellow who made attack must have discovered perhaps from servant who used to help to load van from one of guard who have accompanied to unload at bank that a amount sent in be about same a usual there must remain very large sum indeed hidden have really very little fear of house being broken into in order to prevent suspicion of there being money here discharged men who always kept watch round house at night at same time paid off other hand except engineer who kept pumping engine at work to keep down water in mine then relied upon fact that burglar getting into house must have difficulty in finding safe still more difficulty in opening have doubt a to honesty of servant who alone knew position did not know manner in be protected be situated under study be at back of room safe be extremely strong one of alternate sheet of steel iron be made specially for open at top get at by taking up carpet in study lifting trap door vault in safe stand be two foot way wider than safe a stand in centre there be foot of vacant space on side of round upper part of safe there be sliding apparatus by stout steel case like bottomless box can be drawn up to level of trap door however be only done when safe be to be opened in next place have communication from what may call strong room with pipe brings water for garden with large cistern upstairs thus strong room be kept filled with water safe be therefore surrounded above a well a on four side with water when want to open safe go into study by lift heavy trap door be cased with inch of steel be easily moved by mean of counter poise then with aid of lever in secret closet push up box until be level with floor may say that safe be three inch wider way than trap door door of safe being one inch narrower way than trap door open through having got box be perfectly water tight into place work handle in secret cupboard pump out water in frame above safe then open door of safe be now ready for men to come in store gold away when have left close door of safe lower frame to place safe be at once covered with foot of water thus see burglar must have succession of difficulty must in first place be obliged to cut through steel of trap door then must find to surprise water immediately underneath until be removed must be impossible for to blow in door of safe must naturally try to bucket out a must come in again a fast a did so must gain nothing by might try to blow in safe with waterproof cartridge doubt whether must succeed lid be of immense strength if did succeed in bursting there be equally strong foot lower also must have to be destroyed even then hole made must not be sufficient to let through only way must possibly get gold out must be to try fish out box with hook at end of pole again almost impossible task a box be square very heavy packed tightly together so that there must be nothing to get hold of may say that got idea from reading in time of commune of paris how bank be able to protect specie in vault by filling with water from main worked out detail think improved on original though be good enough for baffled effort of mechanic engineer of commune to get at money be splendid plan certainly sir yorke said yes though must have saved gold must not have saved life have thought that amount there be in safe be known to anyone now in johannesburg think must have shut up house moved to one have in town contenting with keeping couple of watchman in house seeing that be right day when came to see that men at pumping engine be doing duty be what will most likely do now not that think there be probability of renewal of attempt lesson have be altogether too severe what do mean to do sir with three rascal will go to morrow to head of police tell that have tried to rob house ask to send down dozen men to take by next train to komati poort must hing with here for man han be only witness against must not of course appear fortunately know will tell that if be to hand over to police charge with crime must certainly be hanged however be willing to allow for temptation have will only charge with dishonesty have then sent out of transvaal a doubt at present expect nothing short of hanging will be glad enough to be let off so lightly certainly ought to be yorke said warmly for be great deal worse than others discharged men ruffian of town might have done servant who have doubt be well treated by ought to have be faithful quite agree with mr harberton see that be of greatest importance to not to have matter talked about if there be enquiry must of course come out that there be large sum of money in house may be quite sure that kruger must commandeer a be bribe of couple of hundred pound to head of police will ensure fellow being sent out of country without opportunity being given of saying word to anyone may be sure that will impress upon that if ever set foot in transvaal again will have arrested at once on charge in way have hope that affair will be kept altogether dark know of course whether two men who brought cart be included in twelve sir must think very likely did not want to have to divide spoil into more portion than necessary must think most probable that left cart outside came in with others whether be among who be killed not of course can not say yes must think must be sure to come in with others mr chamber said in case there be only two men who know anything about matter may be sure that will keep mouth closed well have talked more than enough of affair now about if two follower like to stay here think might certainly do so with safety need not say how heartily welcome must be thank sir though will gladly stay till morning must then be off be anxious to get back a quickly a possible to rejoin lord methuen force have now be nearly month away then too must put in appearance at hotel where have be staying for be obliged to enquire way to house landlord will be expecting back to night will have to make excuse for absence if appear in morning might suspect that something be wrong give information with description of appearance to authority must arrange mr chamber said must look in there in morning say that a be so late night dark have asked to stay at house till morning that have gone off without returning to town ah there be wife daughter chapter xv down country be mr harberton to whom owe life mr chamber said a wife followed by two daughter girl of sixteen eighteen entered room know how to thank sir mr chamber said a shook hand with yorke for assuredly must have be murdered have not be for warning assistance be rather to man than to myself be indebted mr chamber for be who overheard conversation afternoon at affair be finally arranged showed greater sharpness than must have given credit for a ordinary thing must merely have taken glass of liquor left place fact that men in saloon stopped speaking when went in asked whether spoke english be not satisfied that must not went into room to talk excited curiosity sitting with ear against partition be able to make out what be saying be very sharp of mr chamber said be pretty certain must have taken step in matter have not be for leading especially a be a understand from husband instrumental in aiding escape from prison so dared not attract attention beg of try to minimize service have rendered for certainly will not lessen obligation that be under to shudder to think of great danger have escaped know be not likely that attack will be made yet will never feel comfortable here after husband have promised to take into town house to morrow morning to stop till war be over hope will go with mr harberton say that must be off at once dear want to get back to fighting again be sorry indeed for that seems unnatural after what have done for that must let go away so soon now do tell something about first where have put men john one be locked up in cellar in stable third in wood house so that can not aid other to get away at rate went on none of will feel inclined for much sleep to night want to know about mr harberton how dutch servant came to be at pretoria about what have be doing since landed truth about battle have be fought before begin will go into kitchen girl help jane get tea in dining room with whatever there be in house will do good wo ask mr harberton to tell story till have have what may call supper while be away mr chamber said may a well ask a to whether have plan for getting down to modder have distinct plan except that a see be dressed a young boer farmer a talk language sufficiently to pas muster can support character well enough how be that talk dutch rather suppose must say taal mr harberton will tell presently yorke laughed will have to go over same thing twice man han be regimental servant have learnt to speak english very fairly of course know dutch kaffir speaks dutch little english a speak little kaffir get on very well together have just put up horse in stable have time to lose when first came here fastened up behind house where be not likely to be observed if of fellow went round there a for getting to modder appeared to that a dutch farmer with one of farm hand kaffir labourer might get through without exciting much suspicion might might not mr chamber said see almost able bodied men be away with commando must be likely to be closely questioned a to why be not in field if be going other way must be more easy for might then say that be coming from cape colony a thousand of others have done to join boer even in case must seem strange that be going away from fighting instead of joining commando at once must be still more strange that must have come up to johannesburg what did say at inn what excuse did make for enquiring where lived pretended that people have gone on commando leaving to look after farm be going over to see about cattle that wanted for men still working on mine man be german did not think see anything unlikely in story yes though might do very well here must hardly do elsewhere besides boer be related connected with other ignorant a be on other matter can give name of almost family within fifty sixty mile of where live know more le name of farmer in transvaal landdrosts of town will have be warned to look out for young english officer young dutchman who will doubt be making for frontier two of at least answer to personal description dress must not go for much a must be sure that man who aided escape must also procure disguise for however must put head together to morrow see if can hit on plan after meal be finished mr chamber asked yorke to tell something about what have seen of war be of that principally want to know said after service have rendered must like to know a much a possible about people at home in fact anything that may choose to tell especially a to prospect in future longer make story better will be pleased certainly will not go to bed to night think wife daughter will be anxious to do so for time there be general murmur of agreement yorke accordingly told of life at home reason why have come out how have learnt dutch little kaffir on cousin farm how resolve to enlist in war have be quickened by quarrel with dirck jansen how after scouting for short time with twenty kaffir under command have witnessed four battle have gained commission in lancer by carrying message into kimberley back to modder then told of capture how han have with kaffir journeyed up to pretoria to rescue how have finally succeeded well have certainly managed to crowd great deal of adventure into little more than year mr harberton have done well through deserved commission have won so say saw rhodes in kimberley did have much talk with yes sir asked great many question told though not so fully what have told asked if intended to stop in army after war be over said that have idea of doing so a have come out with intention of making money be good enough to speak flatteringly of having learned to speak dutch so soon said that if when thing be settled must go to must have berth for push forward must not have better patron be biggest man out here by far be virtually king of rhodesia will please remember must have say in matter very considerable one none of four must be alive now have not be for though think scoundrel must have got at gold might have done so for must have have plenty of time a if of engineer have wanted to know anything one of servant must only have have to say be ill away for few day before week might very well have found out how strong room be filled with water cut off supply then emptied out far enough to allow to work at safe can not assert that gold be absolutely safe yet there be saying what may happen before troop arrive here greed of kruger gang be insatiable may search house belonging to bank manager from top to bottom demand to inspect safe why not bury of sir in one of mine tip just a have hidden body because although have reason to believe that twelve white men who be still at work be honest fellow there be point at temptation may be too great might find when came to examine horde that be gone be not aware of existence of store here be well must not be one have heard before now of ship laden with treasure being seized by crew who until temptation came in way may have be honest fellow will take chance will tell two head engineer to come down take up quarter here bring two good men out of shift with in way there will always be three men in house a for police here be a whole biggest rogue in place must rather shut up house leave empty than have of here now be two o'clock if can not sleep have doubt can will show up to

johannesburg be going to take up from series of accident began certainly by learning dutch enabled to get through to kimberley get commission thanks to accident of peter getting away sticking to then there be being captured that did not seem piece of good fortune thanks to han sharpness have turned out best piece of luck of if can get safely back to modder there be old saying that luck be better than rich did not believe formerly have turned out so in case have not father lost money must be grinding away at rugby must have thought lucky four five year hence to get curacy of one hundred twenty pound year yorke be up at seven started at once on horseback for town taking peter with leaving han behind in charge of prisoner where have be night innkeeper asked must not get to see mr chamber till

delighted to give pair of own must be sure to attract attention for rather pride on stud have got double harness for cart though when go longer journey follow boer fashion drive four horse own horse be used to being driven cousin generally have out when went in to richmond be very much obliged to for offer must certainly attract le attention in cart than if rode will myself drive a enjoy know that a rule boer generally let kaffir drive must be content to do so good many boer do drive there will be nothing unusual in indeed about here most of boer drive a see uitlanders do will put saddle in cart for when get near frontier will certainly find easier to get through on horseback must advise to take direct road south to bloemfontein have friend there be dutchman thorough believer in

of time to talk over before then han yorke went on after long pause must advise not to spend money on building house for yourself at first sort of hut will do though five hundred pound seems very large sum to will want for work well horse gear will cost good bit then will have water course to make ground to irrigate say five acre to begin with be always good plan to keep money in hand in case of accident such a well failing having to go deeper of kaffir running away besides must have horse cart to take good to market at rate han if want to get on will have to bestir know that young english

to do han must not be good for be always better that man must depend upon not upon day will want to marry then will see how much better be to have nice home business than to be merely working for wage

yorke be lucky day for when came to mr allnutt took to go out riding shooting with have turned out quite a fortunate for han peter who be not given to speaking unless addressed said little occasionally a looked at yorke han shook with silent laughter at changed appearance indeed transformation effected by long hair be striking to one accustomed to closely cropped head by way however went about work taking horse out of cart supplying with water grain rubbing down be evident that already in imagination considered to be far more important person than be before that be preparing for change from humble position of casual labourer in small town to of man of position influence among tribe occasionally must break into burst of apparently unprovoked laughter a if change appeared to ludicrous in extreme be on move at first sign of daylight potchefstroom be still asleep when drove through at eight o'clock crossed vaal drove into reitzburg couple of boer came up asked where came from be quite satisfied with answer from potchefstroom a considered that if have be allowed to pas through there journey must be legitimate one illustration one of boer have spoken to sauntered in have pas from chief of police at johannesburg if must like to see one of men replied if be good enough for in transvaal be good enough for suppose be going down to army yes want to do share of fighting quite right must lose time will be too late so suppose by say yorke replied thought a well to wait for hour to feed horse take meal leaving peter to look after horse see that nobody touched gun other article in cart went into small inn while be eating meal one of boer have spoken to sauntered in be there news at johannesburg not particular thing be very quiet there did not hear did of escaped prisoner being caught did hear that one of english officer have got away from jail yes be what mean telegraphed to here from pretoria of course must never come down way still have to obey order keep sharp look out if have come way must have be caught expect however went east must not get far say be quite young chap with close cropped hair well young officer can not have learned to talk dutch so there ought to be difficulty in catching yorke said have got dutchman with suppose wo open lip dutchman will do talking for han have better say something yorke laughed possibly may be taken for british officer look much like british officer with cropped head han said talk own language better than do english by long way oh knew must not be man boer said still be glad to see that be dutch a well a master there might be question asked now can swear that be africander will satisfy anyone questioning a to who have be along see what occasion there be for making fuss about one officer getting away when will soon have army prisoner give everyone lot of trouble will have glass of spirit yorke asked a be with hope of obtaining invitation that boer have come in assented willingly remained talking until yorke said be time for to be going on slept that night at winkel drift on rhenoster river drove next day to kroonstad here question be asked put up at inn yorke mentioned casually that be intending to stay with friend for day of two at bloemfontein then going to front have avoided entering town until be dusk a many boer be constantly passing down to join commando one thought of enquiring minutely into affair three more day took to bloemfontein there yorke noticed a drove in many store with british name over be still open for wholesale expulsion of english from transvaal have not extended to orange free state where till outbreak of war good feeling have existed between two people at bloemfontein especially considerable portion of trading class have be british considering that if left store must probably be looted thought better to remain although position be not pleasant one have received fair treatment at hand of boer chapter xvi old enemy arriving at bloemfontein in evening first went to hotel having engaged room seen horse put up yorke proceeded to house of dutch gentleman to whom letter mr chamber have given be addressed on sending one in be shown into sitting room where mr von rensburg presently joined be bearer of letter mr meyring from friend mr chamber yes sir of also did not care to give into hand own mr von rensburg took little surprised first have be so simple matter of fact that have not suspected for moment that yorke be not a stated employ at mine looked scrutinizingly at yorke when have read second letter will not ask who be mr meyring whether be real name be just a well not to know more than can help understand want to cross into cape colony may be glad of advice a to best road to take in first place may ask how came here by rail sir drove have friend with be open to to drive from point a have two horse to ride to go on foot though naturally must rather not adopt last plan if must be helped that can well understand other said with smile indeed must be worst method must be far more natural for to be driving riding than going on foot now tell exactly how stand see be dressed a young farmer in comfortable circumstance how about friend be dressed a farm hand sir have also kaffir with to look after horse be companion dutch yes sir be not think speak taal very well fancy can detect that be not own language be so yorke agreed be glad to say that be first person who have noticed be not surprised at for really speak very well be more tone of voice than anything wrong in language may call dialect be noticeable have learned partly from book sir chiefly from conversing in almost entirely for six month must have knack of learning language if have picked up so well in so short time have only arrived here to day suppose yes sir hour ago from johannesburg yorke made gesture of assent be suppose intimate with mr chamber can scarcely say be intimate with man for be servant a well a friend happened to overhear plot to murder mr chamber loot house with kaffir mr chamber gave ruffian so warm reception that there be not likely to be repetition of attempt be strong party there be twelve of only two got away alive really dangerous part of affair be that three men in house be also in plot have tied up before others arrived be very thorough piece of business indeed mr von rensburg said more warmly than have spoken before can well understand now that friend chamber must be anxious to aid in way will tell little more about be not suppose pressed for time not at sir yorke related more fully incident connected with affair be fortunate escape for mr chamber doubt scoundrel thought that have money in house must hardly have gone in such number if have only be question of ordinary robbery be employment at mine confined to exploit entirely sir a house stand on mine property mr chamber said when wrote letter that must say with good conscience have be employed there have one question to ask be personally known to anyone here mean be there anyone whom must be likely to meet who must recognize sir think there be anyone here likely to have seen before if there must be anyone be sure must not know in present disguise asked question mr von rensburg went on a in case there be occasion for to make instant decision a to route have better take if there have be danger of being recognized must say have better start to morrow morning early a be can take time about be in very pressing hurry though must be glad to be on other side of orange river a soon a can have already be away nearly seven week can guess pretty well who be mr meyring other said with smile though want to know must certainly be glad if must take up residence here while remain think be better that must not be not very popular here at present because opposed free state taking part with transvaal can call upon at hotel very well because then must there be question can simply show letter first sent in say that know nothing more than think at likely that question will arise coming to see will be advantage to rather than otherwise for will show that be not altogether unknown person will evening think over what people know on different road where party of men be stationed how have best proceed thank very much sir at what hour be likely to call will say ten o'clock will bring good map have with have better merely call ask for then bring here must look strange if be to ask for private room certainly can not talk that over in public room will not know that have be here to night have better send man with letter again in morning tell before landlord anyone else that be to take letter to say that have arrived will call upon at hour be convenient in reference to business programme be carried out at ten o'clock yorke be standing at door of hotel when mr von rensburg came up went into hotel without noticing yorke said to landlord have mr meyring staying here have not yes sir be outside just now went to door there be sir said pointing to yorke mr von rensburg went up to name be von rensburg mr meyring did not know when must be disengaged so did not send answer to letter brought be free now if will come with to house will talk over business mentioned see commando have better join thank sir be naturally anxious to lose time must certainly prefer joining force be likely to be engaged innkeeper two other men lounging near heard what said paid further attention to a walked off once in mr von rensburg parlour latter said will not be easy matter to get through drift be guarded on orange river riet of course nearest way be through petrusburg jacobsdal put that out of question then there be road through fauresmith across orange at zoutpans drift that also be long way round believe that a good way a must be to take boshof road across modder at truters drift from there road keep along for three mile north of modder lead finally to kimberley cut road from boshof to jacobsdal at point there be strong force to prevent british from trying to make detour way be name of various commando there at jacobsdal at drift across orange safest way though longer in mile must be to go south to bethulie a if be going to join commando at steynsburg better still colesberg once past colesberg must find difficulty in making way to de aar must help more way than other because must get pas for horse servant kaffir direct by rail to colesberg so that really must not lose so much time a might think for from colesberg to de aar be not much more than distance that be from here to jacobsdal philippolis commando be there know country on other side of seacow river yorke said once past colesberg must make way easily enough must much rather choose line once at de aar must not have much more than hundred mile to ride to modder even if must not get up by train then will see officer in charge of railway arrangement find out when train be going down to colesberg with ammunition supply if be not taking horse down will get to put on truck for animal what do mean to do with cart mr chamber said must do anything liked with must only be in way now for track beyond colesberg west be a much a horse can manage besides must find more difficult to get away from town in vehicle than on horseback well if be must speak to innkeeper must be likely to know someone who must want to buy if not have better leave with tell that be so anxious to get to front that care about wasting time here looking about for purchaser ask to sell for to keep money until return for must appear careful about for dutch farmer however well off must throw away value of good cart have therefore better ask to write to at post office colesberg telling what sum have sold for a know have come here sir might ask to hand money over to a have kindly offered to remit to yes must be a well to seem a anxious a possible when come round afternoon to tell result of enquiry about train will look at cart be very good one sir of cape colony make only want repainting to appear quite new in case will tell innkeeper that if doe not know of anyone who will buy at once will give sum may value at if at end of week doe find purchaser at price will take cart more le make little difference may a well have money a let innkeeper put in pocket money ought to go back to mr chamber sir will be much more useful in pocket than in gave thing to do a liked with certainly will not expect to be paid for must be hurt rather than pleased at money being sent to doubt will find us for innkeeper however knew of trader in town who wanted good cart matter be arranged in few minute there be train going that evening with order signed by military secretary at bloemfontein for gert meyring han bernard going to join philippolis commando at colesberg accompanied by kaffir boy to travel by military train started that evening be open truck a have brought blanket horse rug in cart for sleeping on veldt preferred night journey to being exposed to scorching ray of sun day took fifteen hour to cover distance between bloemfontein colesberg after getting horse out of truck saddled slung rifle bandolier over shoulder strapped blanket behind saddle then rode into town be little more than long single street extending along bottom of very narrow valley peter have be most reluctant to leave rifle behind at bloemfontein have be allowed to bring saying that if be questioned must say that be spare rifle belonging to yorke a be notorious that in battle of graspan belmont many of richer boer have be attended by servant who loaded spare rifle so enabled to keep up steady fire yorke have consented a at worst must be taken away for use of boer with inferior weapon felt that time might come when must be well that peter must be able to give efficient aid good many armed men be in street paid attention to new comer yorke avoided principal inn where field cornet of commando must probably have taken up quarter alighted at of le pretension have room disengaged asked landlord on entering landlord looked doubtful want to commandeer room yorke went on pay for what have landlord face brightened yes have double bedded room vacant will do though must have liked two single one native boy will of course sleep in stable with horse if will show room will carry up spare rifle blanket there will want meal at once for have just arrived by train from bloemfontein meal be good one after be eaten yorke went to bar landlord be standing behind will pay for meal a have yorke said for room for to night know when may be off may be sent suddenly away so that be a well to keep thing squared up so please add charge for stable food for horse landlord made out bill when have paid yorke said must like to have talk with be difficult to get news at bloemfontein a to what be going on down here a have only just arrived be altogether ignorant a to situation if will come into parlour behind bar will tell know dare say have good cigar yorke asked when be seated yes sell many of at present took box out of cupboard where be hidden under cork duster yorke took out two handed one to landlord lighted other be english see yes be mostly english here worse luck just at present be english too yorke said speaking for first time in own language landlord looked at in astonishment must never have thought said speak dutch ever so much better than do look like boer over yes be disguised have made way down from johannesburg want to get through boer line be what want to talk to about where be now first tell have be done here well on st of november boer came in here have own way for two month then on st of january general french came up surrounded place there be fighting in hill for two three day boer captured company of suffolks who attacked hill outside town be afterwards reinforced so strongly that after repulsing one attack french retired thing have be quiet since english hold molteno good many men have gone down way do know what commando be here now be principally colonial rebel from west from south have philippolis commando here have not have till yesterday then be summoned to go to steynsburg for say that one of column be advancing against dordrecht be lucky for railway pas say that be going to join that commando now that find be gone can not report therefore escape questioning how many boer be there in around here from thousand to twelve hundred how have be behaving landlord shrugged shoulder take pretty well what want give bit of paper say will be paid when war be over mean out of money expect to get from government a indemnity of course look at in light only keep in hope that will be proof of loss that have suffered that government will take up when finally thrash boer where be twelve hundred men there be three four hundred of on hill round town have got gun there to keep in order a say most of others be wandering about in band plundering farm of loyal settler fancy have small party out towards west keeping sharp look out lest force must come way from de aar think trust chiefly to getting news from dutch farmer between hanover railway there then best way undoubtedly must be to cross seacow river either by road leading north west to hopetown from to philipstown by third road to hanover north road be least likely to be watched a force from de aar must certainly come through philipstown through hanover seem to know country well landlord said in surprise know on side of river know pretty well on other once across have little fear of being captured who be field cornet in command moens be in command of party on hill believe generally of be a well to know though want to see when once get outside circle of hill can tell boer may fall in with be ordered by to watch bank of river how long do mean to stay landlord asked be two o'clock now yorke said must rather not go till to morrow must like to see little of country horse have only have day rest after eight day hard travelling so will go out into town see where road intend to go by leaf will want to buy thing for journey for can not reckon upon getting to de aar in much le than three day will get anything want landlord said have plenty of bread meat in house must put couple of bottle of good wine into saddle bag thank must be best especially a will want meat cooked there be three of a sha' have much else can do with at least two pound day about same quantity of bread will want bag of mealie for horse must pick up much on veldt have got six water bottle will be a well to fill before start for may cross river in hurry there be not much chance of finding water in of spruits have got tin mug only other thing require be tobacco forgot to lay in supply at bloemfontein can pick up pony for kaffir yorke now went out joined han who be waiting for in street looking carelessly at shop a went along made way out of town having be directed by innkeeper struck off by road intended to follow without having to ask question went about mile then returned a must have seemed unnatural for to be seen walking farther think know a much a need about now yorke said may a well go back to inn be quite evident that be not likely to be asked question here indeed a far a can see anywhere unless come upon outpost loitered about street for hour one spoke to for boer force there be composed of men from various part of colony a well a from free state a be to great extent unknown to other fresh face excited attention yorke on return found landlord have bought stout pony for peter hour later peter ran into room baa exclaimed there be three boer looking at horse say that one of be stolen yorke han caught up rifle bandolier ran downstairs be rubbing down baa in yard when came in one of pointed to brand on horse ride said knew then asked who be master said ber meyring ' said ' have reason to believe that horse be stolen from friend of mine if be in inn tell to come here ' yard be at back of house with gate opening into lane behind a entered yorke started involuntarily for recognized in one of men who be standing by horse old enemy dirck jansen have never occurred to that a richmond lay eighty mile from colesberg be point dirck must be most likely to make for a soon a be seized by men of free state fortunately dirck back be towards did not notice momentary pause where did get horse sir dirck asked authoritatively be not accustomed to be questioned in tone yorke said quietly have have horse for month have at pretoria have be stolen dirck said angrily belonged to neighbour of mine near richmond have seen riding know well that must never have sold say that stole simply say that be stolen unless can prove to that came by honestly will take be not in habit of carrying receipt about for month yorke said do show to first stranger who rudely asks for man here can confirm what say have have animal for more than six month calmness with yorke answered still further excited passionate young boer turned suddenly upon han on whose face there be broad grin of amusement insolent young lout exclaimed how dare laugh when better be talking brought down heavy whip upon head knocking off hat almost striking to ground ah exclaimed a saw face plainly know now be fellow who ran away from allnutt farm now understand doubt be turned towards yorke before name be out of lip yorke sprung at with same blow have once before proved so effective knocked off foot head striking heavily on pavement of yard two companion raised shout must have thrown upon yorke peter who have scarcely taken in purport of conversation sprang upon one of grasped by throat han have a recovered from blow have received snatched rifle from shoulder grasping by muzzle met other boer with sweeping stroke caught on temple prostrated apparently lifeless on ground hold that fellow tight peter yorke said sharply choke if struggle han fetch one of picket rope from stable now tie dirck up hand foot tightly shove handkerchief into mouth will do for present will fasten more securely afterwards now help to carry into stable be right drop down in empty stall now rope then will tie fellow peter have hold of peter slacken hold little be black in face now round leg first han will do now peter will drag into stable there be fear of shouting for minute two now han for man rather fancy have killed ca help whether have not now can tie more securely gag dirck peter man effectually need not trouble about third if doe come round wo be for long time now will drag to farthest stall so that if anyone happens to look into stable wo notice unless enters now han run upstairs fetch down blanket thing saddle horse will look in pay for horse other thing landlord have bought for have got thing for asked landlord yes be in basket thanks will pack in saddle bag at once be off in hurry have just be recognized by one of boer have minute to lose let know what owe altogether will pack thing while be making out account where be kaffir boy be not in yard have sent into town on errand well when return will manage to send somewhere else will keep from going to stable for next hour have particular reason for wishing that one will enter for at least that time be just a well that must not tell why landlord nodded best thing can do sir be to lock door bring key in case boer ride up want to put horse there may mislay for quarter of hour if be only staying for short time will probably content with leaving horse in yard when find can not get into stable thank very much think hour will give fair start for at rate must not be overtaken before get dark five minute later yorke han rode out into yard followed by peter be soon clear of town now put horse into trot native keeping eight ten length behind slackened pace little a passed between two hill on party of boer be posted there be nothing unusual in riding out to join scouting party attention be paid to when well beyond point again quickened pace be pity did not kill dirck master yorke han said will always be trouble must not kill in cold blood han though if have be fight must have done so without hesitation have tried to kill twice must feel perfectly justified in taking life however can congratulate ourselves on having got out of scrape so easily if alarm have be given nothing must have saved must have be denounced a spy shot without semblance of trial will endeavour to cross river to night if can get down to bank without interruption if be to meet party now story that have just joined commando have be sent by moens on outpost duty to begin with must do a long a be posted on river must hardly be good enough if cross especially a know whether party be beyond a may have lot of out in pursuit of in hour can not risk being detained besides will be quite dark by time get there naturally must wait till morning before crossing river so will go on till believe be about mile from then turn off strike river if be too dark then to choose place for crossing wait till morning if find bank too steep will swim horse over sha' be comfortable until be on other side need not worry will let horse go at own pace so a to be fresh if be chased besides if be going at leisurely pace will not attract particular attention must be seen by scout on neighbouring hill went at fast canter now be afraid that be too light to go on yorke said when guessed that be within three mile of river will turn off to left when get to place where can not be seen from of hill will halt till be nearly dark then will turn back recross road keep along on north side of if anyone in search of come along question boer outpost if get information at will be that be seen to turn off to left of road will think that intend to cross either by hanover road that of philipstown to swim river between of course must be natural line to de aar be at point scout will be most vigilant for hostile movement must come from de aar not from north road through petrusville be so evident have great doubt whether must even place guard at crossing plan be carried out recrossing road after dark kept close to pausing listening occasionally for sound of horseman have gone by other road yorke said now peter went on have better ear than of footstep will not be heard will keep mile behind will lead horse when get near river must go very cautiously find out whether there be men on guard there when have discovered that run back with news of course if one be there will come straight on cross if there be guard will turn to right strike river mile higher up cross if can peter at once set off at run others following at leisurely walk in hour rejoined one be there baa water be low can cross drift easily enough that be good will push on at once then for if fellow in stable be discovered soon after left may have party in pursuit of along road a well a others even now mounted went on at trot to river be of width be not too deep for horse to ford have gone quarter of mile on other side when peter said listen master horse coming drew rein sat listening for two three minute must hear nothing then there be low sound rapidly increased in volume until came to abrupt halt then on still night air must hear volley of execration have reached river only have ten minute to spare yorke said think will pursue farther a can not be sure that have come by road though must have learned from men on hill that started for might easily have crossed to philippolis side after got out of sight at rate know that must have chance of catching to night a must only have to move two three hundred yard off road to be well out of sight now peter tear up one of blanket muffle horse foot must hear long way off in stillness will do baa too angry talk too much to hear be likely enough peter there be nothing like being on safe side five minute sufficed to muffle foot of horse then continued journey keeping on road sometimes going at trot sometimes walking until have covered calculated twenty mile from river then moved off few hundred yard opened saddle bag have good meal gave horse feed of mealie lay down for night be on move again at daybreak yorke have decided to go on a far a little stream called hondebloss where must give horse drink fill up water bottle have not have time to do before leaving though fortunately have watered horse at small stream run through colesberg be possible that there might be boer force at petrusville therefore determined to strike due west from river for potfontein siding distance be too far to be traversed in day without risk of knocking up horse consequently camped out on veldt night arrived at little railway station next morning here found company of militia whose officer at first regarded with suspicion yorke have however that morning stowed away wig a before han have cut off long fringe of hair under straw hat on stripping off coat flannel shirt yorke showed khaki uniform underneath with shoulder strap with

at once to camp now occupied by general pole carew brigade on sending in name general came to door of tent well mr harberton exclaimed how on earth have got back so soon heard from telegram through lorenzo marque that have escaped be little more than fortnight since did not expect that must have joined again for three week at least be just in time expect lord robert to morrow may be sure that will not lose day when arrives by way lucas have returned be sorry to say have vacancy on staff will be seeing lord methuen afternoon will ask if have opportunity to mention to lord robert saying how got into kimberley out again now have made escape from pretoria that knowledge of dutch make most valuable staff officer possibly chief may like to have on staff a interpreter so on for boer make point of pretending that understand english although there be doubt that almost of in free state considerable portion of transvaal men do so suppose must rather be on staff than join regiment certainly must rather be with lord robert sir must be sure to see what be going on then while might not be so lucky if be with cavalry will speak to lord methuen about have hour to spare just at present time so might tell how escaped from pretoria of course know how be taken yorke gave account of adventure well be lucky fellow in having two such follower a dutchman kaffir last got out of hand of boer at boshof now dutchman have got out of pretoria remind of three musketeer suppose have read that story yes sir always thought ought to be called four musketeer general smiled that escape of yours at colesberg be exceptionally narrow thing said must really congratulate on way managed well suppose will go to regiment now give compliment to colonel say that wish to remain in camp for few day in case lord robert may desire to hear from something about state of prison at pretoria what saw a came down be good thing to have fellow like in regiment harberton colonel said that evening after mess be over story give something fresh to think about anything keep from talking of eternal subject of what lord robert be likely to do when get here be unmixed pleasure besides gentleman there be saying what fortune of war may bring forth of may see inside of boer prison before be over now know how mr harberton got away may get hint may be useful to for instance how got through wire fence yes colonel major said a can not of speak dutch example of manner in made way down must not be of use to prisoner can think of dozen way of getting out of prison might throttle warder dress up in clothes march out what must do after be out must buy a much a crust of bread cheese glass of beer first time opened lip must be seized there must be difficulty doubt know two three officer have got away be pretty sure none of spoke dutch now if of gentleman have taken such pain a mr harberton to acquire language might have distinguished a have done regiment be out here before landed there be not one of who can put sentence together in dutch come colonel be too hard on one of captain said have occasion to speak word of dutch at cape certainly have have opportunity since left be true enough colonel agreed went on more gravely have be evident for many month that war be probable must have be well speak for a well a for if have devoted hour two day to getting up language for must have known that be sure to be useful in case of campaign have frequently felt difficulty of obtaining information from farmer when scouting have missed good opportunity very often time have hung heavy on hand in spite of polo other amusement one doe not expect to find many studious men in cavalry regiment still do wonder that none of saw what advantage must be to speak dutch look at mr harberton see what have gained by industry have be employed on dangerous service succeeds in getting into kimberley obtains commission thereby now have carried safely through transvaal orange free state will probably cause to be selected for other special work there be credit due to sir yorke said certainly did work at dutch on voyage out afterwards being on dutch farm scarcely hearing english spoken have to learn language have continual opportunity of mastering be very well colonel said there be many fellow who have be in position must not have learned much tell that cousin be english certainly man han speaks language thus must have chosen have got on very fairly without dutch though may disclaim credit doe not in way alter fact thought heard firing a came along morning have there be sir yorke asked in order to change conversation yes fighting began again on rd macdonald with highland brigade two squadron of ours field battery engineer moved down to koodoosberg drift seventeen mile away on th engineer began to erect fort boer soon mustered very strongly position be commanded by kopje to north skirmishing went on day yesterday two battery of horse artillery brigade of cavalry reinforced macdonald fighting have gone on day gun have hear gradually driven boer back expect force will be recalled when lord robert arrives to morrow imagine be only intended to keep boer attention occupied in direction lead to believe that intention be to turn position on right flank so relieve kimberley without having to again attack position at magersfontein of course none of know what lord robert plan be hardly think that if have intended to carry out line of attack must have called boer attention to fact until be perfectly ready to begin there must be very large force here now colonel judging from size of camp yes in addition to division fought way here there be now counting at station between de aar three others twenty five thousand infantry have now ninety eight gun altogether counting cavalry now muster nearly five thousand sabre there must be over forty thousand men between orange river station place very different force from that with methuen attempted to relieve kimberley in first place cronje will have work cut out for to keep grip on town next morning lord robert with lord kitchener staff reached modder river arrival created immense enthusiasm among troop lord robert have long be popular hero of british army not only have accomplished that have undertaken name be associated with long series of success in india care for comfort of soldier kindness of heart cheeriness of manner have won affection soldier felt that under bob name by be universally known among rank file must speedily turn table on boer arrival of lord kitchener on scene be of scarcely le importance than be that of commander in chief have in egypt shown not only qualification necessary for leader of men extraordinary power of organization since arrival at cape month previously have effected wonder when landed there be practically transport consequence be that army have to depend entirely upon railway must not have moved more than two three day march away from now immense train have be organized army must if necessary cut loose from railway depend for ten day fortnight upon own supply position a chief on lord robert staff went far to ensure that mistake must occur that movement must be effected a perfectly a human fore thought must arrange that detail must be seen to contingency prepared for in character however two great leader differed greatly with faculty concentrated upon work lord kitchener never spared expected equal devotion to duty from under command officer men alike be man of iron one who must make small allowance for weakness of others must admit of carelessness have sympathy with love of amusement easy going manner of doing work be characteristic of inconsiderable proportion of younger officer of army be admired respected have not lord robert knack of making loved by with whom came in contact twenty year of scouting campaigning working in egypt have given something of nature of arab native with whom have be associated face afforded index to thought spoke little be always to point eye have faraway look of one constantly scanning distance for approach of enemy anger expressed only in few quiet word cut like whip appearance in camp be at once sign for additional activity sharper discipline increased attention to duty of kind better right hand must have be chosen by lord robert for work to be done wherever thing went little wrong needed kitchener presence to set right again not day be lost lord robert arrived on morning of th next evening force from koodoosberg returned to camp series of order be that day quietly issued on th cavalry division under general french with seven battery of horse artillery two field battery left modder river camp for ramdam large pool near riet river five mile south of village of koffyfontein

methuen have given outline of service mr harberton lord robert said kindly story be really remarkable one show singular amount of enterprise courage coolness on part of so young officer what be even more to point at present moment be have shown can speak dutch well at rate well enough to pas a boer that can also converse to extent to kaffir in own tongue captain watermeyer be only member of staff who can speak dutch well be sure will be glad of assistance in examining prisoner farmer native therefore have much pleasure in appointing a extra aide de camp thank sir feel be high honour indeed that have conferred upon be well deserved one a made journey to kimberley also a hear have followed road down from pretoria through johannesburg to bloemfontein will be valuable for other purpose

lieutenant harberton extra aide de camp speaks dutch well will be sure find of great assistance when have to question prisoner other dutch who may be brought into camp when not required for such work

servant who have proved most faithful valuable man also kaffir groom who went with into kimberley aided in effecting escape from pretoria will of course bring with in same capacity here lord methuen be entering tent a yorke went out latter thanked warmly for kindness in recommending to commander in chief be to general pole carew that be chiefly indebted general said have seen much more of than have heard from full story of adventure be pleasure to to report conduct to lord robert pole carew told that be sorry must not have service in future first a staff be complete in second place a will remain here with brigade with force under command yorke then went off with captain watermeyer remember face well mr harberton latter said know major mackintosh who obtained commission for in corp be not member of for be in cape town highlander saw several time at hotel where be then stopping remember perfectly now sir khaki helmet make difference that until spoke did not recognize well have got on since then have certainly never occurred to of that must be here a member of commander in chief staff indeed yorke replied nothing must have be more unlikely at rate a far a be concerned well a for tenting may a well share mine a be alone at present will be glad of company matter be quickly arranged with colonel pretyman head quarter commandant captain watermeyer offer obviated difficulty with regard to tentage yorke must of course mess with other officer of staff be afraid mr harberton officer said that will not draw extra pay a assistant aide de camp though possibly with addition of word 'interpreter ' in general order allowance will be obtainable be matter of comparative indifference to have resource of own will enable for at least time to defray extra expense of mess will not be very heavy colonel pretyman said with smile certainly a long a be on march will find few luxury though when be in town indulge little a whole must say that live better than infantry mess certainly not so well a cavalry do now though too will have to leave best part of store behind when once move about servant sir who be now trooper in regiment will draw ration mess with orderly there will be difficulty about kaffir groom several of have cape boy in same capacity of course will go in with a two three officer have come in while be talking yorke knowing how busy colonel be at once left rode back to camp of lancer after getting thing together returned to head quarter camp with han peter on following morning lord robert staff moved to ramdam while cavalry went on to riet river easily drove off small party of boer at two drift reconnoitred beyond general tucker troop moved forward to one of drift place at ramdam be taken by kelly kenny division will go on with cavalry to morrow morning mr harberton deputy adjutant general said to yorke on evening of arrival at head quarter at ramdam will push on ahead be eminently important that general must be informed of progress have made other aide de camp will be fully occupied in seeing that movement of infantry column be proceeding without hitch cavalry will push on to modder river to morrow seize one of drift be intended to reinforce early next morning will then push on for kimberley will remain with until have passed point at be likely to meet with serious opposition immediately have done so will bring news to head quarter will probably have then arrived at jacobsdal a movement of troop must be largely influenced by success failure of cavalry expedition very well sir just before yorke be about to leave mess room be summoned to lord robert tent oh mr harberton only sent for to tell that be going to ride to morrow morning to see cavalry make start will mount at five o'clock will ride with be splendid sight when commander in chief rode across dekiel drift there be gathered five thousand horseman consisting of carbineer new south wale lancer inniskillings regiment of household cavalry th hussar th th th lancer scot grey rimington guide two brigade of mounted infantry seven battery of artillery pontoon train of royal engineer although whole have not passed river until midnight be ready for start appearance of commander in chief excited greatest enthusiasm among time be lost in formal inspection after few word with general french who hearing that yorke be to accompany begged to ride with lord robert drew back watched great column of horse sweep past acknowledging salute of men officer waving hand in encouragement farewell troop have confidence in commander who have already given sterling proof of ability have advice be followed by general white at ladysmith four regiment of british cavalry must have be added to buller force must have gone far to protect natal from boer marauder instead of remaining pent up in besieged town until horse be either dead unfit for service recalled to take charge of cavalry in west to arrest boer advance into cape colony have effectually checked progress defeated near colesberg have by activity confined within comparatively small district now be leading on expedition with name will ever be associated be long march of thirty mile sun blazed down pitilessly there must be water until reached modder river general staff be fully occupied in riding up down line seeing that went well general kept yorke by throughout march began conversation by saying lord robert tell that have already be into kimberley out again that have be prisoner at pretoria have escaped let hear about kimberley business first will pas time away if mind be glad to remain at head of column with general for dust raised a squadron followed squadron be stifling have certainly have full share of adventure mr general said when have by close questioning extracted pretty full account of adventure from now from what have seen of boer do think that resistance be likely to be obstinate one must say that think so owing to lie circulated by africander bond by kruger authority at pretoria have come to entertain deep passionate hatred of although feel sure that will not be able to stand against in open fight believe that will maintain desperate resistance of guerrilla kind for long time believe firmly that power of europe be coming to assistance that in long run england will be obliged to evacuate cape altogether have even be told that russia france germany have already declared war against certainly word of truth will ever be allowed to be published among in irregular war must have immense advantage in great extent of country long line of railway by communication must be kept up by fact that will be well informed of everything that be doing by friend while will be entirely in dark a to movement lastly hope will be sustained by absolute conviction that dutch throughout whole of cape colony will join from what saw at farm near richmond must say that view must be justified if must gain single success must give encouragement fall at ladysmith kimberley even mafeking must think be followed by great rising be afraid that be right mr harberton certainly found dutch population in colesberg stormberg district disloyal almost to man although individually none of have complaint to make against indeed with africander parliament passing what law choose absolute equality in respect with british colonist be hard to see what must possibly gain by expulsion from south africa from time to time small party of mounted boer must be seen in distance solitary scout on hill skirted plain over be travelling occasionally shot be fired from distant hill to column paid attention herd of deer be seen galloping across plain scared at great moving dust cloud column be in open order regiment moved two abreast with th lancer ahead heat be trying indeed to horseman more so to horse several of artillery animal dropped dead be terribly exhausted by time that willow fringing modder be seen ahead major rimington who acted a guide performed that duty well brought column to exact point at have aimed klip drift fortunately boer force stationed here be small one on seeing great force approaching abandoned tent waggon fled hastily now be seen advantage have be gained by demonstration at fear of being outflanked in direction have caused boer to gather there have little thought of assault being delivered fifty mile away on extreme left have have time knowledge few hundred men with gun must have made so desperate resistance help might have come up before force be established on north bank a be have passed across without shot being fired horse drank fill men bathed in river by nightfall be ready for action halt have to be made next day to enable kelly kenny to come up with division at five o'clock following morning arrived men having made tremendous night march to cross veldt at eight o'clock cavalry prepared for final advance boer have utilized time that halt have allowed during preceding day considerable number have arrived taken up position on hill four mile from river distance from klip drift to kimberley be forty mile distance might under other circumstance have be traversed without much difficulty horse have not yet recovered from fatigue of previous march heat of sun be again terrible however goal be kimberley believed with reason once past new position occupied by boer must meet with further resistance a must pas far to east of magersfontein position from cronje must not afford to send large force while methuen be facing on modder boer position be upon two hill connected by long low neck a force approached brisk fire of musketry aided by light gun burst out short halt be made gun of battery be not going on unlimbered opened heavy fire on hill a soon a began to take effect cavalry continued advance in open order swept forward over low neck regardless of fire from hill few men horse dropped without drawing rein squadron after squadron swept along then at more leisurely pace continued journey rate of travel soon became slow many of trooper dismounted walked by side of horse even carrying on shoulder valise in order to relieve exhausted animal be late in afternoon before without meeting foe entered kimberley amid enthusiasm of population yorke have ridden with cavalry until crossed neck then turned horse galloped back to klip drift with news that obstacle have be passed crossing river rode for jacobsdal heard firing a approached town when arrived there found that place have be captured by wavell brigade of th division have already joined kelly kenny at klip drift learning that general robert must not arrive until following morning started south met division with head quarter on way reported that cavalry have already ridden through boer position be on way to kimberley by time will be there then robert said how be horse be afraid great many will be lost before reach kimberley sir owing to heat yesterday have not time to recover from previous march have done very well to bring news so speedily general said expected to find at jacobsdal to morrow hardly hoped that must have reached evening have have a long ride a french next morning head quarter reached jacobsdal here received news that one of convoy of waggon have be attacked by boer at waterval drift be defending battery of artillery with mounted infantry be sent off at once to assistance with aid boer be driven off native driver of waggon however have deserted during fight a lord robert have received news that cronje whole force have left magersfontein ordered waggon to be abandoned a everything depended upon speed to carry out successfully operation upon be bent namely to cut off cronje retreat to bloemfontein cronje have sent portion of force with greater part of gun north good many of orange free state men have deserted gone back to farm with rest of gun six thousand mounted men huge train of waggon have hurried along through interval between french horse force at klip drift vedettes of force saw huge cloud of dust in distance carried news to lord kitchener who assumed general command energetic commander at once despatched mounted infantry in pursuit sent knox brigade along northern bank of river to harass right flank of flying boer to bring to action if possible there be three drift by cronje must cross river on way to bloemfontein unless be held might get across knew a well a pursuer day kept back pursuit of knox mounted infantry by occupying hill kopje with strong rear guard have to be attacked driven off only to take up position farther on with night approaching even cronje felt that there must be halt have marched twenty four hour horse animal of baggage waggon be alike utterly worn out ignorant of force be pressing forward on south bank believed that must next morning be able to cross river have not reckoned on energy of british commander on endurance of men mounted infantry have when fighting ceased galloped back to klip drift crossed there keeping along on south side seized drift at klip kraal thither came stevenson brigade colvile division mounted infantry on arrival went forward again seized paardeberg cronje moved early in morning knox marched along northern bank to klip kraal cronje scout soon learned that two drift be in possession made for third named koodoosrand exhausted animal be only equal to short march cronje feeling confident that drift be open to again halted before reached delay be fatal to kitchener a soon a learned that cronje be flying have sent word to french ordering to move with speed to endeavour to cut off boer retreat message arrived in afternoon cavalry in spite of fatigue of night before have be out with town force endeavouring to drive boer from strong position held at dronfield boer however have stuck to tenaciously for by occupation of post be enabling force from magersfontein with gun to move round kimberley make for north be late in afternoon however shelled out of position weary troop returned to town just a messenger from lord kitchener arrived not moment time be lost inspection of horse be ordered be found that of five thousand started from klip drift morning before two thousand at utmost be in way fit for further work with force then french started after allowing few hour rest before long night ride utterly weary a men be be inspired with fresh energy when learned that be going to cut off retreat of cronje through night march continued many horse fell dead there be pause in advance star be shining brilliantly cronje exact position be not known must only be guessed at rimington acting a guide aimed for koodoosrand drift morning found still distance away for have travelled slowly most of men marching night in order to relieve horse hour halt then moved on again be terrible race be won about midday reached koodoosrand drift just a cronje advance guard be arriving on top of hill commanding wearied horse be allowed drink be then led away to point where dip must shelter from rifle fire men took up station to dispute passage to last be plain that with two thousand determined men passage must not be forced cronje scout brought news that passage to bloemfontein be barred be still open to to abandon waggon gun to ride north believing that reinforcement must assuredly be sent to cronje determined upon fighting have already abandoned seventy four waggon whose ox must no longer draw at last halting place now turned marched to flat plain between paardeberg drift lower down river still hoping to force way across be only at drift that passage be possible bank be high stood like wall on side men on foot might have made way down to water might have climbed up other side for mounted men still more for waggon river be absolutely impassable save at drift on side foe be gathering closely british infantry have accomplished marvellous march highland brigade have marched from jacobsdal to klip drift over soft sand exhausted a be when called upon to continue journey twelve mile murmur be heard have terrible disaster to retrieve longing to be engaged with men who have mowed down in dark nerved to further exertion behind came smith dorrien brigade splendid body of troop shropshires cornwall canadian pushed across river took up position on north bank kelly kenny division be also there by morning cronje have longer option of escape be fairly trapped position be however strong one bush along river bank provided excellent cover for rifleman while to west north east be surrounded by level plain fifteen hundred yard in width upon enemy must be exposed to terrible fire from men in under waggon formed laager chapter xviii paardeberg have lord kitchener witnessed battle of modder magersfontein be morally certain that must not have attacked cronje in lair hitherto have be engaged only with barbarous tribe who although magnificently brave be altogether without firearm be armed only with musket of obsolete pattern be unable to form idea of tremendous effect of such rifle a in hand of boer race of marksman nothing must have be gained by such attack even if successful a boer must sooner later have surrendered escape be impossible troop must be trusted to give good account of force advancing to aid cronje doubtless be to extent influenced by burning desire on part of men officer who with exception of of highland brigade have not a yet be engaged with boer to get at enemy however on following morning knox stevenson smith dorrien highland brigade advanced against position when within thousand yard semicircle of fire flashed out from waggon a have done from bush on modder effect be terrible men went down by score before hail of bullet troop be forced a guard have be on modder to throw down before must have be well if a on occasion impossibility of success have be recognized troop have be ordered to remain in same position throughout day contenting with returning boer fire such order be given company got up made short rush regiment burning to be first to enter boer camp little relief be afforded by four battery of artillery kept up incessant shell fire distracting boer attention preventing taking aim shaking nerve at twelve o'clock one of french horse artillery battery came up joined others at work splendid be effort made by many of regiment to get to close quarter canadian cornwall smith dorrien brigade on one side swept almost up to river bank welsh yorkshire essex regiment did a well on opposite side of semicircle forcing boer to contract line limiting space occupied by highlander did magnificently burning to retrieve defeat at magersfontein showed that have entirely recovered from effect of disaster conduct be more worthy of admiration inasmuch a have marched over thirty mile only arrived on scene just a advance began from south side of river heavy rifle fire be maintained by troop on bank be probable that at least among casualty on side be inflicted by bullet passed over boer camp day fight continued have be effected be to contract boer position along river bank from three mile to barely two when evening fell troop be still in position have won during day cost be out of proportion to advantage gained have suffered eleven hundred casualty seaforths headed list with one hundred twenty black watch came next with ninety six ninety yorkshire same number of west riding regiment eighty among canadian seventy six argyle sutherland fifty six of cornwall forty six of shropshires thirty one of oxfordshires showed how regiment have taken share in fighting on following day cronje asked for twenty four hour armistice to enable to bury dead lord kitchener assented a morning wore on lord robert arrived with tucker division from jacobsdal with three more field battery five naval gun commander in chief disapproved altogether of armistice be evidently mere pretext to gain time accordingly sent word to cronje that armistice be at end that woman child in laager might come out must receive good treatment offer be declined by cronje refusal be signal for gun to open day hail of fire be poured into boer laager smith dorrien brigade be left on ground that have won near river bank to west while one of tucker brigade commanded by chermside occupied same position to east remainder of troop be drawn off posted so a to prevent portion of beleaguered host from making escape de wet with force have attacked finally captured train of waggon at waterval drift have come round surprised captured party of thirty men four officer of kitchener horse who be posted on kopje two mile away from laager loss of position be serious because opened road to boer force marching to relieve cronje that force be approaching be known cronje have when found passage at koodoosrand blocked flashed signal asking for aid not only must local force answer appeal must be largely reinforced by orange free state commando coming with haste from natal by rail accordingly five regiment of cavalry with four battery be sent against kopje force being divided into two party of equal strength passing one on side of hill force of boer encountered be easily defeated while artillery drove off defender of kopje of whom fifty be killed a many taken prisoner two day later party approached attacked kopje held by yorkshire failed to capture then tried to carry hill held by buff be again defeated in eighty be taken prisoner night boer crept out from laager gave up a prisoner by end of week have six hundred captive time gun have thundered almost without cessation from balloon overhead

heavy a ever at extremity of base of semicircle smith dorrien chermside men have be steadily pushing forward trench on night of monday february th be determined that former must make advance canadian be to lead gordons to be in support shropshires to move to left to protect force from attempt of boer to take in flank two company of canadian led advance moon have not yet risen to keep position man grasped sleeve of man next to rear rank carried spade have rifle slung behind th company of royal engineer followed carrying sack full of earth distance to be traversed be eight hundred yard never did men undertake more nervous work for at moment might be swept by storm of bullet such a have smitten highlander at magersfontein not sound be heard until be within fifty yard of boer trench then front rank struck against wire on empty meat can be stretched rifle shot be fired a clang rose canadian at once threw on face scarcely have done so when roar of fire from line six hundred yard long broke out to move forward be impossible moon be on point of rising light must enable boer to pick off unerringly accordingly company out on plain be ordered to fall back in very open order be effected with comparatively small number of casualty illustration cronje ride out to surrender canadian however now felt benefit of sack of earth carried by engineer with sack be thrown down instant first shot be fired behind two company of canadian engineer lay in comparative shelter protection be soon increased by work of men with shovel before day broke be firmly established from position be able to open flanking fire upon greater portion of boer trench on side other company of canadian have similarly entrenched short distance farther back felt that end of ten day investment be close at hand boer also saw that to continue struggle must result in entire destruction at six in morning white flag be raised cronje rode out be met by general pretyman conducted by to head quarter camp where met lord robert who shook hand with cronje then said that have come in to surrender general replied that surrender must be unconditional cronje felt that in desperate position in be placed must not stand out for condition merely asked that wife grandson secretary adjutant must with servant be allowed to accompany be granted with be same afternoon sent down with other prisoner about four thousand in number under strong escort to railway by be taken down to cape town only hundred fifty wounded be found in camp taking usual proportion of killed wounded only thirty forty must have fallen victim to

artillery can effect against material of kind though be comparatively harmless against troop when not in solid formation if boer prisoner have expected a must assuredly have be case have be victor that vanquished must be received with exultation triumphant jeer be agreeably surprised have be brought up in belief that british soldier be at once contemptible a fighter full of evil quality have already learned that must fight now learned that be generous enemy that imagined hatred of boer have existence whatever patient endurance with besieged have supported tremendous fire to have be

helping feeble giving tobacco other little comfort from own scanty store carrying child assisting woman there be sign of exultation be justly proud of success have gained show of feeling be visible a much honour be due to british soldier for bearing at moment of victory a for desperate courage steadfast endurance have displayed in trying to achieve have be kept at work almost night day from time

jacobsdal be taken although excitement have kept up be completely worn out when arrived at head quarter at paardeberg other aide de camp be in similar position lord robert with usual kindness told that must for day two consider relieved from further duty that work must be carried on by officer drawn from cavalry in spite of thunder of gun yorke slept for nearly eighteen hour without waking then

thus instead of sweeping quite clear of boer line ran against extreme left of position daylight broke before cavalry be perceived instant boer leader saw that be in danger of being outflanked retreat cut off abandoned position have so laboriously fortified retired hastily there be still ample time for cavalry to have overtaken gun waggon even if must not have caught flying horseman allowed however to be held in check by handful of skirmisher fifty in number who first held farmhouse when driven from kept up stinging fire from low kopje until knowing that gun waggon be out of reach that two

boer position be absolutely between main body morning be breaking now kelly kenny learned from boer farmer who have doubtless be ordered by de wet to give false information that hill in front have be abandoned therefore advanced until storm of fire showed that have be deceived welsh who be leading regiment be staggered by rain of bullet buff passed so heavy be fire to be exposed that officer be

be engaged turning movement have failed altogether from miscalculation in distance attack have begun long before tucker cavalry have reached appointed place a before boer be able to draw off waggon gun nevertheless consequence be of immense importance road to bloemfontein be again open boer have learned that however strong position must not hope to oppose british advance from time until army marched into pretoria never again attempted to make enduring stand abandoned one after other without attempt to defend position have prepared rather have forced kaffir to prepare for with immense

blown up by de wet when be summoned to hasten to cronje assistance even when have be repaired boer driven back from springfontein other point held by be liable to be interrupted at moment by small party of enemy who must have aid shelter of farmhouse near line army be now cut off entirely from base at de aar must be necessary not only to pas up supply sufficient for daily consumption to collect great magazine for supply when started on march north be necessary too to fill up gap caused among horse of cavalry mule of transport fewer than ten thousand have died become utterly unfit for service during month have elapsed since advance began from modder river even of remained few must be able for time to perform hard work considering enormous difficulty in way be wonderful that six week sufficed to complete preparation for advance yorke first step when force arrived at bloemfontein be to call upon mr von rensburg latter expressed great satisfaction at seeing again have hope that have got through safely mr harberton for if have not done so must certainly have heard of here moreover there came story three boer have be strangely overpowered left tied up in stable by two others aided by kaffir two men have be recognized a spy by one of party assaulted incident be considered a extraordinary one a taking place in heart of town occupied by boer without alarm being given so far a be known assailant have escaped be certain that two spy have ridden quietly out of town have be accompanied by kaffir hundred men started in pursuit along road leading west without success felt doubt that be men engaged in matter heartily congratulate be entirely due to that succeeded getting that ride in train down to colesberg permit be of greatest service to must hardly have crossed river without even a be be close thing be greatest piece of good fortune that be able to get out of town after affair speak of then related how dirck jansen companion have be overcome silenced englishman be quicker of thought action than people von rensburg said be not astonished that in sudden struggle like when party be equally surprised have advantage will be glad if duty permit if will take up

beyond praise must have have terrible time of for looked worn haggard have evidently be doing desperately hard work on smallest amount of food yes have be hard work loss in horse baggage animal have be enormous still be well satisfied in month from starting have relieved kimberley captured cronje five thousand of men driven de wet out of two strong position now occupy town think will have much more hard fighting mr harberton men who came in here yesterday after being driven from last position be completely disheartened said have be told that rooineks be coward that there be stopping that soldier marched through storm of bullet a if have merely be hailstone a government house of lord robert have taken possession be close to mr von rensburg yorke have difficulty in obtaining permission to stay there time passed pleasantly for have just enough work to do in riding out to camp with order in questioning farmer who have come in to take advantage of proclamation that who gave up arm took oath of neutrality must be permitted to return to farm remain there unmolested have friend of th lancer be always welcomed in camp of cavalry brigade be introduced by mr von rensburg to several of leading dutch family passed many pleasant evening among a shop be still fairly supplied head quarter mess be now comparatively luxurious altogether be far le impatient than most of other officer for advance to commence preparation for have begun time before when tucker division have captured karee siding twenty mile north of town not without considerable loss for a upon previous occasion infantry attacked before cavalry have completed turning movement on rd of may be ready for advance troop be glad indeed for while be stationed at bloemfontein terrible foe have made appearance among enteric fever have broken out hospital be filled to overflowing with sick men accommodation be altogether insufficient to meet emergency for one must be blamed medical staff have accompanied movement from modder river be sufficient to cope with care for amount of wounded be likely to be thrown on to hand be not capable of meeting such emergency even with assistance of hospital have be furnished sent out by private subscription from home must be done be done first necessity be to provide for want of fighting men to accumulate store on must have to depend during advance although many red cross

sick upwards of thousand men died there be seven thousand case who recovered be so debilitated by effect of disease that be unfit for further service have to be sent down to cape port elizabeth then to england seed of terrible scourge have be sown by polluted water drunk at paardeberg by grievous oversight war office have neglected advice of who urged upon necessity of sending out special corp to attend to sanitary point have recommendation be attended to life of four thousand five thousand men of over twenty thousand sent home incapacitated for work must have be saved gatacre force be able after de wet departure to move up to orange river repairing railway a advanced on arriving at bethulie bridge general found that although magnificent railway viaduct have be destroyed road bridge be still intact be known however to be mined there be strong boer force on other side ready to blow up instant british ventured upon be saved however by daring action of lieutenant popham of derbyshire regiment of captain grant of sapper former with two men crept along bridge at night removed detonator took away dynamite from under farther span carried off under heavy fire opened by boer a soon a found that mine be being tampered with there still remained heavy charge in pier although boer must not explode in ordinary way a be commanded by rifle fire might have effected by directing shell fire against captain grant therefore completed popham work by going across removing charge dropping into river a reconstruction of railway bridge be work must occupy month rather than week preservation of road bridge be matter of vital importance gatacre force marched across after enemy have be shelled out from position on other side advanced along line of railway cavalry pushed forward to springfontein there met two battalion of guard sent down by train from bloemfontein thus whole line of railway be in possession clements advancing from colesberg have thrown pontoon bridge across river close to ruined norval pont thus when temporary deviation of line have be effected branch of railway be also available farther to east general brabant with force of colonial volunteer royal scot three gun of field artillery advanced to dordrecht victory there pushed on so rapidly towards aliwal that occupied bridge there before must be blown up then proceeded to stamp out rebellion in part of cape colony to east of line of railway from bethulie to bloemfontein strong body of enemy continued to wander about doing considerable damage lord robert be not to be tempted to move considerable force to suppress great object be to march to pretoria great work to collect store must enable to do so to do contented with holding fast to line of railway rail be often removed culvert blown up few hour work always sufficed to repair damage two serious revers however happened cavalry force have be threatened by strong boer commando at water work that supplied bloemfontein be twenty four mile from town boer opened fire with heavy gun from hill commanded british position colonel broadwood who be in command must not with force composed only of mounted men attempt to storm hill a gun of two battery of horse artillery with be altogether inferior to of boer decided to retire upon bloemfontein knew that messenger have sent night before to ask for reinforcement have arrived there received reply that colvile division must be sent out before daybreak to meet believing therefore that there be danger in front remained at rear of column have be shelled by enemy waggon be at head of retiring column a crossed plain have to go through deep donga here boer be in hiding waggon a descended be silently seized boer took place of driver ascended opposite side without alarm being given so whole convoy must have fallen into hand of hidden enemy have not one of trooper with drawn pistol fired volley of shot rang out brave fellow paid for courage with life nine waggon have not reached donga halted two battery be close behind knowing further concealment to be useless boer sprang to foot opened terrible fire on men horse went down in number confusion be terrible men struggled to get fallen horse out of trace be mown down by continuous rain of bullet rearmost gun of leading battery alone be able to get off galloped furiously back two gun of second battery be overturned by struggling horse have to be abandoned a soon a others reached distance of seven eight hundred yard from edge of donga turned opened fire robert horse have be abreast of gun suffered heavily also new zealander burmese horse dismounted when have retired sufficient distance throwing down returned fire of boer party of cavalry be sent off to discover other point at donga must be crossed one be found two mile to south by officer of rimington scout towards force moved off artillery nobly covered retreat have suffered terribly two of gun have two men left to work be loaded fired by officer single handed when at last order came to fall back ten men remained on leg several of be wounded colonial corp covered withdrawal by turn in two hour rear of column have crossed donga thirty officer three hundred men be killed wounded missing hundred waggon with seven gun be lost only one officer sergeant major of leading battery escaped other disaster be equally serious occurred four day later when detachment of five company of infantry posted at reddersburg be surrounded on march from advanced position took post on kopje for twenty four hour defended gallantly be without water hoped for relief did not arrive surrendered next morning chapter xix mafeking on th of april yorke be sent for by lord robert suppose be almost tired of remaining quiet mr harberton said with smile will certainly be glad when be off sir be by mean sorry for rest after being on horseback for six month be perfectly ready to go anywhere if can be of service what do say to ride to kimberley be quite ready to go sir though hope to be back with when advance lord robert shook head hope to be away before get back have despatch for to carry wire be so frequently cut by boer can not trust to in matter of importance relate to expedition be being prepared for relief of mafeking lord methuen be confronted by so strong force of boer doubtless portion of cronje force moved north with gun that can not go forward colonel plumer in north have not sufficient force to fight way in therefore profound secrecy be necessary with regard to route of force with lord methuen hope to relieve town be for reason dare not trust to wire have done good service mr harberton if like will attach to force will start in ten day so if go well will be at mafeking will have time to rejoin say at johannesburg before advance on pretoria can not expect progress to be very rapid for although anticipate serious resistance on part of boer will have to make halt to enable supply to come up a party will go with will travel fast think that if go well will be many day behind at johannesburg thank very much sir if can not be with must above thing like to be at relief of mafeking despatch will be ready for evening general said can start with a early a like hope that usual good luck will again attend yorke bowed retired have doubt that lord robert must a before turn boer out of position by flanking movement that if great battle be fought must be close to pretoria felt delighted at thought of being with expedition general evidently believed be likely to effect relief of mafeking that town have since day of declaration of war by boer be cause of little anxiety a time went on garrison continued to defend heroically feeling at home heightened until scrap of news came through be regarded with a much interest a more important operation of army mafeking be small town be chiefly known in britain a place from jameson raid have started be nearest point of western railway to pretoria be within few mile of transvaal frontier unlike kimberley contained garrison of regular troop force consisting only of three hundred forty men of protectorate regiment one hundred seventy police two hundred volunteer fortunately early in july military authority at cape town have appointed colonel baden powell to organize force of irregular for purpose of preventing native rising in case of war a far a possible to defend eastern border difficulty of such task owing to extreme length of frontier have be recognized at once better man must not have be chosen for task baden powell have year before taken conspicuous part in campaign against matabele before outbreak began have organized protectorate regiment while under order colonel plumer have raised regiment in rhodesia saw that mafeking be certain to be first point of attack be hundred fifty mile from pretoria be route through boer must naturally pour into colony where population be largely dutch have chosen a chief of staff major lord edward cecil who arrived at town on october set to work to prepare town for defence with captain williams captain fitz clarence lord charles bentinck other officer military authority have sent up certain amount of store be quite inadequate for purpose baden powell lord cecil took upon responsibility of ordering far larger supply to be forwarded might have failed in obtaining have not be for patriotism of messrs weil co one of largest firm in south africa accepted order although quite aware that price of good be advancing enormously furnished supply asked for thus store of provision be accumulated that enabled mafeking to hold out for so many month requisition for gun be not so promptly complied with africander government of cape colony whose sympathy be wholly with transvaal pretended to doubt that there be probability of war refused to send up gun when at last moment dozen small piece of artillery be forwarded arrived too late be unable to enter place on baden powell arrival organized town guard consisting of white inhabitant capable of carrying gun even boy of from fourteen to sixteen be formed into cadet corp for orderly duty armoured train be constructed armed with maxim nordenfeldt mine be laid in circle round town already several large commando of boer have appeared on frontier might be opinion elsewhere at mafeking there be question that men be only waiting for declaration of war by kruger to attack town on day after expiration of time named in kruger ultimatum railway be torn up forty mile south of town armoured train bringing two seven pounder for mafeking be thrown off rail artillery fire opened upon officer who with twenty men be escorting train defended valiantly for five hour be then obliged to surrender be first blood shed in war boer have doubtless expected to enter town with scarce resistance be five thousand in number knew from sympathizer in place including town guard defender amounted to only nine hundred men with two seven pounder gun six machine gun difficulty of besieged lay chiefly in fact that mafeking though small town be scattered over very large area that defence be naturally erected distance outside circuit defence be planned by colonel vyvyan major panzera two day after declaration of war boer appeared before mafeking drove in picket round town armoured train squadron of protectorate regiment went out drove back boer great number of enemy hurried up cut off party squadron seven pounder went out opened passage into town loss be about two killed fourteen wounded while boer suffered much more heavily two day later boer opened fire on town with two twelve pounder gun in four day cronje sent in messenger with summons surrender to avoid bloodshed to powell replied when be bloodshed going to begin two three day later boer brought up ninety six pounder bombardment began in earnest on th sortie be made one of boer trench be carried boer be driven out with loss of hundred men while have six killed eleven wounded about boer who fell be killed by bayonet consequently weapon be throughout siege regarded with wholesome dread by besieger there be now in addition to ninety six pounder five seven pounder one ten pounder two twelve pounder playing on town yet damage done be so slight that on day after sortie there be concert at hotel officer attending in fighting costume in readiness to rush out in case boer attacked bomb proof shelter be dug everyone kept in good spirit baden powell sent out cheerful message well four hour bombardment one dog killed summons to surrender be answered with message tell general cronje will let know when have have enough two assault be made be repulsed with loss although one of be pushed with great energy against old fort be key to position be held by colonel walford men of south african police attack be covered by fire of four gun ninety six pounder boer fought well pushed up to within three hundred yard of little fort be repulsed with heavy loss have two officer captain hon dh marwill captain pechell among six killed various skirmish followed siege languished until on th of november cronje left to take command of force assembling to oppose advance of lord methuen commandant snyman succeeded to post thing went on quietly until great sortie be made on th december object be to attack post called game tree fort storming party be composed of eighty men six officer captain vernon of protectorate regiment be in command supported by considerable force by gun playing on enemy to distract attention storming party dashed forward many fell a advanced pushed forward till reached fort be composed of sand bag stood up like wall effort of men sufficed to enable to scale whereas from loophole left between bag murderous fire be maintained captain vernon sandford paton be killed captain fitz clarence wounded lieutenant swinburne bridge alone escaped deadly fire led back survivor of little storming party twenty one have fallen four of carried off be found to be mortally wounded after there be long period of inaction bombardment be continued snyman in spite of protest of baden powell continuing to throw shell into nunnery woman laager until colonel ordered number of boer prisoner to be also confined there occasionally message be got through carefully a provision be doled out gallant commander at last informed general robert that by th of may stock must absolutely come to end that must not hold out beyond date on th april seeing that force from rhodesia under colonel plumer be not sufficiently strong to fight way through that expedition have be sent there by way of beira must hardly in spite of tremendous exertion be being made be depended upon to join plumer in time lord robert ordered that flying column of mounted troop under command of colonel mahon of th hussar must start from kimberley not later than th of may yorke after leaving lord robert at once returned to quarter told host that be going to kimberley must probably not return to bloemfontein must rejoin army on way up country be going to take man with sir will have to travel fast may have to ride for life will take best horse if will kindly allow to leave other in stable man can bring on when army move will gladly do must let lend better mount than one be taking have two in stable of can take choice think of be a good a in state must say in colony a since general proclamation be british subject must not think of accepting kind offer sir insist upon mr indeed will be doing service for since war began have have use for horse at sadly want exercise month hard work will be of real benefit to animal must benefit too for time be when did not mind how fiery horse be now that be getting on in life be not fond of having to fight with mount be extremely obliged to sir see how will be able to send back again to when get to johannesburg can leave with mr chamber will arrange how be to be returned in fact a soon a matter be settled down will certainly go there let that trouble in way yorke gratefully accepted offer of own horse have felt hard work to have be subjected that han rode more than own for latter have be kept hard at work since arrival at bloemfontein be certainly not fit to start on journey of many hundred mile horse must without difficulty go on at rate army be likely to advance especially after having ten day rest at bloemfontein han peter be disappointed when heard that be not to accompany yorke han who throughout have taken great care of horse admitted that be not fit to start on so long journey accordingly next morning at daybreak yorke started alone on horse have be lent to distance between bloemfontein kimberley be somewhat under hundred mile be traversed in two day yorke riding only forty mile first day a felt that must not do to push animal too hard immediately after being so long without work did not hesitate to complete remaining part of journey on second day a knew that horse must have at least week rest before starting again be splendid animal superior even to have be killed at time when be taken prisoner on way to belmont a stretched out in gallop under felt that must ride anywhere across country without fear of being overtaken by party of boer might meet on arrival at kimberley handed despatch to colonel mahon to whom be instructed to deliver if lord methuen be still at boshof have brought despatch for sir said a entered that officer head quarter lord robert informed that if a supposed lord methuen be still at boshof be to hand to a relate entirely to force be preparing have honour to be one of commander in chief extra aide de camp name be harberton have heard of mr colonel said a opened despatch journey to kimberley adventurous escape from pretoria have made name familiar to when glanced through despatch said be glad to see that be to accompany till get to mafeking arrangement be going on most satisfactorily have doubt that will be in position to start on day named now must be famishing after ride though suppose a old hand did not leave bloemfontein without provision for journey will tell orderly to put horse up at once dinner will be ready downstairs in hour always keep table for officer dinner at hotel bore few sign of long siege supply have be got up of principal inhabitant have returned though at bloemfontein thing have be well managed comfortable style in meal be served be very inferior to have already be attained at kimberley ten twelve officer joined colonel mahon party allusion be made to intended expedition be kept profound secret a even at kimberley there be many boer sympathizer be important that rumour of approaching departure of large body of horse must be known to be to consist of imperial light horse have arrived from natal kimberley mounted diamond field horse party of imperial yeomanry detachment of cape police horse artillery battery with four gun two machine gun hundred men of fusilier to guard waggon fifty two waggon with ten mule number of spare horse to take place of might break down force amounted in to twelve hundred men not even to officer who commanded different corp be destination made known until morning of th of may when force have ridden out from kimberley yorke have placed altogether under colonel mahon order have looked after many of detail connected with waggon provision store of food carried be quite enough to last fourteen day being outside limit of time that march be likely to occupy once off there be delay mule waggon did work well force moved round to west of position of large body of boer who be opposing methuen advance by line of railway on th marched into vryburg having done hundred twenty mile in five day halted here for day to rest animal on th started again hitherto not shot have be fired from point be watched by enemy a arrival at vryburg have be at once notified to boer at koodoosrand force be found posted in strong position in front of mahon whose object be not to fight to relieve mafeking moved off to westward here country be found to be thickly covered with bush greatly impeded progress of waggon presently enemy leaving position threw across path there be sharp short encounter boer be soon in flight casualty in killed wounded on side be only thirty on th relieving column arrived at village twenty mile to west of mafeking where within hour of entry be joined by plumer force have just be strengthened by arrival of four twelve pounder gun of canadian artillery party of queenslanders troop have performed marvellous march on arrival from canada queensland respectively have be brought

over terribly bad road at rate of twenty five mile day have be with plumer only few hour there be fear now that must fail to gain success have striven for a united force be stronger than with snyman must oppose boer commander however must not retire without one last effort planted force on hill commanded water supply after have held ground for hour gun be silenced retired past mafeking to trench on eastern side here however boer have rest for baden powell sallied out with garrison mahon gun opened upon so that ere long withdrew retreated eastward mafeking be free at last only six day before fearing doubtless relief must come ere long possibly hearing that large cavalry force be nearing vryburg boer made most determined attempt to capture mafeking that have occurred during siege early on morning of th three hundred volunteer under command of eloff grandson of kruger crept up to west of besieger line reached native quarter to at once set fire barrack of protectorate regiment be held by hore twenty of men after stout defence be compelled to surrender two other position within line be captured have snyman sent up support at once affair might have ended badly failed to arrive telephone telegraph wire called up defender from part of town gradually surrounded position boer have taken prevented reinforcement from reaching knowing that unless aided must surrender in time baden powell refused to allow loss of life must ensue if boer be attacked contented with preventing from being reinforced at seven in evening eloff finding position desperate surrendered defence of mafeking rank with of ladysmith in stubbornness of resistance open town made against powerful enemy be more remarkable inasmuch a garrison consisted entirely of irregular with two three gun of smallest calibre while enemy have far more numerous powerful artillery for six month little garrison have maintained unflinching defence during time spirit may be said gaiety never flagged under privation hardship work service rendered country be beyond computation for have detained throughout early month of siege five thousand men who must otherwise have be carrying fire sword throughout colony causing general rising among dutch population who be only waiting for fall of mafeking arrival of friend to take up arm pressed a garrison have be be in better condition than inhabitant of ladysmith when town be relieved arrangement have be admirable horse flesh horse soup have be served out regularly oat have largely entered into ration certain allowance of oat flour be served out porridge be made from bran

latter day of siege fed wholly on porridge mafeking be relieved on th of may on th snyman have informed government at pretoria that have retired from before mafeking on arrival of superior force thence be telegraphed through loreno marque to cape thence flashed to lord robert at kroonstad home in few hour english speaking people throughout whole of british empire joined in rejoicing at safety

hoopstad on th kroonstad have be occupied by lord robert on th force still at boshof heard that halt have be made there until day before yorke arrived at boshof commander in chief have effected passage of rhenoster river without fighting boer having abandoned strong position have prepared owing to being threatened by cavalry who have crossed river higher up after rest of eighteen hour yorke started for kroonstad scarcely saw person during long ride advance of methuen to hoopstad robert to kroonstad so alarmed boer that have for most part abandoned farm trekked north majority however of

illustration yorke receives despatch from baden powell strong force be stationed at kroonstad be now base of advancing army going at once to lord methuen who have arrived there from hoopstad two day before yorke obtained order from for carriage for horse in train must start at midnight spent hour relating to general adventure have passed through since have last seen on modder must be well mounted indeed to have got down from mafeking in nine day mr harberton of course might have done in great deal shorter time have ridden direct from mafeking here though quite understand that knowing nothing of commander in chief movement must not well have attempted that for must have have to pas through country have not touched yet yes sir must have be only about distance probably must say even le than yes much le only reckon to be hundred fifty mile from here to mafeking in direct line of course carrying despatch must not have risked especially a must have have to cross vaal may be sure that drift on river will be strongly guarded think must have come much quicker sir for according to country be great deal rougher than through have travelled a boer have not be disturbed dared not have ridden by day must hardly have found way by night there be road marked leading south east from mafeking be about line must have followed knew too lord robert must have heard news of relief of mafeking via pretoria have be otherwise must have risked attempt knowing intense anxiety throughout army at home a to safety of garrison a be only carrying detail two three day difference did not seem to to be of importance have travelled by line must only have hoped to succeed by coming in disguise knew that lord robert hoped to move from bloemfontein two day after left there might have be fresh misfortune like at sanna post line might have be cut in several place might have be so delayed that must not have be at kroonstad by time arrived there may ask how far general have got crossed vaal to day bivouacked at vereeniging general french hutton believe have moved on to rietfontein general ian hamilton to rietkuil then have crossed vaal without opposition sir yes cavalry outflanked enemy false

day came up to head quarter have that morning arrived at klip river station little over ten mile from johannesburg there delivered despatch to lord robert who on hearing route have followed complimented warmly upon rapidity with have made journey have only heard bare fact that mafeking have be relieved be at last gasp did not look like sir know what store have remaining heard that be pretty nearly out of everything except oat horse flesh men certainly looked somewhat thin worn by account have kept up spirit wonderfully confidently relied upon succour arriving by time named did mahon succeed in capturing considerable force sir there be fight outside town gun be too strong for fell back to entrenchment on other side of town colonel baden powell attacked there think only made stand to get big gun away succeeded in doing only one small gun be captured if horse have be fresher doubt heavy blow might have be dealt have have very heavy march certainly four canadian gun must not have pursued with chance of coming up with especially a have abandoned waggon store colonel baden powell belief that sent off big gun day before only fought battle with to give time to get long way on road be sort of conjuring trick lord robert said with smile heigh ho presto gun be gone have out manoeuvred many time never once have caught one of big gun such cannon until present war have be considered a simply gun of position wholly out of question in military operation in field be sure be much obliged to for zeal activity that have displayed will have pleasure in mentioning name most favourably in despatch on leaving general tent yorke to great satisfaction saw han standing near saw ride in master glad be for one never know what may happen be also glad to see han suppose peter be here too yes sir be with two horse be quite right again now did ride either of coming up so that must be a fit a possible for work by time wanted be glad to hear that han for horse good a be want fortnight rest after tremendously hard work have done since left chapter xx johannesburg difficulty of advance be now past country be almost level beyond drift station in distance be low line of hill on tall chimney must be made out chimney of mine have brought such wealth not only to who worked to transvaal owing to greed avarice of kruger associate have finally brought ruin upon country so far resistance of boer have be feeble in extreme from one point after carefully prepared in way have retreated with scarce show of resistance although might nerve to fight one battle in defence of capital be certain that johannesburg far more important town must fall into hand of invader without effort many of free state men have left retreating force of transvaal remained in own country although have through malign influence of steyn thrown in lot with northern kindred there have from first be real heartiness between two section free state men declaring that be sacrificed by transvaalers that whole brunt of war have fallen upon that be not consulted be treated rather a if have be born servant of transvaalers than a men who have sacrificed everything for sake transvaal men on other hand accused burgher of free state of being half hearted in cause of being backward in fighting not to be trusted accusation be certainly unfounded one desperate attempt for capture of ladysmith have be made by free state men who have fought with greater courage determination than transvaalers have ever done country have be made theatre of war be railway have be destroyed property damaged farm burnt have be placed along modder to bear brunt of british fire while transvaalers have be posted in comparatively safe position on british flank civilized people have be lorded over by one inferior to foe in respect except physical strength be small wonder that seeing how assurance that have received have be falsified hope disappointed feeling outraged must have refused to go north to aid in defence of country have done so little to aid wonder rather be that did not retire altogether from contest accept inevitable when further resistance must bring ruin upon advancing from klip river on th general ian hamilton found enemy in considerable force with gun on range of hill to west position being too strong for cavalry to attack alone two brigade of infantry be sent to assistance gordons city imperial volunteer with greatest gallantry stormed height fighting of boer here showed how great be demoralization there be such resistance a offered by men who held kopje of belmont graspan gordons have nearly hundred casualty be caused to extent by advancing in open order in line without pause while city imperial volunteer who be exposed to equally heavy fire advanced by rush company in rear keeping up heavy fire against boer on sky line so shaking accuracy of fire have gordons used similar tactic must probably have suffered much le than did while action be going on on left flank henry with mounted infantry moved straight upon germiston point at line from natal johannesburg joined main line to pretoria junction lay among great mound of mine refuse be occupied by boer there be sharp fighting enemy be soon driven off in gallant fashion by dismounted men feat be daring one a be impossible to say how large body of enemy have be lying among tip way being thus cleared main force advanced to germiston next day th division with brigade of cavalry mounted infantry be established on height north of johannesburg ian hamilton column be at florida three mile west of town french

rode out to suburb of orange grove three mile to north of town be left in charge of wavell brigade while mackenzie of seaforth highlander be appointed military governor lord robert have now serious decision to make departure of main army to north have emboldened boer of orange free state to undertake operation at several point against line of communication speed at army have advanced have rendered impossible for store sufficient for need to be pushed up along single line of railway at utmost only day consumption for army must be brought up in twenty four hour army be therefore literally living from hand to mouth blowing up of single important culvert small bridge must even for one day arrest transit of train must have have most serious consequence lord robert have therefore to decide whether to content for short time with capture of johannesburg until safety of communication be assured supply for further advance accumulated to push forward at once to pretoria chose latter alternative delay must enable boer to recover from demoralization complete failure of elaborate plan for checking advance have brought about to clear pretoria of store above to carry off british prisoner four thousand in number with latter be very serious consideration a possession of so large number of prisoner might have be used by boer a lever to extort more favourable term than must otherwise have looked for yorke have ridden in with lord robert staff a soon a cheering greeted hoisting of british flag have ceased general be moving on yorke eye a looked round over crowd fell

country be still in very disturbed state down line one may almost say a far a cape town be afraid that will be long time before boer accept defeat a final that will carry on partisan war for many month will be impossible to guard foot of line for nearly thousand mile will be constantly cut a be mounted there will be overtaking raiding party with infantry have nothing like enough cavalry to police enormous extent of country will take long time must think many month before will be able on single line of railway to do more than feed troop until resistance be crushed out doe not seem to to be possible for fugitive to return well must wait a patiently a may be be glad to see by news that have received through loreno marque that shareholder in england have lost heart patience that fall in value of stock mine have be much smaller than might have be expected own have have great fear of late that boer must when saw matter going against smash up machinery blow up mine a far a must there be great danger of at one time indeed yesterday feared worst rabble of town encouraged by judge koch seemed bent upon violence botha troop have retired there be authority whatever to keep order dr krause did must when mob composed almost entirely of lowest class of irish german went out to robinson mine prospect looked desperate mr tucker manager showed great tact firmness be well backed by krause who pointed out to mob that if british troop when entered to day found that mine have be damaged must probably have whole of lower portion of town burned man who must not prove that have taken part in affair shot therefore a there be everything to lose nothing to gain by destruction of mine must be nothing short of madness for to commit so useless piece of mischief happily succeeded mob returned to town there be nothing to prevent from going to work again a soon a can get hand of course mine have be somewhat damaged by picking out richest deposit during last month working a have doubt will be able to get few hand a many men have remained here to drive heading open new ground suppose that there will be falling off in output when once set to work in earnest that evening after lady have retired mr chamber said now a to yorke from what said fancy think of remaining in army after affair be over sir owing to death vacancy be now senior second lieutenant of th lancer might get step day pay even of first lieutenant will go very short way towards expense of subaltern in crack cavalry regiment even if changed into infantry must still hardly make end meet came out here a frankly told in order to make money father income a clergyman will die with above thing be anxious to be able to assure future of mother sister that can do at present mr chamber said quietly yorke looked at in surprise suppose director went on such service a rendered to company to myself family be to be passed over a if have never occurred have taken possible precaution to ensure safety of treasure say that must have sufficed have twelve men have possession of house for forty eight hour when found that must not bale out water must naturally have supposed that be fed from cistern pipe from mine must have found out latter by turning on kitchen tap must have emptied former then must have baled out water got at top of safe must have have trouble with among desperado of kind especially in mining district there must be sure to be several who must understand use of dynamite at rate sooner later must have blown open got at gold have written letter to director at home saying that have saved two hundred fifty thousand pound worth of gold in attack made upon house by band of ruffian with connivance of three male servant who be cognizant of existence of store have recommended that at least five per cent of sum thus saved to shareholder will be voted to recommendation have doubt will be granted especially a very existence of money be still unknown to a have not ventured to say word in letter concerning because of be liable to be opened by boer authority must say that if be at liberally inclined will vote larger percentage at five per cent sum must amount to twelve thousand five hundred pound will see enable to ensure future of dear to yorke be silent with astonishment for minute then said earnestly be too much sir must be out of reason have thought of doing more than saving lady from ruffian thought of reward ever entered head may be mr harberton be reason against accepting money that have fairly earned be not what feel about what shareholder a be very considerable shareholder feel in matter there will be nearly two hundred forty thousand pound to divide between sum wholly unexpected by saved for by be matter of only barest justice be sure will feel a do have of course written full account of affair how although escaped prisoner in danger moment of detection went out of way on hearing of plot to hasten here how in first place overpowered disarmed treacherous servant then warned how two men killed fewer than ten out of twelve men who attacked how without interposition ruffian must unquestionably have killed wife daughter before ransacking place for treasure matter by way must have be considerable inconvenience to put in stronger form to company a must have found difficult to replace by anyone having at once so intimate knowledge of mine so large interest in success now come to personal interest in matter wish to make offer have son have nephew near relative who must stand to in place of one propose therefore that will be trained up to take place so to speak to act here a assistant to learn business thoroughly for must have ample opportunity a be inspector of several other mine in have also interest when matter have quite settled down may not be for year so can act a locum tenens for will certainly go to england with family for two three year may return again for year so will then finally retire by time will be fully competent to fill place here a managing director will transfer enough share in company to to qualify for post be new idea on part have for month past be thinking over returning to settle in england have seen way of doing so without seriously inconveniencing company now see way by can be managed have spoken of plan to wife most cordially approves of now only awaits decision may say that hold twenty thousand share in company consider that a managing director ought to hold at least five thousand that number will transfer to name be perfectly confident that will do full justice to choice of a successor here will not be long in acquiring necessary knowledge will regard a adopted son if will allow to do so can answer wife daughter will gladly accept in position may tell that will not be entirely cut off from family a will be able to take three month holiday year if like to do so will give over six week at home perhaps may bring one of sister out with to keep house until marry what do say to know what to say sir kindness be so great hardly feel that can take advantage of dear lad place in position for moment imagine that there have be plot to kill father mother two sister that plot failed by interposition of stranger what must have felt towards that man be there anything that must not do for if have be rich man a be must not have felt that gift of five thousand share originally cost five shilling although be now worth more than a many pound must have be inadequate expression of gratitude yorke be silent after moment pause mr chamber went on must think of a well a of yourself will be grievous disappointment to if refuse even in pecuniary sense consider that offer to be advantageous one to family stake in mine others be very large one penny have be invested in way at present value of share be worth over three hundred thousand pound must be enormous advantage to have here gentleman on accuracy of whose report must implicitly rely who must be not always case with manager of mine frankly say if prospect of of be falling off improving be personal knowledge of real state of thing have enabled to do so well to get out of mine whose prospect be not favourable buy into others perhaps at very low price likely to do really well when fully opened must not of course wish to obtain report other than sent by to board of various company from what personally know of mine must be able to draw very valuable deduction from report see drift of much better than men wholly in ignorance of working to relate need say more mr chamber yorke said accept most gratefully splendid offer will endeavour to make worthy of hope that will allow to attend to present duty until at least have captured pretoria must not in honour go to lord robert say that on eve of possibly great battle desire to resign commission war may continue in partisan struggle for month even for year with pretoria once taken seems to that there must be end to fighting on great scale might therefore without feeling must be blamed for doing so leave army by mean yorke for now that have agreed to proposal can henceforth call so if have be matter even of month must have waited believe that be one of day only there may be great battle for insignificant a have be resistance of boer to advance be difficult to believe that with example of what ladysmith kimberley mafeking have done unprepared a be can retire from town that have for past four five year be fortifying be hard to believe that must be so cowardly sir especially a must know that lengthened resistance here must enable burgher of state to rally by cutting line of communication speedily reduce besieger to greatest strait indeed even if must only hold out for week position of army must become extremely serious one thing be certain that if fight there will never fight with chance of success again may cut off convoy blow up culvert harass terribly will no longer be war merely effort of band of mounted bandit now will join lady mr chamber said dear said when entered room will be glad to hear that yorke have accepted proposal be glad indeed mr chamber said shaking yorke warmly by hand began to think that must never be able to get away from here now feel that there be prospect day of doing so husband must never have gone until felt sure that must leave everything in hand of one whom must absolutely trust girl will be sure

retreat order be given that released prisoner must at once be reclothed armed sent down to form part of force guarding line of railway mr kruger have fled before arrival of british army showed by leaving wife behind a also did general botha that have belief whatever in atrocious calumny former have invented regarding conduct of troop before leaving kruger carried off money in bank state treasure did not even pay official salary due to after boasting that if british ever entered pretoria must find sitting in front of house despicable conduct when danger approached be only what be to be expected from man whose folly ambition have brought ruin on people over whom ruled who have trusted only too blindly chapter xxi settled although pretoria be taken yorke felt that must not a yet offer resignation position be still serious one botha have retreated fifteen mile away have taken up extremely strong position with fifteen thousand men under command line of railway ran through from must obtain supply from rear if need be send off heavy gun store army of general robert have dwindled a advanced garrison have have to be left at bridge important station brigade garrisoned johannesburg pretoria disease have played such havoc at bloemfontein have accompanied army have thinned rank have fifteen thousand men available for striking blow cavalry horse be again almost unfit for service in orange river colony de wet have eight thousand ten thousand mounted men under be raiding whole country capturing town threatening line of railway bright side of picture be that buller be now advancing might soon be expected to clear out boer opposed to enter transvaal relieve pressure on th came news that de wet with two thousand men have cut line of railway telegraph to north of kroonstad fortunately sufficient supply have be found in town to enable army to subsist for few day have botha retreated to greater distance lord robert must have waited a have done at bloemfontein for remount reinforcement store with enemy so strong able at moment to take offensive general felt that measure must be taken without delay to drive away from neighbourhood accordingly went out with troop on th next morning attacked boer position held by enemy be on long range of hill must only be turned with extreme difficulty cavalry be not in condition to execute so extensive movement french with two brigade hutton mounted infantry be to work round to north east of enemy position two other cavalry brigade under broadwood with ian hamilton column be to advance on right attack be to be made on centre a position there be so extremely strong that must be impossible to carry without great loss of life a turned out boer have posted small force there having determined upon adopting tactic falling upon flank while be engaged in attack on centre army therefore unknown to other massed great force upon flank two cavalry column first came into action with enemy french found speedily met by so formidable force that be unable with two thousand men under to move forward be attacked in front rear flank country be altogether too broken for action of cavalry men therefore fought dismounted in open order aided by three horse artillery battery kept enemy at distance day unable to advance however french made attempt to retreat knowing that unless held fast boer must be able to throw whole strength against other wing a must be heard by distant firing be hotly engaged night came on before firing ceased wearied men slept where lay renewing fight in morning maintained position day on other flank broadwood have be equally hotly engaged with difficulty held own being hardly pressed by heavy artillery fire from front left while on right rear boer commando attacked fiercely force be with difficulty kept back by fire of battery of royal artillery same battery have suffered so heavily at sanna post a assailant retired commando came up pressed hotly be charged in gallant style by th lancer who though horse be weak fairly rode over mounted boer drove to flight gun be saved when after charge cavalry re formed be swept by storm of bullet from boer marksman lord airlie colonel with two officer seventeen men be killed wounded former being shot through heart threatened attack be repulsed by life guard for time force be exposed only to fire of enemy artillery hamilton infantry came up to support of brigade a be now late lord robert determined to postpone general attack until next morning although have gained ground day fighting have not be attended with much valuable result except lord robert have now thoroughly ascertained nature of boer position have determined upon point against decisive assault must be made next day point be diamond hill in morning guard brigade with two naval twelve pounder reinforced hamilton commander be ordered to move against diamond hill then down towards railway to threaten line of retreat must boer maintain in other position hamilton told off one of cavalry brigade with infantry battalion to guard right rear other brigade with mounted infantry to cover right flank while with sussex derbyshire regiment city imperial volunteer field battery advanced about midday against boer position be met by heavy fire on flank continuous infantry fire from hill in front infantry moved steadily forward with guard brigade in close support behind by two o'clock position be carried boer falling back to hill covering railway after two hour fighting infantry won way to crest of new position here be exposed to terrible fire with difficulty maintained position boer gun pounded line while heavy rifle fire swept with storm of lead there be nothing to be done to lie still return fire a best must until aid came up meanwhile artilleryman be working with might main to get gun up precipitous hill one battery at last succeeded although men fell fast gun be unlimbered opened fire upon enemy battery not however until two other battery have be got up hill brought into action did combat become equal a afternoon wore on accuracy with shrapnel burst began to keep down boer fire general robert decided that be too late to undertake further offensive movement over unknown ground made disposition for final advance on following morning when day dawned however be found that enemy have withdrawn cavalry set out in pursuit without much hope of success a wearied horse be scarce able to carry weight of rider equipment hundred west australian however better mounted perhaps than rest of cavalry more lightly equipped followed enemy up for twenty five mile gained kopje near boer be retreating a long a ammunition lasted kept up constant fire killing number of men horse be singular that punishment be inflicted upon boer at very spot where have treacherously surprised massacred british regiment on march nineteen year before on day after victory army marched back to pretoria having freed from danger of immediate attack railway communication be now restored lord methuen on th of june attacked defeated commando of de wet garrison along line be materially strengthened buller while engagement at diamond hill have be going on have by severe fighting defeated boer posted on strong position at aliwal nek same evening established head quarter at joubert farm four mile north of volksrust border town of transvaal yorke have be busily engaged during two day battle have have several narrow escape from enemy shot twice before gun be brought to crest have made way up hill on foot to ascertain how matter be going there ball have passed through helmet smashed field glass be however untouched when day be over felt that must now resign commission without appearance of want of zeal when therefore general robert sent for in morning after return to pretoria determined to speak to at once have called mr harberton to tell have just heard of vacancy in regiment will give step congratulate upon heartily only wish that have be from lieutenant to captain in case must have pleasure in warmly recommending for brevet majority be very much obliged to sir kindness make harder for to say what be in mind be desirous of resigning commission only accepted for service during war although war be not yet over end appears so near at hand feel that object in resigning commission will not be misinterpreted may remember sir that when have honour of relating to story of escape from prison here mentioned to have be able to render service to mr chamber managing director of parfontein mine saw a passed through bloemfontein have be good enough to offer post a assistant be likely to lead to great advantage will be returning to england with family when thing have quieted down be anxious must go to a soon a possible in order that may give such instruction a will enable to leave matter in hand while be away have in case thought of remaining in army a have private mean came out here to make way in business must certainly have preferred to stay on until end of campaign offer made be so advantageous that be anxious to avail of quite right harberton general said have already shown that posse qualification required in officer of army might be long time before have again such opportunity a of have so brilliantly availed during war think decision be very wise one have done share more than share in event of war have very markedly distinguished show that have a much common sense a courage quickness in making such decision many young officer if have gained a much credit a must have have head turned refused even most dazzling offer with result that year afterwards when living in dull monotony of garrison town might bitterly regret having thrown away so valuable chance personally can not accept resignation can give leave of absence until name appears in gazette do so more willingly a be likely that will have halt here for week before can obtain remount reinforcement in sending home despatch will do in course of day two will certainly mention a having performed exceptionally brilliant service must while be at pretoria have occasion to come here will at time be glad to see suppose servant will also want discharge if please sir be still suppose on book of cape town rifle be not transferred to lancer again thanking lord robert for kindness yorke retired hour later started with han peter for johannesburg where arrived afternoon welcome back mr chamber said a came out on hearing ride up have be thinking about very anxiously since heard that there have be two day battle very hard fighting knew that a aide de camp must be galloping about with order in very thick of be pretty tough work yorke said a see helmet field glass have suffered have not even scratch thank god for be here on duty have come for good be here for good sir sent in resignation morning lord robert have given leave of absence until appears in gazette will of course be time hence a letter will have to go return hurry thing at pall mall be good news indeed will be delighted to have here must look upon home a home now know on following morning yorke went into town ordered civilian clothes for han bought suitable attire for peter on return began work by descending mine with mr chamber threw into work with usual energy during next two month paid visit to mine in neighbourhood mr chamber explaining to run of lode reason why level heading be driven step to be taken for extending work endeavouring to discover other lode before descending mr chamber showed plan of working so that must better understand when went below when not so engaged be instructed in nature of book kept of duty performed by various official of mine will understand yorke that question of driving level carrying on working be in hand of underground manager be always discussed with prior to new step being taken matter be not really difficult be only on locating fresh lode determining value how have best be worked that geological knowledge be much required discovery be first made by men thoroughly acquainted with country after determining that nature of ground be favourable sink small shaft twenty thirty foot deep on lode sample be taken to assaye office in town proportion of gold to ton ascertained there assaye value be always considerably larger than will turn out on actual working a much fine gold be lost in stamping other process though greatest care be exercised still if assaye product be say three ounce to ton may be safely calculated that actual working will yield at least two half ounce however will not have to deal with question have well established mine on fine lode must be difficult to make serious mistake in meantime scarcely day have passed without news of fighting in south attended by

affair at colesberg in street did han then must be on look out dirck can be here for good purpose must not be surprised if have come to carry out old grudge against though how can tell be here be more than can imagine of course be together no be not far apart a passed other spoke looked a if be acquainted be not dressed a usual peter say dirck be got up like town dutchman other two like uitlander workman suppose must have recognized two men though must know dirck anywhere peter like native never seems to forget face have once seen be positive about wish have come back told at once han know what must have done certainly must have have arrested because be british subject rebel be in position to show that be actually in arm against can have protection paper to show that have permission to return to farm must have great difficulty in explaining what be doing here at rate must have got term of imprisonment though know that must be much good must only add one more to what considers grievance against a to other two men must hing be probably orange river colony men being unarmed conducting peaceably must scarcely be arrested still wonder peter did not come straight back bring in here han must like to question sit down peter go on with pipe yorke said when kaffir came in so saw jansen two men who be with at colesberg in street afternoon yes baa be not together did not seem to notice other be just so master wonder that did not come tell at once knew be out with baa chamber rode away just before started so did peter forgot that did not get back till just before dinner remember now that rather wondered that han came took horse instead of a knew be away kaffir went on said to myself 'no use going home better see what fellow be here for be bad men dirck jansen hate baa must look after have fear must know only see little time one kaffir boy just like never give thought watch watch dirck went twice into bar have drink others went in once never together at six o'clock went to railway station go there too know evening one train run to pretoria take ticket get in not sit together if have have money in pocket must have gone too know never carry money so that if smell spirit want to break promise ca do so a must not go with thought best to come here tell about then can settle what be best thing to do not safe for baa now fellow about peter remembers face when saw in yard hate must kill whenever have chance be certainly so peter doubt have gone to pretoria to find may have found out from questioning men who have be taken prisoner be on general robert staff soldier might not know officer must know name dirck be crafty enough to get information requires must think over what have best be done sat for four five minute looking into fire be clear said at last can not sit quiet let hunt down must have difficulty about finding must only have to go up to staff officer say simply that be old acquaintance of mine wished to see must be told at once have left army be here with mr chamber then must only have to wait to get shot at time must choose hiding place so close to road that must not miss must hunt down while be tracking sooner set about better must ride over han there be only that one train take passenger will start to night baa peter said only thirty mile will sleep till twelve o'clock will be there by seven what time get there will set out directly after breakfast say at nine o'clock riding fast will reach pretoria at twelve will of course put up at hotel in stopped when be with army will be there baa perhaps find before that sure to go to street near general be place to meet officer very good peter think now that can reckon on catching before catch doe not know that be being hunted know that be hunting give tremendous advantage must not be in too great hurry be deep fellow may be here on other business if so will probably finish before return to johannesburg at rate will watch until see what game be will have to do principally peter for of course know han will watch baa will take old clothes with to night so that can change when like might notice if saw often near in same clothes be very good idea peter now know have further instruction to give joining mr chamber yorke told what have happened what proposed to do think plan very good one a say have doubt chief aim in coming here be to endeavour to find out kill if be only object must say go straight to head of police who be provost marshal have arrested at once may also be here to communicate with disaffected inhabitant boer may intend making attack upon pretoria if must arrange at same time there must be rising there perhaps house fired in different place so a to distract attention of garrison must certainly have greater chance of success therefore by mean carry out plan must be best to say nothing about to lady must only alarm must worry time be away will say at breakfast that be going to ride over to pretoria on business may remain there for day will mention at same time that be anxious to know when be probable that will be able to get few of miner up from cape natal so a to clear up make preparation for start will then suppose that visit to pretoria be in connection with be carried out yorke han started early next morning mr chamber having arranged to have two of engineer to sleep in house during absence peter met a rode into yard of hotel well peter news yes baa at nine o'clock came in front of church did not see come be strolling about just at nine o'clock caught sight of walked up down say to 'he waiting for other men presently man in uniform of transvaal artilleryman came along say something to dirck dirck say one word in reply then follow walk distance of course follow at last go into small house mile from place stop there two hour then dirck came out alone looked very satisfied walked mile then met other two men talked very earnest seem pleased then separated dirck walked away again went to small house quarter of mile away come to meet baa very good peter be clear that dirck have other business in view than of seeking for will go see officer in charge of police arrangement at once a know personally can talk matter over with more comfortably than if be merely official business on sending in card to provost marshal yorke be at once admitted so be back again at pretoria mr harberton officer said a entered be business pleasure business not of pleasant nature must have come to later to lay matter before ask to arrest man who believe have come here for purpose of taking life morning have made discovery seems to show that object of visit here be of greater public interest than be safety let have whole story mr harberton officer said there be nothing like getting at bottom of affair yorke gave short sketch of previous experience with dirck jansen how kaffir boy have met with two men who have be overpowered by at colesberg that certainly look a if have come here with intention of avenging upon mr harberton be well indeed that man recognized what have told be amply sufficient for to order immediate arrest a notorious rebel yes sir be what intended to ask to do case seems to entirely changed by what kaffir found out morning seems to show that be here on more serious business then told peter have noticed how met evidently by appointment officer in uniform of transvaal artillery of long conference together be indeed serious mr harberton officer said after taking note of yorke report did kaffir say anything about personal appearance of officer score of be in town on parole yorke repeated account have obtained from peter of man appearance address of house went to that settle officer said man be lieutenant han cordua german be already watching be surprised have not already report of interview have received information from man who be trusted by that plot be in progress object of be to get up sudden rising in town set fire to house in various quarter kidnap general robert in confusion murder officer a issue from house know botha have be in communication with have be asked to bring up large force close to town on night when affair be to take place have doubt that man who be evidently fanatic be here in reference to arrangement be only waiting until hear that definite date have be fixed upon to arrest cordua other leader of affair be desperate scheme might have not heard of have be attended with success have not advanced very far a yet be leader have not yet taken step to excite rising may consider that must be done in very few hour there be certainly three four thousand men in town who must be likely to join heartily in such enterprise about be dutch others low class german irish french be against in first place from intense hatred of in second place because stoppage of mine cessation of trade departure of employer of labour together with dearth of provision have deprived of casual employment upon subsisted few of be working men in true sense of term certainly good many be employed upon railroad in various railway yard men be ripe for anything in way of mischief if whisper be passed round few hour before rising be to take place must join to man discovery at present be profound secret though of course military commandant adjutant general have be informed of be to have consultation at commandant afternoon news have brought that emissary from without have arrived last night have have interview with cordua to day will probably precipitate matter must not be surprised if cordua concerned be arrested evening must be a well that men must continue watch over fellow dirck jansen must be glad if will return here at six o'clock a may be required to identify must rather not appear in matter personally if can be avoided because badly a have turned out be a told nephew of cousin wife will take care that will not do so more than be absolutely necessary evidence of man that be farmer from neighbourhood of richmond notorious for pro boer feeling that be with rebel at colesberg must probably be sufficient corroborated a must be a to latter portion by kaffir who must also prove that met cordua by appointment went with to house must probably not attempt to deny point must find hard to give explanation of present visit here of course if brought document from botha may find when cordua lodging be searched if not probably will get off with few month imprisonment a notorious rebel very well sir will call again at six o'clock peter went on watch again just before yorke be about to call on provost marshal met with news that dirck have be hanging about head quarter have addressed staff officer who came out that latter have taken out pocket book written few word upon page torn out given to dirck when peter left have just entered small german beer shop hundred yard away when yorke entered provost marshal room latter said be going to make arrest in hour time mr harberton be agreed that crisis might at

from boy yes kaffir have be watching day have have communication with anyone except that accosted staff officer latter wrote few word on piece of paper gave have question be address bear out idea that
