one hand king by instability bad faith duplicity alienated best friend drove common to far greater length than have at first dreamed of upon other hand struggle begun only to win constitutional right ended owing to ambition fanaticism determination to override right opinion save own of numerically insignificant minority of common backed by strength of army in establishment of most complete

three young people sat together on shady bank at edge of wood three mile from oxford country be undulating picturesque little more than mile in front of rose lofty spire of st helen abingdon party consisted of two lad who be about fifteen year of age girl of ten lad although of about same height build be singularly unlike herbert rippinghall be dark grave dress somber in hue good in material well made harry furness be fair merry looking boy good humor be distinguishing characteristic of face somewhat bright fashionably cut clothes be carelessly put on be clear that thought of own appearance good look entered mind wore hair in ringlet have on head broad hat of felt with white feather while companion wore plain cap hair be cut closely to head be bad business harry latter said there be one satisfaction come what may nothing can disturb friendship have never have quarrel since first met at old school down there six year ago have be dear friend always only regret have be that laziness have prevented being rival for must have grudged other victory indeed herbert there be never chance of that have always be mr gregory prize boy be now head of school while have always be in bad book a say herbert have be dear friend come what will will continue so can not agree on state of kingdom will never do so have taken view from parent indeed seems to that question be far too difficult one for boy like to form opinion of when see of best wisest in land ranging on side be clear that even wise noddle a yours to say nothing of feather brain like mine can not form opinion on subject perplexes elder better be true harry still herbert will have argument have best of there fall back upon authority father colonel be for king yours for parliament say that there be fault on side indeed for year favored common king act be unconstitutional tyrannical father approved of bold stand sir george elliot made against now however have be changed tell common seek to rule without king peer have sought to impose condition must render lord absolute of england reduce king to mere puppet have too attacked church must abolish bishop interfere in matter spiritual therefore father while acknowledging fault king have committed grieving over act have driven parliament to taking up hostile attitude to yet hold duty to support against violent men who have now assumed power who be aiming at subversion of constitution loss of country fear also herbert said that common have gone grievously beyond right although did father hear say so must fall under gravest displeasure hold that be necessary that there must be ecclesiastical sweep that prelate must have more power in land popery must be put down with iron hand that since king can not be trusted to govern well power must be placed in hand of people own thought do incline toward a say when one see men like lord falkland who have hitherto stood among foremost in rank of who demand that king will govern according to law now siding with against one can not feel how grave be difficulty how much be to be said on side how be one to choose king be overbearing haughty untrue to word parliament be stiff necked bent upon acquiring power beyond what be fair right there be indeed grievous fault on side seems to must king now have way conquer common descendant will henceforth govern a absolute monarch liberty of people will be endangered while on other hand must parliament gain upper hand will place on firm basis liberty of englishman excess may commit will be controlled modified by future parliament for people of england will no more suffer tyranny on part of common than of king while can not change one be in power to elect whom will to send up men who will govern thing moderately wisely at rate harry said father think that there be moderation wisdom among zealot at westminster a hear that many noble country gentleman throughout england be of same opinion methinks that though at present parliament have best of have seized portsmouth tower depot of arm yet that in end king will prevail against trust herbert continued earnestly that there will be fighting england have known civil war since day of rose when see how france germany be torn by internal dissension must be happy indeed england have so long escaped scourge be indeed sad to think that friend must be arrayed against other in quarrel in side be in wrong hope harry said that if need must fight will soon be over whichever way fortune may turn think not herbert answered be war of religion a much a war for power king common may strive who will govern realm people who will take up arm will do more for triumph of protestantism than for of pym hampden how tiresome be lucy rippinghall interrupted pouting brought out to gather flower hing talk of king parliament a if cared for call very rude herbert be often forgetful think of book more than of master be always polite gentle marvel much that must be so changed to day forgive harry said smiling have be very remiss miss lucy will have more of high politics will even if never again said sadly devote energy to getting such basket of flower for a may fill room with beaupots now if majesty be ready to begin be most obedient servant so with laugh little party rose to foot started in quest of wild flower condition of affair be at outbreak of civil war such a might well puzzle older head than of harry furness herbert rippinghall to choose between two power who be gathering arm foundation of difficulty have be laid in reign of king james that monarch who in figure manner mind be in strongest contrast to english king who have preceded be infinitely more mischievous than more foolish monarch must have be coarse in manner buffoon in demeanor so weak that in many matter suffered to be puppet in hand of profligate who surrounded have yet certain amount of cleverness obstinacy nothing must overcome brought with from scotland overweening opinion of power dignity of position a king word absolute monarchy have hitherto meant only monarch free from foreign interference to james meant monarchy free from interference on part of lord common believed implicitly in divine right of king to do just a chose in thing secular ecclesiastical to impose will upon subject at time upon continent struggle of protestantism catholicism be being fought out everywhere in france huguenot be gradually losing ground be soon to be extirpated in germany protestant prince have lost ground austria at one time halting between two opinion have now espoused vehemently side of pope save in holland switzerland catholicism be triumphing all along line while sympathy of people of england be strongly in favor of co religionist upon continent of james inclined toward catholicism in matter ecclesiastical be at variance with subject what caused if possible even deeper feeling of anger than interference in church matter be claim to influence decision of law court pusillanimity of great mass of judge hindered from opposing outrageous claim people saw with indignation amazement royal power becoming infinitely greater more extended than anything to henry viii even elizabeth have laid claim negotiation of king for marriage between son infanta of spain raised fear of people to highest point remembrance of spanish armada be still fresh in mind looked upon alliance with spain a most unholy of contract a threatening alike religion liberty of englishman thus when at king james death king charles ascended throne inherited legacy of trouble unhappily disposition be even more obstinate than of father training have be wholly bad have inherited pernicious idea of father in reference to right of king even more unfortunately have inherited father counselor duke of buckingham haughty avaricious ambitious noble raised by king james from obscurity urged to follow path of father other evil counselor be not wanting king charles indeed have advantage over father inasmuch a person be stately commanding manner grave dignified private life irreproachable conflict have continued throughout reign of father between king parliament speedily broke out afresh common refused to grant supply unless king granted right privilege deemed alike derogatory dangerous shifty foreign policy of england be continued soon breach be a wide a have be during previous reign after several parliament have be called dissolved gaining advantage from necessity of king others meeting only to separate after discussion imbittered already existing relation for ten year king dispensed with parliament murder of duke of buckingham by felton brought alleviation to situation in ireland wentworth earl of strafford ruled with tyrannical power be man of clear mind of great talent whole effort be devoted to increasing power of king so a considered benefit of country in ireland have submissive parliament by aid of raised money ruled in manner tyrannical a be be yet for benefit of country king have absolute confidence in advice be ever on side of resistance to popular demand in england chief power be given to archbishop land high church prelate bent upon restoring many of form of catholic worship bitterly opposed to puritan spirit pervaded great mass of english people so far error have be entirely upon side of king demand of common have be justified by precedent constitutional rule doings of king be in equal opposition to when at last necessity of situation compelled charles to summon parliament be met by in spirit of absolute defiance before vote of supply must taken common insisted upon impeachment of strafford charles weakly consented to trial be illegally carried on evidence weak doubtful king favorite be marked out for destruction to joy of whole kingdom be condemned executed similar fate befell laud encouraged by success demand of common became higher higher ultimatum at last puritan party in parliament delivered to king be that man must remain in royal council who be not agreeable to parliament that deed of king must have validity unless passed council be attested under hand that officer of state principal judge must be chosen with consent of parliament enjoy office for life that none of royal family must marry without consent of parliament council that penal law must be executed against catholic that vote of popish lord must not be received in peer that bishop must be excluded from house that reformation of liturgy church government must be carried out according to advice of parliament that ordinance have made with regard to militia must be submitted to that justice of parliament must pas upon delinquent be upon official of state country who have assisted in carrying out king ordinance for raising of tax that general pardon must granted with such exception a must advised by parliament that fort castle must be disposed of by consent of parliament that peer must be made with consent of house demanded also that must have power of appointing dismissing royal minister of naming guardian for royal child of virtually controlling military civil religious affair a be clear that demand went altogether beyond right of common that if king submitted to power of country must be solely in hand while must become cipher have course open to to refuse assent to appeal to loyal nobility gentry of country be true that many of right have since be obtained by house of parliament must be remembered that be altogether alien at time to position king of england have hitherto held that body into whose hand must be intrusted must be composed solely of one party in state that party must be controlled by fanatical leader minister of sect opposed to established church be at time bitter narrow violent to extent of have now conception attitude thus assumed by parliament drove from rank great many of most intelligent enlightened of who have formerly sided with in contest against king gentleman felt intolerable a be despotic power of king still more intolerable must be to be governed by despotic power of group of fanatic liberty of englishman be now a much threatened by common a have be threatened by king to loyal gentleman latter alternative be preferable thus there be on side earnest conscientious men who grieved deeply at being forced to draw sword in such quarrel who felt that choice of side be difficult in extreme falkland be typical soldier on royal side hampden on of common be probable be england divided to morrow under same condition men must be equally troubled upon side to range at period of struggle with exception of few hot headed follower of king few zealot on side of common there be general hope that matter must shortly be arranged that one conflict must settle struggle first warlike demonstration be made before town of york before whose wall king arriving with armed force be refused admittance by sir john hotham who held place for parliament be signal for outbreak of war party henceforth strained nerve to arm to place force in field above be brief sketch of circumstance led cavalier puritan of england to arm for civil war many detail have be omitted object

rippinghall that have to with of political occurrence preceded a to at least doubt difference of opinion can arise incident of war victory defeat changing fortune final triumph be matter beyond domain

be first action of civil war first blood drawn by englishman from englishman since trouble in commencement of reign of mary chapter iii brawl at oxford news in day traveled slowly england be full of conflicting rumor a to doings of two army one be unsettled body of men moving to join one other of party kept country in uproar cavalier rather tough of town calling cavalier brought much odium upon royal cause by ill treatment of harmless citizen by raid on inoffensive country people later on conduct be to be reversed royalist be to suffer tenfold outrage now put upon puritan there can be doubt that conduct of irresponsible ruffian at time did much to turn flood of public opinion in many place where must otherwise have remained neutral against crown to harry time passed slowly spent day in abingdon hearing latest news occasionally rode over to oxford city be throughout civil war heart of royalist party loss be one of heaviest blow befell crown here harry found none favorable report current enthusiasm be at height university be even more loyal than town band of lad smashed window of person who be supposed to favor parliament more than once harry saw men pursued through street pelted with stone mud in case escaping barely with life upon one occasion seeing person in black garment of respectable appearance so treated boy indignation be aroused for from conversation with friend herbert talk with father be although enthusiastically royalist yet inclined to view with respect who held opposite opinion run down alley exclaimed pushing horse between fugitive pursuer man darted down lane harry placed at entrance shouted to rabble to abstain yell of rage indignation replied volley of stone be thrown harry fearlessly drew sword cut at of who be in foreground retaliated with stick harry be forced backward into lane be too narrow to enable to turn horse position be critical one finding that be mark for stone leaped from saddle thereby disappearing from sight of in rank behind sword in hand barred way to foremost of assailant contest however must have be brief have not party of young student come up lane seeing from harry attire that be gentleman likely to be of cavalier opinion at once without inquiring cause of fray threw into shouting gown gown speedily drove assailant back out of lane reinforced by great body beyond be then too strong for shout of young men however brought up others to assistance general melee took place townsman gownsmen throwing into fray without inquiry a to circumstance from arose young student carried sword although contrary to statute of university be for time generally adopted townspeople be armed with bludgeon in case with hanger fray be becoming serious one when be abruptly terminated by arrival of troop of horse happened to be coming into town to join royal force officer in command seeing so desperate tumult raging ordered men to charge into crowd interference speedily put end to fight harry returned to room with of protector wound be bound up circumstance of fight be talked over harry be much blamed by college men when said that have be drawn into fray by protecting puritan when new friend learned that be a thoroughly royalist a that father have gone with troop to nottingham took more favorable view of action still assured that be height of folly to interfere to protect rebel from anger of townspeople methinks harry said that be unwise in extreme to push matter so far here in oxford royalist have own way can of course at will assault puritan neighbor be different in most other town there roundhead have upper hand might retort by doing ill to cavalier there surely be better to keep unhappy difference out of private life to trust arbitration of cause to arm of soldier in field there be general agreement that must indeed be wisest course young fellow be of opinion that hot head on side must have way that if war went on attack of kind by one party on other must be looked for harry remained for time with friend in christ church drinking beer for college be famous then mounting horse rode back to abingdon two day later a be proceeding toward town met man dressed a preacher young sir latter said may ask if be master furness be lad replied then be to be indebted for rescue from who assaulted in street of oxford last week in confusion must not see face inquired afterward be told that preserver be master furness have come over to thank for courtesy bravery in thus intervening on behalf of one whom think regard a enemy for understand sir henry father have declared for crown acted harry said simply on impulse of humanity hold mean cowardly for number of men to fall upon one be preacher continued at beginning only of trouble time may come when zachariah stubbs may be able to return to good service have done believe young sir feeling throughout england be strong for common that will not be crushed out a men suppose even must king men gain great victory over essex methinks be not likely there be ten of thousand throughout country who be now content to remain quiet at home who must assuredly draw sword go forth to battle must consider cause in danger good work have begun sword will not be sheathed until oppressor be laid low must differ who oppressor be harry replied coldly be young to discus matter father who think with consider that oppression be at present on side of common of whose religious view share while pretending to wish to be free endeavor to bind others beneath tyranny while wishing to worship in way unmolested molest who wish to worship in theirs however thank for offer must time come good service will be at disposal a say issue of conflict be dark may be though trust will not that day may if will return light service rendered will not forget name preacher said zachariah stubbs humble instrument of lord preacher in independent chapel at oxford thither can not return be on way to london where have many friend where doubt not charge will be found for belong to east country where people be strong for lord doubt not that of know will come to front of affair in case influence may perhaps be of more service than can suppose at present farewell young sir be issue of struggle trust that may safely emerge from man lifted broad black hat went on way harry rode forward smiling little to at promise given time passed slowly kind of rumor filled land at length beacon fire be seen to blaze upon hill a be known that puritan have arranged with essex that news of victory be so to be conveyed to london heart of royalist sank for feared that disaster have befallen cause next day however horseman of parliament galloping through country proclaimed that have be defeated be not till next day that true state of affair

day burying dead drew off from field remaining there be able to claim victory however son be one of kind be scarce worth winning be sad sight to see so many men stretched stark dead killed not in fighting with foreign foe with other englishman made mightily sad if at moment lord essex have have full power from parliament to treat methinks that quarrel must have be settled being mightily sick of such kind of fighting what be going to be done now father harry asked be going to move forward toward london essex be moving parallel with will try to get there first from what hear from friend in city there be great number of moderate men will be glad to see king back to agree to make end of direful business zealot preacher will of course oppose when arrive trust that countenance will enable

said then took off cloak threw over stone dressing down tightly to prevent smoke from curling in through loophole must now hear roar crackling sound sudden glow lit up country flame be bursting through window harry said will bring troop down ere long troop will do good prince rupert replied king army must not rescue at least must be satisfaction before die to see crop eared knave defeated minute after minute passed broad glare of light illumined whole country round through slit must see roundhead keeping guard round house in readiness to cut off one who might seek to make escape while at short distance off have drawn up main body of force presently coming along road at rapid trot saw body of horse there be men prince exclaimed roundhead have seen too trumpet be sounded men on guard round house leaped to horse joined main body just a cavalier charged upon roundhead fought stoutly charge of cavalier be irresistible furious at sight of house in flame ignorant of fate have befallen prince master son burst upon roundhead with force latter be unable to withstand for four five minute fight continued then such of roundhead a be able clapped spur to horse galloped off hotly pursued by cavalier pursuit be short one several of cavalier be gathered at spot where conflict have taken place be apparently questioning wounded man then trumpeter who be with sounded recall in few minute royalist troop came riding back must see jacob pointing to burning building gesticulating with arm then party dashed up to house be lost to sight prince harry shouted at top of voice roar of flame crash of falling beam deadened sound heat have by time become intense have gradually divested of clothing be bathed in perspiration heat be terrific prince rupert said did not think human frame must stand so great heat methinks that water must boil be placed here be indeed case human frame a be now well known being capable of sustaining heat considerably above of boiling water wall be now so hot that hand must not be borne upon for instant foot be burning prince exclaimed reach down ladder from wall laid ladder on ground stood upon thus avoiding contact with hot stone if go on prince rupert said with laugh there will be nothing sword left be melting away fast like candle before fire truly think that there be so much water in man a have floated down from during last half hour harry be so placed that must command sight through loophole exclaimed be riding away be indeed case whole building be now one vast furnace having from first hope that friend if there must have survived have hearing that lady sidmouth daughter have be taken to storton determined to ride thither to take from hand of roundhead to learn from fate of leader two hour passed heat be still tremendous must not feel that be increasing once twice heard terrific crash a portion of wall fell must long since have be roasted be not for cool air flowed in through long loophole keeping up circulation in chamber lowered temperature of air within at end of two hour harry gave shout be coming back light have now sunk to quiet red glow so that beyond fact that party be approaching nothing must be seen rode however directly toward turret then when halted harry saw figure of two lady who be pointing toward loophole harry now stepped from ladder on to door shouted at top of voice through loophole reply came back in joyous shout be being roasted alive harry cried get ladder a quickly a possible with crowbar break down wall men be seen to ride off in several direction instantly for first time ray of hope illumined mind of prince harry that might be saved hour later long ladder tied together be placed against wall jacob speedily made appearance at loophole access be impossible from other side said for place where house stood be red hot furnace most of wall have fallen have hope of finding alive be roasting slowly harry cried in heaven name bring water soon bottle of water be passed in through loophole then three four ladder being placed in position men outside began with crowbar pickax to enlarge loophole sufficiently for prisoner to escape took three hour hard work at end of time aperture be sufficiently wide to allow to emerge utterly exhausted feeling a prince said baked to turn made way down ladder being helped on side by men for be too exhausted to maintain foot chapter viii defense of outpost effect of fresh air of cordial poured down throat soon restored vigor to prince rupert harry furness be still weak for great effort nature have made to resist force of heat during long hour have taxed constitution to utmost lady sidmouth be rejoiced indeed to find alive for have made sure that be lost be not until have be placed in room strongly barred under guard at storton that perceived light arising from residence guessed that men of common unable to find hiding place of prince rupert have set on fire then have knocked loudly at door sentry have given answer to to entreaty for hearing soon indeed desisted from effort for fire blazed up speedily convinced that hope be gone when jacob royalist arrived driving out small remnant of roundhead who remained in village have found lady sidmouth daughter bathed in tear under belief that guest have perished in old house that loved so well be with hope that have mounted on instant ridden at full gallop to castle be not until saw that wall be still standing that even slightest hope entered mind even then appeared incredible that one must be alive shout from loophole have surprised almost a much a have delighted in course of three four hour refreshed strengthened by hearty breakfast draught of burgundy prince harry mounted horse lady sidmouth determined to remain for few day at one of tenant house then to go quietly on to oxford for by time main army of essex be rapidly moving east country must soon be secure for passage prince harry rode at full speed to rejoin army night by riding late reached found that essex have in retreat surprised cirencester have passed farringdon prince with five thousand horse started marching with great rapidity got between reading enemy near newbury fell upon parliament horse for several hour sharp skirmishing went on essex be forced to halt army at hungerford gave time for king who be marching at head of infantry to come up royal army occupied newbury by position have taken up be now between roundhead london on morning of th of september outpost of force became engaged battle soon raged along whole line be to extent repetition of battle of edgehill prince rupert with cavalier swept away horse of enemy pikemen of london who now first be tried in combat forced back infantry of king prince rupert returning from pursuit charged with cavalry so sharply did shoot so steadily did line of pike hold together that horse must make impression upon night fell upon undecided battle next morning roundhead a at edgehill drew off from field leaving to royalist honor of nominal success success however be in case tantamount to repulse three leading men upon king side fell lord falkland carnarvon sunderland former one of finest character of time may be said to have thrown away life be utterly weary of terrible dissension war in england be plunged saw bitterness increasing on side daily hope of peace growing le le a have left parliamentary party because saw that ambition be boundless that purposed to set up despotic tyranny so must have bitterly grieved at seeing upon side of king duplicity beyond bound want of faith seemed to forbid hope of satisfactory issue thus then when day of newbury came falkland whose duty in nowise led into fight charged recklessly found death there can be little doubt sought although cavalier claimed newbury a great victory instead of advancing upon london fell back a usual to oxford during skirmish harry have opportunity of doing service to old friend parliament horse although valiant better trained than of royalist be yet unable to withstand impetuosity with latter always attacked men seeming indeed to be seized with veritable panic at sight of gay plume of rupert gentleman in fierce skirmish between harry troop party of parliament horse of about equal strength latter be defeated harry returning with main body found puritan officer dismounted with back against tree defending from attack of three of men harry rode hastily up demanded surrender officer looked up to surprise harry saw friend herbert be prisoner harry herbert said a lowered point of sword not at harry exclaimed must indeed be strange thing herbert be to make prisoner thought settled at abingdon ordering one of trooper to catch riderless horse be galloping near spoke for moment two with friend then a horse be brought up told to mount ride may get into trouble for releasing herbert said care not if do harry replied need not be uneasy about for prince rupert will stand friend hold clear of complaint may be made will ride forward with little till can join friend a harry rode on by side of herbert royalist officer one sir ralph willoughby dashed up what mean exclaimed do see officer of majesty riding with one of roundhead be treason treachery will answer to king if need be harry said for conduct be not under order sir ralph will use discretion in matter gentleman be a brother to must cut down brother sir ralph said furiously if found in rank of enemy then sir differ harry replied for must not there be friend said to herbert pointing to body of roundhead at short distance give word however that will not draw sword again to day herbert readily gave required promise riding off be soon with friend sir ralph harry came to high word after have left matter might then there have be decided by sword have not party of roundhead seeing two cavalry officer so near to charged down compelled to ride for life following day sir ralph reported circumstance to general to prince rupert prince laughed at charge harry furness said be a loyal gentleman a draw sword in rank a have be well nigh roasted together be vain indeed that complaint be made to touching honor will speak to however doubt not that explanation will be satisfactory prince accordingly spoke to harry who explained circumstance of relation with young roundhead have be great captain sir harry said might have deemed duty to hold in durance however near relationship to myself a few week since be schoolboy methought that addition of sword to roundhead cause must make great difference in chance of victory afternoon moreover have received pledge that must not draw sword again in battle a even although bitterness be quickly increasing be far from having reached that point subsequently attained prisoner on side be treated with respect more be said regarding harry conduct in allowing friend to escape from moment between sir ralph willoughby there grew up strong feeling of animosity only needed fitting pretext to break out be indeed unfortunate point in royal cause that there be very far from being unity among who fought side by side there be intrigue jealousy there be king men who must have supported majesty in length to might have gone who be ever advising to resist attempt at pacification to be content with nothing le than complete defeat of enemy upon other hand there be grave serious men who have drawn sword with intense reluctance who desired nothing so much a peace peace must secure alike right of crown right of people be shocked too by riotous profligate way of of wilder spirit deemed that cause be sullied by reckless conduct wild way of many of party sir henry furness belonged to section of king adherent harry who have naturally imbibed father opinion held good deal aloof from wild young spirit of king party skirmish took place daily between cavalry outpost of two army sir henry be asked by prince to send of troop across river to watch enemy chose that commanded by harry rather for sake of getting lad away from temptation dissipation of oxford than to give opportunity of distinguishing troop commanded by sir ralph willoughby be also on outpost duty lay at great distance from village in harry quartered men after crossing river roundhead cavalry be known to be three four mile away utmost vigilance be necessary harry gave order that troop must be distributed through village five men to house straw be to be brought in at night laid on floor of kitchen men be there to sleep with arm by side ready for instant service one of party be to stand sentry over five horse be to be picketed to paling in front of house at first alarm be at once to awake comrade who be to mount instantly form in column in street two picket be placed three hundred yard from village two others quarter of mile further in advance harry jacob took up residence in village inn arranged alternately to visit picket sentry two hour will not catch napping jacob be first command on detached duty have often remarked upon reckless way of leader have opportunity now of carrying own idea into effect at three o'clock jacob visited outpost be still nothing have occurred to give rise to suspicion of vicinity of enemy hour later one of advanced picket galloped in heard said noise a of large body of horse away to right seemed a if be proceeding toward chalcombe village where sir ralph willoughby troop be quartered two minute later thanks to harry arrangement troop be mounted in readiness for action first faint dawn of day have begun suddenly stillness be broken by sound of pistol shot shout from direction of chalcombe lay mile away be likely harry said that sir ralph have be caught napping be brave be reckless discipline of troop be of slackest let ride to rescue troop filed out from village turned down side road leading to chalcombe harry set spur to horse led column at gallop sound of shot continued without intermission presently bright light shot up methinks harry said to jacob roundhead have caught men asleep be attack upon house rather than cavalry fight be scarcely five minute from time started when approached village by light of house have be set on fire harry saw that conjecture be well founded roundhead be dismounted be attacking house halting just outside village harry formed men with front across whole road directed line to advance twenty yard apart then placing at head gave

promiscuously not in order of value mercer did a requested good said be obtained from master fleming bought last year have scarce sold piece of such article since harry felt rather nervous at thought of being obliged to distinguish between velvet for although have received hint instruction from merchant knew that appearance of one kind of velvet differed slightly from of inferior quality to satisfaction however saw at end of roll piece of paper intact upon master fleming private mark be placed need not said look at velvet for see master private mark upon can of course tell value at once so saying from private mark read off value of roll of velvet per yard a tallied exactly with amount mercer have paid for further doubt remained upon mind of officer mark said to mercer be suppose

reaching camp of lord ormonde sent off to west to drill of newly raised levy there be now six year since have begun to take active part in war be between twenty one twenty two life of active exertion have strengthened muscle broadened frame given strength vigor to tall powerful figure foreseeing that siege of dublin be not likely to be successful harry accepted commission to west with pleasure felt already that with devotion to royalist cause must not wish that siege of dublin must be successful for saw that vast proportion of besieging army be animated by sense of loyalty by interest in constitutional question at stake simply with blind hatred of protestant population of dublin that capture of city must probably be followed by indiscriminate slaughter of inhabitant set out on journey furnished with letter from ormonde to several influential gentleman in galway road at first be fairly good accustomed to comfortable inn in england harry found resting place along road execrable be amused of evening by eagerness with people came round asked for news from dublin in part of england little sheet then did service a newspaper carried news of event be taking place be true that none of country population must read write alehouse served a center of news village clerk perhaps squire bailiff must read a must probably landlord thus news spread quickly round country in ireland news traveled only from mouth to mouth often becoming strangely distorted on way harry be greatly struck by bareness of field poverty of country a journeyed further west country became still wilder more lonely be seldom now that met one who must speak english a road be often little more than track have great difficulty in keeping way regretted that have not hired servant knowing country before leaving army generally however be able to obtain guide from village to village loneliness of way wretchedness of people absence of brightness comfort so characteristic of english life made journey oppressive one harry be glad when five day after leaving dublin approached end of ride upon day have taken no guide being told that road be clear unmistakable a far a galway have not traveled many hour when heavy mist set in accompanied by keen driving rain in face with head bent down harry rode along paying le attention than usual to way mist grew thicker thicker horse no longer proceeded at brisk pace presently came to stop harry dismounted discovered that have left road turning horse head taking rein over arm tried to retrace step for hour walked along conviction growing moment that be hopelessly lost ground be now soft miry be covered with tussock of coarse grass between soil be black oozy horse floundered on for distance with such increasing difficulty that upon reaching space of comparatively solid ground harry decided to take further cold rain chilled to bone after awhile determined to try make way forward on foot in hope of finding if not human habitation wall bush where must obtain shelter until weather cleared fastened rein to small shrub took off saddle laid on grass spread horse rug over animal to protect a far a possible then started on way have heard of irish bog extending for many mile deep enough to engulf men animal who might stray among felt that position be serious one blamed now for not having halted immediately perceived that have missed road only guide that have a to direction must take be wind on way have be in face determined now to keep at back not because be probably way to safety because must see more easily where be going thought by continuing steadily in one direction might at last gain firm ground view extended few yard round soon found that plan of proceeding in straight line be impracticable often quagmire of black ooze space covered with light grass be found still more treacherous barred way be compelled to make considerable detour to right left in order to pas sometimes width of sluggish water be met with for long time harry continued way leaping lightly from tuft to tuft where grass grew thickest sometimes wading knee deep in slush feeling carefully foot lest must get to depth whence must be unable to extricate now then shouted at top of voice in hope that might be heard by human being for hour struggled on be now exhausted with effort thickening darkness told that day be fading from time have left horse have met with bush of sufficient height to afford slightest shelter just a be thinking whether have not better stop where be sit down on firmest tuft must find wait for morning when perhaps rainstorm might cease enable to see where be heard at very great distance sudden bray of donkey turned at once in direction of sound with renewed hope giving loud shout a did so again again raised voice presently heard answering shout called again in reply heard shout in irish probably question to must give answer shouting occasionally made way toward voice bog seemed more difficult treacherous than ever at last reached spot where further advance seemed absolutely impossible be now nearly dark harry be about to sit down in despair when suddenly voice sounded close to answered again immediately barefooted

into wooden cup offered to harry put to lip at first seemed that be drinking mixture of liquid fire smoke first swallow nearly choked however persevered soon felt blood coursing more rapidly in vein finding impossibilty of conversing again sat down by fire waited course of event have observed that a entered young guide have in obedience probably to order of one of men darted away into mist minute passed slowly not word be spoken in cottage hour went by then tramp of foot be heard accompanied by boy eight ten men entered carried pike between men already in hut eager conversation took place harry felt far from easy aspect of men be wild in extreme hair be long unkempt fell in straggling mass over shoulder presently one who appeared to be leader approached harry who have now risen to foot

garrison of drogheda employed busily in strengthening town to utmost in readiness for siege cromwell must doubted not lay to in september cromwell moved against place be prepared to carry out campaign in very different spirit to with have warred in england for year ireland have be desolated by horde of half savage men who have for time be burning plundering murdering on pretext of fighting for against king cromwell be determined to strike so terrible blow a must frighten ireland into quietude knew that mildness must be thrown away upon people defended course excited thrill of horror in england upon ground that be most merciful in end certainly nowhere else have cromwell shown cruel man in execution in cold blood have not amounted to dozen in common men on side be when taken prisoner always allowed to depart to home even officer be not treated with harshness may be assumed that blood be fired by tale of massacre bloodshed reached when landed time be stern policy of conciliating rebel murderer by weak concession be not even dreamed of still excuse plea of public policy can palliate cromwell conduct at drogheda wexford be student expounder of bible be in old testament rather than new precedent for massacre at drogheda must be sought for doubt have effect at time cromwell looked for left impression upon irish mind lapse of over two century have not obliterated wholesale massacre murder perpetrated by irishman on irishman have long since be forgotten terrible vengeance taken by cromwell saint upon hapless town of drogheda wexford will never be forgotten by irish among whom curse of cromwell be still deadliest malediction one man can hurl at cromwell defender who say that warred mildly mercifully in england according to english idea that fought irish only a fought other must be hard driven when set up such defense fact that murrogh o'brien at capture of cashel murdered garrison who have laid down arm three thousand of defenseless citizen including twenty priest who have fled to cathedral for refuge affords excuse for perpetration of equal atrocity by cromwell impartial historian can deny that massacre be foul hideous blot in history of great for most part kind merciful man upon arriving before drogheda on d of september cromwell at once began to throw up battery opened fire on th artillery be abundant be so well served that early same afternoon two practical breach be made one in east in wall of st mary churchyard other to south in wall of town sir arthur ashton have placed harry in command at st mary churchyard seeing that wall must soon give

commanded by sir arthur ashton opposed desperate resistance to enemy supported by gun on wall turned against mount made repeated attack be a often repulsed loss however of defender be great seeing that fresh troop be constantly brought against at last lost heart surrendered on promise of life promise be not kept a be immediately massacred up to time harry have successfully repulsed attack made upon other breach at length news of roundhead success at mount reached assailant defender with exulting roundhead poured over wall garrison headed by harry other officer strove hard to drive back be useless cromwell ireton be in van of troop accustomed to victory hewed way through rank of besieged many of lost heart throwing down arm cried for quarter with shout of quarter hew down amalakites strike spare not roundhead cut down now defenseless foe maddened at sight besieged made desperate effort at resistance for awhile fought so stoutly that roundhead must gain ground of presently however party of enemy who have forced way over wall at point took in rear then garrison fled in direction pursued by victorious enemy who slaughtered man overtook mike have kept close to harry through whole of struggle have picked up pike from fallen man have more than once when harry be nearly surrounded by foe dashed forward rid of one of most pressing seeing by general slaughter be going on that roundhead soldier must have received order from general to give quarter harry determined to sell life dearly rushed into church where score of english soldier be taking refuge door be closed

cutting with sword thrusting with pike did not desist while one remained alive be men who have name of god ever on lip when dreadful massacre began harry turned shuddering from window with white face set teeth nerved to fight to last already door have be beaten down assailant have streamed into church then rush of heavy foot be heard on stair assembled round top stood harry twelve men remaining knew now that there be hope of quarter fought with desperation of men who cared only to sell life dearly fast a roundhead poured up stair fell pierced by pike shot down by musket ball for hour effort continued then roundhead having lost over fifty men fell back three time during day attack be renewed time repulsed with same terrible slaughter between interval defender must hear never ceasing sound of musket pistol firing a house after house defended to last by desperate men be stormed while loud even above firing rose thrilling shriek of dying woman child in history of england from earliest time there be such black ghastly page a of sack of drogheda even supposing cromwell assertion that wished only to terrify irish rebel to be true shadow of excuse can be pleaded for massacre of woman child for of english royalist who formed five sixth of garrison through night occasional shriek pistol shot must be heard a wretched people who have hidden in closet cellar be discovered murdered further assault be made upon church tower be there renewal of next morning a hour after hour passed on harry concluded that deterred by great loss men have already sustained in endeavoring to capture post cromwell have determined to reduce by starvation already defender be from effect of exertion excitement half mad with thirst a day went on suffering became greater there be still thought of surrender next day two of leaped from top of tower be killed by fall then harry saw that be better to give in lad said be better to go down die by bullet shot than to suffer agony of thirst with only death a issue must die better to die in sens a men than mad like wild beast with thirst mike lad be sorry to have brought to pas mike put parched lip to master hand be not fault master life be differ to men agreed to harry proposal there be discussion whether must go down die fighting not harry urged upon that be better not to do so be already weak with hunger thirst must be more dignified to meet

william long be lieutenant sallied out from western side of camp at daybreak like not expedition colonel furness donald leslie said refusal to send cavalry with be strange methinks see finger of

be castle there be there not harry asked might occupy assuredly there be leslie replied be hold of alan campbell cousin of man pinked be that add to suspicion will see unless be greatly mistaken that will not admit such indeed proved to be case upon arrival at kirkglen leslie went in harry name to demand admittance to castle for royal troop campbell replied that have received no order to effect that must greatly incommode to quarter so large number of men there said however that must willingly entertain colonel furness officer leslie brought back message strongly urging harry on account to enter castle put in hand of campbell harry said that even have no cause to doubt welcome might receive at castle must in case separate from men when might be at moment attacked be rough piece of country between cromwell post leslie said must have difficulty in finding way there be more than one broad morass to be crossed without guide must scarce attempt be for reason that be so unlikely to send out foraging party in direction be reflection caused to wonder why must be ordered mike harry said have heard what captain leslie say do keep watch to night near castle gate let know whether leave in direction go will place man behind to watch postern if treachery be meditated campbell will send news of coming to cromwell chapter xxi path across morass mike when night fell moved away

ride past must have muffled horse foot said to be up to good wish there have only be one of mike slipped off shoe started in pursuit keeping just far enough behind horseman to enable to observe outline of figure for mile proceeded quietly then stopped dismounted removed cloth from horse foot remounting rode forward at gallop mike old exercise a runner now rendered good service must already tell by direction horseman be taking that be bearing to east of edinburgh resolved to follow a far a possible in order to see exactly whither went road rather track lay across moorland country ground be often deep quaggy horseman several time checked speed went at slow walk one advancing on foot along track to guide way halt allowed breathing time for mike who found hard work to keep near when going at full speed at last after riding for hour horseman halted at solitary house on moorland here several horse held by trooper be standing mike crept round to back of house looked in at window saw two english officer sitting by fire while light burned on table mike at once recognized in one of dreaded general cromwell whom have seen at drogheda what fool be muttered to to have come without pistol must have shot a sits so wiped out drogheda at moment door opened trooper in scotch uniform entered have brought letter said from alan campbell general took letter opened campbell promise said

doublet for cromwell letter placing in breast went few pace from path where found that sunk to knee water being inch deep over bog then returned lifted body of trooper carried a far into bog a dared venture then dropped placed foot on iron breastpiece pressed until body sank in soft ooze water completely covered then went back to horse taking rein followed track until completely clear of moorland country where mounting rode back to kirkglen presented to harry latter have hour before gone to bed having posted strong guard around village struck light listened to mike relation of what have done ended by production of document with cromwell signature debt to earl of argyll harry said grimly however although prof treachery of kinsman doe not convict argyll although evidence be strong enough to hang other man now leslie what do advise will send seize man left at hut be doubtful question leslie answered after pause when campbell find that messenger doe not return before morning will like enough send others off to learn reason why if find gone campbell may suspect that plan have failed may send warning to cromwell at rate harry continued need not decide before morning at daybreak leslie plant party of men on road stop horseman riding out let sergeant in charge say only that have order that none be to pas eastward must be natural precaution to take when news come back to castle

surprise instead of surprising hour later two horseman rode out from castle upon reaching guard leslie have placed be turned back returned to castle short time afterward trooper rode down into village with note from alan campbell demanding haughtily by what warrant colonel furness ventured to interfere with free passage of retainer harry replied that have a military precaution stationed guard on various road leading toward enemy quarter that be ordered to turn back whomsoever might be who might seek to pas alan campbell returned furious answer that must sally out with garrison ride where listed harry replied by marching fifty men up to road leading to castle by sending message to alan campbell although must regret to be obliged to treat a enemy yet assuredly if strove by force to

harry with main body opened fire upon there be to commence upon flank of column returning to camp harry sent forty men with shovel obtained in village to dig trench twelve foot wide a deep a must get for water across track at near side of morass at nightfall leaving twenty five men under william long in front of castle with order to let none issue forth to shoot down who might make attempt harry marched out with rest of command crossing ditch have be dug led fifty forward posted a have planned with leslie with twenty five took up own station behind breastwork formed by earth thrown out from trench remaining fifty bade advance a far a safely must into swamp on side two hour later dull sound be heard occasional clink of arm muffled tread of many foot on soft ground roundhead infantry two hundred strong led way followed by horse guide walking with officer at head of column when approached within twenty yard of ditch harry gave word flash of fire streamed from top of earthwork at same moment on side opened fire into flank of column while fifty men beyond poured fire into cavalry in rear of column for moment be confusion roundhead have anticipated attack be taken wholly by surprise

there who let horse on hire to traveling north if storm come on leslie asked way be likely to blow will royalist be like to make bay name ah be more than can tell sailor replied methinks 'twill blow

promise man at once went off to group of sailor at first shook head looked toward sky aspect be threatening wind be getting up fast mass of scud flew rapidly across leslie went up to group come lad said five pound if put across offer be too tempting to be rejected men hurried down began to prepare large sailing boat leslie lieutenant long have hasty consultation agreed that seeing difficulty there must be in obtaining horse be useless to take more than ten men in accordingly a soon a boat be in readiness two officer mike seven soldier took place in sail be closely reefed at once put out into firth minute wind rose until by time be half across be blowing gale boat be stout one wave broke freely over four of soldier be kept at work baling to throw out water took over bow once twice thought that must capsize so furious be gust boatman be quick skillful sheet be let go sail lowered until force of squall abated at last after passage seemed rapid even to on board anxious a be entered little port hurrying to inn found that six horse be obtainable hired at once host said that must send to farm not far distant hire four more that hour so must elapse ere came leslie william long have already decided that prisoner must most probably be taken to kilbeg castle a being more secluded than others now agreed that with mike three soldier must start at once to intercept if possible between sea castle when other horse arrived two of soldier be to ride with speed to anstruther two to st andrew be there to keep sharp watch to see if royalist arrived there landed aught in way of men good point to be bound lay fully forty mile away determined to ride a far a horse must carry then if able to obtain more to walk forward night be already setting in driving rain flew before gale will never be able to keep road leslie said landlord have one here who must serve a guide must be quick footed sure business be urgent be ready to pay well guide be speedily found lad on shaggy pony who have day before come down from north with cattle while horse be being prepared party have taken hasty supper leslie have seen that of soldier have tankard of hot spiced wine so quickly have arrangement be made that in hour after arrival at port party started from inn ride be indeed rough one country be heavy wild rain drenched to skin in spite of thick cloak wind blew at time with such violence that horse be fain to stop stand huddled together facing to keep foot hour after hour rode never getting beyond walk so rough be road often obliged to pause altogether from force of gale twice stopped at inn at quiet village knocked up sleeping host obtained hot wine for hot gruel for horse pace grew slower a animal became thoroughly knocked up at last must not be urged beyond walk at next village stopped a found that there be possibility of obtaining fresh horse determined to push forward on foot be now four o'clock in morning have ridden over forty mile guide be obtained set forward although have hurried to utmost be ten o'clock in morning before came down upon valley with narrow stream guide told fell into sea near leuchars be said now within two mile of castle track from to sea ran down valley wind be still blowing gale cloud have broken at time sun streamed out brightly thank heaven be here at last donald leslie said for harder night have never spent think must be in time think so william long said supposing royalist made bay safely must have be there by midnight sea must have be so high that doubt if must have launched boat till morning be light by five might wait for gale to abate little after landing have eight mile to come of course might have passed here hour ago incline to think that must not land till later a with wind blowing off shore must be easy matter to row boat in teeth guide saying that there be cottage mile further up valley be sent there with instruction to ask whether one have be seen to pas that morning after being hour absent returned saying that there be only old woman at hut that have told be sure one have passed there since daybreak now followed stream down valley until came to small wood here lay down to rest one being placed upon lookout two hour later sentry awoke with news that party of men be coming up valley be at once upon alert thank heaven leslie said have struck right place there seem to be ten twelve of of whom two doubt be prisoner will have difficulty in overcoming by sudden surprise capture kill man if possible will have hot work in getting back to edinburgh when party came nearer must be seen that consisted of eight armed men in center of whom two royalist officer be walking arm be bound to side leslie arranged that with mike one of soldier must at once spring to aid a likely enough directly attack began captor might endeavor to slay prisoner to prevent from being rescued mike be instructed to strike blow to devote at once to cutting cord placing weapon in hand surprise be complete sailor forming majority of party with two trusty retainer of earl who have special charge of affair be proceeding carelessly along having thought of interruption so far plan have succeeded perfectly moment two officer have reached quay be addressed by men sent on shore with royalist boat unsuspicious of danger took place in therefore missed opportunity must have have if have entered of other boat of learning true character of royalist have be attacked instant gained deck of vessel harry who be first have be knocked down before have time to put hand to sword jacob have fought valiantly for short time too have be knocked senseless by blow with capstan bar have then be roughly tumbled below where further attention have be paid to royalist have be blown many mile out to sea did not make anchorage until ten o'clock in morning then hatch be removed prisoner brought on deck inlet be small one contained only little fishing village prisoner saw royalist sail off again directly have be placed in boat have from first moment when regained consciousness entertained doubt into whose hand have fallen felt position to be desperate plan indeed have be skillfully laid have not be for harry reading order aloud in mike presence there must have be clew to disappearance during night young men be too overpowered with violence of storm closeness of atmosphere in hold in have be thrown to converse a motion moderated in morning have talked over chance pronounced to be small indeed harry indeed remembered that mike have be present when asked jacob to accompany on board ship thought that uneasiness must be felt until late night a might well be thought that duty have detained that have supped on board storm might further account for non appearance till morning then imagined that inquiry must be made that must be found that royalist have sailed captor must then have start of twenty four hour in such troubled time be scarce likely that anything must be done indeed did see how must be followed a destination of ship must be entirely unknown very fact that have not be thrown overboard when fairly out at sea be in proof that captor entertained fear of pursuit have done so must have dispatched at once captive felt sure that be intended to land in order that argyll might have pleasure of taunting before putting to death against jacob indeed must have personal feeling be by accident only that be sharer in harry fate a witness of what have taken place life must assuredly be taken a well a of companion a walked along gathered from talk of guard distance have to go place of destination have never heard of kilbeg castle a have enemy save argyll knew that must belong to one of clan spoke little on way harry be wondering how news of disappearance must be received in camp thinking of dismay must occasion in mind of mike william long when suddenly heard shout on instant fierce fight be raging around although taken completely by surprise sailor fought steadily two be cut down before must draw sword others outmatched be driven backward leader of party shouted again again kill prisoner of men be too hotly engaged with adversary who pressed to do more than defend own life in minute fray be rendered still more unequal by harry jacob joining in in le than three minute from commencement seven of guard lay dead dying upon ground other active young fellow have taken to flight early in fight be already beyond reach contest over there be delighted greeting between rescued prisoner friend come leslie said have not moment to lose that fellow who have escaped will take news to kilbeg will be having garrison at heel have three mile to run will beat to horse in few minute after get there must strike across hill have best make great circuit by stirling if avoid road town may not pick up track guide fortunately knew country well leaving path by have traveled party started on return day tramped across moorland avoiding village scattered farmhouse have knew three quarter of hour start a pursuer must be alike ignorant whence came whither be going chance of hitting right route be small making circuit round kinross alloa where campbell might have ridden in pursuit sleeping in wood arrived next day at stirling here be great excitement for cromwell army marching south of edinburgh have approached town remained however few hour only collecting what prevision must then falling back again to former camp at following day harry party marched to edinburgh night harry reported to sir david leslie what have befallen next morning accompanied general to holyrood laid complaint before king majesty be most indignant at attempt have be made upon follower said to general leslie doubt not sir david that thought mine go toward same person have evidence that have absolute hand in although fact that ship be commanded by campbell that hold of kilbeg belongs to one of kinsman point to complicity in affair still be proof already earl be friend of mine when day come will have bitter reckoning with in present state of fortune methinks 'twere best in a in other matter to hold tongue for time can not afford to make open enemy now general leslie agreed with king cromwell army be in sore strait must hoped be shortly driven to surrender to fight under disadvantageous circumstance open defection of argyll at present moment followed a must be by of

into hand general leslie however stood firm preacher scattered in camp exhorted soldier to go down smite enemy so great enthusiasm did excite by promise of victory that in afternoon soldier without order from general moved down hill toward enemy more regular body of troop stood firm leslie seeing that preacher have got mastery that order be no longer obeyed ordered also to move forward in hope that enthusiasm have be excited must yet suffice to win victory cromwell saw fatal mistake have be committed in night moved round troop to left at daybreak fell upon scottish right night have be wet scottish army be unprovided with tent many of matchlock have be rendered useless at daybreak on morning of d of september english led by general lambert fell upon scotch for time stood ground firmly

then must march army on to hill again if wait there english must attack with grievous disadvantage such a can not get on board ship must surrender charles must really be king then must disregard wrath of men of conventicle cromwell will attack to morrow will defeat trained troop be more than match for scotchman who think more of preacher than of officer whose discipline be of slackest agree with entirely jacob said in present mood of army believe that half of must march away if general dismissed preacher next day when fight began harry moved forward regiment to support of scottish right
